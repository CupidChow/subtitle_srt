[Love you seven times]

3
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,900
[Episode 29]

4
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,190
It's the sacred relic of the Moluo Divine Clan, the Tianqiong Jade.

5
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,790
Since you know the Tianqiong Jade,

6
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,170
I'll speak of it no further.

7
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,030
There is

8
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,770
a trace of my primordial spirit in it.

9
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,000
From now on,

10
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,270
you shall carry it with you.

11
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,980
It's too valuable.

12
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,600
I can't take it.

13
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,870
Take it.

14
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,620
It can make you strong and nourish your primordial spirit.

15
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,750
It's more useful

16
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,060
in your hands than in mine.

17
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,060
I'm such a fool.

18
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,340
I tried to change my fate

19
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,970
but just made a spectacle of myself.

20
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,070
Xiu Ming.

21
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,210
No matter what happens,

22
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,360
you'll always be my most important family.

23
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,660
Cang Hai.

24
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,500
Since the moment we met,

25
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,660
you've become my entire world.

26
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,080
I thought

27
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,350
I could stay by your side

28
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,580
as I used to.

29
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,100
However,

30
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,910
nothing has worked out as I expected.

31
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,660
If…

32
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,980
I mean if…

33
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,579
If I can become stronger,

34
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,740
will you choose me?

35
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,460
Xiu Ming.

36
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,530
Your world shouldn't just revolve around me.

37
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,710
All this time,

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,079
I've only seen you as my brother.

39
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,050
It's never changed.

40
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:34,900
Do I

41
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,329
stand no chance at all?

42
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,700
I see.

43
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,260
Okay.

44
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,890
Leave me here.

45
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,340
Brother.

46
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,280
Xiaotang and I…

47
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,870
Don't worry.

48
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,890
Leave it to me.

49
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,700
Thank you, Brother.

50
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,220
Take care.

51
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,220
I just remembered something.

52
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,660
What's it?

53
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,020
I heard

54
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,300
that the Empress tended to Prince Xiu Ming's injuries herself.

55
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,140
It turns out

56
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,770
that the Empress cares for him much more

57
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,560
than I thought.

58
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,350
Forget it.

59
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,980
Maybe I worry too much.

60
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,460
I believe that the Empress's feelings for you

61
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,420
are genuine.

62
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,020
Thank you for your concern, Brother.

63
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,020
I'll leave you here.

64
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,780
Your Highness.

65
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,950
Lord Protector.

66
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,210
What brought you here?

67
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,100
I've heard

68
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,990
that you're going back today,

69
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,980
so I came to see you off.

70
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,350
Thank you, Lord Protector.

71
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,090
I'm leaving now.

72
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,610
I know the way out.

73
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,640
First Prince.

74
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,320
Please wait.

75
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,150
Lord Protector, why don't you just tell me

76
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:49,460
what you came to me for?

77
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,659
Do you remember the pills

78
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,770
you gave me the other day?

79
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,440
Of course.

80
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,460
Why?

81
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,770
Is there something wrong

82
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,130
with those pills?

83
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,260
No.

84
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,660
After I went back,

85
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,860
I gave them to my kids.

86
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,500
They've gotten much better as you said.

87
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,740
I wonder

88
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,140
if you have any extra pills?

89
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,900
Yes.

90
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,890
But

91
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,390
it was hard for me to obtain them.

92
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,490
No worries, First Prince.

93
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,650
Just name your price.

94
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,930
I will give you

95
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,570
anything I have.

96
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,360
Why are you so serious?

97
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,020
Get up.

98
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,260
First Prince.

99
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,780
Did you say

100
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,100
you'll give me anything you have

101
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,300
in exchange for the pills?

102
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,320
No matter what you want,

103
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,060
I'll try my best to get it for you.

104
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,150
What do you mean?

105
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,140
I'll never betray the Moluo Divine Clan!

106
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,460
I'm just worried about Chu Kong

107
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,590
and want to know

108
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,630
what happens in the Moluo Divine Clan every day.

109
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,630
Lord Protector.

110
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,940
If you don't want

111
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,150
to be my source,

112
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,690
I

113
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,090
won't force you.

114
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,460
If you change your mind one day,

115
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,130
use this

116
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,840
to contact me.

117
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,150
Put it on.

118
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,640
Wait.

119
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,250
Is that the Tianqiong Jade?

120
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,220
I gave it to Xiu Ming…

121
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,460
I know.

122
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,160
It's the sacred relic of the Moluo Divine Clan

123
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,190
and can repair primordial spirits.

124
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,100
But

125
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,100
it's not effective.

126
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,970
Even if you wear it for ten thousand years,

127
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,940
your primordial spirit won't be much enhanced.

128
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,549
Why don't you let me help you?

129
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,669
You can recover in a blink of an eye.

130
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,049
No.

131
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,460
No need.

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,159
I

133
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,679
don't need your sympathy.

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,180
You're too proud to ask me for help

135
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,450
but are fine with consuming her primordial spirit?

136
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,390
Enough.

137
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,640
Don't mess with Xiu Ming.

138
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,180
It's just a trace of my primordial spirit.

139
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,600
No big deal.

140
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,760
I

141
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,220
am not that fragile.

142
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,830
And you.

143
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,340
Is your pride more important

144
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,000
than your life?

145
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,440
Put it on.

146
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,830
Don't ever take it off.

147
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,060
Do you hear me?

148
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,660
Why did you laugh?

149
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,460
I'm not done with you.

150
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,900
I know you're the Golden Qilin

151
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,620
and your blood has healing properties.

152
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,690
But those who don't know that

153
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,950
will think of you as a quack

154
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,580
who's so eager

155
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,910
to land more clients.

156
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,460
I…

157
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,520
I know I was wrong.

158
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
How about this?

159
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,820
In the future,

160
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,960
I won't treat anyone

161
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,390
without your permission.

162
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,310
Don't be angry.

163
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,930
Don't be angry!

164
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,000
I know I was wrong!

165
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,910
Enough.

166
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,930
You're so noisy.

167
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,270
Are you still angry?

168
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,210
Are you still angry? Say something.

169
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,830
Are you angry?

170
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,320
Are you angry?

171
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,690
Forgive me now or I'll go treat someone again.

172
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,430
Just kidding.

173
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,420
Don't be angry.

174
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,770
Don't be angry.

175
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,400
All these years,

176
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,540
Cang Hai has never smiled at me like that.

177
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,420
Maybe

178
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,920
I should have moved on a long time ago.

179
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,140
Perhaps,

180
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,120
he's the one Cang Hai belongs with.

181
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,350
Princess,

182
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,980
I brought you your favorite desserts.

183
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,430
Please enjoy.

184
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,590
Is something bothering you?

185
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,550
No.

186
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,910
Has someone made you sad?

187
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,010
Your children?

188
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,500
Tell me.

189
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,130
Princess.

190
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,130
Please enjoy.

191
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,220
I'm leaving.

192
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,610
Brother, chase me.

193
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,910
Slow down.

194
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,980
Wait for me.

195
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,180
Luo.

196
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,220
Hurry up.

197
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,250
Wait.

198
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,020
Come and get me.

199
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,170
Slow down.

200
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,580
So many fishes!

201
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,030
Father.

202
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,790
Father.

203
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,250
Be careful.

204
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,550
Luo!

205
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,460
Luo.

206
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,370
Luo, are you alright?

207
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,080
Are you okay?

208
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,030
I'm fine.

209
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,890
My hand hurts.

210
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,090
Let me see.

211
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,340
Let me blow on it for you.

212
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,470
The pain will go away.

213
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,010
Don't run so fast.

214
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,870
You're making me and Father worry.

215
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,690
You can't outrun me.

216
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,680
If you can,

217
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,700
come and chase me.

218
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,130
Slow down.

219
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,090
Wait for me.

220
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,170
You're so slow.

221
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,730
Chase me.

222
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,120
Slow down.

223
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:35,910
Luo.

224
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,370
You're so slow.

225
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:37,820
Slow down.

226
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,270
Luo!

227
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,700
Luo.

228
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,910
Luo!

229
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,530
Lian.

230
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,780
Lian.

231
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:01,950
Lian.

232
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:02,650
Wake up!

233
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,860
Luo.

234
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,210
Don't scare me.

235
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,360
Lian.

236
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,200
Lian, wake up.

237
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,840
I wonder

238
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,160
if you have any extra pills.

239
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,480
Yes.

240
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,540
But

241
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,850
it was hard for me to obtain them.

242
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,760
If you change your mind,

243
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,380
use this

244
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,990
to contact me.

245
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,090
My Lord.

246
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,060
Congratulations

247
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,220
on getting the clan leader's recognition

248
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,250
and taking charge of Divine Prophecies.

249
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,600
You'll definitely

250
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,340
be the clan leader in the future.

251
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,210
It's still too early

252
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,870
to say that.

253
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,580
I know,

254
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,580
Father let me take charge of Divine Prophecies

255
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,620
because he's very angry now.

256
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,510
I can't let my guard down

257
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,240
until the last moment.

258
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,220
Yes.

259
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,550
But

260
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,240
the Second Prince insists on concealing his identity

261
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,940
to marry Empress Cang Hai.

262
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,300
He brought disgrace on the Qilin Divine Clan.

263
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,300
The clan leader

264
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,000
will in no way easily forgive him.

265
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,540
After this,

266
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,860
the clan leader will realize

267
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,850
that only you

268
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,870
are the hope of the Qilin Divine Clan.

269
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,220
Don't bother to find an informant.

270
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,270
The most informed person

271
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,300
is here.

272
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,960
I'll take my leave.

273
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,870
Brother.

274
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,350
Are we

275
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,220
dying?

276
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,340
Don't be afraid.

277
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,870
The physician said

278
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,870
that as long as we behave,

279
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,500
we can live for a few more years.

280
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,880
No matter what,

281
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,900
I'll always be with you.

282
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:06,859
Here.

283
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,140
First Prince.

284
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,800
Give me the pills.

285
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,200
What?

286
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,300
Have you agreed

287
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,660
to be at my service?

288
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,860
You said

289
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,690
I just need

290
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,470
to keep you abreast of the Second Prince's movements.

291
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,090
Don't you know

292
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,730
the situation

293
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,960
is different now?

294
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,900
If you agree to my condition now,

295
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,220
you can have

296
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,280
this bottle of pills.

297
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,780
However,

298
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,780
if you hesitate again,

299
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,120
I don't know

300
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,860
what my price will be

301
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,000
next time

302
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,700
you come to me.

303
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,710
I can work for you.

304
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,510
But

305
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,350
I won't betray the Moluo Divine Clan

306
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,710
or the Empress.

307
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,190
I just want to know

308
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,620
something insignificant about the past.

309
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,590
Lord Protector,

310
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,140
why do you make it so serious?

311
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,220
Fine.

312
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,270
Deal.

313
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,460
That's more like it.

314
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,980
But how will I know

315
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,720
if what you say is true or not?

316
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,230
Why don't you make a vow?

317
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,290
If you lie to me,

318
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,860
the primordial spirits

319
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,980
of your children

320
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,090
will perish.

321
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,460
Father.

322
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,180
Look.

323
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,170
If I lie to you,

324
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,460
the primordial spirits

325
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,590
of my children

326
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,100
will perish.

327
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,800
I don't mean to be hard on you.

328
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,430
Actually,

329
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,290
I just want to know more

330
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,840
about the mysterious power

331
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,710
that flashed across the yard that day.

332
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,850
Who was it from?

333
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,410
I've told you.

334
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,220
It was just…

335
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,540
Think before you answer.

336
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,180
After all,

337
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,880
you just made a vow.

338
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,190
If you lie to me,

339
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,840
your twins

340
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,110
will have to

341
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,370
pay the price.

342
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,510
The Moluo royal family has had twins for generations.

343
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,320
Empress Cang Hai

344
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,110
can't be the only child.

345
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,820
If she had a twin brother,

346
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,700
you wouldn't have needed to hide him.

347
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,380
So there is only one answer.

348
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,180
If I'm right,

349
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,980
that powerful mysterious power

350
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,290
came from the other princess

351
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,510
whose existence was erased.

352
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,770
If Empress Cang Hai

353
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,040
didn't have a twin sister,

354
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,380
you would've contradicted me, wouldn't you?

355
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,850
So I'm right.

356
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,550
Lord Protector.

357
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,590
You helped me a lot.

358
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,700
Thank you.

359
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,460
Who are you?

360
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,440
Why do we look exactly the same?

361
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,260
Why don't you talk?

362
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,540
Who are you?

363
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,150
Xiaotang.

364
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,580
Xiaotang.

365
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,300
What did you dream about?

366
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,180
You were frowning.

367
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,010
I dreamed

368
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,120
of a girl who looked just like me.

369
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,550
Perhaps

370
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,090
I just want a sister too badly.

371
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,730
Don't think about that.

372
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,590
Think about

373
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,710
our wedding.

374
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,370
I've thought it through.

375
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,370
On that day,

376
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,030
we'll go back to the cabin.

377
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,690
It's quiet and cozy.

378
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,620
There will be just you and me.

379
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,780
The wedding of Moluo Empress

380
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,890
should catch the eyes of all the six realms

381
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,880
and be celebrated worldwide.

382
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,070
Sorry

383
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,090
that you can't have a grand wedding.

384
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,980
Don't be sorry.

385
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,660
I grew up in the palace

386
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,550
where everything is luxurious

387
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,450
and exquisite.

388
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,830
But I was the happiest

389
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,420
when we were in the cabin.

390
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,780
At that time,

391
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,830
I wasn't Moluo Empress.

392
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,700
You weren't the Second Prince of the Qilin Divine Clan.

393
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,610
We were so free

394
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,780
and happy.

395
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,070
Besides,

396
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,140
I want to marry you there

397
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,360
because I want to get married

398
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,420
as Xiaotang

399
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,350
to the boy I fell in love with at first sight.

400
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,220
My brother left a few days ago.

401
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,210
I've been writing to him,

402
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,670
but he's never replied.

403
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,380
I'm a little worried.

404
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,370
Are you worried

405
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,700
that your parents

406
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,860
won't allow you to hide your identity

407
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,740
to marry me?

408
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,700
I know

409
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,880
you want to make things easy

410
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,720
by hiding your identity.

411
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,450
But

412
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,480
sometimes things don't work out the way you want.

413
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,860
If you want to marry me,

414
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,330
you'll inevitably put your brother

415
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,840
in a dilemma.

416
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,880
And you and he

417
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,900
will drift apart.

418
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,100
Will you choose

419
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:25,970
to leave me?

420
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,620
Even if the six realms were against our marriage,

421
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,700
I wouldn't change my mind.

422
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,780
Jin Cheng.

423
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,610
I'll leave Ming Yue in your care.

424
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,290
You must not let anyone

425
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,600
find out that she exists.

426
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,020
Monarch, rest assured.

427
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,050
Unless I die,

428
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,920
the existence

429
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,960
of Princess Ming Yue will forever be a secret.

430
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,660
Did something happen?

431
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,540
Princess,

432
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,540
Jin Lian and Jin Luo

433
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,900
can finally be saved.

434
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,210
Maybe before long,

435
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,230
they'll be able to

436
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,700
do whatever they want

437
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,080
like normal kids.

438
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,570
They won't have to be careful with

439
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,400
every step they take anymore.

440
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,860
You treat them

441
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,030
so well.

442
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,150
Your father

443
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,320
treated you very well too.

444
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,800
My family.

445
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,880
What kind of people are they?

446
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,620
By the way,

447
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,590
I had a dream.

448
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,300
I dreamed

449
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,560
of a girl who looked exactly like me.

450
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,970
Was she my sister?

451
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,010
I have a feeling

452
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,040
that I'll soon

453
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,970
be able to talk to her.

454
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,170
No.

455
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,140
No.

456
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,510
I won't disturb her.

457
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,420
I just want to see her in my dream.

458
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,940
Please.

459
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,960
Please don't keep me from her.

460
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,490
I beg you.

461
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,800
Sorry, Princess.

462
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,570
To keep your evil aura under control,

463
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,290
you must concentrate

464
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,490
and not be disturbed by the outside world.

465
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,710
I have to cut off

466
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,430
your connection with the Empress's dream.

467
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,050
She's the only family I have in this world.

468
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,390
Do you have to do this?

469
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,140
Yes.

470
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,130
Your existence must be kept a secret.

471
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,080
Even from

472
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,220
the Empress.

473
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,500
The positions of the stars changed.

474
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,840
I'm afraid a Divine Prophecy is about to be given.

475
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,350
The Divine Prophecy is only given once in tens of thousands of years.

476
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,300
When it's given,

477
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,620
it means

478
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,060
something that concerns the safety of the six realms

479
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,090
is about to happen.

480
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,750
Don't worry.

481
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,130
Your future husband is the Golden Qilin.

482
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,790
Even if the sky falls,

483
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,840
I'll hold it up for you.

484
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,510
Okay.

485
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,020
I'll remember that.

486
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,230
In the future,

487
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,580
I'll rely on you.

488
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,140
Anyway,

489
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,260
no matter what happens,

490
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,170
I'll always be with you.

491
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:25,030
[Moluo Princess will turn demonic and ruin the world.]

492
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,630
The Moluo royal family has had twins for generations.

493
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,890
Empress Cang Hai

494
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,470
can't be the only child.

495
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,080
If she had a twin brother,

496
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,920
you wouldn't have needed to hide him.

497
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,220
So there is only one answer.

498
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,070
If I'm right,

499
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,520
that powerful mysterious power

500
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,940
came from the other princess

501
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,240
whose existence was erased.

502
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,610
Is the princess of the Moluo Divine Clan

503
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,530
who's been kept hidden

504
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,630
the devil in the Divine Prophecy

505
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,070
who will destroy the world?

506
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,270
No one knows about that princess.

507
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,280
The six realms only know

508
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,060
Empress Cang Hai.

509
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,580
If she were the one who turned demonic and destroyed the world,

510
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,130
Chu Kong would fall off his pedestal.

511
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,890
Even the whole Moluo Divine Clan

512
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,700
would be targeted.

513
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,730
Meanwhile,

514
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,920
I could take this opportunity

515
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,990
to make the Qilin Divine Clan

516
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,810
the head of the six realms.

517
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,780
[Moluo Princess will turn demonic and ruin the world.]

518
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:28,239
[Moluo Princess will turn demonic and ruin the world.]

519
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:40,170
[Moluo Princess will turn demonic and ruin the world.]

520
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,929
[Moluo Princess will turn demonic and ruin the world.]

521
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,560
[Moluo Empress will turn demonic and ruin the world.]

522
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,060
[Moluo Empress will turn demonic and ruin the world.]

523
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,090
[Moluo Empress will turn demonic and ruin the world.]

524
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,480
First Prince. First Prince.

525
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,260
Are you alright?

526
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,350
I'm fine.

527
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,220
Go report to Father

528
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,960
that Moluo Empress

529
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,080
will soon turn demonic and ruin the world.

530
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,730
Yes.

531
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,780
I've been subservient for so many years

532
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,550
in order to

533
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,360
rule the six realms one day.

534
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,070
Even if the cost is too great,

535
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,780
I won't stop.

536
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,120
The Moluo Divine Clan.

537
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,000
Chu Kong.

538
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
No one can stop me

539
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,700
from ascending to supreme domination.

540
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,140
What surprise did you prepare this time?

541
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,770
Here we are.

542
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,650
Open your eyes.

543
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,670
You've been acting mysteriously these days

544
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,750
to prepare my wedding dress?

545
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,960
You're

546
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,530
always busy with serious matters.

547
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,900
These things

548
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,940
can only be handled by me, your future husband.

549
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,710
Do you like it?

550
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,370
Yes.

551
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,390
I like it very much.

552
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:04,950
Since you like it…

553
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,720
Empress. Empress.

554
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,660
Bad news!

555
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,840
A Divine Prophecy was given.

556
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,790
It says

557
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,020
that Moluo Empress

558
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,790
will turn demonic and ruin the world.

559
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,660
Don't panic.

560
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,110
The Divine Prophecy is just a warning.

561
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,030
If I refuse to turn demonic,

562
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,560
no one can force me.

563
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,500
Impossible.

564
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,870
You won't become a devil.

565
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,070
I also think

566
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,820
it's complete nonsense.

567
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,090
Even if there's really going to be a deveil,

568
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,540
she won't be the Empress.

569
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,980
Is the person

570
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,170
mentioned in the Divine Prophecy

571
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,640
Princess Ming Yue?

572
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,100
Except for Haoxuan,

573
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,750
no one else knows she exists.

574
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,650
Since ancient times, the Qilin Gods have been in charge

575
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,210
of Divine Prophecies.

576
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,240
Second Prince.

577
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,580
The Qilin Gods

578
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,160
are in charge of Divine Prophecies.

579
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,110
This matter…

580
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,050
All right.

581
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,480
Don't worry.

582
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,150
I got you.

583
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,080
I'll find out

584
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,040
what happened.

585
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,700
Stay here

586
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,080
and wait for me to come back.

587
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,660
Brother.

588
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,240
You…

589
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,510
What are you going to do?

590
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,800
Chu Kong.

591
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,400
I knew

592
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,110
you'd come back

593
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,440
to ask about the Divine Prophecy.

594
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,750
Now that you're back,

595
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,690
stay.
