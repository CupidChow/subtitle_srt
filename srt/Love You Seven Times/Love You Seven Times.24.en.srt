00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,020
Who are you?

7
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,700
Why did you lock Zihui up here?

8
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,620
It's none of your business.

9
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,710
He is our friend.

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,310
My motive from the beginning

29
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,270
is to take your Stone Heart.

30
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,090
It's you.

31
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,020

I remember who I am

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,050
and who you are.

36
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,070
You assumed Yingshi's appearance and approached me back then.

37
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,150
Everything you did

38
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,940
was just for taking my heart.

39
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,750
It's not like that.

40
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,110
I have my reasons.

41
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,700
I was forced to do all this.

42
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,290
You have already taken my heart.

43

And now you're locking me up here.

44

Then, I'll trust you.

62
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,930
Why are you so silent?

63
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,560
Because you think this heart is useful to you now,

64
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,750
and that I'm naive and foolish.

65
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,680
You think I don't deserve to possess this heart

66
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,360
or even to possess memories.

67
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,710
You think I don't even have the right to hate you.

68
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,540
So, what about everything that happened between us?

69

while assuming Yingshi's appearance,

71
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,310
and made those promises to me. What were they all for?

72
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,780
Or was everything just a lie?

73
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,130
Your heart is just like your face.

74
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,510
They're all fake.

75
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,250
You've never loved me.

76
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,790
If you think it's all fake,

77
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,340
then I have nothing to say.

78
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,640
Why don't you dig out your heart and have a look,

79
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,210
to see if it's real or not?

80
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,210
Fine.

Why won't you do it?

83
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,330
Because you are Zihui.

84
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,560
You know

85
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,350
what happened between us are not fake.

86

Stop lying to me.

87
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,340
I can't return the Stone Heart to you.

88
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,950
Because I harbor a guilty conscience,

89
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,900
and erased your memories.

90
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,240
It's my fault.

91
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,260
You're right.

92
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,130
You have the right to hate me.

93
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,150
But remember,

you're Zihui.

95
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,980
You are kind,

96
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,420
but not foolish.

Who's trying so hard to take my heart?

102
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,170
I will definitely find out everything

103

and get my heart back.

104
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,980
Why don't you come with us?

105
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,550
Although we don't know

106

how long we will stay in the State of Qi,

107
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,450
I'm worried about you being alone.

112
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,150
But I have my own plans.

113
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,490
If our fate hasn't ended,

114
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,090
we will definitely meet again.

115
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,200
Where are you going?

116
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,660
It wasn't easy for us to get you out.

117
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,310
What if you get caught again?

118
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,880
Don't worry, Miss.

119

I'm no longer that

120
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,910
ignorant man I used to be.

121
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,730
We should respect his decision.

122
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,490

Always be careful.

126

Don't be impulsive.

127
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,350
See you again.

128
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,680
I'll take my leave.

129
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,770
If we win this battle,

130
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,820
can we really gather the two jade pendants together?

131
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,350
Could Li

132
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,140
have left a clue in the Scale Nine Peaks?

133
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,010
Maybe,

134
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,710
or maybe not.

135
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,530
The State of Wei is coming at us aggressively,

136
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,050
and the Empress Dowager and the Emperor are suspicious of each other.

137
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,050
The people are innocent.

138
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,340
The State of Qi is in danger.

139
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,870
We can't just stand by and do nothing.

140
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,790
I know.

141
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,090
Since we're here in the mortal world for a tribulation,

142
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,980
we have to shoulder this responsibility.

143
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,480
Your Holiness.

and has died.

150

H-he is dead?

151
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,030
He didn't win the fight against the Great Demon?

152
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,020
Wasn't he practicing some great move?

153
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,900
He did use a great move.

154
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,380
But he perished together

155
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,080
with that Great Demon.

156
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,950
Well, that makes sense.

157
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,790
Immortal Li

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,140
was a civil official.

159
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,580
His martial arts skills were very shallow.

160
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,000
He must have tried his best.

161
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,880
Yes.

162
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,120
Even you think Immortal Li's magic

163
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,800
was weak,

164
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,730
let alone others.

165
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,580
For his reputation,

166
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,250
you must say

167
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,000
you saw it with your own eyes.

168
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,220
Yes.

[General's Mansion]

170
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,760
Here.

171
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,080
It seems that every time before we part,

172
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,420
we drink and admire the moon.

173
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,150
Yes.

174
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,690
You liked to do this when you were Lu Changkong.

175
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,160
Why are you laughing?

176
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,620
I remember someone once said

177
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,220
he's not Lu Changkong.

178
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,990
But I know

179
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,690
Lu Changkong is a part of you.

180
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,340
Have you already

181
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,010
fallen in love with me since then?

182
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,460
Actually, I always knew who I am

183
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:00,940
and what are parts of me.

184
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,590
But...

185
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,900
But was your pride too strong

186
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,000
or was it too awkward

187
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,190
for you to admit it?

188
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,890
Listen carefully.

189
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,140
When you return to court after winning the battle,

190
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,680

I made!

192
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,340
Do you hear me?

193
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,060
Do you hear me?

194
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,420
Do you hear me?

195
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,820
Yes, I heard you.

196
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,010
You're so noisy.

197
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:05,420
[Loyalty, Righteousness, Benevolence, and Bravery]

198
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,520
If you have something to say, just say it.

199
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,210
Don't keep it to yourself.

200
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,170
In the front line this time,

201
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,080
Wei's troops are several times that of Qi's troops.

202
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,630
You must be very careful.

203
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,480
I know.

204
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,070
By the way,

205
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,730
Grand General of Zhenyuan

206
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,200
works for the Empress Dowager.

207
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,110
He will be on his guard against you.

208
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,820
You should be careful about that too.

209
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,060
I know.

210
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,390
Now the enemy is in front of us.

211
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,350
Although Grand General of Zhenyuan is estranged from the Emperor,

212
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,510
he's still a general of the State of Qi.

213
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,780
Protecting our country and people is the most important responsibility.

214
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,980
As for Xinran,

215
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,120
I've already sent someone to keep an eye on her.

216
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,890
Don't worry too much.

217
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:57,560
[Loyalty, Righteousness, Benevolence, and Bravery]

218
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,240
General.

219
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,550
It's time to depart.

220
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:53,930
I'll get going.

221
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,720
Don't see me off.

222
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,590
Keep this

223
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,440
with you at all times.

224
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,610
[Loyalty, Righteousness, Benevolence, and Bravery]

225
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,160
I know it's just a tribulation.

226
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,760
Even if you die on the battlefield...

227
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,310
Chu Kong!

228
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,930
you'll just return to the Immortal Realm.

229
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,060
But why

230
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,390
am I still unable to bear for you to leave?

231
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,120
I'll wait for you to come back.

232
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,120
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

233
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,550
I've got news from the front line

234
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,250
that General Chu Kong won the first battle.

235
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,490
Our army's morale was greatly boosted.

236
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,950
But...

237
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,440
But what?

238
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,080
It's just that

239
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,940
after the State of Wei's defeat,

240
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,530
they immediately reinforced with 100,000 troops.

241
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,240
The front line

242
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,260
is hard-pressed.

243
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,420
If the State of Wei is defeated,

244
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,030
Xinran and her backers

245
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,130
will definitely make a move.

246
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,000
Then, you can make good use of the opportunity

247
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,800
to get them all in one go.

248
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,210
Chu Kong is brave and skillful in battle

249
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
and resourceful.

250
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,150
He will definitely return safely.

251
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,790
The Qi soldiers are risking their lives fighting against the enemy in the front line.

252
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,090
There's not much I can do to help.

253
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,570
Tomorrow, go to Daguo Temple with me

254
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,330
to pray for the soldiers.

255
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,860
Mother, you can't do that.

256
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,680
Why not?

257
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,700
Are you still hiding something from me?

258
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,670
Mother.

259
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,359
Do you still remember Xinran?

260
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:30,200
[Daguo Temple]

261
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,830
It's you?

262
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,390
Ridiculous.

263
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,270
She caused you to have a miscarriage

264
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,580
and is a spy from the State of Wei.

265
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,320
How could you have let her go?

266
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,640
Mother, calm down.

267
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,500
We did it for the big picture.

268
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,700
If she didn't bring the fake information back to the State of Wei,

269
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,890
we wouldn't have

270
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,320
gotten our first victory this easily.

271
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,140
Then where is Xinran now?

272
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,490
Chu Kong has already sent someone to keep an eye on her.

273
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,550
Unfortunately, she found out

274
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,620
and went into hiding.

275
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,950
Now the enemy is in the dark, while we're in the open.

276
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,520
Mother, you must not leave the palace.

277
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,830
It's too dangerous.

278
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,900
In that case,

279
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,850
all the more should I get out into public.

280
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,090
You've finally shown up.

281
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,360
I wanted to spare you for a few more days.

282
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,120
But since you're asking for your death,

283
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,940
don't blame me for being ruthless.

284
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,660
You should just surrender.

285
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,780
You can't escape.

286
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,430
What I hate the most

287
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,620
is your arrogant attitude.

288
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,890
How dare you speak to me like that?

289
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,990
Do you think that just because you're the princess of Qi,

290
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,810
that everyone has to listen to you

291
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,150
and obey you?

292
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,640
Even my Chu Kong has changed.

293
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,090
It's all because of you.

294
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,930
I was so good to Chu Kong.

295
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
But in the end, he repaid my kindness with ingratitude.

296
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,270
He pretended to let me go

297
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,780
and even got me to send back fake information,

298
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,460
causing me to make a big mistake.

299
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,790
Today,

300
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,640
I will kill you and the Empress Dowager

301
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,490
to redeem myself.

302
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,110
Your conspiracy will never succeed.

303
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,640
Really?

304
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,580
Mother.

305
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,750
Do you know the situation that Chu Kong's currently in?

306
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,970
If you want to save Chu Kong,

307
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,390
help me kill the Empress Dowager.

308
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,310
Then, I'll find a way to save Chu Kong's life.

309
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,690
Although our army was tricked by you,

310
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,050
and suffered great losses,

311
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,610
the State of Wei still has countless elite soldiers.

312
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,470
No matter how powerful and strong

313
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,300
Chu Kong is,

314
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,090
how can he defeat the State of Wei's

315
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,570
hundreds of thousands of soldiers?

316
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,820
You went to such great lengths

317
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,880
to get my mother killed,

318
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,570
in order to shake the foundation of the State of Qi

319
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,390
and cause civil unrest in the State of Qi.

320
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,790
In this way, you can win without a fight,

321
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:02,890
while the State of Qi

322
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,060
will be devastated

323
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,080
and its people will be in misery.

324
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,130
These

325
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,050
are everything Chu Kong doesn't want to see.

326
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,790
Even if you capture Chu Kong,

327
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,010
he wouldn't let me

328
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,200
sacrifice

329
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,370
the lives of Qi's people for his life.

330
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,060
Don't waste your energy.

331
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,850
Fine.

332
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,900
Since I'll die anyway,

333
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,300
I will kill the Empress Dowager today

334
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,830
and let everyone in the State of Qi

335
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,850
die with me!

336
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,400
Brother.

337
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,740
Mother.

338
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,990
Sorry I'm late in my rescue.

339
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

340
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,200
Mother.

341
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,610
I told Brother to come.

342
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,020
Zhi!

343
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,380
Brother!

344
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,030
What did you

345
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,450
call me just now?

346
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,480
Guards!

347
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,820
Escort His Majesty back to the palace.

348
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,600
Yes.

349
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,110
Hurry.

350
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,020
You will never...

351
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,390
see Chu Kong ever again.

352
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,470
Chu Kong promised me.

353
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,460
He won't break his promise.

354
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,990
A military letter from the border.

355
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:24,850
General Chu Kong

356
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,420
used 3,000 elites as bait

357
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,970
to enact the stratagem of luring the tiger out of the mountain

358
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,740
and lured Wei's elite soldiers into the forest.

359
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,580
The remaining troops

360
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,640
made use of this chance when Wei's headquarters were unguarded

361
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,750
and advanced straight to the enemy's capital,

362
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:43,310
[Qi]

363
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,750
and captured the Emperor of Wei who came to supervise the battle.

364
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,450
Now,

365
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,120
the State of Wei has signed a Letter of Surrender.

366
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,380
They've promised that for a hundred years,

367
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,260
they'd never invade the borders of the State of Qi.

368
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,460
Your Majesty.

369
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,440
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

370
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
This year's harvest is bountiful.

371
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,860
There are great grain harvests everywhere.

372
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,630
Five million dan of grains from eight prefectures

373
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,980
have all been expropriated.

374
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,970
But the transportation of grains by water is not smooth.

375
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,060
I'm afraid it'll be hard to reach the capital.

376
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,260
You can make the decisions.

377
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,960
Grains are the foundation of our country.

378
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,740
The transportation of grains by water cannot be obstructed.

379
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,180
Minister Li.

380
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,450
You will supervise the Ministry of Works

381
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,670
in checking the finances

382
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,020
and clearing the rivers as soon as possible

383
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,000
to facilitate the transportation of grains by water.

384
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

385
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,020
You may leave.

386
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,800
Son.

387
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,010
I'm not as capable as I used to be.

388
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,790
The world

389
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,360
will depend on you from now on.

390
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,460
I

391
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,810
won't let you down.

392
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,470
Brother.

393
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,510
Can I have a look?

394
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,480
Nursery rhyme?

395
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,960
Thank you, Brother.

396
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,000
Mother.

397
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,410
Let me play another round with you.

398
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,600
Come on.

399
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,380
You can't go easy on me this time.

400
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:39,690
Yes.

401
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,460
Chu Kong.

402
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,700
Now, the Empress Dowager and Emperor are united in heart and mind,

403
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,040
and the State of Qi is prosperous and the people are in peace.

404
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,780
It's only until today

405
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,850
that I truly understand

406
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,850
the righteousness you seek.

407
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,170
Yun.

408
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,770
The front line has said that

409
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,200
although Chu Kong is seriously injured,

410
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,370
he's safe.

411
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,310
The State of Qi still has some military conflicts that need to be dealt with.

412
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,580
Chu Kong prioritized the country over his family.

413
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,670
He's a good man of the State of Qi with an indomitable spirit.

414
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,880
I know you love him deeply.

415
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,020
But as a country's princess,

416
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,580
you should know how to prioritize the overall situation.

417
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,130
Just wait in peace.

418
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,220
When the war has completely subsided,

419
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,020
Chu Kong will return.

420
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,740
At first, as a mortal,

421
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,490
I thought there were too many things

422
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,460
that were beyond the control

423
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,620
of one's will.

424
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,800
But after this experience,

425
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,550
I realized the responsibility on one's shoulders.

426
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,260
Even a country's general in the mortal world is like this,

427
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,410
let alone the God of War of the six realms.

428
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,440
Chu Kong.

429
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,300
For tens of thousands of years,

430
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,640
in order to protect the peace of the six realms,

431
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,060
you must have made a lot of painstaking effort that no one knows about.

432
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,380
Cang Hai is about to be resurrected.

433
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,670
All the more can't I let you worry about me

434
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,290
and hurt your primordial spirit.

435
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,300
[Mother]

436
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,370
Mother.

437
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,410
Brother.

438
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,100
I hope this letter finds you well.

439
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,310
I was fortunate to have received the love and kindness

440
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,430
from two elders like you in this lifetime.

441
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,580
Now that you two have reconciled your previous disagreements,

442
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,010
I have no other wishes.

443
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,090
Although I can't bear to say goodbye to my old friends,

444
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,220
I have something more important to do.

445
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,700
If we're destined in the future,

446
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,230
we'll definitely reunite again.

447
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,800
Chu Kong.

448
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,720
Let's consider that the Crabapple Flower Wine I owe you

449
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,870
has been made up for.

450
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,310
When you return to court after winning the battle,

451
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,900
remember to come and drink the Crabapple Flower Wine

452
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,320
I made!

453
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,220
I'll wait for you to come back.

454
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,460
Chu Kong.

455
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,360
I have to leave first this time.

456
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,180
You must live on well.

457
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,330
Xiangyun.

458
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,250
This is all I can do for you.

459
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,950
You can only rely on yourself for the rest of the time.

460
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,320
This time,

461
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,660
you must live on well.

462
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,670
[Qi]

463
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,200
♫Brighter than the moon was your face♫

464
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,920
♫When you said goodbye♫

465
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,110
♫And turned around to leave♫

466
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,850
♫Missing you in the cool wind♫

467
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,620
♫I know I can never see you again♫

468
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,480
♫Tears stream down my face♫

469
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,590
♫We were the perfect match♫

470
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,230
♫But the unpredictable fate pulled us apart♫

471
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,570
♫Stumbling on the way to you♫

472
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,620
Why are you back so soon?

473
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,880
Is your primordial spirit okay?

474
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,950
♫I found myself trapped by love♫

475
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,260
I'm fine.

476
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,950
♫I don't regret meeting you♫

477
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,660
What about you?

478
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,940
I think I'm fine too.

479
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,150
♫I'll wait for you my whole life♫

480
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,380
That's great.

481
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,920
♫Our love is already water under the bridge for you♫

482
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,470
♫Can you hear my wistful sighs?♫

483
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,410
♫Do you wish we could start all over?♫

484
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,140
♫Does the one giving more have to end up with a broken heart?♫

485
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,920
♫You left at sunset♫

486
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,080
♫My heart grew cold because I knew our story ended♫

487
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,920
♫Your face faded in the wind♫

488
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,990
I have something to ask you.

489
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,190
Didn't you promise me

490
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,370
you would come back alive?

491
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,300
Why did you follow me back here

492
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,460
from the tribulation?

493
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,740
I should

494
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,870
be the one asking you this.

495
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,260
Didn’t you say you would wait for me to come back

496
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,620
and drink your Crabapple Flower Wine?

497
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,130
Then if I

498
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,880
came back here earlier than you on purpose,

499
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,040
what would you do?

500
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,200
Then of course...

501
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,240
I'll tear down your Marriage Pavilion.

502
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,190
That Li.

503
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,410
Seriously.

504
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,420
It's all his fault for writing such a ridiculous script in the Fate Book.

505
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,800
He wrote me out so hastily.

506
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,820
If I find him,

507
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,810
I will...

508
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,570
I don't even know

509
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,020
where he is now.

510
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,350
Don't worry.

511
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,460
We will know the whereabouts of Immortal Li soon.

512
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,700
Your Divinity.

513
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,580
Have you found any clues?

514
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,520
Li worked hard to write his Fate Book.

515
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,060
It's impossible that

516
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,840
it's just to let us

517
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,970
go down there for a stroll.

518
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,530
Judging from the State of Qi's situation alone,

519
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:35,990
there seems to be no problem.

520
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,320
It's still in his

521
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,600
indescribable style.

522
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,480
Yes.

523
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,780
A general and a princess.

524
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,100
It's obviously Li's style.

525
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,090
And

526
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,530
the Scale Nine Peaks.

527
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,630
The Scale Nine Peaks?

528
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,740
It's a nursery rhyme.

529
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,300
A nursery rhyme!

530
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,360
What nursery rhyme?

531
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,140
The clue Li left us is a nursery rhyme.

532
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,210
Mr. Grievance

533
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,780
herds the cows.

534
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,300
He walks the cows at 9 p.m. every day.

535
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,270
The cow headbutted the grain warehouse and the maize is roasted.

536
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:13,260
His parents want him to switch to fishing.

537
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,760
Mr. Grievance went into the water to gather the fishing net

538
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,270
and fished out a wooden man.

539
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,250
In other words,

540
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,530
the nursery rhyme contains

541
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,989
the clues he left for us?

542
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,820
After combining the Tiger Tally,

543
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,610
the words "nursery rhyme" sparkled.

544
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:26,790
I think

545
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,420
Li is a lazy person.

546
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,500
He wouldn't write beyond what's necessary.

547
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,340
Why would he

548
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,980
write such a

549
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,110
seemingly mysterious

550
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,730
and irrelevant plot for no reason?

551
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,190
He has never written such things

552
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,050
in the Fate Book.

553
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,090
What does Li want to tell us?

554
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,860
He walks the cows at 9 p.m. every day.

555
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,960
Who would do that at night?

556
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,440
Stop frowning.

557
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,000
We will definitely find Immortal Li soon.

558
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,550
Sir.

559
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,840
I’m back.

560
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,070
Sir?

561
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,630
Sir.

562
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,830
I'm back!

563
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,700
[Marriage Pavilion]

564
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,820
I heard

565
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,360
you're looking for me.

566
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,240
Leave.

567
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,270
Lord Protector.

568
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,950
You are no match for him.

569
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:49,520
Retreat!

570
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,310
Yes.

571
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,890
What is the relationship

572
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,220
between you and Jin Luo?

573
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,080
So

574
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,770
Jin Luo didn't tell you.

575
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,390
It seems like

576
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,170
she still hates me, her brother, the most.

577
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:25,900
Brother?

578
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,490
You are Jin Luo's brother?

579
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,500
Why are you two

580
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,720
trying so hard

581
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,690
to get my Stone Heart?

582
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,380
Qianren!

583
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,890
What are you talking about?

584
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,990
Open the door, Mou.

585
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,380
You saved my life.

586
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,470
I'll repay it for you now.

587
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,680
Mou!

588
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,740
Mou, listen to me.

589
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,460
Mou!

590
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,680
Mou, open the door!

591
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,720
Mou, come back!

592
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,860
Come back now!

593
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,230
I didn't ask you to repay me, Mou!

594
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,100
Qianren...

595
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,820
is already dead.

596
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,400
In the Shengling Sect,

597
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,580
we went through thick and thin together

598
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,260
and shared weal and woe.

599
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:13,920
Why?

600
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,860
Why did you take my Stone Heart?

601
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,310
Why did it have to be you?

602
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,110
Even if I used to be Qianren,

603
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,860
so what?

604
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,670
Everyone has their own inescapable mission.

605
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,350
The 20 years at Shengling Sect

606
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,800
is just an accident

607
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,110
that I had to go through.

608
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,170
How can it...

609
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,790
affect me?

610
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,890
In your eyes, was everything that Qianren and Qian Mou

611
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,370
went through

612
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,200
just a mere accident?

613
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,890
No matter how beautiful the time at Shengling Sect was,

614
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,870
you and I should understand that

615
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,520
it was just a dream in the mortal world.

616
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,810
You're not Qian Mou,

617
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,540
and I'm not Qianren.

618
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,510
I'm the Protector of the Moluo Divine Clan,

619
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,060
Jin Lian.

620
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,650
I shoulder the mission of the deep blood feud of the Moluo Divine Clan.

621
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,210
My life is dedicated to

622
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,880
seeking revenge

623
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,530
and reviving the Moluo Divine Clan.

624
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,500
What about me?

625
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,580
What am I in the eyes

626
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,250
of you and your sister?

627
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,320
You're just

628
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,430
a Nuwa Stone that can help me revitalize my cause.

629
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:49,620
Good.

630
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
Well said.

631
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,340
It was all my wishful thinking.

632
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,860
In the eyes of you two,

633
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,360
I'm nothing but...

634
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,140
a tool to help you complete your mission.

635
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:13,890
Give me back my Stone Heart.

636
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,690
Give me back my Stone Heart!

637
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,260
If you want the Stone Heart,

638
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,000
you'll have to lure Jin Luo out!

639
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,490
Do all the immortals

640
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,780
know about this?

641
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:42,840
Yes.

642
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,190
Immortal Li was lively

643
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,620
and quite popular in the Heaven Realm.

644
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,130
His death couldn't be concealed.

645
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,470
I'm afraid the news

646
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,700
has already spread to the Marriage Pavilion.

647
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,020
Your Divinity.

648
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,030
You came just in time.

649
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,420
Xiangzi...

650
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,670
Did she find out

651
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,060
about Immortal Li?

652
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,110
That girl has always been very close to Immortal Li.

653
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,830
Who knew...
