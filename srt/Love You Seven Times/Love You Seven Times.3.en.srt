be referred to as General Lu instead of his name,

387
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,030
and carry his sword when presenting himself.

388
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,300
[Zhaoqian Palace]

389
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,640
He defeated an army of 20,000

390
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,900
with just 1,000 elites.

391
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,300
He's so adept at strategy and commanding an army,

392
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,770
but he's still a young man.

393
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,180
Yes, he's young and accomplished.

394
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,950
He'll definitely do great things in the future.

395
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,370
[Li Yan, the emperor of Great Chen]

396
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,790
Yes.

397
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,180
Your subject, Lu Changkong,

398
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,900
pays his respect to Your Majesty.

399
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,830
Official Lu,

400
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,250
please rise.

401
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,830
Not bad.

402
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,750
You used your acumen

403
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,550
to resolve the hopeless situation at Tongguan

404
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,020
and turn the tide.

405
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,890
You exceeded everyone's expectations.

406
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,280
Impressive.

407
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,400
You're indeed a descendant of the Lu family.

408
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,330
Lu Liang,

409
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,840
you really have a good son.

410
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,570
Thank you, Your Majesty.

411
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,110
Official Lu,

412
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,800
tell me.

413
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,530
How do you want me

414
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,000
to reward you?

415
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,520
The Lu family has been favored by Your Majesty for years.

416
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,140
It's my duty to protect our country.

417
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,860
If Your Majesty rewards me again,

418
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,600
I'll feel guilty.

419
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,610
Rise.

420
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,400
Don't be modest.

421
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,180
This is a major military achievement!

422
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,240
There's no need to reward you?

423
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:40,850
If I don't reward you,

424
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
and word gets out,

425
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,390
everyone will blame me for being heartless.

426
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,870
[Li Xiuwen, the Second Prince of Great Chen]

427
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,750
It's alright.

428
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,140
What do you want?

429
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,080
Tell me.

430
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,740
I'm the emperor of Great Chen.

431
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,680
Are you worried I can't give you what you want?

432
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,170
I...

433
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,190
I'm a martial man.

434
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,380
I have no other requests.

435
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,270
My parents are old,

436
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,180
so I only wish to go back to the Lu Mansion

437
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,740
to accompany my parents for a while

438
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,030
and fulfill my filial duties.

439
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,860
Alright.

440
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,890
I'll grant your wish.

441
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,130
Thank you, Your Majesty.

442
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,640
Rise.

443
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,380
[Tai'an Palace]

444
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,890
Look at the Lu father and son.

445
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,130
[Commander Feng of the Criminal Investigation Bureau]

446
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,180
They were so arrogant in the hall just now.

447
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,000
He refused to receive a reward?

448
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,040
Mr. Feng.

449
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,860
Yes.

450
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,140
Find some people to take him down a notch.

451
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,440
He needs to learn

452
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,740
who Great Chen belongs to.

453
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,790
Yes.

454
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,570
Your Highness.

455
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,690
Although the Lu family is powerful

456
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,250
and their position in court cannot be shaken right now,

457
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,260
as the saying goes, "The higher you climb, the harder you fall."

458
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,300
In terms of his actions,

459
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:42,550
the Second Prince is really ruthless and cruel.

460
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,380
Your Highness.

461
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,910
Father, listen to me.

462
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,150
I didn't want to be rewarded

463
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,170
because I think...

464
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,910
Let's go home first.

465
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,350
General Lu.

466
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:03,000
This is the Third Prince, Prince Ning.

467
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,330
Greetings, Prince Ning.

468
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,950
There's no need for formalities between us.

469
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,720
I've heard Prince Ning is in ill health.

470
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,190
It’s cold today,

471
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,700
yet you have come to see me.

472
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,560
There must be something important.

473
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,820
General Lu, the formidable young general.

474
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,050
You're a blessing to Great Chen.

475
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,390
I have lived in the palace for a long time,

476
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,510
but I often hear about your great achievements.

477
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,700
I admire you.

478
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,600
I've been looking for a chance to meet you.

479
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,750
If you don't mind,

480
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,430
would you like to be friends with me?

481
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,320
Your Highness wanting to make friends with me

482
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,710
brings honor to the whole Lu family.

483
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,560
As I said,

484
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,050
we should address each other as friends.

485
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,470
What is the use of these formalities?

486
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,220
Now,

487
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,750
as your friend,

488
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,260
I do have something important

489
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,570
to remind you of.

490
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,780
Go ahead, Your Highness.

491
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,340
The court is a place

492
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,310
of scheming and intrigue.

493
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,270
Tall trees must bear strong winds.

494
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,820
The Lu family wields great influence.

495
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,690
It's inevitable that many people are jealous.

496
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,230
The Lu Army isn't in the capital.

497
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,590
You don't have the habit of bringing guards around with you.

498
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,020
General Lu, you should avoid

499
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,840
remote areas for the time being.

500
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,140
Your Highness means

501
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,380
someone at court

502
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,990
wants to target the Lu family?

503
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,460
The capital is not like the border.

504
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,600
You should be careful.

505
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,730
I understand.

506
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,370
In the future, in the palace,

507
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,330
I can keep an eye out for the Lu family.

508
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,600
If you need my help,

509
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,920
I will do my best.

510
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,290
Thank you, Your Highness.

511
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:49,830
The wind has risen.

512
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,640
Your Highness, you should go back and rest.

513
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,470
Not even Father knows about my habits.

514
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,520
How did Prince Ning,

515
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,990
who is sheltered within the palace,

516
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,660
know that I don't like to bring guards around with me?

517
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:15,010
[Song Mansion]

518
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,060
Miss.

519
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,620
Miss.

520
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,570
Miss.

521
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,970
Wake up.

522
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,550
Wake up.

523
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,140
Bad news!

524
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,350
What happened?

525
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,380
Miss!

526
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,860
Wait.

527
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,980
Really? So soon?

528
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,480
He asked Lu Fang to send a message.

529
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,260
He said if you don't have a response

530
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,380
to what he said in his previous letter,

531
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,350
he'll take your silence as consent.

532
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:54,930
Letter?

533
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,230
What letter?

534
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,210
What did I promise him?

535
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,490
Did you forget?

536
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,040
Ever since Young Master Lu went to the border,

537
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,390
he's been writing you a letter every three days.

538
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,950
I've kept them in the cabinet for you.

539
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,020
But you never read a single one.

540
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,970
Keep him away.

541
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,700
Okay.

542
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,020
Seriously?

543
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,760
Lu Changkong

544
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,980
I know you're diligent.

545
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,690
But you should at least give me serial numbers.

546
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,500
This...

547
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,020
How do I know which letter it was?

548
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,410
Young Master Lu,

549
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,820
you're here.

550
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,580
Where is Xiangyun?

551
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,670
Are you here for Miss Song?

552
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,390
She's in her room?

553
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,280
I think so.

554
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,390
Yes.

555
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,710
Let me take a look first.

556
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,220
No need!

557
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,530
I

558
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,520
will go see her myself!

559
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,900
[Lu Fang, servant of the Lu family]

560
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:19,700
Cui Bi.

561
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,250
Are your ears

562
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,310
okay?

563
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,070
Yes.

564
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,510
Young Master!

565
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,610
Xiangyun.

566
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:31,380
Where is she?

567
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:31,900
Young Master!

568
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:32,980
Young Master!

569
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,030
Miss.

570
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,220
Young Master Lu,

571
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,220
these letters are...

572
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:51,980
Well...

573
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,360
Miss Song...

574
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,170

I'm looking forward to them.

I have to make it clear to you.
