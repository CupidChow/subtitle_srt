[Episode 32]

4
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,900
Fortunately,

5
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,520
only I know about it now.

6
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,360
But

7
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,470
if other immortals find it out,

8
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
even if you're the prince of the Dixiu Divine Clan,

9
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,120
you won't

10
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,410
be able to get away with it.

11
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,060
I understand.

12
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,940
I'll take care of it.

13
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,780
You may leave.

14
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,650
Your Holiness.

15
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,660
Greetings, Your Holiness.

16
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,790
Are you here to talk about

17
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,100
the Demon-Vanishing Formation?

18
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,980
To activate the Demon-Vanishing Formation,

19
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,579
I need the Golden Cores of seven Great Demons.

20
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,690
[Black Eagle King, the Demon King]

21
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,940
It's not an easy task.

22
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,390
Please

23
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,540
give me more time.

24
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,120
However,

25
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,430
now,

26
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,990
I have something important to tell you.

27
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,350
This woman is Jin Luo, the Saintess of the Moluo Divine Clan.

28
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,430
I think

29
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,070
she may be of use to you,

30
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,490
so I brought her here.

31
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,060
What's your relationship with Jin Cheng?

32
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,880
Answer His Holiness now!

33
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,490
The ruler of the Heaven Realm

34
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,360
is in cahoots with the Demon King.

35
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,850
You're birds of a feather.

36
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,610
You…

37
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,540
Girl,

38
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,080
you're quite tough.

39
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,340
But it's okay.

40
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,780
I've got plenty of time.

41
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,370
I accept

42
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,860
your gift.

43
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,590
But you have to keep in mind

44
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,890
why I made you

45
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,440
the Demon King.

46
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,980
As to the Demon Cores,

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,930
if you can't make any headway,

48
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,370
I'll make you fall off your pedestal

49
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,620
the same way I put you up there.

50
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,700
I understand.

51
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,659
After going back,

52
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,320
I'll take action right away.

53
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,270
You went to 30,000 years ago.

54
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,020
Have you found out the truth?

55
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,870
Will you kill me?

56
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,240
Do you think

57
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,760
I won't?

58
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,300
I wanted to test my brother,

59
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,860
but he showed it to me himself.

60
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,710
It just made him

61
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,659
more suspicious.

62
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,680
If he were the culprit,

63
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,400
he must have the Doom Mark on his body.

64
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,540
But he doesn't.

65
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,580
Could it be

66
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,460
that he's noticed something?

67
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,940
Don't worry.

68
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,040
I'll figure out another way.

69
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,370
But I don't have the Power of Cang Hai now

70
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,410
and your primordial spirit was damaged

71
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,580
when you saved me.

72
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,200
How can we deal with him?

73
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,240
I'll find a way to retrieve the Power of Cang Hai

74
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,700
you left in Void.

75
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,690
Everything will be over.

76
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,280
We'll be fine.

77
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,400
No matter what happens,

78
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,710
don't lose hope.

79
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,020
But

80
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,470
I don't know what Haoxuan will do next.

81
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,540
I…

82
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,190
I told you to have hope.

83
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,580
Don't think too much.

84
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,409
I'm just

85
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,670
worried.

86
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,340
I'm worried that he may suspect you.

87
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,990
Perhaps,

88
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,240
he's suspected me for a long time.

89
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,940
What did you say?

90
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,090
Nothing.

91
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,140
If there's anything,

92
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,260
don't keep it from me.

93
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,570
You promised me.

94
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,540
You

95
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,700
should be honest with me.

96
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,980
Yes.

97
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,780
Empress Cang Hai.

98
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:25,900
You...

99
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,540
You're the only one

100
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,140
who knows my identity in the Heaven Realm.

101
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,100
Watch your back.

102
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,900
I may kill you.

103
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:38,900
You…

104
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,120
You know what?

105
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,310
The Star Platform

106
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,100
is the best spot not only for watching stars

107
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,870
but also for watching the sunrise.

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,280
I know.

109
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,390
The Star Platform

110
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,770
is the highest place

111

after the Heavenly Palace.

112
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,140
Usually,

113
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,280
when you immortals are here,

114
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,310
a fairy like me doesn't dare to come up here.

115
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:06,890
In the future,

116
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,250
if possible,

117
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,100
we'll come here every day.

118
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,920

Has…

125
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,030
I'll go check it out.

126
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,220
What should we do?

127
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,490
Chu Kong.

128
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,100
Chu Kong!

133
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,500
It was you.

134
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,700
Why?

135
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,560
Why?

136
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,980
He killed someone.

137
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,450
It's just blood for blood.

138
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,220
I had waited

139
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,320
for this day for 30,000 years.

140
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:31,860
No.

141
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,070
It's not like that.

142
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,190
It's not like that?

143
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,400
Then what is the truth?

144
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,630
For 30,000 years,

145
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,750
everyone has been singing his praises

146
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,460
and cheering his heroic deed of killing Cang Hai.

147
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,980
Does anyone know

148
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,660
what the Moluo Divine Clan suffered?

149
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,670
Does anyone know

150
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,490
what I suffered?

151
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,980
The truth

152
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,010
is not what you think.

153
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,380
Chu Kong was not the culprit.

154
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,580
How did you know?

155
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,260
I remembered everything.

156
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,950
You remembered everything?

157
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,730
You're Cang Hai.

158
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,590
I know.

159
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,330
You've suffered a lot in the past 30,000 years.

160
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,100
I'll tell you the truth

161
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,820
in the future.

162
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,180
Now,

163
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,920
I'm going to find him.

164
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,810
Chu Kong is dead.

165
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,580
What's the point of looking for him?

166
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,030
Xiu Ming.

167
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,510
Let me go.

168
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,570
Cang Hai.

169
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,330
I failed to protect you 30,000 years ago.

170
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,070
That's why the tragedy happened.

171
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,250
This time,

172
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,150
I won't repeat that mistake.

173
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,660
Xiu Ming.

174
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,040
I chose this life.

175
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,410
It has nothing to do with others.

176
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,480
I beg you.

177
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,270
Please let me go.

178
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,940
I'm begging you. Please let me go.

179
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,180
Xiu Ming.

180
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,820
Cang Hai.

181
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,420
Sorry.

182
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,590
Xiu Ming!

183
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,820
Xiu Ming!

184
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,860
I beg you.

185
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,230
Please let me go.

186
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,990
Xiu Ming.

187
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,730
Xiu Ming, let me out.

188
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,820
Now that Chu Kong is dead,

189
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,080
no one in the world

190
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,540
can stop me.

191
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,930
After I collect all the seven Golden Cores

192
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,540
and activate the Demon-Vanishing Formation,

193
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,380
I'll gain the Power of the Demon King.

194
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,560
By then,

195
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,900
all the six realms

196
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,980
will be mine.

197
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,610
You disappeared so suddenly.

198
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,710
I still can't accept it.

199
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,180
I don't believe

200
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,820
that you would abandon me.

201
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,780
I'm worried that he may suspect you.

202
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,420
Perhaps,

203
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,890
he's suspected me for a long time.

204
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,370
What did you say?

205
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,720
Nothing.

206
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,480
Untie it for me!

207
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,340
Besides having love tribulations,

208
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,020
there is only one way to untie it.

209
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,750
What's it?

210
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,550
What's it?

211
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,910
Either you or he

212
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,920
has to lose the primordial spirit

213
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,280
and die.

214
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,820
The Love Knot didn't disappear.

215
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,410
Chu Kong is still alive.

216
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,600
He must still be alive.

217
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,110
Chu Kong didn't die.

218
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,130
Didn't you

219
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,990
see him disappear with your own eyes?

220
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,460
The Love Knot is still tied,

221
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,680
which means he's still alive.

222
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,700
So,

223
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,460
you didn't kill him.

224
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,340
It seems

225
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,220
that he was really lucky.

226
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,220
He actually survived the Soul-shattering Arrow.

227
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,120
But next time,

228
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,060
he won't be so lucky.

229
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,940
No.

230
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,270
Whether it was 30,000 years ago or now,

231
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,580
you wouldn't kill the innocent.

232
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,190
You've always known he wasn't the culprit

233
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,100
30,000 years ago,

234
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,720
right?

235
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,060
So,

236
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,260
you put on this show with him.

237
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,220
I'm kept here

238
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,310
because you want to protect me, right?

239
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,230
30,000 years have passed.

240
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,630
The person who knows me the best

241
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,940
is still you.

242
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,420
So,

243
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,220
do you still insist on me staying here?

244
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,480
Leave.

245
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,060
Xiu Ming.

246
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,190
Thank you.

247
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,610
I need to do two things.

248
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,980
I've thought about it.

249
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,270
One you can help me.

250
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,270
You're the God of War.

251
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,390
I don't think I can help you with anything.

252
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,940
What's it?

253
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,390
I'll go to the Mystery Forest.

254
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,620
The Mystery Forest?

255
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,040
For demonic power?

256
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,470
Only with the Power of the Demon King

257
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,890
can I go to Void

258
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,650
to get back

259
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,200
the Power of Cang Hai she lost.

260
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,130
But it's very dangerous.

261
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,220
You may die there.

262
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,220
Are you sure you want to take the risk?

263
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,360
For Cang Hai,

264
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,130
I have to do this.

265
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,050
You need a trace of ancient primordial spirit

266
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,850
to complete your Soul-shattering Arrow, right?

267
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,940
Who are you going to so much trouble

268
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,870
to hide from?

269
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,060
Is it…

270
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,040
I promised you

271
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,640
to uncover the truth.

272
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,840
Now is not the time.

273
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,070
Aren't you afraid

274
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,110
that I'll really kill you?

275
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,480
Will you?

276
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,380
Does she know about this?

277
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,390
That's the second favor I'm gonna ask for.

278
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,780
Xiangzi.

279
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,940
Xiangzi!

280
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,350
Xiangzi, you…

281
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,110
I…

282
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,720
I was so worried about you.

283
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,880
Do you know?

284
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,570
You poor girl.

285
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,110
I thought you and His Divinity died together.

286
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,300
Red Thread Master.

287
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,390
Why is the Love Knot

288
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,800
still tied?

289
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,220
The Love Knot is still…

290
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,140
Red Thread Master,

291
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,900
does this mean

292
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,560
His Divinity's

293
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,810
primordial spirit didn't perish

294
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
and he's still alive?

295
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,040
Who else knows about this?

296
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,620
No one

297
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,070
except you.

298
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,190
Go back to the Marriage Pavilion now.

299
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,200
Be good.

300
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,560
This is an important matter.

301
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,140
Red Thread Master.

302
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,250
I need to report it to His Holiness.

303
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,180
Red Thread Master.

304
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,410
Keep it quiet.

305
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,810
I plan to

306
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,130
look for Chu Kong myself.

307
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,010
Nonsense!

308
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,780
It's such a great matter!

309
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,620
You're just a fairy.

310
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,690
How can you handle it?

311
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,980
We should tell His Holiness

312
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,240
and let him decide what to do.

313
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,780
Red Thread Master.

314
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:56,830
Think about it.

315
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,420
Chu Kong was the God of War.

316
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,920
He was assassinated in the Heaven Realm.

317
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,790
It means

318
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,930
that the person who wanted him dead is very powerful.

319
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,890
Red Thread Master,

320
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,720
in the Heaven Realm,

321
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,910
you're the only one

322
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,220
I trust.

323
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,140
Don't you trust His Holiness?

324
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,260
He's His Divinity's brother.

325
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,460
I can't afford to take the risk.

326
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,200
What are you going to do next?

327
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,150
I'm going

328
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,940
to look for Chu Kong.

329
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,980
But the six realms are so big.

330
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,850
Where shall I start?

331
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,580
Red Thread Master.

332
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,020
Do you know how to find him?

333
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,020
Tell me.

334
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,700
The way to him

335
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,900
is around your wrist.

336
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,500
Don't forget

337
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,380
that the Love Knot

338
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,130
has tied your primordial spirit with his.

339
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:51,930
Yeah.

340
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,600
You reminded me.

341
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,460
With the Love Knot,

342
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,050
I can track Chu Kong down.

343
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,530
[Mystery Forest]

344
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,860
I know where he is.

345
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,920
Mystery Forest.

346
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,820
He's in the Mystery Forest.

347
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,500
Mystery Forest?

348
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,400
That forest doesn't belong to any of the six realms

349
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,890
and is full of vicious demons.

350
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,920
What is His Divinity doing there?

351
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,590
I don't know why he's there.

352
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,010
Anyway,

353
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,430
I'll go find him.

354
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,260
What?

355
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,860
Out of the question!

356
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,980
You're too young.

357
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,620
You have no idea how dangerous that place is.

358
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,980
It's brimming with ferocious demons.

359
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,020
Since the day it came into being,

360
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,540
immortals in the Heave Realm have been banned from going there.

361
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,260
You can't go there.

362
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,800
No matter how dangerous it is,

363
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,000
I have to find him.

364
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:00,670
Fine.

365
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,900
Let's say you were lucky

366
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,700
and made it into the Mystery Forest.

367
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
You're so weak.

368
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,460
Aren't you afraid of becoming

369
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,540
the demons' prey?

370
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,740
You can't go there.

371
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,740
I'm not afraid.

372
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,560
We promised

373
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,840
to live or die together

374
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,340
and never be apart.

375
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,500
I know you and His Divinity

376
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,240
love each other dearly.

377
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,500
It's not like you'll listen to me.

378
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,750
It's true what they say:

379
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,430
children are debts to pay.

380
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,670
Detoxifying Pills.

381
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,740
Thunder Balls.

382
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,540
Hypnotic Powder.

383
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,420
Invisibility Charm.

384
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,020
Take them with you.

385
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,780
Take all of them with you.

386
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,590
Especially this Disguising Hairpin.

387
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,620
Take it.

388
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,220
I got it from a fox demon

389
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,090
when I traveled around the martial world.

390
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,150
With this Disguising Hairpin on you,

391
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,030
everyone will take you as a demon.

392
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,820
It'll make things easier for you in the Mystery Forest.

393
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,030
Remember.

394
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,810
You must not

395
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,860
take off that hairpin.

396
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,300
I got it.

397
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,680
Thank you.

398
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,580
The Mystery Forest

399
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,930
is very dangerous.

400
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,830
You must take good care of yourself.

401
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,660
Keep in mind

402
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,660
that in the Heaven Realm,

403
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,230
I'll be waiting for you to come back.

404
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,540
Red Thread Master.

405
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,610
I'll be fine.

406
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,680
Take good care of yourself.

407
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,910
I'm leaving.

408
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,660
I've given you all the treasures I have.

409
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,400
I hope this time,

410
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,030
you can come back safe and sound.

411
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,110
[Chu Kong]

412
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,690
Your Majesty, drink.

413
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,620
Drink it, Your Majesty.

414
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,340
Your Majesty.

415
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,250
The thing I asked you to do,

416
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,500
how did it go?

417
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,150
Your Majesty.

418
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,310
I've asked Elder Kuanglong.

419
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,750
He said

420
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,630
it's too early for you to have the Power of the Demon King.

421
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,140
Elder Kuanglong

422
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,880
is still so tactless.

423
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:00,250
He thinks having a hereditary title

424
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,770
gives him the right to stand against me.

425
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,780
I'm the Demon King.

426
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,070
Why can't I have the Power of the Demon King?

427
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,040
Please spare my life, Your Majesty.

428
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,530
Please spare my life.

429
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,220
Your Majesty.

430
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:17,740
Calm down.

431
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,980
And you!

432
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,980
Do you also think I don't deserve

433
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,520
to have the Power of the Demon King?

434
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,300
Your Majesty, spare me.

435
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,900
Who the hell are you?

436
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,600
I came to teach you a lesson.

437
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,720
As the Demon King,

438
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,910
you're bloodthirsty

439
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,210
and killed your own kind.

440
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,820
As the Demon King,

441
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,890
killing a few demons is not a big deal.

442
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,260
Since demons worship power,

443
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,910
I'll let you know

444
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,430
what

445
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,540
karma means.

446
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,330
Your Majesty.

447
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,730
[Demon King's Mansion]

448
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,480
You killed Black Eagle King.

449
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,720
According to the rules of the Mystery Forest,

450
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,740
the Demon King

451
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,920
is the strongest demon.

452
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,800
From today onwards,

453
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,340
[Elder Kuanglong]

454
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,780
you're the Sixth Demon King

455
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,500
of the Mystery Forest.

456
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,750
Greetings, Your Majesty.

457
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,580
Rise.

458
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,290
Elder Kuanglong.

459
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,420
You're

460
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,760
very famous

461
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,550
among demons.

462
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,730
Today,

463
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,680
[Elder Buwen]

464
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,080
I finally had the honor to meet you.

465
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,500
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

466
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,960
I

467
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,630
am just an elder.

468
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,570
I follow orders

469
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,790
and do what I should do.

470
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:21,850
Really?

471
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,970
What if I want the Power of the Demon King?

472
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,820
Your Majesty.

473
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,300
You just ascended the throne.

474
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,230
What's the rush?

475
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,490
When the time comes,

476
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,500
I will

477
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,550
give the Power of the Demon King

478
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,670
to you.

479
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,070
The Mystery Forest has existed

480
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,580
for over 30,000 years.

481
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,700
It's still impregnable,

482
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,110
thanks to the rule set by the first Demon King, the Scorpion King.

483
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,290
He made an elder

484
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,760
in charge of the Power of the Demon King

485
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,760
to constrain the Demon King

486
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,510
from growing too powerful.

487
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,030
Elder Kuanglong.

488
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,000
You did a great job.

489
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,630
Your Majesty.

490
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,680
Elder Kuanglong's loyalty

491
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,500
is indisputable.

492
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,530
Really?

493
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,350
Then why did none of the Demon Kings

494
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,030
after the Scorpion King

495
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,460
get the Power of the Demon King?

496
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,330
Some ignorant demons

497
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,300
insist that Elder Kuanglong

498
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,610
is hogging the Power of the Demon King

499
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,310
and wouldn't give it over.

500
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,690
Nonsense.

501
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,620
I

502
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,710
never thought about that.

503
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,350
That's slander.

504
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:54,970
Your Majesty.

505
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,660
Elder Kuanglong once made an oath.

506
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,920
If he ever wants the Power for himself,

507
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,900
his primordial spirit will perish.

508
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,020
Then why is it that none of the Demon Kings

509
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,600
after the Scorpion King

510
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,280
have ever

511
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,140
been given the Power of the Demon King?

512
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,360
So

513
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,670
you're provoking me

514
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,040
to find out the truth behind it.

515
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,050
I'm all ears.

516
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,070
Back then,

517
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,940
demons were the basest of all creatures

518
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,290
and despised by all the six realms.

519
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,260
The Scorpion King built the Mystery Forest

520
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,240
with someone's help

521
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,830
and set a magical barrier

522
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,270
to keep other clans out.

523
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,870
The Scorpion King's contribution

524
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,180
to the Demon Clan is enormous.

525
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,030
With that magical barrier,

526
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,900
even the Heavenly Clan

527
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,080
can't easily get into the Mystery Forest.

528
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,620
The more powerful the immortal is,

529
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,760
the more damage will be done to them

530
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,150
after they enter the Mystery Forest.

531
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,890
They'll get injured at best.

532
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,850
Their primordial spirits will perish at worst.

533
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,120
That's how the Demon Clan

534
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,030
can live without being disturbed.

535
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,990
You're right.

536
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,980
After the Scorpion King built the Mystery Forest,

537
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,330
demons' lives

538
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,600
as wanderers ended.

539
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,630
But unexpectedly,

540
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,600
the cat demons

541
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,230
tried to destroy the magical barrier

542
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,930
for their own interests.

543
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,700
To protect the Mystery Forest,

544
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,980
the Scorpion King

545
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,080
died to keep the barrier intact.

546
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,460
The Kings

547
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,170
after him were strong enough

548
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,820
to take the throne

549
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,800
but not wise enough to rule.

550
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,540
How could I hand over the Power of the Demon King

551
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,650
to them?

552
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,870
I'm different

553
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,820
from them.

554
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,920
Yes.

555
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,140
When I look at you,

556
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,400
I see hope.

557
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,330
But now

558
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,929
is not the time to give you

559
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:16,830
the Power of the Demon King.

560
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,080
Why?

561
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,310
Because to use the Power of the Demon King,

562
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,900
you have to pay a huge price.

563
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,010
Elder Kuanglong.

564
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,380
What is the price?

565
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,040
You can't love again.

566
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,850
You have to

567
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,810
forget those you love.

568
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,489
I never loved anyone.

569
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,900
Give it to me.

570
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,470
I

571
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,380
can't tell

572
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,840
whether you're telling the truth

573
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,350
or not.

574
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,490
Elder Kuanglong.

575
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,910
Take your time

576
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,840
to find out if I'm qualified to have the Power of the Demon King.

577
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,840
Your Holiness.

578
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,560
You summoned me.

579
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,190
What can I do for you?

580
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,230
Chu Kong's demise

581
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,420
broke my heart.

582
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,020
Fuyuan Fairy in your Marriage Pavilion

583
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,110
was very close

584
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,950
to Chu Kong.

585
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,630
How is she taking it?

586
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,940
Your Holiness.

587
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,420
Now that you mention it,

588
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,760
I've been so worried about her.

589
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,760
What do you mean?

590
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,300
After His Divinity passed away,

591
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,850
I searched every inch of the Heaven Realm

592
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,230
but couldn't find her.

593
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,700
Maybe

594
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,400
she's too sad

595
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,480
and hiding somewhere reminiscing.

596
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,120
It seems that Fuyuan Fairy

597
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,070
loves

598
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,580
Chu Kong deeply.

599
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,980
We should tell His Holiness

600
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,490
and let him decide what to do.

601
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,220
Red Thread Master.

602
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,090
Think about it.

603
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,680
Chu Kong was the God of War.

604
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,460
He was assassinated in the Heaven Realm.

605
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,560
It means

606
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,480
that the person who wanted him dead

607
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,850
is very powerful.

608
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,220
Your Holiness.

609
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,650
She's just a 3,000-year-old fairy

610
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,280
who doesn't know much about magic.

611
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,100
Other than crying,

612
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,930
there's nothing much she can do.

613
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,730
Once she returns to the Marriage Pavilion,

614
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,420
let me know.

615
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:20,630
Yes.

616
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,830
That fairy

617
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:24,440
was very close to Chu Kong.

618
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,190
As Chu Kong's brother,

619
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,990
I should do something for her.

620
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,120
Let me thank you on her behalf.

621
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,390
You may leave.

622
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,090
Your Holiness.

623
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,360
[Demon King's Mansion]

624
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:56,970
Today,

625
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,580
the sixth Demon King of the Mystery Forest took the throne.

626
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:02,830
All of you

627
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,960
shall follow his orders

628
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,220
and spare no effort

629
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,720
to serve him.

630
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,590
Your Majesty.

631
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,780
We swear allegiance to you!

632
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,470
Rise.

633
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

634
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,140
Rise.

635
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,260
His Majesty took the throne today.

636
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,000
It's a big joyous event in the Mystery Forest.

637
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,370
Your Majesty,

638
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,980
I prepared a gift for you.

639
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:34,930
[Xiangyun]

640
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,410
My name is Xiangyun.

641
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,970
Greetings, Your Majesty.

642
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,900
Who is she?

643
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,370
What an unpleasant sight.
