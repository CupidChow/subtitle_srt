13

18
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,660
My friend!

19
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,540
What took you so long?

20
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,680
The antidote.

21
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,700
You really found it?

22
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,630
Is someone following you?

23
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,590
Follow me.

24
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,980
What happened?

25
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,040
Take the antidote now.

26
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,260
Here.

27
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,100
I'm done.

28
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,100
Tell me now.

29
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,160
Since I began my travels,

30
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,090
I've taken on the responsibility of slaying devils.

31
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,550
I have a deep grudge

32
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,450
with that Demon Clan.

33
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,380
Now, they've swarmed out

34
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,560
and vow to kill me.

35
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,620
My friend.

36
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,190
You're so formidable

37
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,390
that the Demon Clan is hunting you down.

38
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,590
Although you are powerful,

39
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,900
you're outnumbered.

40
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,350
I'm afraid they won't be easy to deal with.

41
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,150
I'm not worried about myself.

42
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,090
I'm afraid of getting you involved.

43
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,270
I'm afraid that when they see you with me,

44
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,260
they'll think we're working together

45
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,589
and that you'll be implicated.

46
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,079
So for the time being,

47
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,630
I'm afraid you'll have to

48
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,940
stay here despite the inconvenience.

49
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,130
But it's okay.

50
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,530
Once I've dealt with them,

51
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,990
you can leave at anytime.

52
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,960
My friend.

53
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,790
At such a time,

54
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,480
I won't leave even if you tell me to.

55
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,650
Just let them come.

56
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,470
I'd like to see

57
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,490
who's

58
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,720
asking for their death.

59
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,970
In that case,

60
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,600
you agree to stay here temporarily, right?

61
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,270
You don't have to be so polite.

62
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,880
You saved my life.

63
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,020
But...

64
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,860
I have a question,

65
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,170
that I don't know if I should ask.

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,920
Didn't you say that

67
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,190
there are few people who can hurt you in this world?

68
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,980
How could a powerful person like you

69
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,800
have left a trace

70
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,630
and let someone track you all the way here?

71
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,390
Or

72
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,730
did you intentionally let them discover you

73
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,110
to let these little demons come all the way here,

74
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,760
so that I will stay

75
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,440
and fight the enemy with you?

76
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,909
Am I right?

77
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,100
I...

78
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,310
No.

79
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,780
Anyway...

80
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,659
He is...

81
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,640
Did my sympathy ploy just now

82
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,630
fail?

83
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,590
Although your sympathy ploy

84
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,860
failed,

85
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,720
you knew...

86
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,550
to use a counterattack as defense,

87
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,100
which shows that you've grasped the essence.

88
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,810
It's nothing compared to

89
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,570
your self-produced act of the Hero Saving the Beauty ploy.

90
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,480
My...

91
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,180
My Hero Saving the Beauty ploy

92
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,100
wouldn't have worked

93
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,730
without your cooperation.

94
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,100
I wonder if

95
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,370
you'd still be willing to

96
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,340
act along with me?

97
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,490
Previously, you said this.

98
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,480
You said,

99
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,820
"Then, I, a humble lady,

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,640
will marry you

101
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,600
to repay you for saving my life."

102
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,130
I...

103
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:21,980
Then...

104
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,160
Then you...

105
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,650
What about me?

106
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,900
If you're going along with me,

107
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,980
aren't you curious

108
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,470
about my identity?

109
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,760
You...

110
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,140
You...

111
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,610
You...

112
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,950
When you were trying to lure me,

113
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,100
you didn't ask me about my identity either.

114
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,090
I knew my judgment is never wrong.

115
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,790
We are a perfect match indeed.

116
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,430
That's why we didn't care about anything else.

117
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,110
Yes.

118
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,910
I was the one who took a liking for

119
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,210
such a young and heavenly man

120
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,960
who came to save me like a hero.

121
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,180
I don't care about your identity

122
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,220
or your background.

123
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,020
I don't care about all that.

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,190
What I like

125
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,420
is...

126
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,160
how witty and playful you are.

127
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,240
I don't care if you're an ancient deity

128
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,140
or...

129
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,340
or a little Flower Spirit.

130
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,930
I just like you.

131
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,000
I just like you.

132
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,350
♫The moonlight must be you♫

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,460

♫Actually yearning for me to cherish or delete them♫

♫I dare not ask, so let me be half awake♫

166
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,460
Not bad.

167
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,360
This sword technique that I taught you

168
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,240
has been refined for at least 500 years.

169
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,520
If you master this move,

170
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,070
I'll be able to

171
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,640
take our future sword fights more seriously.

172
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,310
You arrogant brat!

173
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:19,800
Take this!

174
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,120
Since I taught you this move,

175
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,180
how are you going to thank me?

176
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,180
Since you taught me swordsmanship,

177
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,250
I'll teach you something else.

178
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,500
It seems like there's something

179
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,440
you can't do in this world.

180
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,490
What's the point of learning this?

181
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,980
You can't fight or defend yourself with this.

182
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,580
What's the use?

183
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,010
My father

184
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,250
taught me how to play the Xun.

185
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,370
He said that

186
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,830
the sound of the Xun

187
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,230
is reminiscent of seeing an old friend.

188
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,500
Since my parents passed away,

189
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,340
whenever I miss them,

190
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,340
I'd play the Xun.

191
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,990
You have me by your side from now on.

192
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,620
I...

193
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,220
Who is the letter from?

194
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,300
It's from my brother.

195
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,520
What does it say?

196
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,440
Why does it seem like

197
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,090
you're unhappy?

198
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,370
He asked me to go home.

199
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,270
Isn't that a good thing?

200
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,010
Don't tell me

201
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,440
he's getting you home for a blind date?

202
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,010
See for yourself.

203
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,340
Visit the Moluo Empress?

204
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,900
Only the young masters of every clan

205
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,310
are able to receive an invitation at this time

206
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,250
to visit the Moluo Divine Clan.

207
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,190
Don't tell me

208
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,330
he's the Second Prince of the Qilin Divine Clan

209
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,750
whom the Protector has been nagging about?

210
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,960
What a coincidence.

211
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,250
Don't misunderstand.

212
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,760
I didn't.

213
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,770
Doesn't your brother's letter state that

214
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,330
he wants to head to the Moluo Divine Clan with you

215
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,510
to pay a visit to the Moluo Empress?

216
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,960
Don't worry.

217
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,350
I will never go to meet

218
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,900
that Moluo Empress.

219
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,340
But I heard

220
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,520
this Moluo Empress

221
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,540
is young, beautiful,

222
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,780
and of a respectable status.

223
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,800
If she likes you

224
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,930
and you become the emperor consort,

225
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,910
wouldn't that be a major upgrade of your status?

226
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,980
Can you really bear to let this opportunity

227
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,920
go to waste?

228
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,250
Don't think too much.

229
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,320
I have no feelings or whatsoever

230
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,300
towards the Moluo Empress.

231
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,150
I heard that

232
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,920
she ascended the throne when she was young.

233
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:07,730
Think about it.

234
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,370
She deals with those boring political affairs every day.

235
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,600
She must be a rigid, boring,

236
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,750
domineering,

237
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,050
cunning and unreasonable person.

238
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,440
I will never like such a person.

239
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,020
How...

240
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,190
How do you know that the Moluo Empress

241
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,220
is a rigid, boring,

242
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,480
domineering,

243
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,300
cunning and unreasonable person?

244
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,220
What if she's not that kind of person?

245
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,270
I swear

246
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,720
I will never go to meet the Moluo Empress.

247
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,120
I've always hated being bound since I was young.

248
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:43,450
I don't want to be some foolish emperor consort!

249
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,750
Are you dreaming of becoming the emperor consort?

250
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,320
Moluo Empress might not

251
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,510
even like you.

252
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,260
She doesn't like me,

253
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,280
and I don't like her.

254
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,670
It's just right. End of discussion.

255
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,090
Why...

256
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,810
are you angry?

257
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,850
Am I angry?

258
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,690
I'm not angry.

259
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,370
You're angry right now.

260
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,940
I'm not angry.

261
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,980
You are.

262
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,510
No!

263
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:10,840
No?

264
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,690
No?

265
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,250
I can still sense

266
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,220
the faint remnants of the divine power here.

267
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,810
The Empress must have used her divine power here.

268
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,390
In that case,

269
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,500
everyone, search immediately.

270
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,110
Don't miss any possible trace.

271
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,750
We must find Cang Hai as soon as possible.

272
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,050
Go and search ahead now.

273
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,690
Yes.

274
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,610
Your Highness.

275
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,180
I’d better have someone send you back to the palace.

276
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,360
As for the search of Empress,

277
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,790
don't worry and just leave it to me.

278
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,670
I know my own health

279
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,740
the best.

280
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,980
As long as Cang Hai isn't found,

281
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,720
I'll never be at peace.

282
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,290
Even if I go back,

283
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,550
I won't feel at ease either.

284
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,450
You don't have to dissuade me anymore.

285
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,690
Your Highness.

286
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:24,950
How am I rigid?

287
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,700
How am I boring?

288
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,880
How am I domineering?

289
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,580
How am I cunning and unreasonable?

290
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,830
I think that brat

291
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,640
is blind.

292
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,640
How about

293
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,560
I tell this silly boy the truth?

294
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,740
Actually,

295
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,210
I am the Moluo Empress.

296
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,210
Well...

297
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,220
Actually, I'm...

298
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,010
I've replied my brother's letter.

299
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,320
I told him

300
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,380
I met a woman I love.

301
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,140
I will never go to the Moluo Palace

302
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,450
to pay my respects to the Moluo Empress.

303
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,380
Actually, the main thing

304
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,760
is just that

305
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,570
I'm too handsome.

306
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,090
Tell me.

307
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,830
If that Moluo Empress

308
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,170
fell in love with me at first sight,

309
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,220
that would be the biggest problem.

310
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,750
You shameless brat.

311
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,900
I'll make you eat your words.

312
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,840
Do you know?

313
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,930
Traveling around the six realms

314
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,010
and slaying devils

315
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,450
has been my ambition since I was little.

316
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,930
But actually, in my heart,

317
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,770
I have another hidden wish.

318
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,770
In the vast world

319
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,970
with countless people,

320
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,210
I've been looking for someone.

321
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,170
Now,

322
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,590
I think I've found her.

323
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,290
So

324
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,970
you have this feeling too.

325
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,520
When I first met you,

326
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,670
I've already felt like

327
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,280
we've known each other for a long time.

328
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:39,690
I...

329
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:41,970
A meteor?

330
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,900
They say that if you make a wish to a meteor,

331
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,540
your wish will come true.

332
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,770
Tonight,

333
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,970
let's trust that myth for once.

334
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:53,810
Here.

335
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,850
In this lifetime...

336
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,440
I hope we will

337
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,890
be together at all times

338
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,100
and never be apart.

339
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,680
Then, in this lifetime,

340
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,320
let's never be separated ever.

341
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,010
Okay.

342
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,970
From now on,

343
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,810
for tens of thousands of years,

344
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,980
forever and ever,

345
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,650
no matter what happens,

346
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,500
we will always be together.

347
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,410
Look.

348
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,450
Doesn't that cloud

349
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,210
look like a crabapple flower?

350
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,710
Now that you mention it,

351
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,370
it does look quite like it.

352
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,690
I once heard of a legend in the mortal world,

353
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,300
that after a person dies,

354
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,790
they turn into a star in the sky.

355
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,170
I don't want that.

356
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,250
As a star,

357
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,820
I'd only be able to come out at night after hiding all day. How boring.

358
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,160
If it were up to me,

359
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,220
I would want to be a cloud in the sky after I die.

360
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,210
I can

361
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,170
go wherever I want freely.

362
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,230
What are you talking about?

363
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,850
You...

364
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,020
have me around.

365
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,320
Who'd dare to hurt you?

366
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,360
All right.

367
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,690
I misspoke.

368
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,910
Then, let me ask you a question.

369
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,840
No matter who I am

370
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,390
or what I become,

371
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,060
will you always love me?

372
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,770
I always keep my word.

373
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,620
Remember this.

374
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,180
Don't regret it.

375
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,590
I won't give you a chance to regret.

376
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,580
I have never

377
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,370
regretted anything I've done in my life.

378
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,640
You didn't close your eyes just now when you made the wish.

379
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,540
Others close their eyes.

380
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,690
Make the wish again.

381
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,170
Under the name of the Qilin Divine Clan,

382
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,570
I, Chu Kong of the Qilin Divine Clan,

383
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,580
summon the power of the Star of War's primordial spirit

384
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,940
to protect the one I love.

385
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,360
♫You understand my love♫

386
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,910
♫Old stories are still spreading♫

387
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,170
♫The cycle of cause and effect has long been recorded♫

388
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,620
♫The red threads of fate intertwine♫

389
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,850
♫They brought us together and pulled us apart♫

390
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,270
♫My heart beat fast when I woke up from the dream♫

391
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,470
♫You were whispering in my ear♫

392
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,820
♫Our story didn't end in the past life♫

393
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,800
♫Let's start over♫

394
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,690
In this lifetime,

395
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,210
♫The joy is engraved in my mind♫

396
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,610
I will never turn my back on you.

397
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,180
♫Through the reincarnation of several lifetimes♫

398
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,460
♫I'll always be with you through thick and thin♫

399
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,000
♫Reunion is not a coincidence♫

400
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,880
♫It's my courage to come for you♫

401
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,090
♫You understand my love♫

402
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,140
♫I lived again and again just for you♫

403
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,390
♫I'm not afraid of hardships♫

404
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,930
♫I'm just afraid of losing you in the crowds♫

405
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,140
♫I don't care if this is right or wrong♫

406
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,630
♫You're the only answer I want♫

407
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,830
♫They say it's not worth it♫

408
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,240
♫But for love I'll do everything♫

409
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,310
♫For love♫

410
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,010
♫For love♫

411
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,370
Why is Father so biased?

412
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,200
I am the eldest son.

413
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,110
I should be the one deserving of the marriage with the Moluo Empress.

414
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,740
But he never once considered me.

415
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,800
Brother?

416
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,300
Why are you here?

417
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,210
How did you find me?

418
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,870
You brat.

419
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,700
I finally found you.

420
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,380
Did you refuse to go back

421
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,360
because

422
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,740
of this lady beside you?

423
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,010
Brother.

424
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,140
This is Xiaotang.

425
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,610
Xiaotang.

426
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,140
This is the elder brother I told you about.

427
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,420
Hello, Brother.

428
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,550
You two haven't seen each other for a long time.

429
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,010
You must have a lot to talk about.

430
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,690
I won't disturb you.

431
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,490
Then don't stand there, Brother.

432
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,290
Excuse me.

433
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,130
Let's go.

434
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,490
Go!

435
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,400
You brat.

436
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,930
Brother.

437
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,590
I've already told you in the letter that

438
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,550
Xiaotang and I have made our vows to be faithful to each other forever.

439
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,040
Your marriage

440
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,600
is a top priority of our Qilin Divine Clan.

441
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,360
How can you be so flippant about it?

442
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,510
The Moluo Empress is about your age.

443
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,930
She is the most respectable woman

444
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,520
in the six realms.

445
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,610
If you can marry her...

446
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,170
I can't hear you.

447
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,420
I can't hear you.

448
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,010
What marriage?

449
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,200
Didn't I make myself clear?

450
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,240
Reject it for me.

451
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,940
I will never go.

452
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,780
Stop messing around.

453
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,080
You are the future leader of the Qilin Divine Clan.

454
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,660
Your marriage is not up to you alone.

455
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,930
Your marriage with the Moluo Empress

456
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,150
is one of your responsibilities.

457
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,080
What clan leader?

458
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,530
Since ancient times, seniority has been valued.

459
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,050
Even if the marriage really has to happen,

460
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,950
you should be the one to do it.

461
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,320
I am older than you,

462
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,110
but you're a born Golden Qilin

463
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,690
with exceptional qualifications.

464
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,800
I believe

465
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,830
you will definitely lead the Qilin Divine Clan to glory.

466
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm also willing to support you.

467
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,620
Forget it.

468
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,160
I've never wanted that since I was a kid.

469
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,660
I hate complicated political affairs the most.

470
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,770
Besides,

471
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,770
as a Golden Qilin,

472
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,250
since I'm already engaged to Xiaotang,

473
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,490
as a member of the Qilin Divine Clan,

474
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,450
I can't possible do something treacherous.

475
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,980
But it's reasonable that you got engaged

476
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,420
in private?

477
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,440
I...

478
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,090
Have you ever thought about

479
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,190
how you're going to explain this to Father and Mother?

480
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,410
And you don't know the background

481
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,440
of that woman.

482
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,820
If you're not clear of that,

483
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,090
how do you know she's a worthy match for you?

484
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,530
I...

485
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,350
She's my wife.

486
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,860
It's fine as long as I like her.

487
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,440
If Father and Mother don't like her,

488
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,840
then I will

489
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,580
live in this mountain with her.

490
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,880
Who cares about her background?

491
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,920
Anyway, in this lifetime,

492
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,470
I've set my mind on her.

493
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,100
You're impossible.

494
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,450
I told you

495
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,490
I'll go back after I'm done with my affairs here.

496
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,100
What are you worried about?

497
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,860
It's not that we're worried.

498
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,890
But you said

499
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,800
that friend saved your life.

500
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,090
Then, he's the great benefactor of the Moluo Divine Clan.

501
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,130
We should thank him in person.

502
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,560
And you.

503
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,860
You are so weak.

504
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:41,960
Go back now.

505
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,290
Although I'm in poor health,

506
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,730
I'm not that weak yet.

507
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,960
You can rest assured.

508
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,750
Yes.

509
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,530
Since you left,

510
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,160
I’ve been anxious

511
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,470
all the time.

512
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,700
Also, Jin Lian and Jin Luo

513
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,200
have been looking forward to your return.

514
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,230
If you don't let me follow you,

515
00:28:59,250 --> 00:28:59,820
I'll really...

516
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,450
All right.

517
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,970
Xiaotang.

518
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,860
What's going on?

519
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,030
Who are you?

520
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,300
How dare you make a scene in my territory!

521
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
Xiaotang.

522
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,030
Is this

523
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,480
the friend you mentioned?

524
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,970
Yes.

525
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,290
Who are they?

526
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,500
He's Uncle Jin.

527
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,420
He's my butler.

528
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,160
He's Xiu Ming,

529
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:32,850
my brother.

530
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,510
He's very close to me.

531
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,800
Your brother?

532
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,120
Wait...

533
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,990
That's not right.

534
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,370
Don't you not have siblings?

535
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,030
This...

536
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,440
I'm not Xiaotang's brother.

537
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,170
Xiaotang and I grew up together.

538
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,060
Thank you

539
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,650
for taking care of Xiaotang during this time.

540
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,300
Aren't you going to introduce me to them?

541
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,920
I forgot to introduce.

542
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,290
This is my life savior,

543
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:05,920
Chu Kong.

544
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,160
And fiancé.

545
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,560
Please pardon me.

546
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,900
Marriage

547
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,710
is decided by a family's elders.

548
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,580
I'm afraid one-sided empty words from you

549
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,940
don't count.

550
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,480
Whether that counts is between us.

551
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,120
Today,

552
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,980
if you're here as her family,

553
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,690
I'll naturally welcome you.

554
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,890
Coincidentally, my brother is also here.

555
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,790
Consider it

556
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,260
as a family meeting of the in-laws.

557
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,770
But if you have any other ideas,

558
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,930
then don't blame me for being rude.

559
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,690
All right.

560
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,230
Yes.

561
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,420
Chu Kong and I

562
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,780
have been engaged.

563
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,910
How can your marriage be decided so hastily?

564
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,300
Why don't we go back and discuss it again?

565
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,690
Jin Lian and Jin Luo

566
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,070
have been looking forward to your return.

567
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:53,960
Yes.

568
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,400
Jin Lian and Jin Luo's health

569
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,630
can't be maintained without Uncle Jin.

570
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,170
But Uncle Jin was worried about

571
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,170
you being alone outside.

572
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,530
It left him in a dilemma.

573
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,870
Even if it's just for Jin Lian and Jin Luo's health,

574
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,410
you should go back as soon as possible.

575
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,370
If it's really necessary,

576
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,260
I can go back with you.

577
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,880
You are the one who volunteered.

578
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,170
I...

579
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,430
Do you have guests?

580
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,280
Brother.

581
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,970
Who are they?

582
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,230
They are Xiaotang's family.

583
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,500
My younger brother, Chu Kong,

584
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,840
and Miss Xiaotang fell in love with each other.

585
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,980
They are a perfect match.

586
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,240
If they can get married,

587
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,070
it would be a beautiful and praiseworthy story.

588
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,250
From now on, we are family.

589
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,490
Don't just stand around here.

590
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,210
Come in and have a seat.

591
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,670
Let's go.

592
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,450
Then,

593
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,040
we'll...

594
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,860
take on the offer.

595
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:14,370
Is he

596
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,500
really the one you want to entrust your life to?

597
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,100
Since I met him,

598
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,450
I realized

599
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,910
how it felt

600
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,320
to like someone.

601
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,320
The time I've spent with him

602
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,170
has been the happiest time in my life.

603
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,300
But

604
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,050
you've only known each other for a short time.

605
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,050
Maybe

606
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,920
these are just temporary feelings of novelty.

607
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,410
Maybe, after a while,

608
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,500
you'd get tired of this place

609
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,410
and would want to...

610
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,880
I can't be wrong.

611
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,060
Just like how I feel about you,

612
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,110
which is the feelings of kinship between friends that grew up together.

613
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,190
To me,

614
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,620
you're family and one of the most important people.

615
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,530
But he...

616
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,290
is different.

617
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,690
I knew you were here.

618
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,600
Since you were young,

619
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,670
whenever you were unhappy,

620
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,050
you liked to be alone.

621
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,650
But in the blink of an eye,

622
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,530
you've grown up

623
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,450
and have become independent.

624
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,870
You even dare to decide on

625
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,620
your own marriage.

626
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:35,970
Brother.

627
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,580
Are you really sure about Miss Xiaotang?

628
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,250
Of course.

629
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,230
Even if her identity is unknown,

630
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,489
you'll still only marry her?

631
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,010
Since you said so,

632
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,920
as your brother,

633
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,469
if I don't help you,

634
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,630
how am I different from those jerks

635
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:26,900
who deliberately break up other lovers?

636
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,330
Brother.

637
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,810
Do you mean...

638
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,080
I will plead with Father and Mother

639
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:40,440
on your behalf.

640
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,690
But you have to promise me one thing.

641
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,210
Go ahead.

642
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,770
I'll promise you anything.

643
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,949
Come with me to the Moluo Palace

644
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,620
to pay your respects to the Moluo Empress.

645
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,270
Brother.

646
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,390
We've already talked about that.

647
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,690
I'm not going.

648
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:01,030
I'm not asking you to go to the Moluo Palace to get married.

649
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,450
But

650
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,870
since the Moluo Divine Clan

651
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,240
has already sent an invitation to the Qilin Divine Clan,

652
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,260
we have to be accountable for it.

653
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,320
Otherwise,

654
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,390
if enmity forms between the two clans

655
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,780
and the blame has to be accounted for,

656
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,060
it'll not be a responsibility that you and I can bear.

657
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,090
Don't worry.

658
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,980
When we get to the Moluo Palace,

659
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,250
act cautiously,

660
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:22,960
and I'll

661
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,980
handle everything for you.

662
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,350
But if

663
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,100
you aren't even willing to go,

664
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,050
Father will realize that

665
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,170
I'm protecting you in secret.

666
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,570
How can I explain

667
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,930
to Father and Mother then?

668
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,450
Fine.

669
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,730
For this matter, I...

670
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,940
I have to discuss it with Xiaotang.

671
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,040
I didn't expect

672
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,960
the great and fearless

673
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,770
Second Prince of the Qilin Divine Clan...

674
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,810
to be a henpecked husband.

675
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,970
Go to s-s-sleep.

676
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,490
Go. Go.

677
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,430
Well...

678
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,350
Xiu Ming.

679
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,660
I've never felt this way before.

680
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:28,810
Since

681
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,140
you like him so much,

682
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,080
for now,

683
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,790
let's bring him back to the Moluo Palace.

684
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,850
But whether he's qualified to be your emperor consort

685
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,490
will be decided upon further consideration.

686
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,330
I have my own plans.

687
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,970
Go back and rest first.

688
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,110
I'll go and be right back...

689
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:04,900
I...

690
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,740
-I have something to tell you.
-I have something to tell you.

691
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,720
You go first.

692
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,360
I may have to pay a visit to the Moluo Palace.

693
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,340
But don't worry.

694
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,080
I'm just accompanying my brother as a mere formality.

695
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,380
I won't let the Moluo Empress

696
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,280
take a liking to me.

697
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,030
I trust you.

698
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,770
It's just right.

699
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,500
I have to go home with Uncle Jin too.

700
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,910
It's been a while since I've been out.

701
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,970
I can't always let my family worry about me.

702
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,010
Besides, I have to inform

703
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,990
my family back home about our marriage.

704
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,940
After I return from the Moluo Palace,

705
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,890
I'll officially visit your family to make a marriage proposal.

706
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,090
Where do you live?

707
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,910
After I go home

708
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,890
and tell my family about our marriage,

709
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,390
I'll contact you again.

710
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,070
By then,

711
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,660
you can visit my family to make a marriage proposal.

712
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,250
Okay.

713
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,810
Rest early then.

714
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,650
What's wrong?

715
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,500
After this parting,

716
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,070
I don't know how long it'd be before we can see each other again.

717
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,130
I can't perceive

718
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,610
any signs of sadness on your face.

719
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,460
Maybe it won't be long

720
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,960
before we can meet again.

721
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,800
What are you doing?

722
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,740
All right.

723
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,140
Don't think too much.

724
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,550
Go back and rest.

725
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,660
Okay.

726
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,850
Go to bed early.

727
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,160
You too.

728
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,620
We're about to present ourselves before the Empress.

729
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:53,990
When we enter the main hall later,

730
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,290
don't gaze around.

731
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,370
Remember that.

732
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,650
Got it.

733
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,330
The young masters of the Qilin Divine Clan, please present yourselves.

734
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

735
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,450
Rise.
