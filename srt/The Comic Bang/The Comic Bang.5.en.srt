00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,430
Good.

00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,229
I'm already 52 seconds late.

4
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,509
I want him to know that

5
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,830
I'm still angry.

6
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,190
I wouldn't have agreed to go shopping

7
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,370
if it weren't to show that
I'm the bigger man.

8
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,670
I don't care

9
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,790
about this date at all.

10
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,190
You're here.

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,270
Let's go.

12
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,670
Am I angry?

13
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,750
Should I be angrier?

14
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,790
I hope I can buy you

15
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,990
a gift you like today.

16
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,150
You want to buy me a gift?

17
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:44,550
Yes.

18
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,190
Is this a gesture to ask for my forgiveness?

19
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,830
Of course it is.

20
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,230
It's definitely for material collecting.

21
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,830
What do you think?

22
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,870
It's cute.

23
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,630
It suits you.

Did you really see it?

26
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,829
I tried on the belt.

27
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,350
Is it that easy to chase me?

28
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,870
Zuo Qiandai,

29
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,670
I also found these clothes.

30
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,470
Help me try them on.

31
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,240

32
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,350
This is what you call chasing a girl.

He's really patient.

34
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,590
I think

35
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,590
it's perfect to be Mei's archetype.

36
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,990
A loving couple.

37
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,870
What a sweet couple.

38
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,680
But my favorite

39
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,310
is this one.

40
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,110
I think it suits you very well.

41
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,710
You have to try it on.

42
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,230
What a subtle couple.

43
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,990
After you put it on,

44
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,990
remember to take some photos for me.

45

Where has the dignity of

She's always targetting
our men's basketball team.

How could we live a life like this?

but only hits people.

and dare not come out.

enough players for a match.

You can't count on me.

100
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,950
from what I imagined.

101
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,630
And my waistline.

102
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,070
My waistline is fine.

103

If you want the material of sailor suits,

108
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,950
just search for pictures online.

109

There's no need to be this insistent.

110
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,030
The photos and videos online

111
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,000
have no texture.

112
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,550
You don't have to be so accurate.

113
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,030
Just... Just artify it.

114

a person in real life wearing a sailor suit,

118
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,510
I'll be inspired in a different way.

119
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,390
Forget it.

120
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,030
I'll buy it.

121
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,150
First, for the comic he loves,

122
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,710
he transformed into Mei himself.

123
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,950
Now in order to restore the real world,

124
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,990
he devoted himself.

125
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,430
That's the selfless spirit to devote himself

126
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,150
as a cartoonist.

on my back.

130
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,390
Come and help me.

132
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,550

We've been shopping for so long,

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,280
but I didn't even buy you a gift.

Is it not here?

157
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,480
Can you help me put on a sailor suit?

158
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,720
Are you mocking me?

159
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,070
Is it not allowed

160

161

Mocking?

167
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,750
With nothing on.

168
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,910
Completely naked?

169
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,040
It doesn't even have facial features.

170
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,880
Are you talking about mannequins?

171
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,130
You don't understand.

172
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,720
Garage Kits

00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,470

174
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,310
one's taste and aesthetics.

175
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,750
Look at the details,

176
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,990
completely replicating the character.

177
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,110

This...

179
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,950
This is a piece of art.

180
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,710
That makes sense.

181
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,690
I'll pick one, too.

182
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,320
This one is good.

If I can break it off...

187
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,870
Don't be so heartless.

188
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,710
I'll go and look over there.

189
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,390
What?

190
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,190
Why did you change your bowknot?

191
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,720
Where is your previous one?

192
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,910
In my bag.

193
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,830
Here.

194
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,770
White dots on red base.

195
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,120
It's really white dots on red base.

196
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,110
What's wrong?

197
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,390
Ye Qi insisted that

198
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,990
your bowknot have white dots on red base.

199
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,630
I said it was the other way around.

200
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,090
It seems that he was right.

201
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,990
He remembers my bowknot
has white dots on red base?

202
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,790
What's wrong?

203
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,990
Why do you look so sleepy?

204
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,590
You have bags under your eyes.

205
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,920
It's all because of you.

206
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,190
Why were you in a bad mood?

207
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,550
Ye Qi forced me

208
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,270
to play girls' games with him all night.

209
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,270
He wanted to know how to cheer you up.

210
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,310
That's why he asked me
to come to the mall?

211
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,030
Or what?

212
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,810
Do you think he's here
to collect materials?

213
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,620
I didn't know Ye Qi cares so much

214
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,080
about you, his assistant.

215
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,950
I'm a little...

216
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,950
Let me ask you.

217
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,390
Can the taste of Garage Kits

218
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,270
really show one's preference?

219
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,910
Of course.

220
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,880
What kind of Garage Kits
will Ye Qi choose?

221
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,150
Will it be the same as me?

222
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,040
I've made my choice.

223
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,550
This one.

224
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,730
It can be a reference of Lin Mu.

225
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,310
Let's go.

226
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't figure it out. So confusing.

227
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,430
I can't figure out
what Jieyue is thinking.

228
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,350
How should I negotiate with her?

229
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,230
[Senior Jieyue]

230
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,310
Maybe there are
negotiation skills with girls

231
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,240
in girls' comics.

232
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,440
Writing a letter?

233
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,830
That makes sense.

234
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,950
How about copying it?

235
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,070
Jieyue.

236
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,470
The men's basketball team
asked me to give it to you.

237
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,000
The men's basketball team?

238
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,350
A challenge letter?

239
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,790
Look at this cover.

240
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,190
Maybe it's a love letter.

241
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,310
Why is it so pink?

242
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,300
[To Senior Jieyue]

243
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,430
Read it.

244
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,490
[ After training, I'll wait for you on the dorm rooftop.
You have to come. I'll always wait for you.]

245
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,270
After training,

246
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,350
I'll wait for you on the dorm rooftop.

247
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,030
You have to come.

248
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,870
I'll always

249
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,790
wait for you.

250
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,390
See? I told you it's a love letter.

251
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,110
I'd like to see

252
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,830
who is so bold.

253
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,120
The training is over today.

254
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,230
It hasn't started yet.

255
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,970
You didn't expect me

256
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,290
to be the one who asked you out, right?

257
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,710
Senior Jieyue.

258
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,830
Indeed, I didn't expect that...

259
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,710
your handwriting would be so chubby.

260
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,840
Are you an elementary school student?

261
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,830
There's something

262
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,430
I've long wanted to tell you.

263
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,770
You know what I want to say, right?

264
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,950
Of course.

265
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,830
It's time to give you a nickname.

266
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,030
What?

267
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,070
Not even close.

268
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,750
I was about to talk about basketball.

269
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,280
About the basketball club.

270
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,430
Right.

271
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,790
We've been dissing back and forth happily.

272
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,790
Basketball is nothing like this.

273
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,910
Besides, you're the only one

274
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,310
who hits people with a basketball.

275
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,710
I don't care if you're
the devil of the basketball club,

276
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,710
or the boxer of
the women's basketball club.

277
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,590
No matter what, can you be more aware?

278
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,870
We all feel troubled.

279
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,830
From now on,

280
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,030
don't show up in front of
the men's basketball team again.

281
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,350
Was I too harsh?

282
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,750
Even it was to Senior Jieyue,

283
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,150
I shouldn't be like this.

284
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,550
Your name is Jiang Ruosong.

285
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,390
Then I'll call you Song.

286
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,110
Were you listening to me?

287
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,270
Hey.

288
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,620
Why have you always bullied me?

289
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,590
You've always bullied me!

290
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,270
Have I?

291
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,190
Yes, you have.

292
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,830
You always hit my face with the ball.

293
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,630
You never let me off during my break.

294
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,590
You kept pestering me after training

295
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,950
and always dragged me to eat.

296
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,710
You also held an umbrella together with me.

297
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,040
What am I talking about?

298
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,670
What a troublesome man.

299
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,870
What a troublesome woman.

300
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,430
Don't compare me to other women.

301
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,110
You've gone too far, Senior.

302
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,110
Loreley from the music club

303
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,040
would never have done such a thing.

304
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,590
Loreley from the music club?

305
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,810
You don't know her, do you?

306
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,350
She has a very beautiful voice.

307
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,650
Although I've never seen her,

308
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,650
I listen to her singing every day.

309
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,390
I can imagine

310
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,950
someone with such a beautiful voice

311
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,830
must be very considerate

312
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,170
and won't hurt anyone.

313
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,840
She must be pure,

314
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,390
gentle and simple.

315
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,750
She's nothing like you.

316
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,080
She's of healing style.

317
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,390
She has a gentle voice

318
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,760
that can drive away all the tiredness.

319
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,390
Without her singing,

320
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,470
I can't sleep.

321
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,950
I can't live without her.

322
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,830
She is my goddess.

323
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,870
You just said

324
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,390
what Loreley is to you?

325
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,510
Say that again.

326
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,830
How can I say this kind of thing again?

327
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,230
What's going on?

328
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,950
I'm here to fight with her today,

329
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,810
but she doesn't respect me at all.

330
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,010
It looks like I have to
use my last trump card.

331
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,240
I will use the highest courtesy

332
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,829
of the Western knights

333
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,030
to declare war on you.

334
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,270
Please take it.

335
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,530
Where is Chai Ziyu?

336
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,510
Chai Ziyu left first.

337
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,670
It's almost time.

338
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,150
Let's go there.

339
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,550
Is this really the place?

340
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,790
Don't worry.

341
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,150
It took me a long time

342
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,630
to find this place.

343
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,230
Again?

344
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,190
I switched to another secret base

345
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,550
and still got found by him.

346
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,750
Why did he bring someone else?

347
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,470
Is this his daughter?

348
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,190
He's almost pushing me off.

349
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,050
Forget about him. Let's get started.

350
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,950
So we came here to...

351
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,430
To relieve stress.

352
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,690
To relieve stress?

353
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,910
From easy to hard.

354
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,350
Let's see this question first.

355
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,750
Have you figured out
the answer of this question?

356
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,590
Minus two.

357
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,790
The answer is correct.

358
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,350
For the next question,

359
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,710
we need to change our mindset.

360
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,270
I think...

361
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,670
The answer is 24.

362
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,750
Next question.

363
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,790
We need to...

364
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,510
-One...
-One quarter or 0.25.

365
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,110
Is your way of relieving stress

366
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,430
bullying elementary school students?

367
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,910
You major in math.

368
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,070
Because I found that

369
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,930
solving math problems
is really a relief of stress.

370
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,910
Try it.

371
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,710
Let's look at the next question.

372
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,950
It's okay. Come on.

373
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,630
Let's take a look at the known conditions.

374
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,200
Based on these two numbers,

375
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,270
insert them here.

376
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,550
Then use the second formula

564
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,910
You know what?

565
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,500
Elementary School Mathematical Olympiads
problems are so hard nowadays.

566
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,000
I can't solve any of them.

567
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,670
But Ye Qi solved them so easily.

568
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,150
What's more,

569
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,030
he even secretly bought me a gift.

570
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:36,090
I also promised him to attend a meeting
in the editorial office together.

571
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,310
Alright.

572
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,590
Let's take a break.

573
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,430
You merely received a gift
from Ye Qi, didn't you?

574
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:48,950
A few days ago,

575
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,230
I even received a gift from another boy.

576
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,030
Did I show off?

577
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,910
No.

578
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,350
Who was it? Who was so brave?

579
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,150
It was Ruosong.

580
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,350
He asked me to have a talk on the rooftop.

581
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,410
He said he wanted to get along with me.

582
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,750
Ruosong.

583
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,300
[Jiang Ruosong—What are you doing?
This emoji looks as cowardly as you.]

584
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,950
Oh, no.

585
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,560
I think she's completely irritated by me.

586
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,410
But girls' comics shouldn't
have lied to me.

587
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,400
Which part went wrong?

588
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,450
Was it my letter of challenge?

589
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,910
Speaking of which,

590
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,310
as a man,

591
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,590
he wrote on pink letter paper.

592
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,070
It's obvious that he has
no experience with women.

593
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,230
Or...

594
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,400
Did I not throw the gloves toughly enough?

595
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,590
But when he gave me a gift,

596
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,550
his vulnerable and weak appearance

597
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,150
made me want to protect him.

598
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,070
Are you in love with him?

599
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,790
Not really.

600
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,910
I just think it's interesting

601
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,110
to be with him.

602
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,150
Speaking of which,

603
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,210
he was the first guy who gave me a gift.

604
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,350
I will protect it.

605
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,710
It's Senior.

606
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,910
What should I do?

607
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,350
Ruosong.

608
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,870
Wait for me!

609
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,930
Why did he run away?

610
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,870
He must be trying to get along with me,

611
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,150
but he's shy.

612
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,510
Songsong!

613
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,350
Songsong!
