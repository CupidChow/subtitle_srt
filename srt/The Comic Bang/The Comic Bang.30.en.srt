00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,590
Ye Qi.

189
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,630
What are you doing here?

190
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,270
I'm taking the stuff
to the Fine Arts Club.

191
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,270
Let me help you.

192
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,840
Okay, thank you.

193
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,590
I just heard people say

194
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,790
that someone pretended to

195
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,070
be a delinquent, a basketball genius,

196
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,990
and a bamboo shoot
or something in our school.

197
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,630
So I'm thinking

198
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,110
it would be great

199
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,590
if you can be as relaxed as that person.

200
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,630
Those are all me.

201
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,800
They're all you?

202
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,630
I get angry when I mention it.

203
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,150
All those cute and charming characters

204
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,390
are taken by others.

205
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,990
What kind of persona is this?

206
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,770
Are you conceiving ideas for a new comic?

207
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,150
Let me tell you a big secret.

208
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,030
Actually, all the surroundings

209
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,510
are part of my dream.

210
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,710
In my dream,

211
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,640
I want to have a different persona.

212
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,480
I want to be a heart-throb

213
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,350
or a person who is hated by all.

214
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,590
But I ended up failing
in being either one.

215
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,320
So I could only be myself again.

216
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,870
So he's so relaxed that he's insane.

217
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,790
So,

218
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,990
you're back to the cartoonist persona?

219
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,550
I hit a plateau in my career.

220
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,510
Then I found a blackening assistant.

221
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,630
But it turns out

222
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,510
that I became more and more
dependent on this blackening assistant.

223
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,310
It's such a cartoonist persona.

224
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,280
That's an unexpected gain.

225
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,270
Ye Qi.

226
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,530
Can you tell me
how to play a bamboo shoot?

227
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,630
Thank you, Ye Qi and Qiandai.

228
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,560
You're welcome.

229
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,390
As a reward,

230
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,030
let me be your model.

231
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,370
We just want to draw Chai Ziyu.

232
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,310
Ye Qi has been working so hard.

233
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,110
Let's just manage to endure it.

234
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,790
Let's draw Ye Qi today then.

235
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,070
What are you doing? Don't take it off.

236
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,830
Don't look.

237
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,270
What are you doing?

238
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,070
Think about your persona.

239
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,270
I almost forgot.

240
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,470
My persona is a girls' comic artist now.

241
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,110
For the sake of material collection,

242
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,790
let's talk about love topics.

243
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,990
Love topics?

244
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,950
Then let's start from me,

245
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,470
the president of the club.

246
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,610
I've never been
in a romantic relationship.

247
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,110
I-I don't think I have, either.

248
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,630
Neither have I.

249
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,350
Neither have I.

250
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,550
Sorry.

251
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,070
We'll do our best.

252
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,910
No need to apologize.

253
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,830
Let's talk about our ideal partners then.

254
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,070
Ideal partners?

255
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,270
My ideal partner is

256
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,630
a person who will come to me immediately

257
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,470
when I'm in trouble.

258
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,230
He will also carry heavy things for me.

259
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,590
After I say "Thank you" to him,

260
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,550
he will nod at me with tender eyes.

261
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,320
Can run fast and carry heavy things.

262
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,270
Has tender eyes.

263
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,190
She likes horses.

264
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,190
The next one is…

265
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,510
Qiandai, please.

266
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,080
I'm going outside to answer a call.

267
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,150
How come it's also a phone call that
interrupts the plot development

268
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,190
even in a dream?

269
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,650
Can't it be more creative?

270
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,230
Then, Ye Qi,

271
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,030
what is your ideal partner like?

272
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,270
My ideal partner…

273
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,470
She…

274
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,310
Yes.

275
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,910
I'm the contact person
of "Let's Fall in Love."

276
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,870
What?

277
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:32,990
Wait a second.

278
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,050
I'll find somewhere to write it down.

279
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,270
I've been working hard for so long.

280
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,870
It won't be too much

281
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,400
if I skip the rehearsal
once in a while, right?

282
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,210
She skipped the rehearsal again?

283
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,390
She really can't be spoiled.

284
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,830
This is my ideal partner.

285
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,470
You're not kidding, right?

286
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,350
Ye Qi.

287
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,110
Of course not.

288
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,470
If one doesn't even
tell the truth in a dream,

289
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,990
wouldn't it be too tiring?

290
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,750
Ye Qi is here too.

291
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,310
What are you talking about?

292
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,870
We're talking about our ideal partners.

293
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,150
I want to join too.

294
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,030
My ideal partner

295
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,310
is more than 170 cm tall.

296
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,070
He loves dramas.

297
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,630
He once won the Best Actress Award.

298
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,400
And he always likes
to have physical contact with me.

299
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,310
He clearly likes me in his heart,

300
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,070
but he just doesn't dare to admit it.

301
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,870
He looks mature on the outside,

302
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,810
but he's actually
like a child on the inside.

303
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,630
In the dream,

304
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,310
everyone is so genuine.

[Fine Arts Club]

306
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,990
He clearly likes me in his heart,

307
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,640
but he just doesn't dare to admit it.

308
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,550
He looks mature on the outside,

[Fine Arts Club]

310
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,369
but he's actually
like a child on the inside.

311
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,750
I need to calm down.

312
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,630
She actually said

313
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,990
that I'm a child.

314
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,790
The material I collected
at the Fine Arts Club

315
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,270
is quite good.

316
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,590
I'll draw it when I get back.

317
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,650
Come to my place tonight and blacken…

318
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,710
Color it.

319
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,430
I have something important today.

320
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,270
I'll be late.

321
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,400
You may leave first.

322
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,230
What is it?

323
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,550
In order to give him a surprise,

324
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,710
I'd better not tell him now.

325
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,110
Well, it's just something very important.

326
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,270
You must come.

327
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,550
Don't worry.

328
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,630
It's a deal.

329
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,930
I'll definitely be there.

330
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,320
You'll be a puppy if you don't come.

331
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,310
I'll come.

332
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:29,830
Be good.

333
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,870
You can go now.

334
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,790
Why are boys so clingy?

335
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,270
Qiandai,

336
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,070
how much time do you still need?

337
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,350
Didn't you say you'll be here in an hour?

339
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,950

Ye Qi. Ye Qi. Ye Qi.

341
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,990
This is the contract from the platform.

342
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,510
How is it?

343
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,430
I'm an awesome
comic book manager, right?

344
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,510
What contract?

345
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,590
The contract we're
going to sign with the platform.

346
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,110
The platform called me this afternoon,

347
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,440
saying that they would like to sign us.

348
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,630
They've already sent the contract,

349
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,270
and I went to get it right away.

350
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,910
The terms and benefits are generous.

351
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,310
Do you want to take a look?

352
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,550
I don't understand these things very well.

353
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,070
You can just make the decision.

354
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,870
I don't know much about these either.

355
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,870
But these are
standard terms and conditions.

356
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,270
And they found a planner

357
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,150
to communicate with us.

358
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,230
Planner?

359
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,710
Will he take the liberty
of changing the content of my comics?

360
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,670
Will he be like Qian Ye?

361
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,070
Oh no.

362
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,230
Don't you already know

363
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,440
what to do?

364
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,390
You've cleaned up the house

365
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,190
and made tea for him.

366
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,710
Aren't you specifically waiting for him?

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,030
He has a poor moral character.

557
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,190
He's not qualified
to participate in the comic-con at all.

558
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,430
Meng Ye has to be canceled.

559
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,960
It attacks you in such a way.

560
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,670
Could it be Qian Ye
who was making mischief?

561
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,070
Mr. Gong Jian and I
also suspect it was Qian Ye,

562
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,470
but there's no evidence.

563
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,990
Because it's related to LAST,

564
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,550
it could also be Meng Ye's rival.

565
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,060
What should we do?

566
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,720
There are more and more likes.

567
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,910
If the reputation of the comic declines

568
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,830
because of this incident,

569
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,910
it may really affect whether
we'll be able to go to the comic-con.

570
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,750
Look at how nervous you are.

571
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,230
I've already had a plan
for dealing with this.

572
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:25,790
Tell us.

573
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,230
Done.

574
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,630
I just sent a private message

575
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,270
to the poster, Cutie 187.

576
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,230
I told him that I'm a staff member
of "Let's Fall in Love"

577
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,230
and asked him how much it would
cost to delete the post.

578
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,350
Are you stupid?

579
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,470
Look.

580
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,110
Am I the only one
who thinks they're shameless?

581
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,350
Is it that anyone
can draw comics now?

582
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,190
According to the post,

583
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,910
Meng Ye betrayed the former boss
and his contract was terminated.

584
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,950
It seems to be true.

585
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,310
Otherwise, there would have been
an official response.

586
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,440
They even made such petty moves.
Really disappointing.

587
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,710
You're the one who's shameless.

588
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,750
Draw comics if you can,

589
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,810
keyboard warrior.

590
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,350
He's the person in the screenshot.

591
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,990
Catch him alive.

592
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,120
Come and revile him.

593
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,270
Oh, no.

594
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,870
I think it's getting worse.

595
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,390
It seems

596
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,120
there's only one way now.

597
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,530
According to my experience
as a video uploader,

598
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,750
it won't work
if we act toughly as Yuyu said.

599
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,230
The tougher you are,
the more you'll fuel the other's anger.

600
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,430
And it might get to the moral aspect.

601
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,430
So we'd better

602
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,070
be humble.

603
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,680
What exactly should we do then?

604
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,630
Should we reveal

605
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,550
that Ye Qi paid
a lot of money for the termination fee?

606
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,790
This way, we can
gain their sympathy, maybe?

607
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,830
If so, everyone will focus on saying

608
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,630
"You're a comic artist.

609
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,310
How can you be
so rich and afford the termination fee?"

610
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,030
What if we say he borrowed the money?

611
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,270
Then they'll say

612
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,870
"You've been
drawing comics for so many years

613
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,830
but you can't even afford
to pay such a small amount of money.

614
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,160
You must be incapable."

615
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:23,350
It's so hard to say something

616
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,160
without being abused
on the internet nowadays.

617
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,470
Actually, what I
want to say is very simple.

618
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,190
We just

619
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,190
need to make an official statement.

620
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,870
Many bloggers, celebrities, and video uploaders
who are troubled by rumors

621
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,240
all use this PR technique.

622
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,550
For example?

623
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,070
For example, this video uploader

624
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,110
who has 250,000 fans.

625
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,060
[Chen Xiaohua]

626
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,270
He was falsely accused

627
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,070
of making inappropriate remarks.

628
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,030
He quickly clarified to the public.

629
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,030
And the fans listened to his explanation.

630
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,430
And this pet video uploader

631
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,630
who has 700,000 fans.

632
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,230
It's rumored that

633
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,990
he abused pets in order to make videos.

634
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,070
He also posted a statement

635
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,590
to reveal the truth.

636
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,590
The fans went back to his side again.

637
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,590
Lastly, this actor.

638
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:02,790
He ate a fly

639
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,950
when he was having hotpot.

640
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,310
He also made a statement.

641
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,030
Wait.

642
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,909
There was a fly in the hotpot.

643
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:11,030
Shouldn't it be the restaurant
that makes the statement?

644
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,190
Because the incident
provoked much discussion,

645
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,150
and that he was said to had no moral
bottom lines in making a publicity stunt

646
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,210
and was intentionally making waves.

647
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,630
So what I want to say is

648
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,590
that the purpose of public relations

649
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,429
is to reveal the truth

650
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:26,310
instead of being used
as a means to shape public opinion.

651
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,750
The first thing we need to do

652
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,949
is to make an analysis

653
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,310
based on the main points that attack us

654
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,270
in the post

655
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,540
and to clarify the whole story.

656
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,510
Then, we need to express our respect

657
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,070
for LAST Comic-Con.

658
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,429
At last, we need to
summarize the whole incident

659
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:39,350
to show that
if someone maliciously manipulates it,

660
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,280
we'll surely call them to account.

661
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,469
Qiandai,

662
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,949
you've got a point.

663
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,670
Let's do as you said.

664
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,310
Yes.

665
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,070
And the sooner the better.

666
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,389
Let's work together.

667
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,389
Each of us will write one paragraph.

668
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,550
Come on.

669
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,920
Come on! Come on!

670
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,720
[Yes, I terminated the contract.
I'm sorry for occupying public attention…]

671
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,550
Done.

672
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,190
I'll upload it then.

673
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,030
Here it is. I'm coming to hear the gossip.

674
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,590
The other side took it out of context.

675
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,670
I'm so angry.

676
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,670
There are reasons and evidence.

677
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,030
I'll be on your side this time.

678
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,630
Meng Ye,

679
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,870
I've known you

680
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,830
since you first started drawing comics.

681
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,750
I like you a lot.

682
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,990
I'm sure you're not that kind of person.

683
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,110
Meng Ye is the best.

684
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,710
Finally, we've solved the problem.

685
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,270
Well,

686
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,350
my grandma asked me to go home for dinner.

687
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,150
I'm leaving.

688
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,750
Okay.

689
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,110
Bye-bye, Mr. Gong Jian.

690
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,440
Bye-bye, Mr. Gong Jian.

691
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,550
Ye Qi.

692
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,670
I'm going back to school.

693
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,150
Lu…

694
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,910
The club members are still waiting for me.

695
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:52,510
Okay.

696
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,870
I'm leaving too.

697
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,760
We're leaving too.

698
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,590
Bye-bye, seniors.

699
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,590
Bye-bye.

700
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,870
Qiandai.

701
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,310
Thanks to you.

702
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,550
Do you have something important

703
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,870
to tell me?

704
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,220
I have something
very important to tell you.

705
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,430
Is he going to
ask for my feelings about him?

706
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,390
Ye Qi, I do.

707
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,950
Qiandai, look.

708
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,750
Your coloring on these several strokes

709
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,230
is getting more and more professional.

710
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,510
My driver called me

711
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,580
and said that he's coming
to pick me up and send me home.

712
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,870
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

713
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,310
Is the bus service

714
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,840
so customer-oriented now?

715
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,110
Throughout the statement,

716
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,760
the habit of punctuation usage

717
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,390
is totally inconsistent.

718
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,150
Besides that, in the fourth paragraph,

719
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,670
the usage of adjectives
and adverbs is ambiguous.

720
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,270
But the rest are all correct.

721
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,270
It's not written by one person.

722
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,530
That's my conclusion.

723
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,840
It must be written by a PR firm.

724
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,440
Can you show some sincerity?

725
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,950
It's leaving me
a poor impression again.

726
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,150
I almost believed it.

727
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,750
How could this happen?

728
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:39,950
[I like raccoon the most]

729
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,110
It's really you.

730
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,310
Ye Qi.

731
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,350
Ye Qi.

732
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,850
Did you not sleep well last night?

733
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,430
I haven't slept well

734
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,350
since I read those comments.

735
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,510
It's okay.

736
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,310
I've solved the case.

737
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,640
Solved the case?

738
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,350
Last night, I searched for
the two instigators' accounts

739
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,510
on Weibo, Douyin, Rednote,

740
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,870
Douban, Zhihu, NetEase Cloud Music,

741
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,270
Meituan Delivery
and other major platforms.

742
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,870
I finally found…

743
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,670
Wait a second.

744
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,460
Why did you search for them
on Meituan Delivery?

745
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,270
Because I got hungry
as I searched for them.

746
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:24,790
Go on.

747
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,350
I finally found some clues.

748
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,550
Look.

749
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,830
In this Tieba forum,

750
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,060
I found two accounts
with the same IP address.

751
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,400
Both of the two accounts
are active users in the forum.

752
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,190
After my investigation last night,

753
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,910
I found a big secret.

754
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,350
When this person replied to others,

755
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,830
he accidentally switched
to the wrong account.

756
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,470
Look.

757
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,980
[The latest episode of Lirmos is so fun]
[You'll never guess who the murderer is]

758
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:53,530
[No spoilers!] [I'll consider it if you beg me]
[I'm begging you, please] [I've considered it. The murderer is still Dashan]

759
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,690
[I like raccoon the most: My handsome picture]

760
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,030
It was really Qian Ye.

761
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,440
That's right.

762
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,950
He must be jealous
of the fact that "Let's Fall in Love"

763
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,350
can participate in the LAST Comic-Con.

764
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,790
So he couldn't stay calm.

765
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,230
Now we have solid evidence.

766
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,800
Let's uncover what he did.

767
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,150
How?

768
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,630
Let him have a taste of his own medicine.

769
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,840
I'll make a video

770
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,950
and reveal all
his evil deeds to the public.

771
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,830
Plus, I'll show the evidence
from the raccoon forum.

772
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:21,290
This time, Qian Ye definitely won't be able to make a comeback.

773
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,950
Hello, everyone. I'm Gong Shihei
who never defames others.

774
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,310
The comics I've recommended
are all worth reading.

775
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,280
Today, I'm not going to
share a list of comics with you.

776
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,150
Let's review the incident

777
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,350
of "Let's Fall in Love"
quitting the LAST Comic-Con,

778
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,590
which gave rise to much discussion

779
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,430
in the comic circle recently.

780
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,750
This incident is about

781
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,070
a netizen named Cutie 187,

782
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,730
who published a long article.

783
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,750
Songsong.

784
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,280
Look at your phone.

785
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,870
[Gong Shihei:  The truth of
"Let's Fall in Love" being defamed is actually…]

786
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:02,670
Gu.

787
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,760
I can't believe you're paying attention
to the gossip in the comic circle.

788
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,960
I want to watch it too.

789
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,430
Right,

790
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,160
Lu Dao doesn't know yet.

791
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,590
Poor Lu Dao.

792
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,190
Support Meng Ye.

793
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,590
We resolutely cancel such
a shameless executive editor.

794
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,340
[Support Meng Ye. We resolutely cancel
such a shameless executive editor]

795
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,910
Regarding the executive editor,

796
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,710
I also have a few words to say.

797
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,100
He will absolutely be done for this time.

798
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,910
He sings and does other stuff every day.

799
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,030
It really gives me
a headache. It's so annoying.

800
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,800
That's right.

801
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,590
What are you doing?

802
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,620
Find out what the executive editor did

803
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,150
before you slander others.

804
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,870
It's easy for a rumor to spread quickly
but it's hard to refute it.

805
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,510
You guys.

806
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,790
Just you wait.
