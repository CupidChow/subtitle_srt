00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:41,520
You're Zuo Qiandai who helped to color it, right?

4
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,990
All the marked areas need to be colored.

5
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,990
Thank you.

6
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,670

7
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,229
Are you the...?

8
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,190
President!

9
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,070
To fight for Lu Dao,

10
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,590
the girls are fighting again.

11
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,470
Wait!

12

13
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,750
Maybe

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,950
that assistant is Gu?

15
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,830
Lu Dao, stop messing around.

16
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,080
Zuo Qiandai, you are a good person.

17

Are you... the briefs?

21
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,030
Is it that obvious?

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,630
I mean the mark.

23
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,630
Are you also...

24
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,070
I am.

25
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,190
You're amazing, Gu.

26
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,710
Gu is talking about this

27
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,270
with a first-met girl?

28
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,550

29
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,470
So he likes

such new and down-to-earth topics.

31
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:49,710
I see.

32
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,070
We're on the same boat, Gu.

33
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,790
I like to talk about such topics too.

34
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,550
I can talk about this all night.

If you talk nonsense again, I'll trap you for half an hour.

37
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,830
I'll keep talking nonsense.

38
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,070
So Gu is your assistant too.

39

How did you know each other?

40
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,829
We were netizens at first.

41
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:26,790
Later, we watched

42
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,910
a comic adaptation drama at the same time

43
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,790
and commented on the same post.

44
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,640
Many people online complained about this drama.

45
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,950
If it's not adapted well, they'll complain about it.

46
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,350
Why can't people complain if it's not good?

47
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,190
But Gu and I think

48
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,650
the adaptation is not bad.

49
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,230
Right?

50
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,870
I also think so.

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,630
Every work

52
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,230
is the result of the hard work of the creator.

53
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,310
It shouldn't be criticized casually.

54
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,670
Not really.

55
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,800
Of course you can point out the problem if there are some.

56
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,170
But if someone complains about my comic,

57
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,190
I must discuss it with them.

58
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,070
Ye Qi is going to do it.

59
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,530
I cannot let him know that I commented on him.

60
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,470
Judging from your words,

61
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,040
you have complained about comics too?

62
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,910
Me?

63
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,590
How could I?

64
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,870
You're right.

65
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,870
You don't look like someone who can criticize others.

66
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,230
Right?

77
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,350
It completely overwhelms Lin Mu's.

78
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,190

80
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,550
More suitable than Lu Dao?

81
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,070

But being observed by Ye Qi

84
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,560
will make me feel embarrassed.

She seems to be physically uncoordinated when she walks.

194
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,270
It can be exaggerated

Although she cannot answer the question, she raised her hand bravely.

00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,070

Come to help me copy some files.

383
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,950
Come here.

384
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,830
Ye Qi, wait for me.

385
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,090
I'll come to you later.

386
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,950
What are you looking at?

387
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,670
Come and help me move them.

388
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,190
Let's go.

[The Concise Edition of General History of China]

390
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,630
Don't feel distant from me

391
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,870
because you're too ordinary.

392
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,390
Don't be nervous when you're alone with me.

393
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,390
I'm nice.

394
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,070

Qiandai and the others always come to me for consulting worries.

397
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,470
Many people ask me for help.

398
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,310
She really didn't do it on purpose?

399
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,430
Ridiculous.

400
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,630
Because I always think for people around me,

401
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,360
and understand people's words and actions well.

402

Something urgent came up.

405
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,510
Can you help me

406
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,480
take good care of these things?

407
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,150
They are as important as my life.

408
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,750
Now I'm going to

409
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,150
hand over them to you.

410
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,030
I'll definitely come back to pick them up.

412
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,030
What are you doing here?

413
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,640
To protect Zhou Jieyue’s life.

414
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,310
Where is she?

415
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,110
She never came back.

416
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,430
You're so easily deceived by her.

417

Let me help you.

418
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,230
Tell me the truth.

00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,990
Am I also like Zhou Jieyue,

420
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,850
driving people crazy sometimes?

421
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,030
No, no way.

422
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,710
Don't think like that.

423
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,990
Gosh.

424
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,990
Because of Jieyue,

425
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,590
even Ye Qi is starting to review himself.

426
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,390
I knew it.

427
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,890
Cartoonists understand people's words and actions best.

428
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,000
Thank you for your help.

429

By the way,

431
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,150
what is Zhou Jieyue doing?

432
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,390
She should be in another club now.

433
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,630
She's quite popular in that club.

434
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,590
She's like a girl comic heroine.

435
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,920
It's definitely the individual kind.

436
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:12,910
She also has a nickname

437
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,950
called Loreley of the music club.

438
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,190
Loreley?

439
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,310
Let me show you.

[Music Club of Dongsheng University]

441
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,060
Interesting.

442
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,030
I didn't expect

443
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,950
she's also a member of the music club.

444
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,590
She can sing so well.

445
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,030
It's like I'm listening to an opera.

446
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,750
Surprised?

447
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,510
She is the chief singer of the music club.

448
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,000
I have a lot of her songs in my phone.

449
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:30,990
Do you think

450
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,720
she's suitable to be a new character in the comic?

451
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,830
Are you kidding me?

452
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,470
It's perfect, okay?

453
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,950
She's so unreasonable.

454
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,190
It will be such a waste if I cannot

455
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,150
make her the male supporting role in our comic.

456
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,910
Why isn't she a female supporting role?

457
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,310
Jieyue's character is too outstanding.

458
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,910
It’s so rare. Only when I make her the male supporting role

459
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,790
can I reveal all her character of not following rules

460
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,790
fully.

is maybe you.

Ye Qi.

466
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,910
Is there any progress with your new character?

467
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,310
It's almost done.

468
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,590
I even finished the name.

469
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,390
Just call him

How is it?

472
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,280
I thank you on behalf of Jie.

473
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,640
Because you introduced her to me,

474
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,070
this role can exist.

475
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,110
Are you free tonight?

476
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,070
I want to invite you to my apartment for dinner.

477
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,950
Sure.

478
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,870
What are you going to order?

479
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,350
I will make it myself.

480
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,830
Ye Qi cooking by himself?

481
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,350
What do you like to eat?

482
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,870
Sweet and sour ribs. My favorite.

483
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,630
I saw the weather forecast this morning and it said it would rain,

484
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,190
but I forgot my umbrella.

485
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,480
Could I be the only idiot

486
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,710
who doesn't have an umbrella?

487
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,230
I don't have an umbrella either.

488
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,310
I guess there are two idiots.

489
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,990
In this case,

490
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,790
people usually use coats to block the rain, right?

491
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,670
Come in.

492
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,950
That's cool.

493
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,150
But I feel like I can't cover the bag.

494
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,550
Considering that,

495
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,310
I have come up with a new pose.

496
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
What do you think?

497
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,060
Not really.

498
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:45,910
Well...

499
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,910
You come in too.

500
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,750
Okay, let's go.

501
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,190
So much water.

502
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,750
Thinking about it calmly,

503
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,510
a coat

504
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,070
can't block such heavy rain.

505
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,810
The campus in the rain,

506
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,990
teaching building with nobody,

507
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,670
a boy and a girl hiding from the rain.

508
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,070
I'm familiar with this plot.

509
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,150
Is Ye Qi trying to get closer to me?

510
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,590
And then?

511
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,910
You'll never see them again.

512
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,070
This isn't the time to talk about horror stories!

513
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:06,550
Lu Dao, Lu Dao, Lu Dao.

514
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:12,910
Take my umbrella, Lu Dao.

515
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,060
Lu Dao is really popular.

516
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,110
While we're bored,

517
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,840
let's think of a cool way to hand over an umbrella.

518
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,790
Why don't you come to me?

519
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,630
But isn't this too old-fashioned?

520
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,550
It should be wilder.

521
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,710
I said I have an umbrella.

522
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,240
I don't need your umbrella.

523
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,350
Qiandai, take the umbrella.

524
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,910
My umbrella.

525
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,870
You don't have an umbrella now, right?

526
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,750
You have to come with me.

527
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,350
Two people walk in the rain under one umbrella.

528
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,150
It's a classic plot of idol drama.

529
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,830
Others must be envious.

530
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,870
They two are so strange.

531
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,870
Qiandai. Qiandai.

532
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,190
I'm sorry.

533
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,630
Sorry about earlier.

534
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,550
It's okay.

535
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,030
I should be the one to hold the umbrella.

536
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,110
No matter what,

537
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,510
I'll do my best to protect you.

538
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,990
I won't let you get wet.

539
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,190
Please take the umbrella flat.

540
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,350
It's safer this side.

541
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,110
Come on.

542
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,140
[Oh no.]

543
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,440
[Splash]

544
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,950
In this situation,

545
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,510
even I can't block it completely.

546
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,590
It's okay.

547
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,790
I want to keep going with Ye Qi.

548
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,750
If only this raod

549
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,030
can never be finished...

550
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,710
I wish this road

551
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,310
can never be finished.

552
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,030
I just washed my clothes this morning.

553
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,300
They are being hanged outside now.

554
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,510
I have to wash them again at night.

555
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,830
So you just want to escape from reality.

556
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,390
Let's go.

557
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,790
Let's eat.

558
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,590
There's no twist.

559
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,110
It's so delicious.

560
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,670
By the way,

561
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,870
how did you meet Zhou Jieyue?

562
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,590
Many things must have happened

563
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,270
before you became friends.

564
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,030
Is it

565
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,310
that she didn't like you when you first met?

566
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,670
You didn't expect you two can be so close.

567
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,030
One of you is like summer,

568
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,630
and the other is like autumn.

569
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,750
I knew her

570
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,480
because our student IDs were close to each other.

571
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,780
I see.

572
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,710
What's wrong?

573
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,870
Do you want to write

574
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,230
a history for Jie?

575
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,510
No.

576
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,110
I just think Zhou Jieyue is quite interesting.

577
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,030
Interesting?

578
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,710
What do you mean?

579
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,570
Have some ribs.

580
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,030
Hold on.

581
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:40,990
Ruosong?

582
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,030
Ruosong?

583
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,670
What does she mean?

584
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,390
She?

585
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:50,830
You're being followed?

586
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,590
I'll call the police now.

587
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,470
No, no.

588
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,590
It’s Zhou Jieyue.

589
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,310
She has been following me.

590
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,710
I took a long way around to get rid of her.

591
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,390
Didn't you two leave together?

592
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,110
No.

593
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,190
I was forced to.

594
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,200
Forget it. You're all wet.

595
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,990
Go to my room and get changed.

596
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,030
I'll make you some hot tea.

597
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,230
Thank you, Ye Qi.

598
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,710
Go now.

599
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,389
Ruosong.

600
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,639
Ruosong.

601
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,909
You're still so nervous?

602
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,710
Why don't you listen to some music?

603
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,770
There are many pieces in my computer.

604
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,500
I'll make you some tea.

605
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,750
Thank you.

606
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:34,949
Why does Ye Qi begin to listen to operas?

607
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:37,159
[Loreley]

608
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,350
Not bad.

609
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,190
But...

610
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,110
Falling asleep so soon?

611
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,210
Didn't you have insomnia?

612
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,150
It's done.

613
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,510
I also combined the plot of rain today.

614
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,150
It makes my heart flutter.

615
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,310
Tell me your opinion after you finish.

616
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,370
Heart fluttering.

617
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,270
Will this be the scene where we shared an umbrella?

618
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,270
Qiandai, take the umbrella.

619
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,750
My umbrella.

620
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,790
I was defeated by Jieyue.
