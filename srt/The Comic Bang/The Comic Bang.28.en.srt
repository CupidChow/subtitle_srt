Are you

3
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,270
still upset about the comic?

4
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,390
If you're feeling down,

5
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,110
then do something

6
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,789
that makes you happy.

7
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,110
As for me,

8
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,790
I'm thinking about buying some garage kits.

9
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,250
Only garage kits can
soothe my wounded soul.

10
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,590
I'll go listen to some fresh new music.

11
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,430
How about you, Gu?

12
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,910
You guys are still too young.

13
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,910
I've weathered all kinds of storms.

14
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,150
Something like this

15
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,550

What?

21

I...

22
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,670
I'm just worried
you're overworking yourself.

23
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,870
There have been so many news stories
lately about students dying suddenly.

24
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,070
Just get to the point.

25
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,510
We just tried rehearsing.

26
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,230
But we couldn't really go on...

27
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:04,960
Rehearsing?

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,180
Since when are we rehearsing?

29
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,870
Right now.

30
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,790
Sorry.

31
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,230
I spaced out

32
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,470

What went wrong with the rehearsal?

35
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,990
We think

36
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,990
the real problem lies in the script.

37
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,230
That can't be.

38
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,840
I just revised it yesterday.

39
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,270
Exactly, it's that new version.

40
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,160
Let me give an example.

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,550
The prince appears

42
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,190
and immediately gets killed by a vampire.

43
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,950
Then the villagers
flee the vampires and migrate,

44
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,150
eventually discovering a new continent.

45
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,550
Isn't that a fresh story?

46
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,270
It is fresh.

47
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,350
But it doesn't really match our theme.

all waiting for me, were you?

89
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,110
you solved the script problem?

90
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,680
I only rewrote
the opening from the last version.

91
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,740
The rest follows the original draft.

92
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,430
So...

93
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,350

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,800
Let's run through it again.

95
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,710
The prince was defeated.

96
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,920
But he didn't die.

97
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,590
He struggled
to pull himself out of the ruins.

98
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,190
He dragged his battered body

99
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,320
back to the village.

100
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,909
Though he had failed,

101
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,870
the villagers saw him as a hero.

102
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,350
Get up!

103
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,800
Everyone, get up!

104
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,270
He vowed

105
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,430
to defeat the vampire.

106
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,310
For our village,

Never give up!

109
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,390
Because he's a prince

110
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,590
and a prince

111
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,320
is never defeated by setbacks.

112
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,030

113
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,390

122
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,150
Prince, you must

123
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,680
truly express
your feelings to the princess.

124
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,830
Good luck.

125
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,120
Don't worry.

126
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,790
Even a prince

127
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,630
can feel afraid when it comes to love.

128
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,630
Let's keep going.

129
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,110
Come on.

130
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,510
Though the prince was defeated,

131
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,030
he didn't die.

132
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,550
He dragged his broken body

133
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,430
back to the village.

134
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,590

Jieyue, you're here.

136
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,640
He's been wailing
like that for over an hour.

He insists on joining our music club.

138
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,470
Can you please talk some sense into him?

139
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,150
If others hear this,

140
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,880
it'll totally ruin

150
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,110
I listened to music all night yesterday

151
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,510
I think I should
try joining the music club.

152
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,390
So you're giving up basketball?

153
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,630
If Ye Qi

154
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,840
can give up comic,

155
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,670
then I can give up basketball too

156
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,350
Honestly, I've wanted
to join the music club for a while

157
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,670
I can join forces with you.

158

You be the Loreley of the club.

159
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,270
I'll be the Romeo.

160
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,630
Give it a rest.

161
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,030
With that voice,
you might be worse than Lu Dao.

162
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,950
But we could start a duo.

163

379
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,990
Way too soft.

380
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,510
He bullied my son.

381
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,920
I'm going to use force.

382
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,590
I'll chop him

383
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,030
into meat rolls.

384
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,950
Meatballs!

385
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,310
Meat paste!

386
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,550
Meat slices.

387
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,710
Qiandai.

388
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,640
Minced patties!

389
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,230
Into vermicelli!

390
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,510
Into kelp!

391
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,520
Into tripe!

392
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,750
Into duck intestines!

393
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,430
Add some greens.

394
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,150
Alright, alright, alright.

395
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:17,950
Veggies cook fast anyway.

396
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,750
Come on, let's eat.

397
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,710
Eat, eat.

398
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,470
Thanks.

399
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,350
Qiandai.

400
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,590
Sorry you had to see that.

401
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,790
Actually,

402
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,230
you didn't have to go out of your way
to get along with my parents.

403
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,110
It's fine.

404
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,040
We actually get along really well.

405
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,270
Come on, the meatballs are ready.

406
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,510
Ready to eat?

407
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,670
Here, Qiandai, Qiandai.

408
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,550
Here you go.

409
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,110
Thank you, Auntie.

410
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,550
Careful, it's hot.

411
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,230
Watch out.

412
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,030
It's on fire! It's on fire!

413
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,270
It's on fire!

414
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,190
What are they shouting for?

415
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:54,110
It's on fire! It's on fire!

416
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,150
You hear that?

417
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,070
Even the neighbors have been ignited

418
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,310
by our fiery passion.

419
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,960
No really, it's on fire!

420
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,550
Careful, careful!

421
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,750
Get water, get water!

422
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,390
Son, watch out!

423
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,790
Get some water! Water, water!

424
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,110
Okay, yes, yes!

425
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,670
Yes, good!

426
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,390
Alright, alright.

427
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,450
It's out, it's out.

428
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,870
We spent an entire meal

429
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,830
and still didn't come up with a plan

430
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,750
to get revenge on Qian Ye.

431
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,670
Looks like

432
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,950
I'll have to take matters
into my own hands.

433
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,030
Sit down, sit down.

434
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,390
Sit down.

435
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,910
You're an adult.

436
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,570
Still acting so impulsively.

437
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,750
Look it up online.

438
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,830
See how much it costs to hire someone

439
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,950
for revenge.

440
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,510
That's not right.

441
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,640
We need a civilized way

442
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,230
to get back at him.

443
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,710
But revenge itself

444
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,170
isn't exactly civilized.

445
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,640
The best way

446
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,240
is to prove ourselves with comics.

447
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,950
Ye Qi will make a comeback.

448
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,550
But what should he draw?

449
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,610
Let's hold a brainstorming session.

450
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,040
How about it?

451
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,630
In that case,

452
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,110
let's all think

453
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,880
of some good ideas.

454
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,670
I suggest

455
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,990
a gangster

456
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,510
comic.

457
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,350
Stormy and powerful.

458
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,080
A rising star in chaotic times.

459
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,570
They fight passionately in the streets.

460
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,990
Among them, a man and woman fall in love.

461
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,950
But they belong to rival gangs.

462
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,350
How can they protect their love?

463
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,080
"Stop fighting!

464
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,870
I'll be with you!"

465
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,870
"Really? That's amazing!"

466
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,400
Why does it turn into
a girls' comic again?

467
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,750
I think

468
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,910
you could do something realistic,

469
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,910
like an office worker comic.

470
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,790
That topic

471
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,520
really resonates with people.

472
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,990
Working 9-to-9, 6 days a week
is tough and dull.

473
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,550
In this brutal workplace,

474
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,410
a man and woman fall in love.

475
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,510
Where will their office romance go?

476
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,510
"I'm so tired, I work overtime every day."

477
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,270
"Luckily, you're here with me."

478
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,590
"As long as you're here,

479
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,520
even working late makes me happy."

480
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,430
Still a girls' comic!

481
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,350
A hot-blooded action youth comic!

482
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,590
Shaolin Arhat Fist!

483
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,790
Mighty Vajra Kick!

484
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,710
Taichi Eight Trigrams Palm!

485
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,790
I like it.

486
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,070
Sounds great.

487
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,310
Youth comic...

488
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,880
That's what
I originally started with, isn't it?

489
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,390
So after breaking free from Qian Ye,

490
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,750
I'll go back to where I began?

491
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,950
Bro.

492
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,920
You like this comic?

493
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,150
You've got great taste.

494
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,710
No wonder we hit it off so well.

495
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,960
So in sync.

496
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,630
Thanks.

497
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,510
When will these two

498
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,770
finally learn each other's identities?

499
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,070
But the direction I took back
then with youth comic

500
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,930
still turned into girls' comics.

501
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,730
Even though I can draw comics,

502
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,850
it seems I can only draw one style.

503
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,110
It's okay.

504
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,510
Son.

505
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,000
Everyone

506
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,350
has their shortcomings.

507
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,510
Take me for example.

508
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,550
I can drive a car.

509
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,870
But that doesn't mean

510
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,350
I can drive a submarine

511
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,630
or a spaceship.

512
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,830
Right?

513
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,390
That didn't comfort him at all.

514
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,150
That didn't comfort him at all.

515
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,310
Not at all.

516
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,310
Not even a little.

517
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,210
I'm going out for some air.

518
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,290
You guys get some rest.

519
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,160
Ye Qi, I'll come with you.

520
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,160
Are you okay?

521
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,130
It's nothing, really.

522
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,690
I just suddenly
don't feel like doing anything.

523
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,750
And I don't know what I can do.

524
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,750
I just want to
pause everything for a while.

525
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,240
Sorry for making you worry.

526
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,490
I also have times
when I don't want to do anything.

527
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,830
Maybe growing up

528
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,750
just brings more worries.

529
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,270
When you think about it,

530
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,280
being a kid was really the happiest.

531
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,230
I miss being a kid.

532
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,750
When I was little,

533
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,150
I walked this road to school every day.

I remember

561
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,150
when you were riding the tandem bike,

562
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,880
you said you loved
drawing comics since you were little.

563

this really is where it all began for me.

567
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,910
Back in elementary school,

568
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,350
everyone signed up for after-school clubs.

569
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,070
What I wanted most

570
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,710
was

571
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,790
the marching band

572
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,250
and the martial arts club.

573
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,870
And then?

574
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,950
Because I was too tall.

575
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,150
So...

576
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,030
[Average height line]

577
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,990
I ended up joining the art club.

578
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,270
Because

579
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,190
you just sit and draw

580
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,350
and no one notices your height.

581
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,590
I get it, I get it.

582
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,710
How would you get it?

583
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,790
I had the exact same experience.

584
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,270
When I was a kid,

585
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,830
I really wanted to join
the etiquette and dance teams.

586
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,910
But I didn't fit in
because of my height either.

587
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,870
So...

588
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,770
[Average height line]

589
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,130
So in the end I joined the art club too.

590
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,710
Because when you're sitting and drawing,

591
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,630
no one notices how tall you are.

592
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,350
Ye Qi.

593
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,030
You have to hang in there.

594
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,670
Thanks for cheering me up.

595
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,070
I'm not cheering you up.

596
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,510
Isn't this

597
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,770
where you first started drawing comics?

598
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,550
So coming back here,

599
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,280
you must be feeling
something special deep down.

600
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,390
Even if you always
feel out of place in this world,

601
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,790
you'll definitely find

602
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,590
something you truly love.

603
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,830
Why not

604
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,270
try drawing

605
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,470
what you love most?

606
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,120
The thing I love most...

607
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,550
It's done?

608
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,670
Let me take a look.

609
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,630
See?

610
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,430
Your drawings don't lie.

611
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,590
This is where your heart points to.

612
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,910
You still can't let go of Mei.

613
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,110
You still can't let go of girls' comics.

614
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,110
They're what bring you joy, right?

615
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,760
They're what give you
a sense of worth, right?

616
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,870
You're right.

617
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,469
Then keep drawing Let's Fall in Love.

618
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,550
Not just keep drawing,

619
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,030
you should boldly innovate.

620
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,710
Let's start again.

621
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,790
But...

622
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,389
But I have a contract with the magazine.

623
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,110
I can't publish
girls' comics on another platform.

624
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,440
It would violate the non-compete clause.

625
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,080
Didn't you pay the penalty fee?

626
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,429
After paying the penalty,

627
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:33,989
Let's Fall in Love

628
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,429
returns to your hands.

629
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,270
You're free to

630
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,800
use the rights to it now.

631
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:39,750
That's right!

632
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,159
Why didn't I think of that earlier?

633
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,710
I wasted so much time being sad.

634
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:46,590
From now on,

635
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,190
you can draw

636
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,350
whatever you want.

637
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,070
Even if you make Mei's hair

638
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,389
rainbow-colored like a punk rock idol,

639
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,670
no one can stop you.

640
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,150
How could Mei's hair be any color?

641
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,230
Maybe…

642
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,910
We could try

643
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,190
a full-color comic.

644
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,990
A lot of people
have actually mentioned that before.

645
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,550
But...

646
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,190
I know you're
committed to freehand drawing.

647
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,990
But did you know?

648
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,080
On the Let's Fall in Love forum,

649
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:14,360
many fans have been
coloring your pages on their own.

650
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,670
Really?

651
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,080
Look.

652
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:27,910
[Happy weekend, from us here]

653
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,110
Maybe we could turn this

654
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,990
into your comeback gift

655
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,760
for the fans

656
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,400
as a surprise.

657
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
What do you think?

658
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,470
No way.

659
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,550
I was just casually suggesting it.

660
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,190
You don't have to take it seriously.

661
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,480
You can totally keep
drawing in black and white.

662
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,590
Mei's bow.

663
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,110
How could it be this color?

664
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,510
It has to be red.

665
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,390
Red!

666
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,790
Look.

667
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,990
Lin Mu's hair too.

668
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,590
How could it look like that?

669
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,150
Right?
