00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,509
hasn't come out to respond.

5
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,670
Looks like this matter

6
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,270
is completely over.

7
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,479
Qiandai.

8
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,910
Thank goodness you're here.

9
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,950
Is this why

10
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,670
you're having cola with me?

11
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,910
I thought you were into life nourishing.

12
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,840
It's because Mr. Gong Jian
likes carbonated drinks.

13
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,750
Although I'm into life nourishing,

14
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,430
there's a limit to everything.

15
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,550
I'm also changing.

16
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,350

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,470
Thanks to Qiandai,

20
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,510
we made

21
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,110
a great turnaround this time.

22
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,150
So when will things be confirmed

23
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,150
regarding the LAST Animation & Art?

24
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,590
I was about to tell you.

25
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,670
The staff of LAST Animation & Art
has contacted me.

26
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,190
They said they were very optimistic

27
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,710
about "Let's Fall in Love."

28
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,829
Besides, they also paid attention
to the counterattack

29
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:35,990
against the executive editor last time.

30
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,790
They said the PR handled it well.

31
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,390
But…

32
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,350
But what?

33
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,390
Only large serial comics

34
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,990
were exhibited on
LAST Animation & Art before.

35
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,630
We're relatively small.

36
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,910
So recently,

37
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,840
I'll have to trouble you
to work harder and update it.

38
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,350
Is there any problem?

39
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,030
Our final exams are coming up.

40
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,010
Students should focus on their studies.

41
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,180
Well…

42
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,590
Is there a way in which
we can update the comic

43
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,910
without affecting the review?

44
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,640
[Update: Does this manuscript that got
shot down look like a hit? Episode 31]

45
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,600
You still have no inspiration?

46
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,750
Since the updates

47
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,750
and the final exam reviews are overlapped,

48
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,590
Ye Qi

49
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,070
made Lin Mu and Mei
do a final exam review.

50
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,130
In that way, we can review
while collecting materials.

51
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,950
But reviewing is boring.

52
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,670
And there are no ups and downs
in the plot.

53
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,590
Do you have any good ideas?

54
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,950
I have an idea.

55
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,240
With Lin Mu's help,

56
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,070
the study slacker Mei

57
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,750
goes through a lot of hardships

58
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,150
and finally gets into
a prestigious school.

59
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,150
What do you think?

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,480
Is Mei going to be a study slacker?

61
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,160
I know!

62
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,790
The genius student Mei
seeks excessive profits

63
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,790
by taking exams for others.

64
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,350
She has planned the perfect cheating

65
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,630
with another straight-A student, Lin Mu.

66
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,960
I think it'll face the risk of censorship.

67
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,670
Mei's classmate commits suicide,

68
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,909
which reveals the truth

69
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:52,230
that Mei has been bullied at school.

70
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,409
When she feels the loneliest,

71
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,550
a boy named Lin Mu

72
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,030
comes to her side.

73
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,510
Wonderful.

74
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,350
If I hadn't seen these three movies,

75
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,280
I'd have been impressed by you two.

76
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,310
And it's a real campus comic.

77
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,270
What you said is too dramatic.

78
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,030
It'd be great if there is
a true straight-A student

79
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,190
from whom we can collect materials.

80
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,310
Sorry.

81
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,070
I never review for exams.

82
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,830

the college entrance exam

83

85
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,490

the supercritical deformed

88

89
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,150
This guy

90
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,310
actually solved the J-equation

91
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,070
independently proposed by

92
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,510
Chen Xiuxiong and Donaldson

93
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,150

Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation

95
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,230
proposed by Qiu Chengtong and others.

96
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,510
And he built a bridge

97

between the Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation

98
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,470
and the Keller-Einstein equation.

99
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,950
It seems

100
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,830
I'm not the only genius in the world.

101
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,030
The time is all wasted.

102
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,510

It appears that there are
three people who didn't understand.

105

But it's okay.

106
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,870

115
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,310
Yes.

116

Don't worry.

121
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,390
You can definitely think of a plot

122
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,650
with a climax that covers several pages.

123
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,150
I'm afraid I don't have enough time.

124
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,600

attending LAST Animation & Art

126
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,030
and makes you fail the exams…

127
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,200
It'd be great if there were
ready-made plots.

128
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,990
Ready-made plots?

129
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,080
Let's go.

130
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,350
Ye Qi, wait for me!

131
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,030
They're all here.

132
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,430
This is a good one.

133
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,190
Lin Mu bought Mei crayfish

134
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,190
to make her happy.

135
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,430
Why was it shot down?

136
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,750
Because Qian Ye's crayfish store
closed down.

137
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,670
What about this?

138
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,590
Because the zodiac sign of the character

139
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,920
is against Qian Ye's Chinese animal sign.

140
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,930
What kind of logic is that?

141
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,470
What's the reason

142
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,470
of the one in my hand being shot down?

143

Do you want to go shopping with me

187
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,280
and have fun?

188
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:13,950
Let's finish the semester

189
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,470
with a great end.

190
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,910
The Comic-Con will begin next week.

191
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,670
I still have a lot to do.

192
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,790
Go get your No.1 fan,

193
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,030
Songsong, to go with you.

194
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:22,830
Stop.

195
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,870
Don't mention him.

196
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,670
I get angry when he's mentioned.

197
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:26,990
Since you two

198
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,390
got into a relationship,

199
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,830
he has been listening to you

200
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,190
and doing everything for you, hasn't he?

201
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,030
Aren't you satisfied?

202
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,150
That was in the past.

203
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,910
Now I finally

204
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,790
see his true colors.

205
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,710
What happened?

206
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,480
Jiang Ruosong!

207
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,430
Senior Jieyue.

208
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,270
You're just in time.

209
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,200
I bought your favorite pork bones.

210
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,070
Did you change

211
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:46,950
my game password?

212
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,670
Was it you?

213
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,870
This game?

214
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,790
Yes, it was me.

215
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,390
It was really you.

216
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,050
Are you looking for a beating?

217
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,830
Senior Jieyue,

218
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,350
you stay up late every day to play games.

219
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,260
You don't eat well either.

220
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,550
Your eyes are red.

221
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,800
Are you teaching me how to live my life?

222
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,590
How dare you!

223
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,070
Do you know how many nights I spent on it?

224
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,600
They were all ruined by you!

225
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,370
Senior Jieyue.

226
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,430
Excuse me.

227
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,270
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,790
I'm starving.

229
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,070
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,950
That's the reason?

231
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,470
I think he's getting arrogant

232
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,600
because of my preference towards him.

233
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,230
But Jieyue,

234
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,430
you used to stay up late
to play with your phone,

235
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,080
and you had conjunctivitis, didn't you?

236
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,230
He did it for your good.

237
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,070
What conjunctivitis?

238
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,390
It's cured. So I never got it.

239
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,520
Stop defending him.

240
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,430
He just ignored my feelings

241
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,150
in the name of being nice to me.

242
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,390
I always feel

243
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,190
that you shouldn't be
so dramatic in a relationship.

244
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,110
Then what should I do instead?

245
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,630
I have no experience in this either.

246
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,590
I won't let this go

247
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,990
unless he apologizes.

248
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,300
Senior Jieyue.

249
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,550
Senior Jieyue.

250
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,270
Senior Jieyue.

251
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,030
I'm here to apologize.

252
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,550
Sorry.

253
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,910
It's too late.

254
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,350
I missed the time to get
the Dragon Slaying Sword.

255
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,840
Isn't the Dragon Slaying Sword given
just by clicking?

256
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,970
I missed the time to get it by clicking.

257
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,310
He's so handsome.

258
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,630
Indeed.

260
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,190
Is the location for
LAST Animation & Art finalized?

261
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,670
Yes.

262
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,670
In Haidu City.

The famous comics mecca.

264
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,430
I can buy more…

265
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,870
I'll book the tickets now.

266
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,230
I've asked Gu to book it.

267
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,760
We're leaving next Monday.

268
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,230
Well,

269
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,550
what else can I, a handsome young man,

270
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,590
do for you?

271
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,380
I have to design the merchandise
for the comic.

272
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,040
Come and help me with Qiandai.

273

274
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,990
I'm going to LAST Animation & Art.

275
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,470
Do you want to go with me?

276
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,960
I have to take the exams.

What are your plans for the holiday?

280

Do you want to go traveling with me?

281
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,080
Look.

282
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,150
There is a high-altitude ropeway,

283

cave exploration,

284
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,110
or swimming with sharks.

285
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,630
Why do you like such scary activities?

286
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,190
Jieyue recommended these to me.

287
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:22,630
Look.

288
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,960
She has made the guides,

289
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,390
but she can't make it.

290
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,460
I can't make it either.

291
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,590
Actually,

292
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,510
we've been hiding something from you.

293
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:35,670

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,860
What are you thinking about?

295
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:42,990
Ye Qi and others

296
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,350
have been coloring
in the apartment, right?

297
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,210
I was there too.

We're all members of Meng Ye Comic Studio.

[Let's Fall in Love]

Aren't you surprised?

314
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,780
We're drawing a girls' comic.

00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,990
Why should I be surprised?

316
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,120
You're capable of doing anything.

317
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,310
Even if you tell me

318
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,110
we're living in Episode 31 of a drama,

319
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,590
I won't be surprised.

320
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,190
But

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,920
why didn't you tell me earlier?

322
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,750
I was afraid that you would
bring your fangirls to Ye Qi's place

323
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,190

have to do with rabbits?

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,839
Of course it has.

353
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,510

00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,690
I'll sort of understand
comic culture, won't I?

376
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,040
What's the protagonist's name again?

377
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,430
Forget it.

378
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,990
I didn't expect Senior Gu to draw

379
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,190
so many buildings.

380
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,670
As the first place in the world of comics,

381
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,070
this Comic-Con must be important

382
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,190
to Senior Gu.

383
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,790
Miss,

384
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,020
come and take a look at
DIY handmade cakes.

385
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,680
Let him taste your sincerity.

386
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,640
This way.

387
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,800
Why is it stinky mandarin fish?

388
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,950
Mr. Gong Jian, you don't like it?

389
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,510
What's the use of me liking it?

390
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,550
I'm not Qian Ye.

391
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,390
Besides, stinky mandarin fish doesn't have
anything to do with the comic.

392
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,250
What kind of merchandise is this?

393
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,520
In fact, the best thing is the Mei doll.

394
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,830
Unfortunately,

395
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,490
I was rejected by the factory.

396
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,990
This doll

397
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,350
is too delicate.

398
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,360
The factory won't have
enough time to make it.

399
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,310
I see.

400
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,630
We can draw a simple version.

401
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,130
How about this?

402
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,310
Her hair can be simpler too.

403
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,550
Good.

404
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,970
But this doll is a three-head figure.

405
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,070
Normally, cute dolls

406
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,730
are two-head figures, right?

407
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:22,830
I see.

408
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,270
The cute version of Mei is so adorable.

409
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,790
In this way,

410
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,110
the fans can carry the Mei doll

411
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,310
with them.

412
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,910
It'll certainly increase

413
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,430
their love for Mei.

414
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,210
I can't believe

415
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,590
they look exactly the same.

416
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,750
When exactly did Ye Qi

417
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,310
fall in love with Qiandai?

418
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:06,590
Alright.

419
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,200
It's her.

420
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,910
We can reach out to the factory

421
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,370
and ask them to
start producing samples now.

422
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,850
The schedule for
LAST Animation & Art is out.

423
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,630
Mr. Gong Jian,

424
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,230
you have a lot of things to do.

425
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,990
Let others handle the communication

426
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,270
with the factory.

427
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,630
Since everyone is so busy,

428
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,750
I'll help you…

429
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,030
I'll help you contact Gu

430
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,360
and let him communicate with the factory.

431
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,400
Why didn't you close your door?

432
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,190
I'm so angry.

433
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,590
Jieyue, why are you here?

434
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,440
He told me the password.

435
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,190
Are you still angry with him?

436
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,270
He actually thinks he's right.

437
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,310
He even made me promise

438
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,340
to play games only 23 hours a day.

439
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,310
What the heck?

440
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,970
Obviously, he doesn't like me

441
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,760
and is going against me.

442
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,030
He's so obedient to you.

443
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,670
There are 24 hours a day.

444
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,910
And he wants to control me for 23 hours.

445
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,670
Why are you laughing?

446
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,560
Your relationship with him

447
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,640
is interesting.

448
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,430
I think I understand.

449
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,160
Do you also think he's annoying?

450
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,680
Sometimes,

451
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,550
the way Ruosong expresses his concern

452
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,110
might be inappropriate.

453
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,150
But your tolerance
towards Ruosong is too low.

454
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,190
I agree with Ye Qi.

455
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,350
When two people are together,

456
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,070
they have to tolerate each other.

457
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,830
You always get angry

458
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,950
because of some trivial matters.

459
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,240
You'll scare Ruosong away sooner or later.

460
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,190
How dare he!

461
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,270
What do you think I should do then?

462
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,410
How about this?

463
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,020
I'll design

464
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,680
a cute doll of Ruosong for you.

465
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,000
Take it with you every day

466
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,150
as if it's him

467
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,770
to increase your tolerance towards him.

468
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,360
The factory is quite fast in shipping.

469
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,030
The doll of Ruosong

470
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,510
has also been shipped to Zhou Jieyue.

471
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,990
Now, everything is ready.

472
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,680
There's one more thing we need to prepare.

473
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,110
The signing event at the Comic-Con.

474
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,610
It's indeed a tricky problem.

475
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,150
Thank you for your hard work.

476
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,440
Have some drinks.

477
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,430
Yuyu.

478
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,910
We're discussing

479
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,910
the signing event at the Comic-Con.

480
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,910
What's there to discuss?

481
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,710
Do you have to customize your signature?

482
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,430
No.

483
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,390
If I show up,

484
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,950
it may influence the comic.

485
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,310
Qian Ye acted on his own,

486
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,190
saying that it'd attract fans

487
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,830
if we promoted it
from the perspective of a female.

488
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,390
So many fans

489
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,700
[Cartoonist: Meng Ye,
a mysterious girls' comics artist]

490
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,230
are coming to the signing event

491
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,690
[No one has seen her since her debut.
It's said that she's a super cute girl]

492
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,690
to see what she looks like.

493
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,190
I see.

494
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,680
What should we do now?

495
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,270
Luckily,

496
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,270
I made a plan.

497
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,190
I prepared the same wig.

498
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,710
Who gave you the courage?

499
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,030
Everyone will be scared.

500
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,810
What a tall and powerful girl.

501
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,570
I have another way.

502
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,160
Maybe we can keep people

503
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,690
from knowing I'm a man.

504
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,230
Hair remover.

505
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,000
Sailor suit.

506
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,790
Little skirt.

507
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,590
Another little skirt.

508
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,650
You've been planning this
for a long time, haven't you?

509
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,350
But there is no way

510
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,550
you can fool them

511
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,630
with these things.

512
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,870
Mr. Gong Jian.

513
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,030
Will it be awful if the fans find out

514
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,230
Meng Ye is a man?

515
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,550
After all, Meng Ye is a cartoonist

516
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,550
who focuses on girls' love stories.

517
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,560
And the comic has always been
promoted like this.

518
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,110
Mei.

519
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,470
What a sad girl!

520
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,750
I can't believe she's created by a man.

521
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,990
I don't trust men anymore.

522
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,110
Why is it a man?

523
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,910
Jerk.

524
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,680
Let's go.

525
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,350
I knew it.

526
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,020
Mr. Gong Jian.

527
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,630
Is it possible

528
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,390
to hold a signing event

529
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,910
where I don't have to show my face
but also pamper the fans?

530
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:47,670
Ye Qi.

531
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,110
Stop your desire.

532
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,110
How about we simulate

533
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,110
the signing event?

534
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,110
What do you think?

535
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,630
Good idea.

536
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,270
Hello, Mr. Meng Ye.

537
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,670
I'm your loyal fan.

538
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,430
Thank you for your support.

539
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,590
Can you give me a hug?

540
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,430
Can I have your autograph?

541
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,310
Can you write

542
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,970
that you like Zuo Qiandai the most
when you sign?

543
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,390
Stop your desire too.

544
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,350
Chai Ziyu.

545
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,720
Why don't you

546
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,830
do the signing?

547
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,870
Why me?

548
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,330
Because you're handsome.

549
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,750
If a handsome guy draws girls' comics,

550
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,750
I'm sure the fans will be delighted.

551
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,790
He's so handsome,

552
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,910
but he's a homebody who hides at home,

553
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,350
lies on the table,

554
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,550
and draws love stories of other people.

555
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,390
I'm not reading it anymore.

556
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:41,950
Let's go.

557
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,410
Let's go. What a homebody.

558
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,150
I don't want to be criticized.

559
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,830
Give it a try.

560
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:52,790
Come on.

561
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,790
Come on.

562
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,350
You must be my fan.

563
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,390
Why are you so nervous like a kitten?

564
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,960
If you can meow for me,

565
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,440
I'll sign it for you.

566
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,030
Say something.

567
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,270
Don't look at me together.

568
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,550
I…

569
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,230
Why should I pretend to be Ye Qi?

570
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,950
Qiandai, come here.

571
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,830
Qiandai.

572
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,190
Good. Very calm.

573
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,950
Let's start.

574
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,110
Miss Meng Ye.

575
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,470
I'm your fan.

576
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,230
I like Lin Mu very much.

577
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,960
Can you talk about
the creation of the character?

578
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,310
Well…

579
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,390
I think…

580
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,790
Well…

581
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,790
I don't know

582
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,680
why Lin Mu is so slow in love.

583
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,400
But I still like his face.

584
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,990
Qiandai.

585
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,990
As a cartoonist,

586
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,470
your answer should be more professional.

587
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,150
You can't tell the truth.

588
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,680
Hello, Miss Meng Ye.

589
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,550
I really like

590
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,110
"Let's Fall in Love."

591
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,470
Thank you.

592
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,350
Keep it up, Qiandai.

593
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,510
But

594
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,590
I don't really understand
the ending of this chapter.

595
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,190
Is there any foreshadowing?

596
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,230
And this line.

597
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,750
Is there any subtext?

598
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,390
Do you think your characters are perfect?

599
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,030
And what have you contributed to society?

600
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,910
Are you here to pick a fight?

601
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,390
After all,

602
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,230
if the fans can't get Meng Ye's autograph

603
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,150
at his signing event,

604
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,070
it doesn't make sense.

605
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,790
We can't explain it to the fans either.

606
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,630
You're right.

607
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,630
This is cheating our fans.

608
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,740
But if we confess directly,

609
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,390
we need to take a risk.

610
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,670
Are we going to take the risk?

611
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,000
I have an idea.

612
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,990
Leave it to me.

613
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,910
It's not anyone's birthday.

614
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,150
Why did you buy a cake?

615
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,510
To celebrate the upcoming highlight

616
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,270
of your life.

617
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,830
I made the cake myself.

618
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,700
You made it yourself?

619
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,590
It looks good.

620
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,870
As the prince of the school,

621
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,400
how could you not
pay attention to your image?

622
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,310
I'll have a taste.

623
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,610
Have you tasted my sincerity?

624
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,550
It's a big cake.

625
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,950
I can't finish it myself.

626
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,830
How about

627
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,300
giving them some?

628
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,400
Senior Gu, what's wrong?

629
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,400
What did you put in it?

630
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,310
Why do I feel so dizzy?

631
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,190
I put some brandy.

632
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,950
Because they said

633
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,830
it'd make the taste of the cake

634
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,150
mellower.

635
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:49,710
Oh no.

636
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,510
Senior Gu.

637
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,640
It turns out he'll get drunk
with a sip of alcohol.

638
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,190
Senior Gu, you're blushing.

639
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,870
It doesn't matter.

640
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,470
You must get famous.

641
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,710
I'm willing to

642
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,510
be the man

643
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,750
behind you.

644
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,030
Why is he so drunk?

645
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,590
Lu Dao.

646
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,830
You are

647
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,150
the member

648
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,910
that I'm most proud of.

649
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,190
You are

650
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,390
good at acting

651
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,070
and courageous.

652
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,710
I admire you

653
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,800
from the bottom of my heart.

654
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,270
He praises me when he's drunk.

655
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,470
Senior Gu.

656
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,950
Do you think

657
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,990
I'm cute?

658
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,590
Yes.

659
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,390
Of course.

660
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,110
I used to be

661
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,350
too harsh on you

662
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,350
because I had high hopes for you.

663
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,680
That was why I was

664
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,390
so strict

665
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,710
and why I often

666
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,350
did chokeholds on you.

667
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,190
I

668
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,270
have been treated you as my brother.

669
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,830
But after I found out
that those were your legs,

670
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,510
I don't know how to face you.

671
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,670
I didn't skip the rehearsal.

672
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,070
Look at my legs.

673
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,330
Are they running away?

674
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,190
No.

675
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,030
How can I have such an idea about Lu Dao?

676
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,550
Please give me some time.

677
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,310
I'll overcome my inner fears.

678
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,150
Until I heard

679
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,200
you said in the Fine Arts Club

680
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,970
that I was your ideal type…

681
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,070
He once won the Best Actress Award.

682
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,390
And he always likes to
have physical contact with me.

683
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,710
He clearly likes me in his heart,

684
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,710
but he just doesn't dare to admit it.

685
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,440
He looks mature on the outside,

686
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,550
but he's actually like
a child on the inside.

687
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,830
Do you know

688
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,030
how happy I was?

689
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,230
Lu Dao.

690
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,530
Let's stay together like this

691
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,310
forever.

692
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,590
Because

693
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,510
you are also

694
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,270
my ideal type.

695
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,590
Senior Gu.

696
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,429
I'm your ideal type too?

697
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,150
Lu Dao.

698
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,810
You skip the rehearsal again.

699
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,590
Senior Gu.

700
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:34,510
I'm sorry.

701
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,949
I shouldn't have

702
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,110
done chokeholds on you.

703
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,830
No.

704
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,590
I…

705
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,790
I'll be gentler to you

706
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,830
from now on.

707
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,590
My shoulder

708
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,750
is only for you.

709
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,550
From now on,

710
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,910
my shoulder

711
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,550
is only for you too,

712
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,150
Ye Qi's method

713
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,750
is not bad.

714
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,590
Songsong,

715
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,950
as long as you come to talk to me,

716
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,910
I will forgive you.

717
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,630
Did you hear me?

718
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,030
So annoying.

719
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,030
Chai.

720
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,510
Did you just finish simulating

721
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,710
the signing event with Ye Qi?

722
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,510
Yes.

723
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,590
Without me,

724
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,150
Ye Qi would be so helpless.

725
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,510
You're right.

726
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,910
I heard about your conflict.

727
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,430
Chai.

728
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,630
Based on your years of research experience

729
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,510
on love relationships,

730
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,270
should I apologize?

731
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,790
Ye Qi always says I'm unreliable.

732
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,470
But Ruosong trusts me so much.

733
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,450
Should I give him some advice?

734
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,150
Since my opinion is unreliable,

735
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,550
I'll give him the opposite idea.

736
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,150
It must be reliable then.

737
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,030
Ruosong.

738
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,710
I think

739
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,690
you shouldn't apologize.

740
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,590
Because this is a good opportunity for you

741
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,720
to take control of your relationship.

742
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,230
What do you mean?

743
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,790
Apologizing is like quitting the game

744
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,050
when you just get matched to an opponent.

745
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,590
You're certain to lose, aren't you?

746
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,470
You're experienced, Chai.

747
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,550
I should've asked you from the start.

748
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,910
I know what to do.

749
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,030
Are you here to see me?

750
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,830
Have you realized your mistake?

751
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,950
No.

Jiang Ruosong.

756
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,470
You asked for it.

757
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,430
I wonder if the fans will be surprised

758
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,520
when they see Meng Ye
at the signing event.

759
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,950
It's better than someone
pretending to be Meng Ye.

760
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,270
You're right.

761
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,830
Thank you for your hard work.

I wouldn't be able to go to LAST.

If it weren't for you,

768
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,920
I wouldn't be able to go to LAST either.

769
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,550
I heard that there are

770
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,270
many interesting scenic spots
in Jinli Mountain.

771
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,130
Do you have any travelling plans?

772
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,270
I haven't thought of it yet.

773
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,470
Alright, you don't have to see me off.

774
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,530
I'll go to the subway station myself.

775

00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,150

783

about this?

791
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,190
I just recovered from
a hangover yesterday.

792
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,050
My brain is a little sluggish now.

793
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,350
Gu, you drank?

794
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,350
Don't mention it.

795
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,690
I remember that I talked to Lu Dao a lot

796
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,670
after I got drunk yesterday.

797
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,470
But I don't remember

798
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,670
what I said at all.

00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,230

Ye Qi.

802
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,750
I think Senior Jieyue and I are
giving each other the silent treatment.

803

You haven't asked me yet.
