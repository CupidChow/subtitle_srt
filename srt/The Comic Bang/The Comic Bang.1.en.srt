00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,930
has been doing freehand drawing.

376
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,270
I think

377
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,590
freehand drawing

378
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,670
shows the soul and quality of comics.

379
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,550
You've drawn so many

380
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,350
sweet girl comics.

381
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,950
Does that mean

382
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,430
you

383
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,670
dated

384
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,870
many girls?

385
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,080
I've never been in a relationship.

386
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,710
But I have a lot of love experience.

387
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,630
Because I often discuss love plots

388
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,910
with people around me.

389
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,150
By the way,

390
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,750
do you have someone you like?

391
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,870
Me?

392
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,670
At first,

393
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,270
I was attracted

394
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,510
because he's tall

395
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,230
and charming.

396
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,450
I plucked up courage to confess my feelings for him,

397
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,110
but I failed to express my feelings.

398
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,710
We are closer to each other now.

399
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,590
Although

400
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,060
it seems he just wants my help.

401
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,530
♫A beam of light♫

402
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,570
♫Infiltrates into my heart♫

403
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,510
What's so good about him?

404
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,500
♫It's like love♫

405
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,870
♫Coming to me silently♫

406
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,550
♫With your face♫

407
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,700
♫In my eyes♫

408
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,880
Although he's totally different from what I thought,

409
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,940
♫I forget how far the future is♫

410
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,830
he's still Ye Qi I like.

411
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,420
♫Immersed between you and me♫

412
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:32,270
I haven't confessed my feelings yet.

413
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,270
I'm going to confess my feelings again

414
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,710
and I'll do it well.

415
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,270
Ye Qi.

416
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,280
♫If the destination of clouds♫

417
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,920
♫Is a rainy day♫

418
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,470
I like...

419
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,240
♫It will turn into fog♫

420
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,970
♫And return to the beginning♫

421
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,310
I've always been your fan.

422
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,280
♫Like time repeating♫

423
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,470
♫Like my attachment♫

424
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,990
♫Things I do with you♫

425
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:03,230
♫Are an adventure♫

426
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,330
♫I want to ask if you can hear♫

427
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,090
♫Birds chirping in the sky♫

428
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,270
I got your autograph again.

429
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,130
♫Like our hearts♫

430
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,870
I'm so happy.

431
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,860
♫Beating on the same frequency♫

432
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,550
♫Wind blowing in ears♫

433
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,710
♫Softens noise in the classroom♫

434
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,050
♫I want to give you a hug♫

435
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,510
Can I...

436
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:29,770
♫Is it a sign of love?♫

437
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,910
Be my assistant?
