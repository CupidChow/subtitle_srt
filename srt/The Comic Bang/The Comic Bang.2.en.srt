00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,590
As a science student,

112
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,830
why did you choose Psychology as your elective course?

113
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,990
And it's the Abnormal Psychology.

114
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,360
Because in my comic book,

115
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,670
there are two supporting roles whose personalities

116
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,910
are different from those of the ordinary people.

117
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,790
I want to find

118
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,920
enough theoretical support for them.

119
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,830
As a straight...

120
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,620
straightforward guy,

121
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,000
why did you choose to draw girls' comics?

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,950
With the abnormal incoherence of thoughts,

123
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,870
the patient would suddenly pause while he's talking.

124
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,670
After a while, he would talk again.

125
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,870
But the content isn't about the original topic.

126
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,390
It mostly occurs in schizophrenia.

127
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,909
I don't have schizophrenia.

128
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:42,920
I'm normal.

129
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,190
I just think

130
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,830
maybe

131
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,270
we can find the mutual effect and relationship

132
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,159
between genes and environment from specific cases.

133
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,390
It's also

134
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,190
a way

135
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,150
to combine the practice and theories.

136
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,810
Why did I choose to draw girls' comics?

137
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,150
That story

138
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,990

145
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,670
Are you kidding me?

146
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,750
I don't think the author's level is good.

147
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,750

148
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,150
Do it if you can.

149
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,310
Okay.

150
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,030
After that, I drew a passionate boys' comic.

151
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,030
I sent it to many magazines.

152
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,870
I thought I wouldn't get any reply.

153
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,470
But to my surprise, after the college entrance exam,

154
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,510
I received a call from the editorial office

155
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,710

156
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,549

162
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,230
Your comic book

163
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,990
is called the Passionate Boys' Comics.

164
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,390
But our magazine

165
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,840
is called Monthly Girls.

166
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,030
Do you understand?

167
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,790
Well,

168
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,070
since the style is incompatible,

169
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,190
why did you ask me to come here?

170
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,030
That's because I'm very insightful.

171
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,390
I found that the couple in the third chapter of your comic book

172
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,370
[I was going to do that]

173
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,990
[They won't defeat me!]

174
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,870
are well drawn.

175
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,590
Let me tell you.

176
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,590
You can draw another girls' comic

177
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,870
with that couple being the female lead and the male lead.

178
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,390
Change the name, too.

179

What is it called?

180

The Trembling High School.

182
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,350
The Trembling High School. Yes.

183
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,960
So funny.

184
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,230
It's awful. So tacky.

185
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,750
It's really tacky.

186
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,110
However, since you're inexperienced,

187
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,720
I've helped you give it a new name.

188
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,950
-A new name?
-Yes.

191
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,710
I've helped you rename it.

192
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,870
It's called

193
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,040
[Let's Fall in Love—written by Meng Ye]

194
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,190
Let's Fall in Love.

195
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,470
At first,

196
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,990
I wasn't willing to do it.

197
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,110
But since I had promised him,

198
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,320
I had to do my best to continue it.

199
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,150
So I've kept drawing it.

200
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,790
But now,

201
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,450
I like girls' comics more.

202
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,830
It's a huge leap.

203
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,150
Fortunately, the inspiration of my comics

204
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,810
is acquired from the reality.

205
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,150
All characters have their archetypes.

206
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,090
They all have archetypes?

207
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,030
Of course.

208
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,750
Well,

209
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,990
Mei also has her archetype?

210
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,390
Of course.

211
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,230
No wonder you've depicted

212
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,030
Mei so vividly.

213
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,270

218

222
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,150
It's more about her own experience.

223
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,110
I drew it after I

224
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,390
learnt about it.

225
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,830
So you're not that close to each other, are you?

226
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,630
I would ask her to come

227
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,790
when I need it.

231
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,070
Do you have any new understanding

232
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,230
about the environment and genes?

233
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,790
I would ask her to come

I've heard that you're great.

238
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,680
I finally have the chance to learn about it today.

239
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,070
Let's get started.

240
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,230
I'll do all my best then.

You want to know her?

246
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,350
It makes sense.

247
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,270
After all, both of you

248
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,590
are my assistants now.

249
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,030
You should get to know each other.

250
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,190
But no hurry.

251
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,990
You will see each other sooner or later.

252
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,780
Because

253
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,270
she is in this school.

258
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,310
Sure.

Mei, your meal is here.

260
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,080
You must have fetched meals for many other girls.

261
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,960
I don't want it.

262
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,390
There must be other people who once sat on it besides me.

263
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,720
I don't want to sit on it.

264
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,050
She doesn't even eat her meal.

265
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,400
That's what Mei is like.

266
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,380
But the way she runs doesn't look like Mei's.

267

269

Don't stop me from pursuing love.

This is my another assistant,

282
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,430
But everyone always mistakenly calls him

Yu Zichai.

284
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,310
So you can also call him Yu Zichai.

Yes.

He shouldn't have said in the first place.

But don't tell him.

He doesn't know it yet.

312
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,030
It'll affect my observation of him.

don't ask me.

This is the exclusive mark Ye Qi gave me.

Then this pattern

he has been acting weird.

327
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,750
It seems he wants you to ask him for advice.

328
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,430
How about

329
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,230
you go to ask him for some advice?

330
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,850

332
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,350
Could you tell me how to blacken hair like this?

333
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,870
It's so simple but you don't know how to do it.

334

you can mark the position of the hair whorl.

338
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,590

339
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,510
Imagine the growth principle of hair.

340
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,990

00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,150
Ye Qi.

377
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,070
Come on.

378
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,350
Firstly,

379
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,710
I'll draw a character.

380
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,310
Then

381
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,640
I'll hand it over to Qiandai to blacken.

382
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,710
Yuyu, it's amazing.

383
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:17,870
For things like

384
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:18,990
flowers and small objects

385
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,990
that can improve the charm of a character,

386
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,190
just leave them to me,

387
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,310
as I have a deep understanding

388
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,910
about charm.

389
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,680
The draft was rejected.

390
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,830
Is it the episode about the tandem bicycle?

391
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,550
It's okay.

392
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,230
If this one didn't pass,

393
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,890
let's think of some new plots.

394
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,150
Cheer up.

395
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,150
Actually,

396
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,790
you don't have to comfort me.

397
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,870
A draft being rejected

398
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,630
often happens to a cartoonist.

399
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,690
It's easy for you to say it.

400
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,540
Let's Fall in Love has always been on the top.

401
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,550
Its ranking suddenly fell to the second previously,

402
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,790
and it has stayed there till now.

403
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,350
It was useless to replace the plots with many interesting ones.

404
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,750
That's not common.

405
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,750
This is a bottleneck for us, okay?

406
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,350
It's a bit difficult to continue the storyline.

407
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,230
I think we've almost described everything

408
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,430
that the two main characters can do.

409
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,380
I have an idea.

410
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,870
Add a new character.

411
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,470
According to my years of experience of watching dramas,

412
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,390
when it's difficult to continue a story halfway,

413
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,590
a new character

414
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,070
would appear out of nowhere

415
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,070
so as to push the development of the plots.

416
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,910
We call people like this

417
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,030
tool men.

418
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,020
Then

419
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,470
let's add a supporting role.

420
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,390
But

421
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,470
who should be the archetype?

422
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,670
I can recommend my friend,

423
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,830
who is just a little

424
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,950
less charming than me.

425
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,310
In our school,

426
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,230
there's no girl whom he can't chat up.

427
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,960
The Prince of Dongsheng is him.

428
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,790
The Prince of Dongsheng?

429
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,950
Interesting.

430
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,310
Chai Ziyu.

431
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,230
The color of your hair looks good, too.

432
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,360
Do you have time to have coffee with me?

433
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,790
You're so popular among girls.

434
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,190
Do you have a girlfriend?

435
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,790
I don't belong to anyone.

436
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,070
Because

437
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,430
I'll always be a hunter of love.

438
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,830
Yuyu.

439
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,830
Are you being shy?

440
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,670
Don't be shy.

441
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,190
I'm also embarrassed when you're shy.

442
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,790
Who's shy?

443
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,160
Besides,

444
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,590
don't call me Yuyu.

445
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,830
Sorry, Chai Ziyu.

446
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,510
It's okay.

447
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,820
Qianqian.

448
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,360
Come on. Respond to my joke.

449
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,110
Ye Qi.

450
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:58,990
You're here.

451
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,440
I wonder

452
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,110
what the Prince of Dongsheng looks like.

453
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,000
He should be here soon.

454
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,720
Hello, everyone.

455
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,380
I'm Lu Dao from the drama club.

456
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,150
So handsome.

457
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,870
So handsome!

458
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,390
Lu Dao, good morning.

459
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,210
You've changed your shampoo?

460
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,990
Is there anything wrong?

461
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:41,750
No.

462
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,200
I just thought

463
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,110
a rose fairy had shown up.

464
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,510
Is she saying her lines?

465
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,190
She's from the drama club.

466
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,430
It's surprising that she should say those words

467
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,190
without feeling shy.

468
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,150
That's what a prince is like.

469
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,230
This is a comment from boys.

470
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,820
Lu Dao, it's been a long time since we met last time.

471
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,070
Do you remember me?

472
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,510
Of course.

473
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,470
Your cute face

474
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,590
has always been kept in my mind.

475
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,910
Then call my name.

476
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,230
Then I'll call you

477
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,990
my princess. Is it okay?

478
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,200
She managed to muddle through.

479
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,430
Wait for me.

480
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,600
Waiting for you.

481
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,120
Waiting for you.

482
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,790
As the saying goes,

483
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,430
handsome guys are the same.

484
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,030
Two people who are so similar

485
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,720
either become best friends

486
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,390
or best enemies.

487
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:47,920
Fortunately, we became good friends

488
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,190
at the first meeting.

489
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,990
Don't you know me?

490
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,270
I thought

491
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,430
I was famous in Dongsheng.

492
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,510
That's because I've only paid attention to

493
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,510
Ye Qi for the past two years.

494
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,470
Lu Dao is so handsome.

495
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,590
I'm blushing after looking at her face for so long.

496
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,270
It's easier to stand next to Yuyu.

497
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,000
He gives me an amiable feeling.

498
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,800
I... I also give people a sense of distance, okay?

499
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,270
By the way,

500
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,030
it seems the three of you

501
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,830
are of different styles.

502
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,190
How did you get together?

503
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,030
How should I explain it?

504
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,790
Friends?

505
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,630
But if I confirm

506
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,470
I'm just his friend now,

507
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,350
how can I pursue Ye Qi in the future?

508
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,200
If Lu Dao finds out I stay at home to draw comics,

509
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,790
the gap between us will be even further.

510
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,850
How should I put it?

511
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,330
Because the three of us often stay at my home.

512
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,590
To be specific,

513
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,510
we stay at my home to do things together.

514
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,440
Do you have to explain it like that?

515
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:55,910
Oh, no!

516
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,750
Time's up.

517
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,290
He's coming to pick you up?

518
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,990
Is it like a fairy tale where

519
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,950
there is a prince and a princess?

520
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,910
When time is up, a pumpkin carriage will come to pick you up?

521
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,640
What a great sense of occasion!

522
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,630
Lu Dao!

523
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,230
You're late again.

524
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,350
How many times have I told you? I hate people being late.

525
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,210
Go and have the rehearsal with me.

526
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,310
Gu, the script.

527
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,330
Is he trying to take revenge on Lu Dao?

528
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,530
He's the president of the drama club, Gu Zhengxing.

529
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,430
Ye Qi.

530
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,390
Have you revised the script I asked you to revise?

531
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,320
I've almost finished. I'll revise it when I get back.

532
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,510
Lu Dao.

533
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,510
Can we still have milk tea together?

534
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,750
I'll sneak out to find you.

535
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,640
Wait for me.

536
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,240
Okay. I'll wait for you.

537
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,830
Gu's way of treating Lu Dao

538
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,630
is so unique.

539
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,720
I didn't expect Ye Qi could write scripts.

540
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,590
What a treasure boy.

541
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,370
I'll go to class now.

542
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,630
By the way, Yuyu,

543
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,830
since you get shy so easily,

544
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,230
why do you use a pair of briefs to be the mark?

545
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,670
Briefs?

546
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,630
The mark left for you

547
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,510
is a pair of briefs, isn't it?

548
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,710
It's not for me.

549
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,470
It's for the background assistant.

550
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,600
Aren't you the background assistant?

551
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,590
No, no.

552
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,960
You don't understand, do you?

553
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,190
A background assistant is to draw the buildings in the background.

554
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,270
I'm the effect assistant.

555
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,190
My job is to draw things like

556
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,550
flowers for the characters and the background

557
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,430
so as to increase the image effect.

558
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,830
They are two completely different concepts.

559
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,690
Who's the background assistant?

560
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,140
I don't know him, either.

561
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,190
But sometimes,

562
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,120
he spends the night at Ye Qi's home.

563
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,070
He seems to be a mysterious person.

564
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,430
I've heard that you're great.

565
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,230
How come he also spends the night there?

566
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,550
I won't be fooled again.

567
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,340
I'm sure it's a man who uses briefs as the mark.

568
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,200
Gu, the script.

569
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,640
[An Invisible Love Rival—directed & written by Gu Zhengxing, and starring Lu Dao]

570
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,790
Could it be Lu Dao?

571
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,710
That's impossible.

572
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,550
Ye Qi has just met her.

573
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,750
It must be a misunderstanding.

574
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,080
It must be a misunderstanding.

575
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:16,190
[Auditorium]

576
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,950
Lu Dao.

577
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,350
Were you okay just now?

578
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,110
I was fine.

579
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,510
I'm used to it.

580
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,390
Actually,

581
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,350
I have something to ask you.

582
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,910
What is it?

583
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,990
Is your mark on it?

584
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,720
What mark? I don't understand.

585
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,590
If you have to choose one, which one do you choose?

586
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,190
This one.

587
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,550
It looks more powerful.

588
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,390
Luckily, it isn't you.

589
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,720
But

590
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,430
who is that person?

591
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,030
Qiandai.

592
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,930
I've heard you're a member of the Fine Arts Club.

593
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,350
Can you color these props for me?

594
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,550
Okay.

595
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,160
Qiandai, you're an angel.

596
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,690
Love you.

597
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,470
Lu Dao.

598
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,230
Can you say these lines for me?

599
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,030
I'm coming.

600
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,450
Love you, Qiandai.
