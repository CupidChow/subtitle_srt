190
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,590
I found the desserts here are pretty good,

191
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,830
so I brought you one.

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,060
You didn't even buy one for yourself.

193
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,840
This is mine.

194
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,150
Anyway,

195
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,310
we've completed the challenge, right?

196
00:10:59,310 --> 00:10:59,990
Of course.

197
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,630
Although there were twists and turns,

198
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,030
we still

199
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,890
found each other without phones.

200
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,110
To celebrate this small victory,

201
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,090
let's take these two cakes

202
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,030
as our rewards.

203
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,190
Hi, it's 170 yuan in total.

204
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,990
Qiandai, do you have cash?

205
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,950
It's okay, sir.

206
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,710
We also receive payments by phone.

207
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,110
You can pay with
the QR code or a credit card.

208
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,030
Is there any other way

209
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,830
other than these two ways to pay?

210
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,270
Other way?

211
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,190
What do you mean, sir?

212
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,430
For example,

213
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,290
the exchange of goods.

214
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,100
[Meng Ye]

215
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,190
I'm a cartoonist.

216
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,270
This is my autograph.

217
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,710
Based on the market price,

218
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,030
the value of this signature

219
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,390
is equal to the price of these two cakes.

220
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,550
Sir,

221
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,830
do you want to get out by yourself

222
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,290
or should I call security?

223
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,550
It doesn't matter if we can't buy a cake.

224
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,630
Take it as a diet.

225
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,130
But I haven't bought
anything the whole day.

226
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,940
I don't think it's a successful challenge.

227
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,390
But we don't have money.

228
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,590
How can we buy things?

229
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,900
With these hands,

230
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,990
I can make money.

231
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,790
College students are making money

232
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,910
by sketching on the street.

233
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,310
Take a look. Don't miss it.

234
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,070
It won't work if you shout like this.

235
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,710
Look at me.

236
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,470
A sketch by the cartoonist
of Monthly Girls on the street.

237
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,130
If you miss it, you'll wait
for another 10 years.

238
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,150
A sketch by the cartoonist
of Monthly Girls on the street.

239
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,810
If you miss it, you'll wait
for another 10 years.

240
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,710
A sketch by the cartoonist
of Monthly Girls

241
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,910
on the street.

242
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,430
If you miss it, you'll wait
for another 10 years.

243
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,230
How much is it?

244
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,990
20 yuan for one.

245
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,590
Draw one for me.

246
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,250
Are you a fan of Monthly Girls?

247
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,670
I don't know what that is.

248
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,350
Let's get started.

249
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,110
One for each.

250
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,590
Okay.

251
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,590
Thank you.

252
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,270
Senior.

253
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,550
You chose this fiction movie?

254
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,870
Do you like watching movies?

255
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,750
Of course.

256
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,950
I'm a fan of Nolan.

257
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,590
I've watched his Ready Player One

258
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,540
for many times.

259
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,250
By the way, Senior,

260
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,030
have you ever noticed

261
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,870
which side of the armrests you perfer

262
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,270
to put your arm on when you watch movies,

263
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,430
left or right?

264
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,030
I've never noticed that.

265
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,430
But I have a strong sense
of personal boundaries.

266
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,670
I think it's the same

267
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,750
with the armrests.

268
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,800
That's good.

269
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,120
Let's go.

270
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,190
Later, you'll know

271
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,510
who is the real boss.

272
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,870
When you can't figure it out and ask me,

273
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,230
I will take back

274
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,550
my lost dignity.

275
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,390
Senior.

276
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,000
Did you cross the boundary?

277
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,650
Sorry, I didn't realise that.

278
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,000
Do you want some?

279
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,270
No.

280
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,470
It's starting.

281
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,790
There's no one around.

282
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,120
It's like we're taking up the whole place.

283
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,800
Just focus on watching.

284
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,950
Don't beg me if you don't
understand the plot.

285
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,550
Well, I prefer soda water.

286
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,070
No, you don't.

287
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,750
Don't!

288
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,390
Is it so funny that the heroine got hurt?

289
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,230
Is she taking the perspective
of the villain?

290
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,790
She's laughing loudly
even after the villain was killed.

291
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,910
It seems that she's watching it

292
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,190
from the perspective of the Grim Reaper.

293
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,370
It's done. Take a look.

294
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,530
Well...

295
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,109
What is this?

296
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,750
It's not realistic at all.

297
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,829
Look at the eyes.

298
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,910
Look at the mouth.

299
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,829
You didn't get my good looks.

300
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,750
Look at this one.

301
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,470
Nice drawing.

302
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,550
You totally got my good looks.

303
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,190
It's one hundred percent real.

304
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,830
You're indeed the cartoonist
of Motherly Girls.

305
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,690
Monthly Girls.

306
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:30,750
Whatever.

307
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,210
So handsome and talented.

308
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,990
You even noticed my talent, huh?

309
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,430
I can also tell

310
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,690
that you are very real,

311
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,590
loving and smart.

312
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,430
You can be a great friend.

313
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,150
You saw through me.

314
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,830
I must treat you to dinner.

315
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,690
You must when you have the chance.

316
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,070
Thank you.

317
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,630
Qiandai, what would you like to drink?

318
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,550
Anything.

319
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,560
[Milk Tea]

320
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,710
Please get me one

321
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,310
Rua Rua Brother Treated Me Rua Rua Milk Tea.

322
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,430
Give me a cup of Rua...

323
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,430
A cup of Rua Tea.

324
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,310
Okay.

325
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,030
Hold on.

326
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,060
Here's your Rua Tea.

327
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,830
Thank you.

328
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,550
Thank you.

329
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,350
Hello, a cup of green tea.

330
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,630
I want green tea, too.

331
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,070
What about you?

332
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,190
I'm not thirsty.

333
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,270
Drink up.

334
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,450
If you don't mind, we can share it.

335
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,430
What am I doing?

336
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:50,910
I just

337
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,190
gave him the milk tea I had drunk.

338
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,510
If he drinks it, it's indirect kissing.

339
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,310
No, I'm not ready yet.

340
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,990
But it's weird to take it back now.

341
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,980
[Come on, come on, come on!]

342
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,780
[Tunnel's closed, gate's sealed.]

343
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,950
Senior.

344
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,630
Se...

345
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,000
She fell asleep.

346
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,070
She might be embarrassed

347
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,910
when she wakes up.

348
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,750
I'm hungry.

349
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,910
I thought too much.

350
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,030
Interesting.

351
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,150
It's not that hard to understand as said.

352
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,230
Did you get it?

353
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,830
Of course.

354
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,630
Ask me if you have any questions.

355
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,070
I didn't understand

356
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,630
how Nil saved the hero at the end.

357
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,470
Nil.

358
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,430
Is she that tall girl?

359
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,910
She's the heroine.

360
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,710
It doesn't matter.

361
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,110
Don't you think

362
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,870
the one who rides that
motorcycle is so cute?

363
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,670
A motorcycle?

364
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,510
Where's the motorcycle from?

365
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,340
Did you watch the movie?

366
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,510
Did we watch the same movie?

367
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,870
It's nice chatting after
watching the movie together.

368
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,400
Is there anything else
you don't understand?

369
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,630
Can I tell you how I feel?

370
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,240
Sure.

371
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,950
Can you please not

372
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,750
ask me out again to humiliate me?

373
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,950
To humiliate you?

374
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,960
I know

375
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,030
you said and did everything

376
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,990
on purpose.

377
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,270
One can be destroyed

378
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,530
but never be defeated.

379
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,910
Especially after watching this movie,

380
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,870
I'm more certain

381
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,750
I will never be defeated.

382
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,590
Destroyed?

383
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,540
Defeated?

384
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,830
Is he talking about the movie?

385
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,880
Don't mess with me anymore.

386
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,110
Are you mad because you
didn't understand the movie?

387
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,150
Cute.

388
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,270
I know how to buy things

389
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,590
without money.

390
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,550
Do you have the membership of this store?

391
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,470
I've topped up hundreds of yuan in it.

392
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,190
It should be enough to buy these.

393
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,510
It's 78 yuan in total.

394
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,350
Hello, I have a membership.

395
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,010
Please show me your membership card.

396
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,190
I didn't take my card with me.
Can I give you the card number?

397
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:42,830
Sure.

398
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,270
How many digits are there?

399
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,350
18.

400
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,190
If you don't remember,

401
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,320
you can also tell us your phone number.

402
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,750
1573983256.

403
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,070
The password is 000327.

404
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,870
The password is my birthday.

405
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,000
Can you remember it?

406
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,530
Why should I remember your password?

407
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,830
I want you to remember my birthday.

408
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,240
But the password of
the electronic lock of my home

409
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,370
is also my birthday.

410
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,480
Got something unexpected.

411
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,670
The password is correct.

412
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,150
Please tell me the verification code

413
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,110
sent to your phone,

414
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,840
then the payment is completed.

415
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,910
The password is correct.

416
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,070
Do you still need the verification code?

417
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,670
Yes.

418
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,750
The purpose is to provide safer

419
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,810
and securer services for customers.

420
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,790
I didn't expect that

421
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,710
there would be so much trouble

422
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,550
without a phone.

423
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,670
It's good, too.

424
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,870
Although we didn't buy any delicious food,

425
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,270
when we don't have phones,

426
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,510
we will pay more attention

427
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,840
to the people around us.

428
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,190
It's weird.

429
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,710
I don't have any money today,

430
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,750
but I'm not worried.

431
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,390
Maybe it's because

432
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,790
I have you by my side.

433
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,230
I'm hungry, too.

434
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,830
Let's go to my place

435
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,890
and have some food.

436
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,160
Sure.

437
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,170
Let's ask Chai to go together.

438
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,920
-Chai Ziyu!
-Chai Ziyu!

439
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,190
How come I left him there?

440
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,200
Sir.

441
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,510
How many times have I told you?

442
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,400
I really don't know them.

443
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,590
I don't sell knock-off phones.

444
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,550
Then why do you have this iPhone 18?

445
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,190
We were doing a "No Phone Challenge."

446
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,450
No one took our phones.

447
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,830
Later,

448
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,150
I couldn't find them.

449
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,150
Young man,

450
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,480
do you want an iPhone 18?

451
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,430
No.

452
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,950
It's really good. Try it.

453
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,310
No, thanks.

454
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,950
Try it.

455
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:42,840
It's really useful.

456
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,310
Fine.

457
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,710
You think I can't arrest you?

458
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,150
Sir, I...

459
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,630
Shut up and go.

460
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,950
I...

461
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,550
I just want to use them

462
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,070
to contact my friends.

463
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,030
Since neither of you took phones with you,

464
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,230
who were you calling?

465
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:10,960
[Police Station]

466
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,390
Chai Ziyu.

467
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,340
Yuyu!

468
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,950
Where... Where did you go?

469
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,870
Help me!

470
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,710
Ye Qi.

471
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,880
Hello, sir.

472
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,630
Qian...

473
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,110
I will never

474
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,710
take any challenge.

475
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,670
Who proposed not to take phones?

476
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,870
You can't live without phones, OK?

477
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,890
Today's challenge

478
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,750
proves what Gong Shihei said was right.

479
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,990
There's something wrong with my comics.

480
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,950
I was just complaining about

481
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,950
today's challenge.

482
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,410
It doesn't mean anything.

483
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,730
Comics are definitely
different from reality.

484
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,390
I think Yuyu is right.

485
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,130
You did nothing wrong.

486
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,510
You don't have to comfort me.

487
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,350
It's okay.

488
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,840
I really think you're right.

489
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,670
Firstly,

490
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,790
you just want

491
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,710
the comics to be more exciting,

492
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,510
so you sacrifice a bit logic.

493
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,430
As long as you solve this,

494
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,270
the quality of the comics
will be improved.

495
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,110
Secondly,

496
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,830
you did a lot

497
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,560
to verify the logic of the plot.

498
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,830
If Gong Shihei finds out,

499
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,990
she'll definitely think your comics

500
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,390
can be better and better.

501
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,310
But I think

502
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,790
that's not what Gong Shihei thinks.

503
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,390
Let's post this

504
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,030
in her comments.

505
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,390
My phone.

506
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,350
Don't comment.

507
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,190
She already knows.

508
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,190
Because

509
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,310
I'm Gong Shihei.
