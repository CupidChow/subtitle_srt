369
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,470
I'm suffering from insomnia

370
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,950
and starting to lose hair.

371
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,590
Next,

372
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,150
my skin will be dry,

373
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,160
and I'll be easily distracted.

374
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,440
My vision will blur.

375
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,070
In the end,

376
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,130
I'll die suddenly.

377
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,310
I'll die before I achieve anything.

378
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,030
My comic career will be over
just like that.

379
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,270
You want us to sleep for you again?

380
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,930
It's insomnia caused by anxiety.

381
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,070
We just need to find a way

382
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,990
to cure your insomnia.

383
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,050
Then it'll be fine.

384
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,550
Qiandai,

385
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,610
you understand me.

386
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,790
My insomnia was cured here

387
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,310
at Ye Qi's place.

388
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,910
Now he has the same problem.

389
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,030
It's time for me to repay you.

390
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,640
Yes.

391
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,630
Ruosong's insomnia

392
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,670
was cured by Loreley's singing.

393
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,270
Maybe

394
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,470
it'll work on you too.

395
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,830
Wait a second.

396
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,790
It's totally useless.

397
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,440
After all, it's Zhou Jieyue's voice.

398
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:49,990
Ruosong.

399
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,710
Turn it off.

400
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,430
What did you say?

401
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,550
What the heck?

402
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,350
He got himself hypnotized.

403
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,160
Let me try.

404
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,870
Sometimes when I can't sleep,

405
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,230
I usually

406
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,430
do meditation.

407
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,630
Meditation?

408
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,190
Sounds reliable.

409
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,510
Use it on me.

410
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,260
Put your hands on your tummy.

411
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,270
Close your eyes.

412
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,590
Feel your breath.

413
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,590
Imagine

414
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,110
you are

415
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,270
on the endless sea.

416
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,870
Under your feet,

417
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,990
there's blue sea water.

418
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,150
Open your arms

419
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,750
and breathe the wet air.

420
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,310
Look far away.

421
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,870
There,

422
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,390
you see a girl's back.

423
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,950
You walk up

424
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,430
and pat her shoulder.

425
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,710
She turns around.

426
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,830
And it turns out to be the one
you care about the most…

427
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,190
Lu Dao.

428
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,190
I'm sorry.

429
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,910
I forgot that I was hypnotizing Ye Qi.

430
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,550
I'll try again. Again.

431
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,350
Close your eyes.

432
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,200
Feel…

433
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,670
No! No!

434
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,750
Once I close my eyes, all I see is Lu Dao.

435
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,910
It's haunting.

436
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,790
I've tried my best.

437
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,590
You guys, figure something out.

438
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,150
Good.

439
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,310
You can't sleep anyway.

440
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,550
Why don't you

441
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,350
play this new game with me?

442
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,190
This game

443
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,390
adopts a new cultivation system.

444
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,550
He wants to rest. Why…

445
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,550
Why did you ask him to play games?

446
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,550
-Leave now.
-Why are you pushing me?

447
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,430
Ye Qi, we're leaving then.

448
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,090
Let's play together then.

449
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,350
Sure.

450
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,550
A man and a woman,

451
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,830
alone in the same room,

452
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,430
talk about sleeping.

453
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,590
Qiandai.

454
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,190
Promise me.

455
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,830
Don't leave.

456
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,630
The atmosphere is getting weirder.

457
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,470
Qiandai.

458
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,550
Hold on.

459
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,070
Don't worry.

460
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,230
I won't leave.

461
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,950
Insomnia caused by anxiety…

462
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,230
I'll search it online

463
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,350
and see what to do.

464
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,710
Maybe there're methods online.

465
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,950
[What should I do if I have insomnia
caused by anxiety?]

466
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,940
[Best answer: Don't be anxious]

467
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,610
What's the use of this search engine?

468
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,230
Ye Qi.

469
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,190
How about

470
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,840
you stop thinking about comics?

471
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,190
How can I stop thinking about it?

472
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,390
Unless I'm in a dream.

473
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,110
Is there any way

474
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,310
to cure insomnia in the comics?

475
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,950
I got an idea.

476
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,910
Such a shameful move.

477
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,710
If

478
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,270
I have to do this,

479
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,630
can I not wear a sailor suit?

480
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,230
If you put your head on my legs,

481
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,160
the blood vessels on my thighs
will be pressed,

482
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,390
which will cause poor blood flow

483
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,550
and a lack of blood in the brain.

484
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,950
Then I'll feel sleepy.

485
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,370
I don't think that's how it works.

486
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,960
I also have another way.

487
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,550
When I was little,
I went to the haunted house.

488
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,960
I was so scared that I couldn't sleep.

489
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,790
My mom hummed a song for me

490
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,400
and made me fall asleep.

491
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,000
What song?

492
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:41,830
Tell me.

493
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,030
Let me hum it for you.

494
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,200
A Song to Tough Guys.

495
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,670
What the heck?

496
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,790
She sang a slow version of it.

497
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,070
It was very lyrical.

498
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,230
I'll try then.

499
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,300

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,280

how great it would be.
