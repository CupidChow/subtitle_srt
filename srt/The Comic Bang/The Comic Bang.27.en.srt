00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,850
Can I have your autograph?

191
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,990
I can't say no to you.

192
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,720
[Zhou Loreley Jieyue]

193
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,670
So your name is Zhou Loreley Jieyue?

194
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,270
Are you stupid?

195
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,130
My name is Zhou Jieyue. Thank you.

196
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,990
I misunderstood.

197
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,230
Actually, I always have a wish.

198
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,630
I hope I can ask Loreley to help me

199
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,750
when I see her.

200
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,670
Are you thinking of

201
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,550
letting me sing a song

202
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,790
with my beautiful voice?

203
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,670
Then listen.

204
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,430
No, no, no.

205
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,030
It turns out slow songs
can make him fall asleep faster.

206
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,070
Are you crazy?

207
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,870
An aloof beauty.

208
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,470
has become like this.

209
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,680
I can't stand it.

210
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,350
I'm going to see Ye Qi.

211
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,790
I'm Li Lei sitting next to you.

212
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,670
Nice to meet you.

213
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,790
I'm so lucky to sit in the last row.

214
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,310
I won't be found
even if I sleep in class.

215
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,630
What exactly

216
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,950
would a cold person say?

217
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,870
[Good luck]

218
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,350
Actually, I've always…

219
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,030
Wait.

220
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,270
Just go.

221
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,310
Is Qiandai

222
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,070
mad at me?

223
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,820
[Good luck]

224
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,910
It seems that he's drawing a comic
about a cold female lead.

225
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,270
So in his eyes,

226
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,730
the new issue of the comic
is more important than a confession.

227
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,920
I guess he's really in trouble.

228
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,110
She really got mad at me.

229
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,550
But no matter how mad she is,

230
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,830
it's only natural.

231
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,030
Qiandai, what happened yesterday…

232
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,320
[Cut the crap]

233
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,950
Is she going to

234
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,470
punish me by not saying anything?

235
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,790
Qiandai,

236
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,950
what did you have

237
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,190
for lunch today?

238
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,930
[Ramen and pineapple bread in the canteen
& chocolate bread]

239
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,710
You have a good appetite.

240
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,710
It doesn't seem to be a punishment.

241
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,710
In that case,

242
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,150
why doesn't she speak?

243
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,720
How did you

244
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,310
eat the ramen?

245
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,110
She'd rather perform it than say it.

246
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,990
That is

247
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,829
easy to understand.

248
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,310
Qiandai.

249
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,310
Are you okay?

250
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,400
[Is this cool enough?]

251
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,630
I've played a cool girl

252
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,780
to the extreme.

253
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,640
Ye Qi.

254
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,150
Don't let me down.

255
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,950
That's not what cool means, right?

256
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,830
Is she…

257
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,790
Is she not being mad at me

258
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,030
but helping me find inspiration?

259
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,010
[I didn't say that]

260
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,190
Qiandai.

261
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,110
Thank you.

262
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,590
You're still thinking of

263
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,920
helping me at this time.

264
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,230
Once I'm done
with Mr. Gong Jian's matters,

265
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,390
I'll continue

266
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,910
to finish that thing.

267
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,670
It didn't count last time.

268
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,330
It will go smoothly next time.

269
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,030
I'm going home.

270
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,070
I didn't wake you up
since you were asleep.

271
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,870
Do your best, Ye Qi.

272
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:43,180
[You Li]

273
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,630
Ye Qi, I heard from the editorial office

274
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,180
that you're going to
terminate the contract with Qian Ye.

275
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:50,950
[Ye Qi]

276
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,270
I haven't decided yet. What's wrong?

277
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:57,340
[You Li]

278
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,830
If you quit,

279
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,910
take me with you.

280
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,190
I've had enough too.

281
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,870
What happened?

282
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,720
[Ye Qi]

283
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,310
Senior You Li.

284
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,390
Are you moving?

285
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,390
Yes.

286
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,130
I'll change the environment
and start over.

287
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,510
Have you made up your mind

288
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,570
to end the contract with the company?

289
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,350
But if the contract hasn't expired yet,

290
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,750
you'll have to pay the liquidated damages.

291
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,910
It's fine.

292
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,990
I'll pay for my freedom.

293
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,790
It's worth it.

294
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,750
Then,

295
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,870
what made you make this decision?

296
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,030
You must have read my comic.

297
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,750
What do you think?

298
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,550
I think…

299
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,670
I know it

300
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,070
even if you don't tell me.

301
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,710
I used to live in a world of self-comfort

302
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,870
and blocked the sound of criticism.

303
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,070
But last night, I saw a comment

304
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,190
on my website.

305
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,230
I suddenly feel

306
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,760
that I can't go on like this.

307
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,190
What comment?

308
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,870
He said

309
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,390
he was my fan

310
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,910
and liked my previous comics.

311
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,230
But now my comic

312
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,360
is getting weirder.

313
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,230
He started to worry

314
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,760
that if there's something
wrong with my life.

315
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,590
He even thought
someone forced me to draw like this.

316
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,440
He guessed it right.

317
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,160
Qian Ye did force you

318
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,190
to draw many things.

319
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,950
Actually, I've tried to
stand up to Qian Ye.

320
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,590
But it always

321
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,670
ended up with my apology.

322
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,430
Why did you have to apologize to him?

323
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,020
Maybe

324
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,830
I'm a coward.

325
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,880
And I don't have

326
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,070
an executive editor like Mr. Gong Jian,

327
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,590
who can protect me from it.

328
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,710
That's why my comic became like this.

329
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,690
[Yes, I was the one
who had a question for him first.]

330
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,480
[The person who Senior likes is me.]

00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,670
"Let's Fall in Love"

332
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,390
hasn't failed,

333
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,190
and I owe it all to Mr. Gong Jian

334
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,190
who stood up to Qian Ye for me.

335
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,150
Senior You Li.

336
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,790
Your comic

337
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,120
shouldn't be like this.

338
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,830
No matter what decision you make,

339
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,830
I'll support you.

340
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,390
Thank you.

341
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,590
By the way,

342
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,030
I heard

343
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,290
that Mr. Gong Jian resigned two days ago.

344
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,230
I wonder how he's doing.

345
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,470
Hello?

346
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,230
Yes, I am.

347
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,510
I can come to work tomorrow.

348
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,870
Sure.

349
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,630
Okay.

350
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,630
What?

351
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,030
How much?

352
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,240
800 yuan installation fee?

353
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,320
[Unknown Caller; the number
has been marked as a scam by 68 people]

354

Ye Qi.

355
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,070
Why are you here?

356
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,830
I was just passing by,

357
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,350
so I came to see you.

358
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,990
[Outstanding Executive Editor, Gong Jian]

359
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,110
Thank you, Mr. Gong Jian.

360
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,270
The meal is coming.

361
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,390
The meal is coming. Take it easy.

362
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,270
Here comes the meal.

363
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,990
Mr. Gong Jian…

364
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,030
You're off work

365
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,710
so early today.

366
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,150
Yes.

367
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,870
It's our boss's birthday

368
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,190
today.

369
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:22,750
Yes.

370
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,190
So he gave us half a day off.

371
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,590
You're worried about me?

372
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,190
Don't worry about me.

373
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,630
Go back to work.

Okay, okay.

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,670
Who are you talking about?

379
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,750
He…

380
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,070
He is Ye Qi.

381
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,230
He is

382
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,590
one of my colleagues.

383
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,310
A female colleague.

384
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,470
She's so tall.

385
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,350
Come on.

386
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,310
Eat.

387
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,110
Thank you, Grandma.

388
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,790
Eat.

389
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,870
Grandma has poor eyesight too.

390
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,030
This girl

391
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,150
is so pretty.

392
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,910
Yes.

393
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,390
Look at her left eyebrow.

394
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,070
It's lighter than the one on the right.

395
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,990
Jian

396
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,950
has been stubborn since childhood

397
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,950
and doesn't like to talk to others.

398
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,030
Has he made any trouble at work?

399
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,830
No, no.

400
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,630
Mr. Gong Jian

401
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,950
has been helping us all the way.

402
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,810
We heavily respect Mr. Gong Jian.

403
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,230
So heavy?

404
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,230
He has indeed gained weight.

405
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,270
But he has gained weight

406
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,790
because he has to

407
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,150
work hard

408
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,310
for his family.

409
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,200
It's not easy to make money.

410
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,310
It's just enough for buying the house.

411
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,350
Grandma,

412
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,920
didn't I tell you?

413
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,150
Cream rises to the top.

414
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,430
Yes.

415
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,030
Savings will run out.

416
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,070
I checked

417
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,910
the balance of the debit card last night.

418
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,270
It's running out.

419
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,320
My grandma is funny.

420
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,230
Well.

421
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,830
You're hungry?

422
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,670
Hungry?

423
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,230
Wait.

424
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,190
I'll cook for you.

425
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,870
Go to work

426
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,030
after you're done eating.

427
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,830
Grandma…

428
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,070
I'll go cook.

429
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,400
Thank you, Grandma.

430
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,070
Thank you.

431
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,670
Thank you.

432
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,110
So…

433
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,720
Grandma doesn't know about it yet?

434
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,870
She's old now.

435
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,190
It'll only make her worried.

436
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,870
I plan to

437
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,390
tell her

438
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,990
after my next job is settled.

439
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,910
How was your interview today?

440
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,950
Not very well.

441
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,350
But it's okay.

442
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,510
Cream rises to the top.

443
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,030
Did something happen?

444
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,830
No.

445
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,710
It's just that it's been a long time
since I paid the renewal fee

446
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,270
for the western sapling I adopted.

447
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,310
They notified me

448
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,910
that if I don't pay the renewal fee today,

449
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,440
they will transfer my sapling
to someone else

450
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,070
and remove my name.

451
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,790
Mr. Gong Jian,

452
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,470
I really blame myself.

453
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,550
If it weren't for
protecting "Let's Fall in Love,"

454
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,550
you wouldn't have had
such a big conflict with Qian Ye.

455
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,950
But don't worry.

456
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,640
I'll certainly make you
return to the editorial office.

457
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,470
Ye Qi, listen to me.

458
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,510
Stop having fantasies about Qian Ye.

459
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,550
And stop doing anything

460
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,310
on impulse for me.

461
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,130
I need to answer this call.

462
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,270
Yes.

463
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,390
I'm the one who adopted the sapling,

464
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,550
Mr. Gong.

465
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,710
I would like to ask

466
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,350
if you can give me a few more days.

467
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,390
I'll transfer it to you
as soon as I got the money.

468
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,630
Is that okay?

469
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:31,350
Is it joy or sorrow?

470
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:37,070
I can't tell happiness
from sorrow in the waves.

471
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,830
Success. Failure.

472
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:47,310
I can't tell from the waves.

473
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,870
-Love you…
-Qian Ye.

474
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,330
Have you read the comic I gave you?

475
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,430
You mean that?

476
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,150
Yes.

477
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,790
I think

478
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,390
you handled the twist

479
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,550
of the ending well.

480
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,720
Just draw like this from now on.

481
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,000
You've been

482
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,510
quite smart lately.

483
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,990
Keep it up.

484
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,270
So,

485
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,230
can Mr. Gong Jian come back?

486
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,430
No.

487
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,670
He has been fired.

488
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,930
Where is he going back?

489
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,070
Didn't you promise me

490
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,710
as long as I make you satisfied,

491
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,470
you'll let Mr. Gong Jian come back?

492
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,030
No.

493
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,310
I promised you

494
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,710
I'd reconsider it.

495
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,150
But I've thought about it now.

496
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,750
I don't want him to come back.

497
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,250
Is there a problem?

498
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,010
No problem, right?

499
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:40,710
Love you or hate you, do you know?

500
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,030
Qian Ye.

501
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,390
For so long,

502
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,230
Mr. Gong Jian has been doing a lot

503
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,880
for "Let's Fall in Love."

504
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,030
Now,

505
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,510
it's time

506
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,170
to let it do something for him.

507
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,640
What do you mean?

508
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:06,640
Say it again.

509
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,310
Yuyu.

510
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,470
Qiandai.

511
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,510
I'm here to see Ye Qi.

512
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,310
He worked late
on the manuscript yesterday.

513
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,710
I want to see how he's doing.

514
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,150
He didn't come to class today.

515
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,870
He asked me to help him take a sick leave.

516
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,470
Sick leave?

517
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,590
He's sick?

518
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,750
I don't think so.

519
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,790
His voice sounded energetic.

520
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,350
Maybe he's on leave

521
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,830
because he's meeting the deadline.

522
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,550
Is he in trouble again?

523
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,910
I don't know.

524
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,710
I'll visit him after class this afternoon.

525
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,150
Guys,

526
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,310
let's see

527
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,510
the factors that cause procrastination.

528
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,030
How many are there? Three.

529
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,540
[Are you sick?]

530
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,830
Right?

531
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,990
What's the first factor?

532
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,430
Environmental factors. Alright.

533
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,870
What does that mean?

534
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,390
It's the entertainment information
from the outside.

535
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,940
[Gong Shihei; Log In]

536
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,490
[Login successful]

537
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,030
Right?

538
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,470
This is one of the factors.

539
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,310
What's the second one?

540
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,240
Say it together.

541
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,880
The mission characteristics.

542
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,950
Shihei.

543
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:13,870
Do you know why "Let's Fall in Love"

544
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,390
has been suspended?

545
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,430
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed…

546
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,950
Have you found any clues?

547
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:45,750
No.

548
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,270
I called Ye Qi but couldn't get through.

549
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,200
I can't reach Mr. Gong Jian either.

550
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,030
Yuyu.

551
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,710
Can you reach Ye Zhen?

552
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,110
Did something happen to Ye Qi?

553
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,030
Ye Qi must have been kidnapped.

554
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,170
I knew it. You think so too?

555
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,110
Look.

556
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,830
The yogurt on the table
hasn't been finished,

557
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,230
which means Ye Qi left in a hurry.

558
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,550
On the ground,

559
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,750
there are more than
one person's footprints,

560
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,710
which means a stranger came in.

561
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,510
I drank the yogurt.

562
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,440
We left the footprints ourselves.

563
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,270
What about the rope on the ground then?

564
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,770
The comic has been suspended.

565
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,150
Ye Qi was kidnapped.

566
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,650
What's the connection between them?

567
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,310
It's easy.

568
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,880
A passionate fan of "Let's Fall in Love"

569
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,270
kidnapped Ye Qi

570
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,390
because he wasn't satisfied
with the plots.

571
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,870
He forced him to suspend the comic

572
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,330
and asked his friends and family
for ransom.

573
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,470
If my guess is correct,

574
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,550
we should

575
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,550
receive the kidnapper's call soon.

576
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,630
Hello?

577
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,030
Hello, is this Ms. Zuo Qiandai?

578
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,960
Yes. Who's speaking?

579
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,510
I am…

580
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,510
Kidnapper!

581
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,550
Are you really the kidnapper?

582
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,350
Please don't kill him. I beg you.

583
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,990
This is a platform for small loans.

584
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,910
Do you need a loan service?

585
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,510
We provide various loan services.

586
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,470
No need.

587
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,910
This kidnapper

588
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,190
is quite cunning.

589
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,510
Ruosong.

590
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,510
Your idea is ridiculous.

591
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,780
In my opinion,

592
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,870
the reason Ye Qi suspended the comic

593
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,780
is that its film and TV
adaptation rights were bought.

594
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,070
And he is going to
pursue a dream in Hollywood.

595
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,550
That's even more ridiculous
than Ruosong's idea.

596
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,310
Or maybe he's going to Hengdian.

597
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,040
Impossible.

598
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,320
Ye Qi won't give up on the comic.

599
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,570
Why hasn't the kidnapper called?

600
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,870
I found a new clue.

601
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,230
What is this?

602
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,510
Password?

603
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,389
Ruosong, you have no common sense.

604
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,870
This is a postal code.

605
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,360
This is a landline phone number.

606
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,270
This kidnapper is so old-school.

607
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,790
He still uses a landline phone.

608
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,510
Qiandai.

609
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,550
Try dialing it.

610
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,750
There might be a clue.

611
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,030
Hello?

612
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:51,710
It's Ye Qi.

613
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,590
Qiandai.

614
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,070
Ye Qi, are you okay?

615
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,150
Are you with everyone?

616
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,710
Ye Qi, are you okay?

617
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,590
I have something personal

618
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,110
to deal with at home.

619
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,230
Why did you turn off your phone?

620
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,990
We are so worried about you.

621
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,270
I broke it on my way back

622
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,000
and sent it to the phone shop.

623
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,790
I was thinking about

624
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,350
telling you after dinner.

625
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,930
Why didn't Ye Zhen reply to us either?

626
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,430
He's cooking with me.

627
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,470
He probably didn't check his phone.

628
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,750
Ye Qi.

629
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,190
Where does the rope
in the corner come from?

630
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,870
I unwrapped the parcel and left it there.

631
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,670
What's wrong?

632
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,470
Nothing.

633
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,350
Ye Qi.

634
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,860
What's up with the comic suspension?

635
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,910
Qian Ye fired Mr. Gong Jian.

636
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,550
I think

637
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,830
that continuing to work with him

638
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,490
is a betrayal to Mr. Gong Jian.

639
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,350
It's also irresponsible for our comic.

640
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,150
So,

641
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,220
I terminated the contract with him.

642
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,510
I made the decision on my own

643
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,270
without consulting with you beforehand.

644
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,270
I'm really sorry.

645
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,950
You don't have to be sorry.

646
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,750
I support you.

647
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,030

We all support you.

650
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,750
Thank you all.

651
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,270
By the way,

652
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,550
I put your rewards

653
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,510
in the layer under the drawer.

654
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,280
I wanted to give them to you
when I got back.

655
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,470
Since you are all here,

656
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,630
take it away now.

657
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,830
Yuyu.

658
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,400
Please

659
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
distribute them.

660
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,280
Okay.

661
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:29,950
Ye Qi.

662
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,590
When are you coming back?

663
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,470
I…

664
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,870
The fish is almost burnt.

665
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,510
I'll be back in several days.

666
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,510
I have to cook.

667
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,410
I have to go.

668
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,030
Bye-bye.

669
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:45,910
