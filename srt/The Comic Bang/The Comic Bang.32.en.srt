Nothing.

What gift?

35
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,680
When I went there last time,

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,110
I stood under a tree
and gazed at Jinli Mountain.

37
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,990
That scenery was really unforgettable.

38

But,

39
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,390
I forgot to take photos at that time.

40
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,710
Ever since I started
drawing the backgrounds,

41
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,070
I've been wanting to draw this scenerry

42
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,270
as a source material.

43
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,150
So you want me

44
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,280
to take a photo of that scenery for you?

45
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,030
But first,

46
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,640
you must find this tree.

47
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,950
No problem.

What does this tree look like?

50
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,870
This is

51
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,430
a unique tree

52
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,590
that can't be described in words.

53
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,680
But the moment you see it,

54
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,390
you will be attracted to it.

55
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,030
Because when you stare at it,

56
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,230
it will be staring at you too.

57
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,270
Anyway,

58
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,070
you will be able to find this tree

59

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,500
is people-oriented.

192
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,470
What are we waiting for?

193
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,590
Let's go in.

194
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,230
Excuse me.

195
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,110
Hold on.

196
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,390
Mr. Meng Ye will stay here,

197
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,390
and you will stay across the street.

198
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,790
There's no hotel there.

199
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,740
Yeah.

200
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,350
The motel ten kilometers away.

201
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,290
They will stay across the street?

202
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,230
Why should we go to a motel?

203
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,270
Yes.

204
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,430
You said it's people-oriented.

205
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,270
Here's the thing, Mr. Meng Ye.

206
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,430
It's because a lot of cartoonists

207
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,590
came this time.

208
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,150
Our hotel is completely booked.

209
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:21,870
So,

210
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,910
Mr. Meng Ye will stay here.

211
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,380
The assistants can only
stay across the street.

212
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,430
Don't stop me!

213
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,070
I can actually share a bed

214
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,790
with Ye Qi.

215
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,030
Dream on.

216
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,710
Hello?

217
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,710
How is the rain in the prairie this year?

218
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,510
How fat are the cows and sheep?

219
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,390
Sorry.

220
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,560
This is clear discrimination.

221
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,670
Exactly!

222
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,840
Why hold a comic-con
if they don't have money?

223
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,150
Besides,

224
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,110
the motel is great.

225
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,430
Yes.

226
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,470
The motel is the best.

227
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:25,990
Look.

228
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,950
It's so clean.

229
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,830
Cockroach!

230
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,150
At least the service here

231
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,870
is very friendly.

232
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,390
It's been over a minute
since the specified check-out time.

233
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,250
The deposit will not be refunded.

234
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,110
Ye Qi.

235
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,350
How is it?

236
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,270
Are you comfortable

237
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,470
in the starred hotel?

238
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,390
It's okay.

239
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,950
We're miserable.

240
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,110
The soundproofing in this chain hotel

241
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,550
is very poor.

242
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,630
We can even hear the sound
of cockroaches being squashed upstairs.

243
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,290
I think I heard it just now too.

244
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,870
Is the soundproofing
in the starred hotel so poor?

245
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,150
Why does

246
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,150
your room

247
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,840
look similar to ours?

248
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,630
Yuyu!

249
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,430
You really went there?

250
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,790
I'll open the door.

251
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,710
Why are you here?

252
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,710
Because I don't want
to be apart from everyone.

253
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,270
Let's go.

254
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,590
Let's go down for a late-night snack.

255
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,630
Sure!

256
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,550
Here.

257
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,900
May our exhibition be a huge success.

258
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,190
Cheers! Cheers!

259
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,030
Qiandai, eat this.

260
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,490
What's our plan tomorrow?

261
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,630
The organizer will
take us to Jinli Mountain.

262
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,240
After that, we'll have time to ourselves.

263
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,510
Although the convention
is the day after tomorrow,

264
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,270
there will be a lot of
cartoonists and fans

265
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,710
on the mountain tomorrow.

266
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,270
So it should be very lively.

267
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,310
We're going hiking tomorrow,

268
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,750
and it will surely need
a lot of physical strength.

269
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,470
So make sure to eat well tonight.

270
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,630
I'll get some skewers.

271
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,320
Okay.

272
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,350
Just say that you want to eat more.

273
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,470
Come with me.

274
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,630
Okay.

275
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,990
Let's go.

276
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,990
Sorry.

277
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,750
Be careful, Qiandai.

278
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,910
You need me, right?

279
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,710
I wish Gu and Ruosong were here.

280
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,910
I just sent a photo of us eating skewers

281
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,190
to Gu.

282
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,270
He couldn't help
ordering barbecue for himself

283
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,070
when he saw us eating.

284
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,350
Jieyue!

285
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,870
Don't you want to send a photo

286
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,390
to entice Ruosong?

287
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,410
[Jiang Ruosong]

288
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,430
It's okay. Let's enjoy ourselves.

289
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,190
Come on.

290
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,830
Cheers.

291
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:54,910
Cheers.

292
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,270
Together.

293
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,470
Qiandai, you...

294
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,070
I'm speechless...

295
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,110
It's so heavy.

296
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,710
This pot is so heavy.

297
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,030
There are potato slices.

298
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,870
Full of love.

299
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,910
I want this.

300
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,950
I want this.

301
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,510
Come on.

302
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,840
It's really delicious.

303
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,710
[Jieyue]

304
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,070
[Are you asleep?]

305
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,590
Ruosong.

306
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,990
Based on my years
of research on relationships,

307
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,110
I can assure you

308
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,390
that this is a great opportunity for you

309
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,720
to take back control of the relationship.

310
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,990
Cartoonists,

311
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,230
I've been following
your work for a long time.

312
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,150
That...

313
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,080
That was drawn page by page, right?

314
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,030
Yes.

315
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,070
Everyone!

316
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,430
If you look in this direction,

317
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,950
you'll see a mountain
called Jinli Mountain.

318
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,190
During autumn,
a lot of painters go up there to sketch.

319
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,390
The lake under the mountain

320
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,670
is called the Wishing Lake.

321
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,270
Legend has it that
there is a koi fish in the lake

322
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,390
that grants any wish.

323
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,030
Next, we are going to give

324
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,230
paper boats to everyone.

325
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,470
You can write your wishes

326
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,310
on the paper boat

327
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,350
and put it in the lake.

328
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,670
And your wishes may come true!

329
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,390
Alright.

330
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,190
You can do whatever you want after.

331
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,390
Let's go over there. Okay, let's go.

332
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,870
That cartoonist is so tall.

333
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,790
Hello, cartoonist.

334
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,030
Hello, cartoonist.

335
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,430
Hello, cartoonist.

336
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,620
Hello, cartoonist.

337
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,190
I'll wait for you in front.

338
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,190
Hello, cartoonist.

339
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,470
Hello. Hello.

340
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,790
Qiandai!

341
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,790
What did you wish for?

342
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,830
I wished...

343
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,750
Be careful.

344
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,040
It's slippery here.

345
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,230
Nice pose.

346
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,920
It's sweet. Have a look.

347
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,990
It's really pretty.

348
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,589
Do you want it?

349
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,710
100 yuan.

350
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,589
100 yuan?

351
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,430
That's too much...

352
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,160
Here you are.

353
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,150
Thank you.

354
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,150
Have fun.

355
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,470
This person seems to be

356
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,930
taking pictures
for lovers here on purpose.

357
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,830
You...

358
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,710
What did you just ask me?

359
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,630
I asked you about your wish.

360
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,270
I hope...

361
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,510
I can always be with my idol.

362
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,960
I think this is
the perfect time to confess.

363
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,510
But then,

364
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,070
the plan will be ruined.

365
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,630
Qiandai.

366
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,960
-Actually, I...
-Ye Qi!

367
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,150
I... I...

368
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,830
What are you doing?

369
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,080
[I hope I can always be with her.]

370
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,750
Hurry up!

371
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,510
Ye Qi...

372
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,390
You know what?

373
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,390
If you hadn't called me over,

374
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,720
I would have confessed to Qiandai now.

375
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,790
Then...

376
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,350
Was what I did right or wrong?

377
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,830
I also don't know.

378
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,920
Why did you call me here?

379
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:50,870
Well,

380
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,670
I just passed by a stall over there

381
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,390
and saw

382
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,390
that he's selling all kinds
of lucky charms and amulets.

383
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,230
I was wondering
if you would buy one or two

384
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,160
to ensure your plan goes smoothly.

385
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,600
Thank you for your consideration.

386
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,110
However, unfortunately,

387
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,110
I don't really believe in these things

388
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,830
that go against science.

389
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,750
That's good.

390
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,630
Just now, I was bored

391
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,510
and checked the horoscopes on the bus.

392
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,430
I found out that things won't go well

393
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,630
for Geminis this week,

394
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,670
especially when it
comes to confessing feelings.

395
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,130
Luckily, you don't
believe in these things.

396
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,910
Ye...

397
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,510
Where...

398
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,260
Then Qian...

399
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,070
15 yuan! 15 yuan!

400
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,990
Get an amulet

401
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,590
to fill your world with love.

402
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,350
Get an amulet

403
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,710
to make all your wishes come true.

404
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,390
15 yuan! 15 yuan!

405
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,750
Sir.

406
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,230
Do you have an amulet

407
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,910
that can guarantee
the smooth implementation of plans?

408
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,270
I want two this time.

409
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,350
You look like a student.

410
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,070
Do you have exams soon?

411
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,510
Buy a "Qualify" amulet.

412
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,070
I wish that you pass every exam.

413
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,710
But I want to...

414
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,030
If the words on it
are too straightforward,

415
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,830
Qiandai will see through it.

416
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,590
Sir,

417
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,520
do you have an all-purpose amulet?

418
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:15,750
I...

419
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,310
Didn't I tell you just now?

420
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,030
There's another name for this amulet.

421
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:19,790
It's also called

422
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,320
the "All-Purpose" amulet.

423
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,240
[Pass]

424
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,670
But this is...

425
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,510
Give me one.

426
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,350
Okay.

427
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,240
[Pass]

428
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,170
What are you doing?

429
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,730
Didn't you ask me to buy it?

430
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,230
I asked you to buy an amulet

431
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,290
to make your confession go smoothly.

432
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,270
You bought this...

433
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,030
Do you think you're
a piece of pork or something?

434
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,750
This... Of course I know.

435
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,060
But Qiandai will find out,

436
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,230
if it's too obvious.

437
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,270
Then you could've put it in your pocket.

438
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,510
Besides...

439
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,630
Will this

440
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,070
really work?

441
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,150
Don't worry.

442
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,590
The psychological comfort it provides

443
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,150
is very obvious.

444
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,070
Besides, doesn't wearing this on my chest

445
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,070
give off a unique sense of coolness?

446
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,910
If someone finds this thing cool,

447
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,950
their aesthetic sense

448
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,670
must have completely died out.

449
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:10,950
Ye Qi!

450
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,350
It's actually not bad...

451
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,170
I'll go to sketch with them later.

452
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,720
Where did you buy this?

453
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,870
It looks so cool.

454
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,750
I bought one for you too.

455
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,750
Sure.

456
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,430
Promotion.

457
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,760
Let me help you put it on.

458
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,030
Are you kidding?

459
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,190
What do you mean?

460
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,000
It's really pretty.

461
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,640
Right?

462
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,390
The color is also beautiful.

463
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,150
Yours is blue. Mine is…

464
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,670
Very cool.

465
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,670
Really cool.

466
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,750
Let me ask Gu

467
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,910
which one he likes.

468
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,190
I...

469
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,190
Wait...

470
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,630
What's wrong with this world?

471
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,590
This...

472
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,270
You...

473
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,960
What's wrong with Yuyu?

474
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,710
Maybe his aesthetic sense has died out.

475
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,870
Mr. Meng Ye!

476
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,130
Mr. Meng Ye, over here.

477
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,550
There's a meeting for cartoonists.

478
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,390
It will take about an hour.

479
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,150
You need to attend it.

480
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,950
Okay.

481
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,270
I'll go first.

482
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,870
Go ahead.

483
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,540
Bye.

484
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,400
Bye.

485
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,430
Let's go.

486
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,870
-Qiandai.
-Let's go together.

487
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,730
Mr. Meng Ye, you have a good taste.

488
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,750
It's very pretty.

489
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,430
Yes.

490
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,330
[Lu Dao]

491
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,230
Gu, we're going to buy an amulet.

492
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,470
What kind do you want?

493
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,510
[Pass]

494
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,270
Don't choose the one Ye Qi chose.

495
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,470
Just choose one for me.

496
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,390
Gu.

497
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,030
Ruosong.

498
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,130
The figures are ready?

499
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,350
Let me show you.

500
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,750
So beautiful.

501
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,750
By the way,

502
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,110
how's the preparation for the competition?

503
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,150
Really good.

504
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,310
Everyone is relaxed

505
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,790
because Jieyue hasn't been around lately.

506
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,510
A teammate sprained his ankle

507
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,270
because he was too relaxed.

508
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,390
But it's nothing serious.

509
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,050
It won’t affect today’s game.

510
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,160
That’s good.

511
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,350
By the way,

512
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,230
did Jieyue buy you an amulet?

513
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,670
What amulet?

514
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,310
Didn't she tell you?

515
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,230
We haven't been in touch,

516
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,790
since she went to Jinli Mountain.

517
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,150
Why?

518
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,430
Did you two fight?

519
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,710
Not really.

520
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,510
Then why didn't you reach out to her?

521
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,910
Because Chai said

522
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,870
that you shouldn't be passive in love,

523
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,000
or you'll end up losing your position.

524
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,590
This Yu Zichai...

525
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,830
And then?

526
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,690
Then I read a lot of girls' comics.

527
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,030
I felt that being in control
of the relationship is really important.

528
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,990
So I've been holding back

529
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,710
to regain control.

530
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,670
I don't know if Jieyue

531
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,430
thinks the same way.

532
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,430
Anyway, we're in a dead end.

533
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,670
But actually,

534
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,110
I really miss her now.

535
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,790
I totally understand

536
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,870
your situation.

537
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,150
But my situation with Lu Dao

538
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,610
is actually
the complete opposite of yours.

539
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,470
We've been sending signals

540
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,990
to each other.

541
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,950
Wait.

542
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,550
I just ate two local oranges.

543
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:30,450
[Lu Dao]

544
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,990
Very sweet.

545
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,150
Have you eaten one for me?

546
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,830
I bought it.

547
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,960
I'm keeping it for you
until you come and eat it yourself.

548
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,150
The figures are ready.

549
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,410
I'll arrive tomorrow.

550
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,470
So...

551
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,070
Between me and Lu Dao,

552
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,780
who do you think is in control?

553
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,990
So there's no control

554
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,270
in love, right?

555
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,070
Of course!

556
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,110
When two people care

557
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,270
and have concern for each other,

558
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,470
does it really matter who's in control?

559
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,230
Got it, Gu.

560
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,470
When did you get together with Lu Dao?

561
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,350
Why didn't I know about it?

562
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,190
The basketball game
is about to start, right?

563
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,470
Go get ready.

564
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,780
I'm leaving.

565
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,790
Gu!

566
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,710
Gu, wait for me.

567
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,550
It's so beautiful.

568
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,350
Look!

569

Oh no, I can't get down.

Hello, Yuyu.

Qiandai, what's wrong?

578
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,630
I can't get down a tree.

579
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,790
Why are you trapped in a tree too?

580
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,510
Forget about how it happened.

581
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,350
I am trapped anyway.

582
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,880
How did you get down
from the tree at that time?

I knew I had to
do it at the crucial moment.

I received a call from Ye Qi at that time.

585

When my hands trembled,

586
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,270
the phone fell off.

587
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,790
