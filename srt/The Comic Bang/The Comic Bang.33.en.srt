Bye-bye.

191
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,390
Gong Jian, Ye Qi,

192
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,430
I won't let you get your way.

193
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,470
Just you wait.

194
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,630
Hello. Hello.

195
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,600
Thank you.

196
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,550
Thank you.

197
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,070
Make a heart.

198
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:30,990
What…

199
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,510
Everyone, come and take a look!

200
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,430
This pervert

201
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,960
is the real Meng Ye.

202
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,750
He used an innocent girl

203
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,470
to play with your emotions.

204
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,670
He claimed

205
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,670
he's the spokesperson for girls

206
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,200
and a girls' comics artist.

207
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,310
It turns out

208
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,790
he's merely a rough guy.

209
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,390
Are we tricked?

210
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,480
May I ask who you are?

211
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,190
Just like you all,

212
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm an innocent reader tricked by him.

213
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,870
Whether it's a man or a woman,

214
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,750
as long as he's sophisticated,

215
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,870
I like him.

216
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,630
Right!

217
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,910
I don't care whether the cartoonist
is a boy or a girl.

218
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,230
-No way…
-That's right.

219
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,590
So the one in front is Meng Ye, right?

220
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,510
Meng Ye is a man?

221
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,550
It bursts my bubble!

222
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,670
He's so tall.

223
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,190
Yes.

224
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,510
I'm Meng Ye,

225
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,880
the author of "Let's Fall in Love."

226
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,430
See?

227
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,550
He admitted it.

228
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,470
Liar! Liar!

229
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,590
But…

230
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,630
I'm not Meng Ye.

231
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,070
What does that mean?

232
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,110
I'm just half of Meng Ye.

233
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,430
I can only be Meng Ye

234
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,360
when combined with the other half.

235
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,790
Zuo Qiandai.

236
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,950
This is my other half.

237
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,390
She used to be my blackening assistant,

238
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,670
and now my coloring assistant.

239
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,150
He said

240
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,070
I'm his other half.

241
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,930
Is this what people say "Good things
will happen if you wait for them"?

242
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,550
My other half…

243
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,910
My other half

244
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,350
also includes…

245
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,630
The effect assistant, Chai Ziyu.

246
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,750
For things like

247
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,870
flowers and other small objects

248
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,870
that can improve the charm of a character,

249
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,070
just leave them to me.

250
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,470
After all, I have such

251
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,330
solid understanding of "charm."

252
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,670
The background assistant, Gu Zhengxing.

253
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,030
The assistant who's in charge of

254
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,750
stippling and everything else,

255
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,910
Jiang Ruosong.

256
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,910
The coffee is ready.

257
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,430
And my executive editor,

258
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,550
Mr. Gong Jian.

259
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,350
All of us

260
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,990
combined

261
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,950
makes a complete Meng Ye.

262
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,270
We are a group.

263
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,630
A team.

264
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,200
No one is dispensable.

265
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,150
Good!

266
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,870
Meng Ye, the G.O.A.T.

267
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,110
I'll never regret
loving "Let's Fall in Love."

268
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,670
Meng Ye, you're amazing.

269
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,190
Thank you.

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,750
Meng Ye! Meng Ye! Meng Ye!

271
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,030
Without you,

272
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,910
there wouldn't be
today's "Let's Fall in Love."

273
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,030
Thank you, Zuo Qiandai.

274
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,030
Thank you, Chai Ziyu.

275
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,350
Thank you, Gu.

276
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,590
And you,

277
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,550

Also,

279
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,950
Mr. Gong Jian.

280
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,630

285
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,330
have no business here, right?

286
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,430
No way.

to slander "Let's Fall in Love,"
aren't you?

who drove Meng Ye
and You Li away, aren't you?

You're the blogger
whom Gong Shihei unmasked, aren't you?

00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,750
I saw him online too.

-He's so handsome.
-Yes.

meet in the real world now?

of "Let's Fall in Love"
at LAST Animation & Art.

327

Let's celebrate that Qian Ye ran away
with his tail between his legs.

Let's celebrate that Meng Ye

I think they went somewhere for fun.

Ye Qi said he has
a creative exchange seminar

333
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,430
to attend.

334
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,590
You keep talking about Ye Qi.

335
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:10,750
Talk about it.

What he feels about me now is…

341
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,790
When he can't see me, he will be worried.

342
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,390
When he's staring at me,
he will feel it's interesting.

343
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,070
When we walk together,
we always want to hold hands.

That's pretty much it.

345

Ye Qi is so motherly.

346

You've held hands?

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,150
It's almost the final episode
but you've just held hands.

How long is it going to take
to get to the next stage then?

349
