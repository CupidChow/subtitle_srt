00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,550
To summarize your long story,

190
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,880
you want to find out who Loreley is. Right?

191
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,350
I suggest you go in there and ask.

192
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,910
But I don't know anyone from the music club.

193
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,090
And all of them are girls in there.

194
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,710
You're too shy.

195
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,990
It's all right.

196
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,550
Watch and learn.

197
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,630
Hello, everyone.

198
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,990
He may look very serious,

199
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,670
but he doesn't mind how awkward I am.

200
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,590
We've just met,

201
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,390
but he's willing to ask about Loreley for me.

202
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,750
He's a very generous and reliable senior.

203
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,190
Thanks!

204
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,870
How did it go?

205
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,310
We'll perform a musical for the celebration of school anniversary.

206
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll tell Lu Dao.

207
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,790
Why are you running off?

208
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,750
Did you ask about Loreley for me?

209
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,050
[Auditorium]

210
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,830
Lu Dao.

211
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,630
Senior.

212
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,070
We will perform a musical for the celebration of school anniversary.

213
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,710
Can we do that?

214
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,710
What kind of musical?

215
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,590
You will start with tightrope walking,

216
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,790
then go through two rings of flames in a row.

217
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,350
After that you'll do 3 backflips while dancing,

218
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,030
and finally, you land on your feet and sing.

219
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,910
No problem.

220
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,790
How come I have no problem with that?

221
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,630
Yeah.

222
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,350
Tightrope walking; going through rings of flames; backflips.

223
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,010
That would be too hard for you.

224
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,440
That's not the problem.

225
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,470
That's not the problem?

226
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,430
Are you saying

227
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,670
you are tone-deaf, so you can't sing?

228
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,030
How is it possible that I'm tone-deaf?

229
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,910
I just...

230
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,150
I just...

231
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,510
Yes, I am tone-deaf actually.

232
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,390
Are you disappointed?

233
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:00,950
No, I'm not.

234
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,470
Many people have things they're not good at.

235
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,750
For example,

236
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,630
I won't become the sassy girl

237
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,470
who is liked by everyone.

238
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,110
You're not helping at all.

239
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,470
What should I do?

240
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,600
Why do I agree on everything he says

241
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,710
without even thinking?

242
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,390
How can I

243
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,110
become a singer?

244
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,320
Oh, yes.

245
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,030
Romeo from the music club.

246
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,020
Loreley.

247
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,670
Yes, Loreley.

248
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,990
Do you know her?

249
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,070
Yes.

250
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,310
I heard that she is not only

251
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,150
good at singing,

252
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,150
but also full of charm.

253
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,310
People who have heard her sing

254
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,080
will never forget her.

255
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,430
They will be enchanted.

256
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,590
If she can teach me to sing...

257
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,550
Can you introduce me to her?

258
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,750
Even the Prince of Dongsheng is attracted to Jieyue.

259
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,970
You want me to teach you to sing?

260
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,830
That's easy.

261
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,350
Kneel down and ask me,

262
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,230
"Please teach me to sing,

263
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,630
Lady Jeiyue!"

264
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,310
Jieyue, she's my friend.

265
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,190
Your request is too juvenile.

266
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,390
Sorry, I'm used to it.

267
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,070
Because in the past...

268
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,150
I only need to kneel down,

269
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,910
Lady Jieyue?

271
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,450
How can you be so juvenile as well, Lu Dao?

272
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,950
Come.

273
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,110
Sing for me a little.

Speaking of which, Jieyue is also a member of the music club.

277
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,950
I should ask her.

278
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,660
I've never heard her sing.

279

Though she won't be as good as Loreley,

280
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,150
she should be good enough.

281
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,510
I got it.

282
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,990
Two options for you.

283
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,870
One, you give up now.

284
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,270
Two, you give up after a year of practice.

Which one would you choose?

286
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,230
Is there

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,230
a more hopeful choice?

288
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,270

Either let Gu give up doing the musical,

Ye Qi made

313

Mr. Gong Jian thinks I don't understand

324

Mei's feelings well enough.

325
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,950
So I decided

326
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,550
to live as Mei for one day.

No, I have class.

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,710
Should I take this delicious lunch with me?

331
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,870
When someone enjoys the lunch she made,

332
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,990
Mei feels a great sense of gratification.

333
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,350
Who would eat that?

334
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,750
When someone disapproves of what she did,

335
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,510
Mei gets upset

336
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,640
even though she does not talk about it.

337
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,710
Crazy.

338
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,710

What did you just say, Senior?

346
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,510

00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,450
What's women's battlefield?

348
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,870
Lu Dao,

349
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,830
let's go rehearse together after dinner.

350
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,750
If I make Lu Dao my girlfriend,

351
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,880
Mei will become the enemy of all girls.

352
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,930
This is the battlefield for women.

353
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,030
Are these unwanted plasters

354
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,830
resembling the love I cannot have?

355
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,030
Even if it's just for the delicious lunch,

356
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,710
I shoudn't give up.

357
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,910
How about

358
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,790
I return the lunch box first?

359
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,910
Gu!

360
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,790
Gu!

361
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,230
Have you seen Ye Qi?

362
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,110
No.

363
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,490
I'm looking for Lu Dao as well.

364
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,790
Lu Dao! Lu Dao!

365
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,790
Come back to the rehearsal with us!

366
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,350
Stop running! Come back to the rehearsal!

Lu Dao!

368
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,110
So this is how it feels to be chased by love rivals.

369
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,390
This is what Mei has been experiencing.

370
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,590
Is it over yet?

371
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,990
Sit tight!

373
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,200
Where did she go?

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,330
We're late for rehearsal, Shikadima!

375
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,430

00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,910
from this?

562
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,070
Three years ago,

563
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,030
I couldn't talk to girls naturally.

564
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,950
So I started to practice

565
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,240
with the girls in ACG.

566
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,510
And then I went into the real world.

567
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,040
I learned to socialize with different girls.

568
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,750
But gradually, I realized

569
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,950
what I've learned from the girls' games

570
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,750
was only a drop in the bucket.

571
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,200
Are you sure

572
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,930
you haven't gone off the track?

573
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,350
Don't underestimate girls' games.

574
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,350
It's the achievement of countless scholars and experts

575
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,350
who invested significant amounts of time

576
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,790
studying the thoughts

577
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,190
of thousands of girls.

578
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,030
You have a point.

579
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,990
Let's get started then.

580
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,320
Who should I begin with?

581
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,790
First,

582
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,430
pick a name for yourself.

583
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,430
Next,

584
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:37,790
choose a girl you like to interact with.

585
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,550
Last, you go through many difficulties

586
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,470
to make her your girl.

I clear... clear the level?

592
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,230
Well...

593
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,270
So our answer...

No tricks.

598

Since it's your first time playing the game,

599
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,510
you'd better focus on one girl only.

601
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,590
I choose this girl.

602
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,150
Why does this character

603
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,790
look familiar?

604
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,429
I also think she

605
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,389
looks a bit like Zuo Qiandai.

606
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,909
I don't think so.

607
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,989
Zuo Qiandai wears a white bowknot with red dots.

608
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:39,150
But her bowknot is red with white dots.

609
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,630
Why do I remember

610
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,960
Qiandai's bowknot is red with white dots?

611
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,750
That's impossible.

612
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,949
You must be wrong.

613
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,909
Am I? Yes.

614
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,870
I just saw her at the door.

615
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,190
I saw her white bowknot with red dots.

616
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,389
But I...

617
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,909
So

618
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,429
did you choose her

619
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,110
because she wears the same bowknot

620
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,310
as Qiandai's?

621
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,750
No.

622
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,990
I read the walkthrough.

623

624
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,550
So I chose her.

625
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,510
Don't read the spoilers, okay?

626
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,030
Take it seriously.

627
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,700
Do you still want Qiandai to forgive you?

628
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,990
Thank you so much, Qi.

629
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,670
Why does she call me Qi?

630
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,880
It means you two are closer now.

Are you really not going to reply to me?

632
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,070
If a girl doesn't reply to you, it means she's upset.
