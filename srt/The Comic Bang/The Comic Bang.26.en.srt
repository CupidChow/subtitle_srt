[The Comic Bang]

2
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,270
That's about it.

3
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,610
The progress is completely
beyond my expectation.

4
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,110
That's very true.

5
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,789
If I knew the life detector would work,

6
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:47,250
I wouldn't have posted
a missing cat notice.

7
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,350
I was talking about
your relationship with Ruosong.

8
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,910
He confessed his love and you kissed him.

9
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,590
That's amazing.

10
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,350
If only

11
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,420
I am as bold as you.

12
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,390
You and Ruosong
hit it off with each other,

13
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,280
and there's reciprocal love
between you two.

14
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,230
I think I've only seen such a sweet plot
in romance anime shows.

15
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,550
So you know about that.

16
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,139
If it's like you and Ye Qi,

17
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,030
spending several episodes
shilly-shallying about a trivial matter,

18
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,160
how will anyone still watch the drama?

19
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,430
It is indeed you're
in a sweet love relationship,

20
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,270
but don't underestimate me.

21
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,670
Recently, I accidentally found

22
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,150
that Ye Qi is doing something

23
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,280
like a favorability score plan.

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,880
I just don't know how far
he has gone in his plan.

25
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,910
It's not that I'm criticizing you two.

26
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,870
The sentence "I like you"

27
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,670
has only three words.

28
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,030
It won't make a difference whether
you say it or he says it.

29
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,829
Why are you making it so complicated?

30
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,750
But

31
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,150
all my first
three love confessions failed.

32
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,829
No exception.

33
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,590
Ye Qi!

34
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:41,670
I like…

35
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,329
I've always been your fan.

36
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,829
What if

37
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:51,030
I say "I've always been your fan"

38
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,690
instead of "I like you" again?

39
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,310
It's easy.

40
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,390
Just forget the word "fan"

41
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,430
and practice the word "like" hard.

42
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,790
When you've formed muscle memory,

43
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,650
it would be less likely to mess up.

44
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,950
You have to seize the initiative

45
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,470
just like I did.

46
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,030
Generally, in idiom stories,

47
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,790
the person who only waits foolishly

48
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,120
often won't end up well.

49
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,030
Right.

50
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,990
Like "Waiting for Hares by the Tree,"

51
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,630
"Climbing a Tree to Catch Fish,"
"Marking the Boat to Find the Lost Sword."

52
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,470
And "Mao Sui Recommends Himself."

53
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,950
I don't think this one counts.

54
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,630
It doesn't matter.

55
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,430
As long as you understand
what I mean, that's good.

56
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,150
Forget it.

57
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,520
I won't let him fiddle around.

58
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,670

It's quite easy.

75
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,430
It doesn't seem hard

76
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,560
to forget that word.

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,470

86
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,550
Anger would lead to hair loss
and be harmful to the body.

what you've done to prepare for it.

185
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,910
Flowers, balloons,

186
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,150
a love confession banner,

187
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,110
or a feast made by yourself?

188
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,350
In terms of props,

189
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,950
the life detector is essential.

190
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,880
What do you mean?

191
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,950
Originally, I planned to
go to the music club

192
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,590
to bare my heart to Loreley.

193
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,390
Later,

194
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,950
I suddenly got a call from Jieyue.

195
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,510
She said that Songsong was lost.

196
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,030
The more I thought about it,
the more I worried about her being alone.

197
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,550
Later,

198
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,350
I simply forgot
about wanting to see Loreley.

199
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,630
You were hesitating between
the Angel Singer and the Devil Senior.

200
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,230
At the crucial moment,
you made the difficult decision.

201
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,110
And finally, you got
a clear understanding of your own heart.

202
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,070
You not only saved the innocent cat

203
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,630
with the Devil Senior

204
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,560
but also gained self-redemption.

205
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,390
Such a plot with twists and turns

206
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,670
is really wonderful.

207
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,870
Actually,

208
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,190
it was completely
beyond my expectation too.

209
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,470
The process of the love confession
was also very casual.

210
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,310
I even let Jieyue

211
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,910
write "Exclusive to Jieyue"
on my Band-Aid.

212
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,370
It wasn't romantic at all.

213
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,670
Who would have thought?

214
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,070
You're quite something.

215
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,440
Such a cheesy line

216
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,710
is probably the best one
in school romance stories.

217
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,070
Can that help you, Ye Qi?

218
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,870
Well…

219
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,870
Surprisingly, it's not a valuable reference.

220
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,550
Ye Qi,

221
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,010
I understand how you feel.

222
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,310
But no matter what,

223
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,110
a person has to
take the first step bravely.

224
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,030
Just like me.

225
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,350
Making Loreley a memory of mine

226
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,470
was just a split-second decision.

227
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,550
Ruosong,

228
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,750
you still don't know?

229
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,920
Actually, Loreley from the music club

230
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,320
is Zhou Jieyue.

231
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,150
Ye Qi, I'm going to play basketball.

232
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,870
The Angel Singer
and the Devil Senior are the same person.

233
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,270
Ruosong will be able
to handle this, right?

234
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,780
[Auditorium]

235
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,870
Now that I'm here,

236
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,330
I should go
and ask Senior Gu for some advice.

237
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,150
What did Ye Qi say?

238
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,080
Are you playing basketball?

239
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,390
Actually, Loreley from the music club

240
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,110
is Zhou Jieyue.

241
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,030
Don't worry, Lu Dao.

242
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,030
We'll help you think of a solution.

243
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,230
How about this?

244
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,110
Let's ask the teacher

245
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,830
and see if he has any ideas.

246
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,750
Ask the teacher...

247
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,230
Smile.

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,790
Lu Dao.

249
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,710
May I ask…

250
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,950
Ye Qi, you're just in time.

251
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,480
I got into a little trouble.

252
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:18,950
Everyone,

253
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,350
Mr. Zhong has seen our rehearsal,

254
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,550
and he made a comment.

255
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,990
That is, Lu Dao's role is too flat.

256
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,190
[Handsome Boy No. 2, Handsome Boy No. 1, Handsome Boy No. 3]

257
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,280
We need something unexpected.

258
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,950
Do you have any ideas?

259
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,880
Something unexpected?

260
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,310
It must be because the cross-gender acting
can't meet the censorship requirements.

261
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,570
What should we do then?

262
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,150
Anyway,

263
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,680
I still want to share Gu's worries.

264
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,770
According to the plots in girls' comics,

265
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,840
the main character
needs a splendid transformation

266
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,640
to attract people's attention.

267
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,960
A role that is unexpected
in terms of clothing?

268
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,730
I don't think I've played one before.

269
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,360
Lu Dao is going to wear women's clothes.

270
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,790
Really?

271
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,910
Lu Dao,

272
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,150
can you wear a skirt?

273
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,030
Ye Qi,

274
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,470
can't you see that I am wearing a skirt?

275
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,790
Right.

276
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,790
But

277
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,190
I've indeed never

278
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,390
tried the girly style clothing before.

279
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,390
Wait for me.

280
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,590
[Auditorium]

281
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,030
Lu Dao is going to wear a skirt.

282
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,190
I can't wait to see.

283
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,590
But Lu Dao will surely
look good in anything.

284
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,390
Yes.

285
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,270
I wonder if there’s any skirt
in our dressing room

286
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,320
that would suit Lu Dao.

287
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,670
I wonder what Qiandai is doing now.

288
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,670
I guess I'll wait to surprise her

289
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,270
when I confess my love to her.

290
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,150
Lu Dao!

291
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,510
Lu Dao!

292
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,310
Lu Dao!

293
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,350
Is this still our Lu Dao?

294
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,390
Whether she dresses like a prince
or Princess in Lolita Style,

295
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,150
she's so attractive.

296
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,790
So cute.

297
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,790
What do you think?

298
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,540
If this was in girls' comics,

299
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,350
Gu should show up now.

300
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,790
Gu?

301
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,390
Lu Dao?

302
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,390
Is this a sign of a crush?

303
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,830
You need me to match your outfit for you.

304
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,510
And that hairstyle

305
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,910
doesn't suit you at all.

306
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,160
Do you know what your advantage is?

307
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,190
Also, can you not

308
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,630
wear dresses as cute
as this in the future?

309
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,490
Handsome outfits fit you better.

310
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,830
Also, what's with

311
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,230
the super cutesy makeup?

312
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,150
You have to be your real self.

313
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,270
He's hopeless.

314
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,710
Lu Dao. Lu Dao. Lu Dao.

315
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,550
This is our Lu Dao, right?

316
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,350
It's more pleasing to the eye now.

317
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,790
But Gu,

318
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,830
Mr. Zhong said

319
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,030
there are too many similar characters.

320
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,430
Really?

321
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,730
Take off your suit jacket.

322
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,360
Wait. Wait.

323
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,310
Bow tie. Bow tie.

324
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,910
Don't…

325
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,070
Glasses.

326
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,550
Don't… Don't move yet.

327
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,440
Put it on.

328
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,470
Gu.

329
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,470
You become strange

330
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,630
when it comes to something
related to Lu Dao.

331
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,190
You are usually normal.

332
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,230
Do I?

333
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,240
Get another outfit.

334
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,710
Gu, you like it?

335
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,760
Guess I'm going out to
fool people in this outfit.

336
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,750
Lu Dao, Lu Dao. Don't leave, Lu Dao.

337
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,190
So this is your type.

338
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,350
I just think

339
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,380
this outfit fits Lu Dao better.

340
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,360
But

341
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,350
if I make the face I like

342
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,510
appear in the way I like,

343
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,630
doesn't that mean

344
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,750
it is my ideal type?

345
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,110
Ye Qi,

346
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,190
I always thought

347
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,790
the ideal boy in my mind
should look like Lu Dao.

348
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,270
Could it be

349
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,710
that my ideal girl

350
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,990
is also Lu Dao?

351
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,150
Your relationship problem
is much more complicated than mine.

352
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,079
What do you mean?

353
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,670
I'd better ask someone else.

354
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,510
The idea for the new comic is good.

355
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,869
Crown Prince Hu An, a raccoon.
(Note: "Hu An" sounds similar to "change" in Chinese when pronounced fast.)

356
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:29,190
Who else would have thought of

357
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,870
such a pun

358
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,430
besides you, Chief Editor?

359
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,670
You're right.

360
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,390
You Li.

361
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,670
Under my guidance,

362
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:40,000
your career in comics
can be considered thriving every day.

363
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,270
Thank you, Chief Editor.

364
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,590
I'll go back and continue drawing.

365
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,070
Go ahead.

366
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,270
Go. Go.

367
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,830
It's my turn now.

368
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,950
Hey, you.

369

Why did you come in without knocking?

370
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,430
You asked me to come here

371
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,590
an hour ago.

372
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,630

why didn't you sit down?

Come. Sit down.

376
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,430
Since you've been
sitting here for over an hour,

Otherwise, Ye Qi's career

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,520
would have got better long ago.

I've been a cartoonist for so long,

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,750
and I've drawn a lot of love stories.

401

the most important thing
for love confession

Let me retouch it.

556
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,270
The air is so fresh outside.

557
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,470
Let's go out for a walk, okay?

558
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,190
Qiandai, is it someone's birthday?

559
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,270
Ye Qi.

560
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,670
Actually, I…

561
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,790
I've been…

562
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,750
We're going to be late.

563
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,400
Qiandai,

564
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,310
come with me.

565
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,830
I… But I…

566
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:34,470
[Ye Qi, I like you]

567
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,590
Ye Qi.

568
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:37,710
Ye Qi.

569
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,820
What's going on with you?

570
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,260
Qiandai.

571
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,710
Actually, I…

572
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,510
Wait a second.

573
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,390
Hello?

574
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:02,430
It's for you.

575
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,150
For me?

576
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,910
Hello?

577
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,510
Mr. Gong Jian.

578
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,350
Don't do anything silly.

579
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,030
I still have…

580
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,000
Okay, I'll be there in a minute.

581
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,190
What's wrong?

582
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,730
Something happened to Mr. Gong Jian.

583
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,750
But I… Here…

584
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,350
Qiandai, you…

585
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,730
Go over there first
and check what happened.

586
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,150
Go now.

587
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,550
Sorry, Qiandai.

588
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,790
He already missed
my love confession anyway.

589
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,000
[Zuo Qiandai, I like you]

590
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,710
I think someone is confessing their love.

591
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,510
Yes, it's so romantic.

592
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,990
There are words written on it.

593
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,870
It's so romantic.

594
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,230
I'm so jealous. It's so beautiful.

595
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,960
See how other people handle it.

596
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,310
Qiandai.

597
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,830
Actually, I've always…

598
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,990
Was Ye Qi

599
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,360
also going to confess to me?
