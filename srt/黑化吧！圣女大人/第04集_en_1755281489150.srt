1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not even going to forgive you for being so kind

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm not even going to forgive you for being so kind

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not even going to forgive you for being so kind

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not even going to forgive you for being so kind

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not even going to forgive you for being so kind

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm not even going to forgive you for being so kind

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not even going to forgive you for being so kind

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not even going to forgive you for being so kind

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you're going to give me your love

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to cry, don't you think? No more

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
One last time again, I'll give you my blood

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
For you, for you, for you

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to be kind to you

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm going to be kind to you

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to be kind to you

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to be kind to you

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What is the real purpose of this?

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There's someone here

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No way, if we don't do anything

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This way

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A rat!

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What, a rat?

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't care!

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I hate ugly and dirty things!

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do something!

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I hate ugly and dirty things

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
For Arian, am I the same as that rat?

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you for saving me, Master Shiji

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No, it was His Highness's order

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I was watching over you and the Commander

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Good evening, Lua

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The moon is beautiful tonight

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Master Suen

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm afraid of your unexpected power of action

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I didn't expect you to sneak in

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But it's not enough just to suppress their three-time site

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You can escape as much as you want

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's right

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We have to gather evidence of their evil deeds

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
For that

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll ask you to do it again

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Would you like to take revenge with me for their evil deeds?

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If I join hands with you

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will never forgive them

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Morning

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I was bold to sneak into the three-time site yesterday

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I see

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
By the way, His Highness gave me this key last night

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
When we become partners, I'll give you this key

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What is this?

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There is a secret room in the palace that is dedicated to me

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is the key

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's have a meeting there

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
First, come to the three o'clock tomorrow

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Don't let anyone see you

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll be waiting

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
His Highness is a very kind person

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But I decided to trust His Highness

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I will definitely stop the plan of the Commander and Arian

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The secret room

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The secret room is here

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Is His Highness already here?

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hello

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Welcome to my secret room

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Come, sit there

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There are few people here who know about the existence itself

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's a hiding place since I was a child

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Is it okay to put me in such an important place?

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Of course, I told you that we are partners

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We must share each other's secrets

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's right

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I said it before, but we will be working together

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Talk more comfortably

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's get along from now on

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Get along?

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's right

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can use this place as you like

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Come to read this time

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You like books, don't you?

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The reaction in the library was seen

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I really can't get out

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I understand, Suen

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So what is the specific strategy?

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Look at that

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Do you know him?

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes, he is a female commander

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Commander of the Ros Dedomond

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There is no one in the noble society who does not know his name

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He is a man who is recognized by his family, and he can't talk

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It seems that the skills of the foreign country are not good, but he is a man who is a villain who is good at his job

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He is living away from his wife and son

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This man is one of the three nobles who are cooperating with the new commander

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He has been using the skills of the foreign country to exchange personal materials with the country of the west

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But the trade is camouflage

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Some of the materials sent by the commander of the Dedomond are probably flowing to the Yuan family

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yuan family who controls the demons

97
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's a reward for them

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You are good at your job

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Not only that, Yuan family has made the demons quiet

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He is the one who is preparing to bring the demons into this country

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Many people are suffering from the damage of the demons

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If you wash the trade documents of the Dedomond's commander, you will definitely find the evils

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It will be effective as evidence to expose the new commander's plan

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
In other words, you can get the documents

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But how?

106
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Use this

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The dance party to celebrate his birthday is scheduled to be held soon

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I am invited as the representative of the royal family

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Dance party on his birthday?

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's a good thing to leave your family alone

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Really

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That?

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The accessories on your ears

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What?

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What's wrong?

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Nothing

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Are you going to enter the dance party?

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes, we are two

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Can you dance with me?

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
After all, you are a noble person

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm glad for your revenge

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Who is it?

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's you, Ari

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I was surprised

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You know it so quickly

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You like Ari, don't you?

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, yes

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I have something to tell you

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Join the dance party with Ari

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I received an invitation from Ari's house

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's the secretary's birthday party

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It will be gorgeous and wonderful

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't want to go to such a place

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Ari wants to go

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's enjoy the party together

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If Ari wants

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sorry, boss

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I was in a bad mood during the meeting

139
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What? Show me

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It seems to be broken

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I have to fix it quickly

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But in a sense, it's lucky

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Ari is here

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If she saved me, she would fix it immediately

145
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Sorry, Ari

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Can you do me a favor?

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's troublesome

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's tiring to fix someone

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I was excited to talk about the dance party

150
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I want to fix it very much

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I've been using too much of my abilities lately

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Is that so?

154
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I can't force Ari

155
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll ask other candidates

156
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes

157
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Let's go

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I hope my legs will be cured

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's okay if you're injured

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I want to dress up because I'm going to the dance party

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I want you to choose together

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Is that so?

163
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
My subordinate's injury is like that?

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Ari is just having fun in the dance party

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
My fiance is cute

166
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I understand

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Ari

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The new captain is calling

169
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
See you, Mr. Garrot

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Don't forget the promise

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm sorry

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sorry

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm sorry

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sorry

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm sorry

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm sorry

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm sorry

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm sorry

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm sorry

182
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm sorry

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm sorry

184
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry

185
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sorry

186
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry

187
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
