1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you give me the love that hurts

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to cry, don't you think? No more

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to cry, don't you think? No more

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
For you, for you, for you

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm going to be kind and give you my feelings

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to be the best I can be

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to be the best I can be

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
To stop the evil deeds of the new captain

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's good that you've infiltrated the Deadmond's club

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm in trouble

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's only five days until the club

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I decided to infiltrate

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I was collecting information about the Deadmond's club

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I completely forgot about the dress

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't have any clothes or decorations to wear

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What I had was a stupid bullying

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I was made a mess

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I was wanted by Arian and gave it to him

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
After all, that ribbon

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I haven't seen Arian wear it since then

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But what should I do?

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I wonder if I have to go to town

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The candidate for the political party

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Some of the money collected from the temple

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The money that can be used freely is allocated

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I applied and if it passes, I should get it

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The new captain is in charge

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I have never asked for anything and passed it once

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What's wrong?

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm here to deliver you

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
From Shiji

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Shiji?

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Is it from Suen?

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It was heavy

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why do I have to carry something for you?

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Moreover, Shiji is popular among the women

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Because you like men

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Did you make Shiji do it?

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
As always, it's a rude situation

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I really want to give you a little pain

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I have to try not to know this power

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But wait

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What is it?

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Do you still need something?

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Your words are not only for me

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It is also a insult to Shiji

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Please forgive me

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Why me?

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Shiji is the faithful servant of the Suen

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can't let him do that

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a insult to both sides

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I didn't mean to insult Shiji

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You were trying to insult me

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You used the name of the crown prince to insult me

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And you and I are the candidates

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Please stand up

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can step back

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I feel better

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What did Suen send?

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is...

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What a beautiful dress

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Shoes and accessories

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Dear Lua

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I made a dress for you

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I sent it as soon as possible

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I also asked the royal court to make it popular

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I wanted to make the decorations look good on you

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Did you like it?

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Suen

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Suicid

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You've been working without a break

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I asked the temple to give you a long vacation

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If you say something, show me this permit

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You can rest in peace

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're so considerate

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They're all wonderful

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The rest is the earings

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The earings are the only thing I have

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is my mother's treasure

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I think I lost one of them

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I miss her

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Is she doing well?

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That was the first time I used healing power other than my family

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Since then, my family has been ill

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
When I came back from playing outside

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This is my mother's treasure

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm not powerless anymore

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll make sure the mission is a success

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The day of the martial arts meeting

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Suen seems to be heading to the venue first

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
She made a reservation for this horse and Shiji

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Did something happen, Luwa?

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
No

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Please tell me when you're in a bad mood

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm entrusted with the duty of the king

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I understand

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Shiji is a silent person

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So it's a little awkward for two people

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I miss the talkative Suen

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Tonight the moon is hidden in the clouds

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's kind of ominous

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hi Luwa, you came

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:21,560
As I thought, Suen has the royal

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you, Suen

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But don't overdo it

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You were blonde, but your hair turned white

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's weird

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Who said it was weird?

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
They're so blind

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Your white hair is a proof of your strength

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Even if you're proud, you won't be told to be disdained

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
How can you say that about my hair?

123
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And it looks like my hair color

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But it's the same as Shiji's

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm kidding

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Suen, you're in trouble

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You finally smiled in front of me

128
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, let's go

129
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry

131
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Good luck

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Look Luwa, that's Redmond's servant

133
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm the one who's greeting you first

134
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He looks like a white-haired man, but he's actually a good-looking man

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
As the rumors say, he's not good with women

136
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I want to see him, I want to get close to him

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't rush, let's move

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes

139
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, this is Suen

140
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I can't believe I can meet you

141
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's been a while, Your Highness

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Suen has many people he can meet

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I have to move instead of him

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
First, I have to observe the venue

145
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Huh?

146
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That woman in the 9 o'clock

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
She looks pale

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I feel like I've thought of something

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll try to call her

150
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Um

151
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Oh, Luwa is over there

152
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This voice

153
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Alian

154
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Your Highness

155
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sorry

156
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry

157
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm sorry

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm sorry

159
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm sorry

160
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm sorry

161
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sorry

162
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm sorry

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm sorry

164
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm sorry

165
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm sorry

166
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry

167
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm sorry

168
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry

169
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Even today, I'm still lost

170
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm me

171
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I want to shout

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
My tears have already dried up

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm going to change right now

174
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm going to live in a dirty world

175
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I want to change right now

176
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Because there is a world I want to change

177
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm going to change right now

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm going to change right now

179
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
My precious thing is here
