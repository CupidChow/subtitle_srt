1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If love also CHANGE when hurt

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If love also CHANGE when hurt

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Then we can keep ourubsう

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We will finish with our soul

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll return your love, love, love

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I knew it, Lua! I didn't think we'd meet here.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Arian...

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Since the day we first met, you've been so straightforward.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You did that to me...

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hey, why are you here? Are you alone?

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It looks like you don't have a partner.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Aren't you lonely to be alone at a party?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Right, Mr. Garot?

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Y-Yeah...

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I was just invited because I had a little problem.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I have a partner.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, I'm curious!

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Your hair looks so pure when you look at it up close.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You look like an old lady.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Who did this?

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Calm down.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I see. You like this hair color too.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's more than the previous one.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Ari, let's go.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
She must have been bullying you.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You don't have to talk to her with Ari's kindness.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Kindness...

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's what you think of Mr. Garot.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But, but! I haven't seen Lua's partner yet!

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Hey, did you get that nice dress and accessories from your partner?

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you wearing earrings too?

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Show me, show me!

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No, stop.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't touch me!

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Sorry to leave you alone, Lua.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Suen...

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Good evening, Trevias Castle and the Chief of Knights.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is this your first time talking to both of them in person?

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Your Highness Suen!

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sorry for being late.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's okay. It's a break-off tonight.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Nice to meet you, Your Highness Suen.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
My name is Ariane Trevias.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't tell me you're Lua's partner?

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's right. I'm Lua's partner.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But what's the connection between you and Lua?

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The second prince and the only daughter of a lowly man.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes, she's a orphan.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But she was originally from a lowly family.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I recently learned about her situation.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm also involved in the orphanage's support activities.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So I asked her, who is a normal candidate but has a painful background,

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
to help me with my activities.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I also thanked her for that connection and invited her to this place.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Isn't that right, Lua?

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is the reason why I and Suen prepared this meeting.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That girl from the lowly family was a former resturant.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She was left behind and was saved by illness.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Poor girl.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That girl was a normal candidate?

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But Your Highness, you're doing a great job.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How wonderful!

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
She seems to have accepted it.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It was Suen's idea, but it was the right thing to do.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
She's also greatly appreciated by the public.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So that's why you two...

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Your Highness Suen is so kind.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But I hope you'll get along with Ali more.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes, please.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll be going now, Your Highness.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Wait!

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Captain.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Your father was an excellent knight.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You have many beautiful achievements, too, in the name of a hero.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's a waste of words.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But you don't seem to like women.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What?

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Shall we go, Lua?

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
How annoying, Lua.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I won't let you do as you wish.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You don't dance?

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No. I'm not good at dancing.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I see.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Too bad. I wanted to dance with you.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Then...

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If you're good at dancing, I'll let you dance with me.

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Really? That's a promise.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I want to dance with you as soon as possible.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll do my best to make you dance with me.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What are you talking about, Suen?

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That woman at the crossroads...

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Suen, that person...

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah, that's bad.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
She's definitely after someone with that knife.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Someone?

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Commander Dedmond.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The music is playing. There's no one around him.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's stop her.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Kill her?

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I have to kill her.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That man alone...

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Excuse me, lady.

112
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This is not a good time to take a break.

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Commander Suen, why?

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Don't make a fuss.

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you're not drunk, you won't get drunk.

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Then will you tell me the reason?

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're not doing well.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
My name is Charlotte Mayle.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I was a maid at the Redmond mansion.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He said I had a bad habit of being a woman.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But I had a good salary.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
At that time, I needed money to send to a poor family.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I worked for about two years, and nothing happened during that time.

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But my marriage was fixed, and I decided to quit my job.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Is that okay to say congratulations?

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Who is your opponent?

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm a young man named Alan, a childhood friend.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm opening a bakery without a auto.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I happened to go out to buy it in the city and I came back.

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
A bakery without an auto?

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, it's Viola.

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I've told you.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The freshly baked cream bread was delicious.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Your Highness, do you know her?

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I sometimes go out in the city.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I want to know the life of the people, and it's interesting and interesting.

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm sure Alan will be surprised to know.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I wanted to become a couple with him and support the store together.

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But...

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I was called to the Redmond mansion as soon as I told him I was quitting.

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
As soon as I entered the room, I was pushed down to the bed.

142
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No way...

143
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Even if I transfer to another room, I can't...

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Stop it! Stop it!

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's my husband's order!

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Let me enjoy it to the end.

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What a guy. The Redmond's master.

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Did you tell anyone about that?

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I was worried, but I told Alan the truth.

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What did he say?

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He was so angry that he never saw it.

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He came to apologize to the Redmond.

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I stopped him, but he said he couldn't forgive him.

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Then he...

155
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He put pressure on him so that he couldn't run Alan's store.

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So that's why you ran to the castle.

157
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes. I was ready to kill the Redmond and become a corpse.

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not married to Alan yet.

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He's not related to me even if I become a criminal.

160
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If he's gone, the store will be closed.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I wanted to protect his precious store no matter what.

162
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't cry, Charlotte.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We'll do something about you.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Right, Sven?

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If you want to do that, I'll help you as much as you want.

166
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can't leave a woman who's crying behind.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I thought you'd say that.

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Wait, Redmond.

169
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll pay you back for what you did.

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Charlotte went home for now.

171
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You're a good person.

172
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You took on things that had nothing to do with the plan.

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Sven said he couldn't leave her alone.

174
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He approached the Redmond and stole the transaction documents.

175
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He just wanted to solve Charlotte's problem with that.

176
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
With one move.

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Waltz for the Saint.

178
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's my favorite song.

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Wait, Sven?

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I did it! You promised to dance with me.

181
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Let's go!

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Your Highness Sven is dancing.

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He's so charming.

184
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The best dancer in the Restart Family is good too.

185
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You're good at stepping, but your expression is stiff.

186
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Smile more.

187
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I can't.

188
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I've been dancing for a long time, so I'm nervous.

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That earring.

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It was you, after all.

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm sorry.
