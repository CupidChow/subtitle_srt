1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
This...

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,500
Blood-Crossing Holy Book!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Blood-Crossing?

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,500
That's right.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,500
I, who have already stopped healing someone,

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,500
am not even a holy book.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,500
I will never forgive you.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,500
I can't even walk through the days

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
when my heart was broken

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
and my memories were scattered.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
In this world where I can't forgive

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
and I can't walk through it

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
I can't even walk through the days

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
when my heart was broken

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
and I can't even walk through it

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
in a world where I can't forgive

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
and I can't even walk through it

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
in a world where I can't forgive

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
a world where I can't forgive

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
a world where I can't forgive

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm a person like this

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Falling Falling Falling

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The words that are like a fire

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
have started to burst

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hey, last time

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I said that I love you

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
For you For you For you

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If I could give you the love that I want to give you

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,500
Don't cry, don't we pray no more

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Fly away, fly again

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,000
With all my determination

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,500
For you For you For you

33
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,500
I will gently fall

34
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
and return

35
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,500
my feelings that are scattered

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Save me Save me

37
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,000
This child was attacked by a demon

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Saintess, please, this child...

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you, Saintess!

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This temple is a sacred place

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
where people who have been injured or sick

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
seek the healing power of the Saintess

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We, the Saintess candidates,

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
work in this temple

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to heal people

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, I can't heal myself

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
unless I have a symptom

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I can't believe I'm suffering like this every time

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It can't be helped, you're different from us

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're a blood-sucking Saintess

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, my ability has a blood-sucking power

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can only do this by taking the symptoms of my opponent

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and healing myself later

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But, I can only do this by taking the symptoms of my opponent

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and healing myself later

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Above all, if I can heal someone even a little

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I have another ability

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that I can't use

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Rua, good job on your job today

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Aria...

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You don't have to worry about what those kids say

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Rua always works hard to fulfill his duties

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He doesn't do anything wrong

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm on your side

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Aria, thank you for everything

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If you weren't here, I...

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Of course, you're my best friend

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Anyway, Rua, isn't that...

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Lord Garroth?

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Y-You're right

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's Garroth Vance

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
A hero of the people who became the Chief of Knights when he was young

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I first met Lord Garroth when I just started my job

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Lady Seijo

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Y-Yes

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Can I ask you a favor?

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sorry

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let me do it again

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I can't do it at all

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can't do the job of Lady Seijo

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No one will succeed at first

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What?

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You may be the future Lady Seijo

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't give up

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I've been supporting that word from the beginning

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Lord Garroth is working hard as the Chief of Knights

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I have to work hard too

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're into Rua again

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
N-No

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I think Lord Garroth and Rua are a good match

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I-I can't do that

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There's no rule that Lady Seijo can't fall in love

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Besides, I'll support you

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Because I want my beloved best friend to be happy

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Arian

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I love you too

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you can find someone you like, tell me

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Of course

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Promise

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Open the door

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hurry up

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Open the door

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's noisy

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Lord Garroth

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why is it like this?

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The demon beast attacked us

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This is the power of Lady Seijo

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This wound...

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Is this the end of the hero?

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No way...

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
How could this happen?

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Then I'll...

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll cure Lord Garroth

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No matter how hard it is, I was saved by him

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Even if I have to risk my life

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I want to save him

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm scared

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Now he's okay

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
My body...

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It hurts

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I can't catch up with my self-healing

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Huh?

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is this...

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Like a soma-tou?

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Could it be...

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm going to die like this?

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Huh?

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm...

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Alive?

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, you're awake

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Um...

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You left your job as a Lady Seijo and went out

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Huh?

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You've been sleeping for a month after you've been injured

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What are you talking about?

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're a terrible person

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You should have woken up

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What are you talking about?

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But more importantly...

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Um...

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Lord Garroth...

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Lord Garroth was injured

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Lord Arian cured him with a life-saving treatment

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Huh?

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Unlike you

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The true Seijo, Lord Arian...

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What does that mean?

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll tell you

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The other two who were in that suit

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The marriage contract has been decided

153
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Why are Lord Arian and Lord Garroth...

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What's going on?

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Lord Arian and Lord Garroth are a perfect match

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They've been dealing with the recent demon-hunt

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Lord Arian was cured with a life-saving treatment

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He's worthy of being the true Seijo

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I knew it

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Lord Arian cured him

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Compared to that, Lua Restorat...

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You left the temple and played with men, didn't you?

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You said you were working for Lord Arian

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Why are you so shy with such a mature face?

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a curse of the temple

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's all true

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Because I heard it from Lord Arian

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Arian...

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He heard my terrible rumor

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Arian!

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Huh?

172
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Lua

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Hey, hey

174
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's all...

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's all a mistake, isn't it?

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You're my precious friend

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm scared! Don't come any closer!

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let me go, Lord Garroth!

179
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You...

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What are you doing to Arian?

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Lord Garroth...

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I heard everything from Arian

183
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He pretended to be my friend and used Arian to bully me

184
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I will respect you

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No...

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I...

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I will...

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I will...

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
No...

190
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm sure he won't believe me

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What I said...

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No one...

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's go, Arian

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Poor and miserable Lua

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Arian, I've always wanted to see your face

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You were a good toy to be bored with

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But you'll forgive me, right?

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Look, we're...

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
best friends

200
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Are you okay?

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes, Lord Garroth

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I was an idiot...

203
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I was alone...

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Hey, you're in the way

205
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Are you a virgin?

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
No way

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Hey, answer me

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Don't touch me

209
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What happened?

210
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Hey, don't go

211
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I've been hiding this power

212
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
that's the opposite of wisdom

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But...

214
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I've been hiding this power

215
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But...

216
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's more useful than death

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I won't...

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
heal anyone

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm still lost

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm still me

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I want to scream

222
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
My tears...

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
have dried up

224
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm going to rot right now

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm going to live in a dirty world

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I want to change

227
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I want to change

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I want to change

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I want to change

230
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
My precious thing

231
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
is here
