1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you give me the love I've been hurt by

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to cry, boy, pain no more

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to cry, boy, pain no more

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
For you, for you, for you

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm going to be kind and give you a new feeling

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to be the best I can be

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to be the best I can be

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Commander Flix Ronhearts

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We are gathering the candidates for the temple

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
They are all kind and friendly

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm glad you recovered from your injury

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But I'm not impressed that you were walking around without permission

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I hope you reflect on yourself

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I won't deny the terrible story that Arianne told me

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But is this really the black screen of the monster victims?

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then, when the treatment period is over, you'll be back to work

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll be back to work soon

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I've been working without a break

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't have a break like other candidates

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I think that's the most natural treatment for me

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Rue, you're better than other candidates

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So you have to work harder

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is for you

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
For me? Really?

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I have to look into it more

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
A royal library, as expected of Rionne

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I think there's some information about the Yuan people here

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
First, the characteristics of the people of the western country are

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The golden eyes and the colorful skin

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Especially the Yuan people...

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
There's one

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
They are a minority that live in the forest

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
They have the power to control the monsters

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Another characteristic is that they use their own language

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And put a pen like a dot on their neck

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Pen...

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Their own language...

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't think I've heard about that

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hello, Rue

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hello, it's been a while

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I feel like we're suddenly getting closer

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Good day, Your Highness Swayne

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's fine, sit down

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I thought you'd come here if you were a little shy

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Did you find out anything about the new captain?

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No, nothing yet

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I see, but it seems that you've been investigating the Yuan people

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Instructor

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm looking forward to seeing you for the first time, Your Highness

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Huh? The golden eyes and the colorful skin?

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He is Shiji Rubin, an excellent and reliable imposter

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He is not from the Yuan people, but he is from Heimin, a western country

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He said he had the opportunity to learn the language of the Yuan people

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If you have any information, please let me know

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Uh... Yes, thank you

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes, everything is as you wish

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He is a great priest

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And it's rare for a foreign countryman to serve the royal family

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is it a gentle and gentle re-enactment like the Suen Deng?

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll go ahead and apologize, but one last thing

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If there is a movement in the new captain, it is probably a quiet night

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You should confirm the truth with you

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well then

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Well, is my goddess really her?

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm secretly trying to escape from the Suen Deng

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
If I were to be found by someone now, I would be able to make a terrible rumor again

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It doesn't matter

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What was that?

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is the prayer tower

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It was supposed to be taken down, but it's not used now

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That person is the new captain Hosana

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Enan, I'm sorry to hear that

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's fine, I'm not a Revenger

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's a tattoo on his neck

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And this language

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm glad I learned the words from the commander

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I can hear it to some extent

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The new captain is waiting for you

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hurry up and go inside

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The new captain

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I really want to negotiate with them

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I want to confirm with my own eyes

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I want to chase away the watchman and go inside

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
My ability is not useful unless it touches the skin of a person

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So here

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Alright, I have no choice

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Excuse me

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What are you doing here at this hour?

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,780
I was lost in the new temple's

99
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:58,000
house, and I was wondering where the house was

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
A new person, huh?

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If you want to go back to the house, go there

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Thank you very much

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What?

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
My head is breaking

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry for giving you such a painful death

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I've experienced it in the past

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It went well again

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You did well this time as expected

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You managed to attack the village of Mileni with a demon

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Of course

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's easy for us to control the demon

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Give me the reward

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes, of course

114
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Even if you attacked the village with a demon

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The new captain is still black

116
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There seems to be another person in the back

117
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hey, new captain

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This voice

119
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Arian

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I want you to get the bride's seat as soon as possible

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The plan has just begun, Arian

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I just gave you the marriage contract with the captain

123
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Arian is aiming for the bride's seat with the new captain

124
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And the marriage contract

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's a great success

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I've always thought that the bride's Arian is the hero of everyone

127
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, in our plan

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
His ambition can be used

129
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But he didn't know it was a one-sided love

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It was always so sad

131
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He didn't know me that much

132
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If I say I support you two

133
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I love Arian

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's disgusting

135
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I can only use my humble abilities

136
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I can't handle a girl with a blood vessel

137
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I feel like I'm being spoiled

138
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I was serious

139
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I believed in you

140
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, well

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Rua's good sense of humor is not so bad

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
She's a good doll who listens to everything

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Good sense of humor

144
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm a doll

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If the plan progresses, you won't need that girl

146
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
If Arian becomes a bride

147
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Other candidates are like good hands and feet

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's right

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We have to destroy the demon

150
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Our true purpose is

151
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Our true purpose is

152
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh no

153
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Hey, there's a sound from over there

154
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There's someone

155
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No way

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What should I do?

157
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I can't find out here

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
At this rate

159
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I wandered in the dark

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Stopped by hatred and sleep

161
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The common sense of the human world

162
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The back that treats

163
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
In the entangled emotions

164
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The dead voice

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
As if the existence was proved

166
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Even today

167
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm still lost

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I am me

169
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I want to scream

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Tears are already

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Already dried up

172
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Because I'm going to change right now

173
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I can't live in a dirty world

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Because there is a world that I want to change

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Because there is a world I want to change

176
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm going to change right now

177
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What is important to me

178
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Here
