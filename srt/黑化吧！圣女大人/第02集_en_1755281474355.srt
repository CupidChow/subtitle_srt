1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not going to forgive you for being so kind

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If we can give each other love

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We can be happy even if we're in pain

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
One last time, again, I'll put an end to this

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
For you, for you, for you

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
For you, for you, for you

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll give back this feeling that I've lost

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll give back this feeling that I've lost

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll give back this feeling that I've lost

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hundreds of years ago, a plague spread in the Kingdom of Jid.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There is a legend about a girl who saved the people with her healing power.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The temple was created to worship her as the goddess Luce.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The temple has the same healing power as Luce.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It has been used as a political candidate for several times.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It uses that power for the sake of the people.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The healing power is said to appear in the middle of the noble women until they reach the age of 10.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The outstanding political candidate is officially listed as a princess and is ranked high in the royal family.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Moreover, the princess's seat is empty from 10 years ago.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's because there was no suitable candidate for the seat.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Before becoming a orphan, it was also a dream to become a saint when I was with my family.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's been a few days since then, but my hair color hasn't changed.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was about to die at the limit of my abilities and a mental shock.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What should I do from now on?

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hey, you, the blood-sucking fairy!

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What are you doing here?

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's with that hair? It's a strange white hair.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hey, are you listening?

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, me?

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry. I'm not a blood-sucking fairy, so I didn't know.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Every time these girls were bullied, Arianne took care of them.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now I understand.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I heard that you were leading the bullying.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I understand now.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm sure Arianne herself was leading the bullying.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
To make me laugh at her for making me believe that she was her best friend.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is the bride and groom's wedding banquet.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You shouldn't be here!

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're so noisy.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Will you be quiet for a moment?

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
My hand suddenly...

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is another ability that I've been hiding.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I can take on people's illness and injuries.

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I've been healing myself with self-healing for a long time.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I can transfer the pain I've suffered in the past to someone else.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
From this terrible power...

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've been thinking that I'll never use it again since I apologized to my mother.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It hurts! It hurts!

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
My arm!

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It doesn't matter who it is, so hurry up and heal it!

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You do it!

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No! I don't know what happened to me!

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What? I'm the one who's in trouble!

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I've given her a light punishment.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But I've been suffering from it many times.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The next day

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's healing.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What was that?

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
These children who look down on me and make fun of me...

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You can't imagine the pain I've been through.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I think it's time to go back to the room.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Excuse me.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Luer Restorat Castle.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You are...

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Your Highness Swen.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Swen Jead Kron.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,200
The second prince of the

74
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,000
Kiremono and the Hyouban.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He's so brave.

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I have something to tell you.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
About the darkness hidden in this temple.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Darkness?

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What are you talking about?

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You have a vision and power.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Will you join hands with me and take revenge?

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ah...

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is the royal garden.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What a wonderful place.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
People are washing here.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No one will ask.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Please sit down.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So what does the darkness of the temple mean?

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Your Highness Swen.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You can call me Swen.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We're going to start a new life.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Please talk to me more comfortably.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We're not going to start a new life.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What do you think about the

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
monster damage that's been spreading since last year?

96
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What do you think?

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't you think it's strange?

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The monsters are only in some parts of the country,

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
such as forests and wilderness.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
They've never been seen in our country.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They suddenly appear in every corner of the country

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and attack people.

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No way.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Someone is attacking people by using monsters?

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You're right.

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And that someone is the

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
most important person in the temple,

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I suspect it's the Chief of Staff.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The Chief of Staff?

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
When my family died of a mysterious illness,

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the Chief of Staff came to take care of me.

112
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I was careless.

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But even if I was,

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
what was your purpose?

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
To raise the temple's public support.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Since the monster damage has spread,

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
the number of candidates for the seat has increased,

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and the people's faith is concentrated in the temple.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's not just about the royal family.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The Chief of Staff will increase the rights of the temple

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and rule this country.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
No way.

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Isn't that a huge self-sacrifice?

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's right.

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And this isn't just Chief of Staff's plan.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The three nobles who donate to the temple are involved.

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
They are the Trevias White-Sharp family.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Arian's family?

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
She's involved too?

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The Chief of Staff is probably trading with

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
a family of other nations that have the ability to control monsters.

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The Western people are called the Yuan family.

134
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I've never heard of the Yuan family.

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So you've been investigating them.

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes, but they don't let me grasp their decisive tail.

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So I want you to help them fight their evil.

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why me?

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I told you.

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You have that vision and power.

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's not a neutral power.

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's a reverse power.

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Is that what you want to say?

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That power should be used effectively.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
My ability has already been grasped.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I haven't seen it yet.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I thought no one had noticed it.

148
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And in this regard,

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
you may be able to take revenge on Trevias Castle.

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:06,840
You seem like a very

151
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,000
very good friend.

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry, but I still can't believe

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
what you're saying.

154
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Can I think about it for a while?

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Of course.

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm looking forward to your good response.

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,800
The story from before...

158
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,800
If it's true, it's not something that can be forgiven.

159
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,800
But I can't make a mistake in making a decision.

160
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
I'm not the foolish me when I couldn't see anything anymore.

161
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,000
I have to find out the truth myself.

162
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,800
Lord Garotte!

163
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,800
Are you not injured today?

164
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Yeah, I'm fine.

165
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,500
That's good!

166
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,800
No matter how much you get injured, you can rest assured.

167
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,600
I'll help you again, just like before.

168
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,600
You're so kind, Ali.

169
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,100
You saved me back then.

170
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Thank you so much, Ali.

171
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,800
I'll protect you this time.

172
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Lord Garotte...

173
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Hey, Lua.

174
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Are you feeling better now?

175
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,100
M-Major...

176
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
I wandered in the darkness.

177
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,600
I was stopped by hatred and sleep.

178
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,600
The common sense of the human world is killing me.

179
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
In the entangled emotions,

180
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,600
The dead voice proves its existence.

181
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Even today, I'm still lost.

182
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
I'm me.

183
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I want to cry.

184
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,400
My tears have dried up.

185
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I'm going to rot right now.

186
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm going to live in a dirty world.

187
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,400
There's a world I want to change.

188
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm going to live in a dirty world.

189
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,200
My precious thing is here.
