00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,300
-Block him!
-Hey!

3
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,426
Hey, pass it to me!

4
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,970
-Here you go.
-Block him!

5
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,889
-Hey!
-Hey!

6
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,265
-I'm open!
-Pass!

7
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,433
Get her!

8
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,270
-Duck!
-Look out!

9
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:06,609
Out!

10
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:09,320
What's the matter? You're out.

11
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:17,244
Why do the boys always play soccer
while the girls play dodgeball?

12
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,206
Do you want to do something else?

13
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,667
No, it's just that
they get to use the whole field.

14
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:27,129
We only get this tiny space,
and they get everything else.

15
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,049
{\an8}14 M X 7 M = 98 SQUARE METER
90 M X 45 M = 4050 SQUARE METER

16
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,176
{\an8}Soccer's meant
to be played in a big field.

17
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,179
Otherwise, it would be footvolley.

18
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,140
So why do they
get to use more of the field?

19
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:40,810
We all pay the same amount to be here.

20
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,561
This is unfair to us.

21
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:46,398
Why would you think of it that way?

22
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,443
The boys like soccer,
so that's what they're playing.

23
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,571
You girls like dodgeball, don't you?

24
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,990
-Isn't that right?
-We do.

25
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,536
How would we know
if we haven't tried anything else?

26
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,914
And I like fairness
more than I like dodgeball,

27
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,707
so I want to play soccer.

28
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,335
You think too much for a little kid.

29
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,880
In life, you sometimes end up losing out.

30
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:13,717
Your friends won't like you
if you try to avoid losses all the time.

31
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,178
Do you want your friends to hate you?

32
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:22,560
No, right?

33
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:27,690
Just step out and stop ruining dodgeball
for all of your friends.

34
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,607
Out!

35
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,651
Now, let's keep playing.

36
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,111
Where's the ball?

37
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,655
-The thing about hate is…
-Oh, my.

38
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,783
What now?

39
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,494
Hate is the giver's loss,

40
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,162
not the receiver's.

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,668
What's your name?

42
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,421
-Son Hae…
-Talk faster, will you?

43
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,631
Tell me your name.

44
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:56,552
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">I'm a stickler for fairness

46
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,558
Come in.

47
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,354
Say hello.
He'll be staying with us for a while.

48
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,356
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">…a true model of kindness and generosity.</font></i>

49
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,526
Say hello.

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,404
She'll be staying with us for a while.

51
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,326
Goodness.

52
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,410
Say hello.

53
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,579
She'll be staying…

54
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,082
-Hae-yeong.
-<i><font face="Arial" color="white">I was told to take after my mom</font></i>

55
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,209

56
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,921

00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:48,604
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">The love and attention my mom gave away
were supposed to be mine.</font></i>

59
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,523
Careful.

60
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:53,901
Good job.

61
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,240
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">The time and energy she spent
should've been mine as well.</font></i>

<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Having never agreed
to be kind and generous,</font></i>

64
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,094

65
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,720
I'm losing precious time here.

66
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:23,973
Just tell me your name.

67
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,391
It's Hae-yeong.

68
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,059
Son Hae-yeong!

{\an8}EPISODE 1

70
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,649
{\an8}Hi, everyone.

71
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,442
{\an8}-You look great.
-Look here, please.

72
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:36,819
{\an8}Here we go.

73
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,862
{\an8}One, two, three.

74
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,409
{\an8}CONGRATULATIONS
KKULBEE EDUCATION CEO BOK GYU-HYUN

75
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,595
Hey, Ms. Son.

76
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,224
-You're here, Ms. Gong.
-Yeah.

77
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,935
I wanted to spend my precious weekend
in crowded Gangnam

78
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:12,479
wearing uncomfortable clothes
and eating expensive food.

79
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,356
With people from work you hate?

80
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,567
You're an exception.

81
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,361
How much will you give?

82
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,115
Well, about 100,000…

83
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,492
You and Woo-jae are college
and work friends, right?

84
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,161
Yes.

85
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:31,165
{\an8}I guess I'll give about 150,000…

86
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,459
{\an8}The food here
probably cost a pretty penny,

87
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,169
{\an8}at least 150,000 won per person.

88
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,506
If the food costs 150,000 won,

89
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,467
{\an8}then I should give 300,000…

90
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,511
Is this a wedding invitation or a bill?

91
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,599
Exactly.

92
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,769
If I add up all the congratulatory money
I've given out…

93
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,730
COLLEGE FRIEND
150,000 WON

94
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:55,814
COWORKER
100,000 WON

95
00:05:55,898 --> 00:06:01,612
COLLEGE FRIEND: 200,000 WON
COWORKER: 100,000 - 150,000 WON

96
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,197
…I could buy a small car.

97
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,616
No, at least a midsize car.

98
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,993
Think about all the congratulatory money
your parents gave.

99
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:12,247
Congratulatory money
is supposed to be give and take,

100
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,208
but I've only ever given.

101
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,211
At least you still
have a chance to take it.

102
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,088
I can only give now.

103
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,214
Just donations.

104
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,176
{\an8}CONGRATULATORY MONEY

105
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,236
{\an8}NAME OF GIVER AND AMOUNT

106
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,323
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">The whole country participates
in exchanging congratulatory money.</font></i>

107
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,659
Look over here. One, two!

108
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,787
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">You receive as you give
and give as you receive.</font></i>

109
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,124
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">It may seem like a fair system,</font></i>

110
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,458
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">but there's a catch.</font></i>

111
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,545
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">The added expenses brought on by inflation</font></i>

112
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,589
{\an8}<i><font face="Arial" color="white">and the cost of accommodation and travel
based on the wedding venue</font></i>

113
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,049
{\an8}<i><font face="Arial" color="white">are not factored in.</font></i>

114
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,928
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">And one envelope doesn't always mean</font></i>

115
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,847
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">only one guest will show up.</font></i>

116
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:14,059
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">It's also completely unpredictable
whether the person who received your money</font></i>

117
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:16,603
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">will remain your friend
without switching jobs,</font></i>

118
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:20,482
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">moving abroad, or even dying,
and return the favor.</font></i>

119
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,819
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">When you have to bet
on such unpredictability,</font></i>

120
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,197
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">whoever gives it first
is definitely at a loss.</font></i>

121
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,243
Welcome, Manager Son.

122
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,619
I didn't think you'd come.

123
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,329
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Don't people usually not show up</font></i>

124
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,206
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">to their ex's wedding?</font></i>

125
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,960
Of course, I came, Manager Ahn Woo-jae.

126
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,462
All of our college friends
and coworkers are here.

127
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,756
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">People would find it suspicious
if I hadn't come,</font></i>

128
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,258
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">you brain-dead idiot.</font></i>

129
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:49,595
Congratulations.

130
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,180
Just six months ago,

131
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,641
{\an8}I had no idea you'd be celebrating
such a happy occasion.

132
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,394
{\an8}<i><font face="Arial" color="white">I can't believe you're getting married
six months after I dumped you.</font></i>

133
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,855
It only took me three months to realize

134
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,816
that my dear Yi-lin is an imported sedan.

135
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,776
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Meanwhile, you were a lemon.</font></i>

136
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,154
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">That's for me to say.</font></i>

137
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,619
That is all. Thank you.

138
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,085
Hello. My name is Kim Ji-uk
and I hope to join Liter Electronics

139
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,462
at its overseas sales department.

140
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,673
I believe I have two qualities
that make me a good candidate to--

141
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:27,591
Are you an orphan?

142
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,010
Why is your family section blank?

143
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,430
Did your parents pass away
or were you born an orphan?

144
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,016
No one is born an orphan, sir.

145
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,186
My grandmother raised me with love
before she passed away,

146
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,231
and I had a good childhood
thanks to the charity of companies

147
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,233
such as Liter Electronics.

148
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,778
If given the opportunity
to work for Liter Electronics,

149
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:52,032
I will not only develop my abilities
and pursue my dreams

150
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,410
but also take it as a chance
to repay what I have been given.

151
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,624
People with backgrounds like yours
are often tenacious and insecure.

152
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,209
Does that describe you?

153
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,253
Water to a snake becomes poison,

154
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,088
while to a cow it becomes milk.

155
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:11,343
My insecurity has motivated me
to grow and develop as a person.

156
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,012
I received a full scholarship
throughout college, and--

157
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:17,849
This job requires you to be fluent
in at least a couple of foreign languages.

158
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,394
Are you, though? I doubt
you could've afforded studying abroad.

159
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,187
Where there is a will, there is a way.

160
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,273
Where there is none,
there are only excuses.

161
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,859
I learned English and Chinese
through means other than studying abroad--

162
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,695
Where did your parents go to college?

163
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:30,988
Do you not know?

164
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,699
I see you don't even have
any internship experience.

165
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:37,452
{\an8}I guess putting food on the table
meant a lot more to you.

166
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,329
{\an8}2023 3RD QUARTER
LITER ELECTRONICS INTERN RECRUITMENT

167
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,336
Ms. Jung Su-a,

168
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,339
24 is a good age to be dating.
Are you seeing anyone?

169
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,843
No, I believe self-development
is more important than--

170
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,886
Men would love that you live alone.

171
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,681
When do you plan to get married?

172
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,641
Would you keep working
even if you get pregnant?

173
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,602
Traveling is a big part of working
in overseas sales.

174
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,188
Wouldn't having children
interfere with your work?

175
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,316
Well…

176
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,903
If your superior accidentally touches you
while trying to encourage you,

177
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,947
how will you respond?

178
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,619
I will try to make sure
such a situation does not--

179
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,289
Well, what if it does?

180
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,375
Then…

181
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,919
I will

182
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,966
talk to my superior
about the situation and how I feel--

183
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,719
Oh, is that so?

184
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:41,683
Mr. Bok Gi-un, how will you respond
if a female coworker asks for help

185
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,269
regarding alleged sexual harassment
by a superior?

186
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,023
Well, first of all,

187
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,028
I would ask her whether
she misunderstood the superior's actions

188
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,948
or if her actions
might've misled the superior.

189
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:01,161
Furthermore, I know no one who works for
a company like Liter Electronics

190
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,497
would do such a thing.

191
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,499
That's what you call
secondary victimization.

192
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,379
Personally, I would advise her
to gather concrete evidence

193
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:14,383
such as texts, emails,
voice recordings, or CCTV footage.

194
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:19,888
Just as I have done.

195
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,518
What you just asked Ms. Jung Su-a

196
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,729
is a discriminatory act
violating the equal rights

197
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,940
stipulated by the
National Human Rights Commission.

198
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,150
What did you just say?

199
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:35,529
Are you accusing me
of sexism and sexual harassment?

200
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,782
Don't you know what stress interviews are?

201
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,326
And if you get on your high horse

202
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,454
and act all righteous,
what does that make Mr. Bok?

203
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,500
Do you think he answered the way he did
because he's a bad person?

204
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,628
He just has common sense.

205
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,965
In that case,

206
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,094
I apologize for my rashness.

207
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,638
Please give me another chance
to answer your question.

208
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,434
Fine.

209
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,769
How will you respond

210
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,772
if a female coworker tells you she's been
sexually harassed by a superior?

211
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,151
Will you tell her to gather evidence

212
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,194
and head to the Human Rights Commission?

213
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,879
Of course.

214
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,722
Excuse me.

215
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,517
I'd like to apologize for earlier.

216
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,853
-Apologize?
-To me?

217
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:54,357
It was inappropriate of me to interfere
when you were putting up with them.

218
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:59,446
And I'm not more ethical or courageous
than you are, Mr. Bok.

219
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,783
I was simply not as desperate for the job.

220
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,660
My professor put me up to this.

221
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:06,870
I see.

222
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,248
Is that why your clothes and hair are…

223
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,128
If both of you are not hired,
the blame belongs to me.

224
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,005
My apologies.

225
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,548
Jeez.

226
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,091
You're something, aren't you?

227
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,969
What does it make us
if you apologize about that as well?

228
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,721
Right.

229
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,141
I'm sorry for apologizing about that too.

230
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,727
Are you an angel or something?

231
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:32,979
Listen.

232
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:38,109
You kept that interview
from becoming a horrible memory for me.

233
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,819
I appreciate it.

234
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,280
And I wouldn't work here
even if they hired me.

235
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:43,448
Screw you!

236
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,950
So do you accept my apology?

237
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:51,331
-Of course.
-Of course.

238
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,254
If getting a job isn't your priority,
what's your plan?

239
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,090
Well,

240
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,678
I'm actually doing something
nobody knows about.

241
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,179
What's that?

242
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,601
Mothers of the bride and groom,
please enter.

243
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,106
I can smell the wealth from here.

244
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,567
I hear Yi-lin's family is rich.

245
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,860
I'm sure he took his pick.

246
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,947
You know how cunning Ahn Woo-jae is.

247
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,076
MOM

248
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,953
Excuse me.

249
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,456
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">It's me, Hae-yeong.</font></i>

250
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,084
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Have you eaten?</font></i>

251
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,211
I'm hungry.

252
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,005
I want food.

253
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,091
You just ate, ma'am.

254
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,594
She finished everything.

255
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,637
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Is she all right?</font></i>

256
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,097
Of course.

257
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,183
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">But you must be busy these days.</font></i>

259
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,564
Well, I'm at a wedding today.

260
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,149
I promise I'll visit next week.

261
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,317
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Please do.</font></i>

262
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:04,779
It may not seem like it,
but your mother misses you.

263
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,741
Okay, I will.

264
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,076
All right.

265
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,458
Mothers of the bride and groom,
please light the candles.

266
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,880
Please give them a round of applause.

267
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,470
Here comes the bride.

268
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,079
What a good-looking couple.

269
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,790
You're right.

270
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,708
They really are.

271
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,505
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Manager Ahn.</font></i>

272
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,680
{\an8}Yes, Manager Son?

273
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:12,764
{\an8}6 MONTHS AGO

274
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,308
{\an8}I already sent you
the workshop schedule by email.

275
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,852
It's not our date night.

276
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,145
I have something to tell you.

277
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,647
Is it urgent?

278
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,024
Yeah, let's break up.

279
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,735
-What?
-Let's break up.

280
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,197
Come on, don't mess with me.

281
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,871
Why are you doing this out of the blue?

282
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,748
No particular reason.

283
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,083
Did I do something wrong?

284
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,293
-Or is it a misunderstanding?
-My feelings are gone.

285
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,046
In other words,

286
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,508
I don't love you anymore.

287
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,804
It's over.

288
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,850
Hey, Son Hae-yeong!

289
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,222
Son Hae-yeong!

290
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,392
How could you break up with me here?

291
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:42,437
You don't have a car, so you'll be fine.

292
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,856
But imagine how painful it'll be for me,

293
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,066
thinking of you every time I park.

294
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,946
I'll find you another parking spot.

295
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,531
Drive safe.

296
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,878
Next, we'll take photos.

297
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,839
We'll begin with the couple's families.

298
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,467
You're doing great.

299
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,844
Let's stuff ourselves
with this expensive wine.

300
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,863
I'm so jealous of Yi-lin.

301
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,657
Today's their one-year anniversary, right?

302
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,075
I'm jealous.

303
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,326

HAE-YEONG AND WOO-JAE'S BREAKUP

306
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,877
WOO-JAE AND YI-LIN'S WEDDING
WOO-JAE AND YI-LIN'S FIRST DATE

307
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,797
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">He two-timed me?</font></i>

308
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,100
I was wondering how to get rid of her.

309
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,185
She did the work for me.

310
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,823
We'll begin with the bride, groom,
and their parents.

311
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,117
Please make a heart for the camera.

312
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,953
One, two, three. One more time.

313
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,831
Good. One, two, three.

314
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,543
Next up will be the bride
and the groom's friends

315
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,086
-and coworkers.
-What's going on?

316
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,921
Friends and coworkers,

317
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,925
please come up to the stage for photos.

318
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,511
Are you going to join them?

319
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:40,597
Of course.

320
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,526
-What on earth?
-Oh, my! What's happening?

321
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,601
What on earth are you doing? Back off.

322
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,394
I heard it's been a year
since you two started dating.

323
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,064
We broke up six months ago,

324
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,441
but it's your one-year anniversary.

325
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:34,609
Did you two-time me?

326
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,527
Who cares?

327
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,863
It's in the past now.

328
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,198
All right, then.

329
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,283
Smile. It's a happy day for you.

330
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,662
Here we go.

331
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,081
One, two, three.

332
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,876
Next, please make finger hearts.

333
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,212
One, two, three.

334
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,130
Great.

335
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,423
That came out nicely.

336
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,384
Bride and groom, kiss! Give them a hand!

337
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,844
Keep going.

338
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:22,115
Sir, I hear the spice level for the meals
is not up to par.

339
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,326
We'll have to make some changes.

340
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,287
The meals are too spicy and hot.

341
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,873
There's no way.

342
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,793
I worked so hard to perfect it.

343
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,545
I don't mess around with food.

344
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,298
But I do mess around in other ways.

345
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,431
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Come and eat, Ja-yeon!</font></i>

346
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,683
You go ahead!

347
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,894
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Come join me. I don't want to eat alone.</font></i>

348
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,105
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">I get that things are hot,</font></i>

349
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,190
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">but who gets naked on top of pesticides?</font></i>

350
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,574
The food's organic.

351
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,783
That means it has bugs.

352
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,618
Have you ever done it on grass?

353
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:11,039
It's so hard to focus when you don't know
if it's bugs or hands that are on you.

354
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,418
You've done it on grass as well?

355
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:19,672
I'm starving.

356
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,050
Who put you up to it?

357
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,260
Was it your idea or the producer's?

358
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,771
Oh, wow.

359
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,273
You've been too busy writing
to even go to the bathroom,

360
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,734
so I thought I'd show you
what real food looks like.

361
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,110
Ms. Cha.

362
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:42,612
I'm bribing you.

363
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,364
Don't forget to hire me as a voice actor
when your story gets adapted.

364
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,282
Of course.

365
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:47,992
When's Hae-yeong coming home?

366
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:50,578
Her college friends will be there too,
so probably really late.

367
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:54,332
I can't believe she went
to her ex's wedding to keep her secret.

368
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,417
Office romance is such a bad idea.

369
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,503
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">What's Wrong with Mr. Kim?</font></i>,
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Office Matchmaking,</font></i>

370
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,004
and <i><font face="Arial" color="white">Spice Up Our Love.</font></i>

371
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,255
Those are all office romances.

372
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:05,009
I want people to read about it
and not do it in real life,

373
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:06,552
especially Hae-yeong.

374
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,681
Oh, she's here.

375
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,811
Did you see your ex off well,
Ms. Generosity?

376
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,200
That bastard two-timed me.

377
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,244
-What?
-What?

378
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,454
They started dating six months
before we broke up.

379
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,413
-What?!
-What?!

380
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,124
The day he proposed to her…

381
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,793
was also when I dumped him.

382
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:40,837
I knew it!

383
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,172
I told you he wasn't the type
to marry in just three months!

384
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,716
What did you do?
Did you just let it slide?

385
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,104
Before the tea went cold…

386
00:23:58,729 --> 00:23:59,772
You brought it.

387
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,529
Oh, my gosh!

388
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,822
Are you crazy?

389
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,574
You're out of your mind!

390
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:12,451
-You went to your ex's wedding…
-And caught the bouquet?

391
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:23,212
Next up will be the bride
and the groom's friends and coworkers.

392
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,214
Friends and coworkers,

393
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:28,843
please come up to the stage for photos.

394
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,469
I'm passing. Are you going to join them?

395
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,556
Of course.

396
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:41,147
Please gather around the couple
and make sure there's no empty space.

397
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,316
Make sure your face is visible.

398
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,067
That's great.

399
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,778
Women must go on the bride's side.

400
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:48,946
-But I…
-That way.

401
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,115
That way.

402
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:52,366
Here we go.

403
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:55,703
One, two, three.

404
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,515
I regret giving the congratulatory money.

405
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,935
Jeez, my money.

406
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,478
My money!

407
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,230
Are you really crying about money?

408
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,858
Get married to any guy
and you'll get it back.

409
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,401
Would he come to my wedding?

410
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,403
And would he come alone?

411
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,697
He'll bring a plus-one
and only give me 300,000 won.

412
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,992
That's my loss.

413
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,620
Why did you dump him?

414
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,039
What?

415
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,791
You never told me
why you broke up with him.

416
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,417
Do you know why?

417
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,920
It's obvious why.
She probably thought she was losing out.

418
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,589
She's always been that way.
Don't you remember?

419
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:53,636
6 YEARS AGO

420
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,139
Jeez!

421
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,016
Hey.

422
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,520
You basically live here
and you always come empty-handed.

423
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,730
Does it not cross your mind
to buy supplies?

424
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:07,066
My living expenses
have doubled since dating you.

425
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,318
Am I dating you or adopting you?

426
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:12,113
Do you remember
when she dumped stingy Mr. Gu?

427
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,781
He was such a freeloader.

428
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,158
He always took fruits
and supplements without asking.

429
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,661
I fed him and let him sleep
and bathe here.

430
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,163
He'd do my bidding for a year
if he had a conscience.

431
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,542
Who was after Mr. Gu?

432
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,920
It was Mr. Battery.

433
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,588
You know, Mr. Park.

434
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,385
Is this really…

435
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,179
the best you can do?

436
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,473
3 YEARS AGO

437
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,517
I gave you so many chances

438
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,978
and this is it?

439
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,399
Did you even try your best?

440
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:51,944
Don't give me a half-hearted answer.

441
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:56,282
If you actually gave it your all
and this is it…

442
00:26:58,576 --> 00:26:59,952
Then you're hopeless.

443
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:05,916
Hear me out.

444
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,169
If he enjoyed it three times,

445
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,296
it's only fair
I enjoy it three times as well.

446
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,964
-Come on.
-Okay, fine.

447
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,342
Three's too much.

448
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,426
But what about once?

449
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,261
It's his moral duty to--

450
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,179
Not even once?

451
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:19,722
Not even once.

452
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,225
I mean, is this a public bathhouse?

453
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,935
He basically only showered and left.

454
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,354
His battery ran out?

455
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,814
At least he was nice.

456
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,483
Does the other stuff matter that much?

457
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,525
-Yes!
-Yes!

458
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,322
WANTED CRIMINALS

459
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,325
Hey, put it up straight.

460
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,745
These evil bastards
are crooked enough already.

461
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,873
Oh, here comes our saint.

462
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,794
Thank you for the clothes.

463
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,170
How did the interview go?

464
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,589
Well, the thing is…

465
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,593
I suggest you buy your own.

466
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:01,514
It's tough to get hired these days
even if you look decent.

467
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,142
I see a new wanted poster is out.

468
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:07,186
I can take some
and put some up on the way.

469
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,312
Sounds good.

470
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:12,566
You might not have a job,
but you're a hell of a saint.

471
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,194
It's nothing. It's all for the safety
of my neighborhood.

472
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,529
But you don't live here.

473
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:17,988
Sorry?

474
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,867
Well, I should go.

475
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:22,785
All right.

476
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:23,953
See you around.

477
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,207
Is that the guy

478
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,751
who reported five wanted criminals,
caught two himself,

479
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,837
and stopped countless perverts
and scammers?

480
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,964
Is that civilian officer number 28,
Kim Ji-uk himself?

481
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:38,259
He's an angel in human form,

482
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,594
but would he be a good son-in-law?

483
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:42,430
Is he too giving?

484
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:46,308
No, I don't like his look.

485
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,894
LOOKING FOR MISSING PERSON
WANTED CRIMINALS

486
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:52,273
So we get to take the waste paper
from all nearby convenience stores

487
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,526
as long as we have
those posters on our carts, right?

488
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,610
That's right.

489
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:59,155
Since we spend all day outside,

490
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,199
more people will see
these criminals and missing kids.

491
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,160
We collect waste and help each other.

492
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,121
-It's killing two birds with one stone.
-Exactly.

493
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,747
-Please remember.
-Yes?

494
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:12,042
If you see any wanted criminals,
call the police right away.

495
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:13,627
But do it discreetly.

496
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:17,590
Your safety must always come first, okay?

497
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:19,049
-All right.
-Goodness.

498
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,886
I wonder who brought up this angel.

499
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,346
-What an angel.
-You're right.

500
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,724
A true angel.

501
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,105
Hui-seong's leaving, Ja-yeon.

502
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,815
Bye!

503
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:36,525
Any plans for next weekend?

504
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,235
-Are you visiting Mom?
-Yeah.

505
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,862
Should I go with you?

506
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,198
I haven't seen her in a year.

507
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:46,660
Well, her house is a bit run-down.

508
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,078
It's too messy.

509
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:49,788
Who cares?

510
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,502
Does she not want us to visit her?

511
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,421
Don't be ridiculous.

512
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,965
She's just a bit embarrassed.

513
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,343
We'll go when the repair is done.

514
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:08,098
Oh, my little Hui-seong.

515
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,558
Do you want me to buy you jelly?

516
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,268
Jelly?

517
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:12,770
Are you still addicted?

518
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,107
I swear smoking is easier to give up.

519
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,610
Is it still the same guy
at the convenience store?

520
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:20,986
The rabid dog?

521
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:27,785
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Why is he such a rabid dog to you
and an angelic dog to me?</font></i>

522
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,955
I don't know.
He barks and snaps at me for no reason.

523
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,248
There has to be a reason.

524
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:34,041
There really isn't.

525
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,668
He hated me at first sight.

526
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,086
So why do you go there?

527
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,924
If he hates me for no reason,
I want to give him a good reason.

528
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,303
Hating me is just his loss.

529
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,781
Hello.

530
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,554
Where's the--

531
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:29,888
Discontinued.

532
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,057
I haven't told you what yet.

533
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,059
Mustard Pang Pang Jelly
has been discontinued.

534
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:37,605
Could you check the back for--

535
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,608
Five Giant Worms,
seven Molang Jellies, three Heybo Mixes,

536
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,818
six Golden Jellies,
and thirteen Podong Podong Jellies.

537
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,450
You're a human computer, aren't you?

538
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,118
Amazing.

539
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,871
Give me a pack of cigarettes.

540
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,585
Oh, I'd like a pack of Sunhill…

541
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,086
Right there.

542
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,635
{\an8}SMOKING SHORTENS YOUR LIFESPAN!
6 MG

543
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:12,890
Instead of the 1 mg, 3 mg,
slim, super slim, forest slim,

544
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:15,434
you gave me a pack of the heaviest 6 mg.

545
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,811
Why pay the same amount
for lower tar content? That's a loss.

546
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:20,272
-And is a shortened lifespan a bonus?
-Do you want to live forever?

547
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:21,482
-Hey!
-What?

548
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,819
-You little…
-You were rude to me first.

Aren't you going to get a job?
You've been a part-timer here for ages.

551

{\an8}YEON BO-RA HAS PINNED HAJUNLOVE'S COMMENT

574
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,875
What's so funny, Jeong-a?

575
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,502
I'm reading a fantasy novel.

576
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,670
Fantasy, you say?

577
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,172
What's it about?

578
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,509
It's about a man who loves a woman.

579
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,386
-Does the man have superpowers?
-No.

580
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,847
Is he an alien then?

581
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,809
No, he's from a conglomerate family.

582
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,520
How is that a fantasy?

583
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,605
You're surrounded by
conglomerate families.

584
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,608
Well, there's eternal love.

585
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,445
The man is committed to one woman.

586
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:20,619
You should focus
on eating during meals, Jeong-a.

587
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,454
Look who's talking.

588
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,289
Why don't you focus on your family?

589
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,041
That was a long time ago.

590
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,168
And not in front of Gyu-hyun.

591
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:32,923
Please excuse me.

592
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:36,093
What kind of CEO of an education company
doesn't even know basic manners?

593
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,428
How dare you leave
before your elders have finished?

594
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:40,138
Sit. I have something to say.

595
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,808
I'm sorry, but I have a meeting.

596
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,978
Of the people at your meeting,

597
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,813
does anyone outrank me?

598
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,485
Where are your manners?

599
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,037
Go with him.

600
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,832
He was never a good father,

601
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,001
but it seems he wants to be
a good chairman.

602
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:11,837
Okay.

603
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,768
I told her not to throw out
the newspapers in my study.

604
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,437
We need to hire a new maid.

605
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,898
Just say what you need to say
and stop rummaging.

606
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:32,649
Here it is.

607
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,156
GONGJIN THINK GREAT: UP 91.4%
KKULBEE EDUCATION: DOWN 52.7%

608
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:40,282
Aren't you embarrassed?

609
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,742
What's the meeting even for?

610
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,160
To discuss how to stay in second?

611
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,078
Didn't you see

612
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,956
that we're first in brand reputation
and employment desirability?

613
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,460
The worst insult
your grandfather ever said was,

614
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,920
"Well, he's a nice kid."

615
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:54,922
It means you're useless.

616
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:58,133
So your company has a good reputation
and content employees?

617
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,888
Am I going to tell the shareholders,
"He may not make money, but he's nice"?

618
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,349
-But--
-As an only child,

619
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,267
you may take your position for granted.

620
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:09,978
You see, you bring a receipt
even when you claim back an item

621
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,063
from a pawnshop.

622
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,773
But what will you bring to the table?

623
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,400
Just a paternity test?

624
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,819
-Number one in revenue in three years.
-Get married.

625
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:18,737
Excuse me?

626
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,531
You'll never make number one.

627
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:25,118
The least you can do is encourage me.
Why drag me down?

628
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,371
It takes a winner to know how to win.

629
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,415
An incompetent pretender like you
can never be the best.

630
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:33,418
I'll find you a partner more than worthy
of a second-place man.

631
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:36,213
If you want what's yours, get married.

632
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,589
No.

633
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,178
-You refuse to get married?
-Yes.

634
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,097
You'd rather try
to push your company to the top?

635
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,431
-Yes.
-Within a year?

636
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:47,516
Yes.

637
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:49,935
Wait, what?

638
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,524
Finish first in revenue within a year,
or you'll have to get married.

639
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,318
This is an agreement with a chairman.

640
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,237
There.

641
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,656
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">And there.</font></i>

642
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,157
It's all on tape.

643
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,619
That's ridiculous, Chairman Bok.

644
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,622

REASON FOR DEPARTMENT TRANSFER REQUEST

647
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:20,173

<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Let's go with "I humbly request."</font></i>

652
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:38,984
Sir, I hope you're having…

653
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:41,778
a good morning.

654
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:50,412
Today's not a good day for this.

655
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,290
Maybe next time.

656
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:54,624

RESIGNATION LETTER

659
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:35,332
Secretary Yeo.

660
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,043
-I want to code, sir.
-What do I do?

661
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,753
If you accept my transfer request,

662
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:41,546
I will do anything you ask--

663
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,631
-Marriage?
-Hey!

664
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:44,257
-What?
-Sir?

665
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,676
-"Hey"?
-A, B, C, D…

666
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,261
D, do you want to die?

667
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:51,556
{\an8}My apologies.

668
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,267
{\an8}What did you mean to say, sir?

669
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,852
{\an8}The chairman told me

670
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:58,438
{\an8}to either climb to first in revenue
within a year or get married.

671
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,524
Does it seem possible to you?

672
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,484
Do you want an honest answer?

673
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,653
It's impossible.

674
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,322
Exactly. How can our revenue jump--

675
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,490
Marriage, that is.

676
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:12,661
Are you saying it's impossible
for me to get married?

677
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,580
Well, you're not seeing anyone,

678
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:16,748
nor do you have a fling.

679
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,083
Have you been in a relationship before?

680
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,418
But saying it's impossible is a bit harsh.

681
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,504
I'm a third-generation heir
of a conglomerate family

682
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,382
-and a CEO.
-Oh, an arranged marriage?

683
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,262
Anyway,

684
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,389
do you really think

685
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:35,016
we can rise to first

686
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,060
-within a year?
-Of course.

687
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,479
How do we make it happen?

688
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,316
That's not for us to contemplate.

689
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,442
Then who should?

690
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,421
Wait, is the Mustard Pang Pang Jelly
are in stock again?

691
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:05,547
Yes, but…

692
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,721
MUSTARD PANG PANG JELLY
2,000 WON

693
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,763
Where?

694
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,809
Where? I can't find it.

695
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:18,977
You didn't let me finish.

696
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,353
They were, but they're gone now.

697
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,315
-What's that then?
-This?

698
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:25,567
The last one.

699
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,741
I'm dealing with cigarette withdrawal

700
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,993
with the Mustard Pang Pang Jelly…

701
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:36,494
What?

702
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,622
I'm off the clock.

703
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,583
You're so annoying.

704
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,460
I can hear you.

705
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:47,714
So annoying!

706
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,687
{\an8}YU-KYUNG:
WHY WON'T YOU ANSWER MY CALLS? I MISS YOU

707
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:12,280
Thank you.

708
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,324
DESIGN TEAM

709
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,494
I guess Manager Ahn's back
from his honeymoon.

710
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:20,205
Isn't staying single a trend these days?

711
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,665
What's wrong with our company?

712
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:24,709
Our company incentivizes
marriage, pregnancy, and childbirth.

713
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:28,004
All of the employee benefits
have to do with those three things.

714
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,382
Really?

715
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,511
I guess you wouldn't know
since you're not married.

716
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:37,430
Just from having a wedding,

717
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:39,891
you get three million won
and two weeks off for your honeymoon.

718
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:42,519
They also pay for wedding decorations
and rent buses for your guests.

719
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:45,105
Register your marriage,
and your spouse's medical expenses,

720
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,481
flower baskets on your anniversaries,

721
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,316
and a vacation every five years
are all on the company.

722
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,860
Once you're pregnant, you get
one million won per child until your third

723
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:52,028
and maternity insurance.

724
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:55,699
Once your child is born, you get a cake,
a day off, and a whole lot more!

725
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,410
That's a loss to the unmarried.

726
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,663
We work the same hours,
but the married get all the benefits.

727
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:02,956
You're wrong.

728
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,958
If anything, unmarried people work more.

729
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,211
{\an8}Married people have more vacations
than the unmarried.

730
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:18,305
Mr. Lee over there got married last year
and again this year.

731
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,182
I was shocked to hear it.

732
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:24,019
I didn't know he was divorced
when I got the wedding invitation again.

733
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:25,729
As long as you get married,

734
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,231
our company doesn't care
whether you live happily ever after

735
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:29,399
or end up living in misery.

736
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,401
Anyway,

737
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,361
after getting married twice in a year,

738
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:36,031
Mr. Lee got a month off
and a six million won raise.

739
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:38,408
What did you get
for working your butt off?

740
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:41,202
If you want a raise,

741
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,663
marriage matters more than performance.

742
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,049
HAPPILY MARRIED
GROOM AHN WOO-JAE AND BRIDE KWON YI-LIN

743
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:20,617
How was your honeymoon?

744
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:22,786
Good, thanks to you.

745
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,163
May I speak to you?

746
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:31,378
AWAITING YOUR AUTHORIZATION

747
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:32,545
{\an8}YOU DOG SHIT

748
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:35,757
Jeez.

749
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:38,510
How immature.

750
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,722
And it wasn't immature of you
to two-time me?

751
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:43,932
Was that mature of you?

752
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:47,352
You dumped me without even talking it out.

753
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:48,686
And ultimately,

754
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,524
you benefited from my cheating on you.

755
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,484
-What?
-Think about it.

756
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,779
If you were my only love,
I would've clung to you like crazy.

757
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,949
But I let you go easily,
so you didn't suffer any losses.

758
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:04,411
You're a master of bullshit.

759
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,080
Cut the crap and pay me back.

760
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:08,790
Pay back what?

761
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,294
The congratulatory money I gave you

762
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,840
when I went to your wedding
to keep our relationship a secret.

763
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:20,051
I wouldn't have been so generous
if I knew you were a cheating bastard.

764
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,513
Pay me back my 300,000 won.

765
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:28,893
Are you really doing this
just to get back your petty cash?

766
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:30,437
"Petty cash"?

767
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:34,232
Is 300,000 won a joke to you?

768
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:37,318
You can call me petty all you want,

769
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:38,653
but I want my money back.

770
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,864
Don't you want to know
if I ever really loved you?

771
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,658
Aren't you supposed
to make me kneel and apologize?

772
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,411
You never actually loved me.

773
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:47,704
I don't want your fake apology.

774
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:50,957
I don't give a damn
whether you kneel or whatever.

775
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,835
Just hand me my 300,000 won back.

776
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:56,588
How could you…

777
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,049
make everything about money?

778
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,010
Did you even love me?

779
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,303
What, you bastard?

780
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,641
MOM

781
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:12,187
Answer it.

782
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:20,195
Hello, I'm sorry,
but now is not a good time for me.

783
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,572
If it isn't an urgent matter,
I'll call you back later.

784
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:24,574
All right.

785
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:29,662
How's your mother?

786
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,500
You son of a bitch.

787
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,252
How dare you ask about her?

788
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:43,676
Considering how you cheated on me,

789
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,764
I lost out and didn't break even
in our relationship.

790
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,683
But I'll let it slide

791
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,852
and only ask for what I spent
after the breakup.

792
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,604
Give me 300,000 won.

793
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,069
I'll pay that money back

794
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,029
at your wedding.

795
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:08,368
Although I doubt a calculating person
like you could ever get married.

796
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:16,918
"Calculating"?

797
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:21,548
6 MONTHS AGO

798
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,888
Manager Son.

799
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:30,557
Manager Ahn.

800
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,351
Manager Son Hae-yeong.

801
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,770
Manager Ahn Woo-jae.

802
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,565
Manager Son!

803
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,525
Keep it down.

804
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,569
Manager Son Hae-yeong.

805
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:46,197
-Are you that happy?
-Yeah.

806
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,075
Come here.

807
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,834
If you're this happy as a manager,

808
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:59,919
imagine how happy you'll be
with another promotion.

809
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:01,337
By that time,

810
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,715
we wouldn't be dating in secret.

811
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,717
We'd be married.

812
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:09,637
Married?

813
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,767
Hae-yeong.

814
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:16,019
Yeah?

815
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:18,938
Are you the only one?

816
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,150
I know I'm the only one for you.

817
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:24,861
I'm talking about your mom.

818
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,781
Are you the only one…

819
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,827
who can take care of her?

820
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:35,496
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Ahn Woo-jae,</font></i>

821
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,416
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">it was you who was calculating.</font></i>

822
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:42,629
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">And I dumped you
because I didn't want to be a burden.</font></i>

823
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,050
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Yet you stabbed me in the back.</font></i>

824
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:50,094
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">I'll show you what happens
when you mess with me.</font></i>

825
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:56,893
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Wire me my money.</font></i>

826
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,020
I won't and I can't.

827
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:00,563
Oh, yeah?

828
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:02,023
Fine.

829
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:05,109
I'm here, Ms. Kwon Yi-lin!

830
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:09,238
You're just messing with me, right?

831
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:12,075
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">I'm sorry for making you wait, Ms. Son.</font></i>

832
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:14,786
It's all right. How was your honeymoon?

833
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,496
It was amazing.

834
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:19,624
EDUCATION TEAM 2 MANAGER AHN WOO-JAE

835
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:21,751
Hello?

836
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,465
Damn it.

837
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,357
Damn it.

838
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,998
Damn it, where is she?

839
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:14,178
-Yi-lin.
-Woo-jae.

840
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,097
How could this be?

841
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,015
I can't believe this.

842
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:19,267
No, Yi-lin.

843
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:20,643
Just listen to me.

844
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,688
-I can explain.
-I'm so moved!

845
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:25,440
Look at this.

846
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:31,028
What's this?

847
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:33,656
It's a candle holder. Isn't it beautiful?

848
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:36,159
Ms. Son made it
out of the bouquet she caught.

849
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:40,121
It's to wish for brighter days ahead
for you two.

850
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:44,167
I didn't realize how close you two were.

851
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,127
He never mentioned it to me.

852
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,962
I hope we can be good friends too.

853
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,380
I'd love that!

854
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,067
Pay me back.

855
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:13,696
I really want to, Hae-yeong.

856
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:19,994
But I live off my allowance.

857
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,662
It's 200,000 won a month,

858
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,247
and I can only use a debit card.

859
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,082
Yi-lin handles all our finances.

860
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,417
So what?

861
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,044
Don't you have a secret nest egg?

862
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,379
I had to reveal all my finances to Yi-lin.

863
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:33,883
Yi-lin will freak out
if she finds out I gave you money.

864
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:36,552
I know I'm a bastard who cheated on you,

865
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:40,848
but I want to be a good
and trustworthy husband to Yi-lin.

866
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,060
I love her so much

867
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:45,770
and I don't want to fail her.

868
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:49,023
I promise I'll pay you back
on your wedding day.

869
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:52,652
So could you please wait until then?

870
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:53,986
Please.

871
00:51:56,656 --> 00:51:58,866
-That's such a great idea.
-You should join.

872
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,701
-Maybe I should.
-It's worth a try.

873
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:03,246
It'll be under
the CEO's direct supervision.

874
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,081
BRIGHT FUTURE IDEA CONTEST

875
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:10,211
Companies foster talent

876
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,672
and talent fosters companies.

877
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,048
Kkulbee's talented employees

878
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,926
will figure out how to get us
to first place in revenue.

879
00:52:18,261 --> 00:52:19,637
In-house contests

880
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:23,599
are basically clueless higher-ups
stealing their employees' ideas.

881
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:25,685
"Clueless"?

882
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:28,896
A bright future!

883
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,606
First in revenue!

884
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,608
Your life as a lone ranger!

885
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:34,485
It refers to a lot of things.

886
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,362
Secretary Yeo,

887
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,114
will this work?

888
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:40,575
Our employees aren't as desperate as I am.

889
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,451
Sir, what's on the line for you

890
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:45,204
is a fancy wedding with a daughter
of a conglomerate family.

891
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:48,040
{\an8}But for the employees, their evaluations,
salaries, work experiences,

892
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:49,542
{\an8}and even lives are on the line!

893
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,377
Who would be more desperate?

894
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,172
Do you know what a rain ritual is?

895
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:58,092
I will not stop
until it rains cats and dogs.

896
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:04,098
Where did you learn all of this,
Secretary Yeo?

897
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:06,434
At grad school.

898
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,106
So are you transferring me
to the development team?

899
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,482
What?

900
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,610
You agreed to transfer me.

901
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,945
What's my schedule this afternoon?

902
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:21,616
Being a secretary
really doesn't fit me, sir.

903
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,326
No, it fits you perfectly.

904
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,704
No, it doesn't! I don't even know
what you're doing this afternoon.

905
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:29,332
Training session at the gym.
I have to do an extra set if I'm late.

906
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,667
Mr. Bok!

907
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,253
Fuck-gyu!

908
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:35,379
Damn it!

909
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,131
"Fuck-gyu"?

910
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:40,259
-Did you just swear at me?
-No, sir!

911
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:42,929
I didn't mean it like that!

912
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:48,893
Have you seen this?

913
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:53,522
BRIGHT FUTURE IDEA CONTEST

914
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:54,565
An in-house contest?

915
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:56,233
They're creating a TF team
under the CEO's direct supervision

916
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:57,485
to implement the winning idea.

917
00:53:58,486 --> 00:53:59,779
The CEO's direct supervision?

918
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:01,948
That means the winner…

919
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:04,367
They'll be on the fast track
to promotions.

920
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:07,620
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Office romance, office marriage.</font></i>

921
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,372
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">I don't need all that.</font></i>

922
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,792
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">First place in the in-house contest
and a fast-track promotion.</font></i>

923
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,168
Are you interested?

924
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,544
Very!

925
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:18,673
I'm sorry, but you probably won't win.

926
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:21,133
-Come on.
-Hear me out.

927
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,679
I know how great your work performance is.

928
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:27,515
Even your medical check-up results
are great.

929
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:29,475
But the thing is…

930
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:35,439
They don't recruit women for teams
under the CEO's direct supervision.

931
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:37,316
That's not true!

932
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,694
-Our legal team--
-You mean Attorney Kang?

933
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,570
She's married.

934
00:54:42,238 --> 00:54:44,198
There are no single women

935
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,617
in such teams.

936
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:51,706
Come to think of it,
all the secretaries are all men too.

937
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:55,334
Maybe it's a coincidence.

938
00:54:55,418 --> 00:54:57,753
A series of coincidences
hints at someone's intent.

939
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:01,007
Chairman Fork
has had a scandalous personal life.

940
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:05,219
Some say this was done
on his wife's orders.

941
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:08,014
Others say Fork-gyu is self-distancing

942
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:10,433
to avoid recreating
the same scandals as his father.

943
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:11,934
So you're telling me

944
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:15,062
Chairman Fork's vigorous crotch

945
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:17,356
and Fork-gyu's insecure ass

946
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:19,358
are interfering with my promotion?

947
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,027
Just because I'm unmarried?

948
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,611
Isn't this discrimination?

949
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:23,821
Of course, it is.

950
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,408
But to survive in an office,

951
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,869
you need to lay low
and put your head down.

952
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:33,831
If only you were married,

953
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:36,542
the fast-track promotion
would've been yours.

954
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:45,342
I'm done.

955
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,095
I'm done with work.

956
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,014
I give up on getting promoted.

957
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,224
I'm quiet quitting from now on.

958
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:55,936
Hello, sir!

959
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,563
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello.

960
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:47,822
Much better.

961
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:57,414
Welcome.

962
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,891
Please insert your card.

963
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:45,171
I'll pay that money back at your wedding.

964
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:47,381
If only you were married,

965
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,342
the fast-track promotion
would've been yours.

966
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:57,683
Damn marriage.

967
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,102
I would've done it if I could do it alone.

968
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:52,279
Ma'am.

969
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,241
Are you looking for something?

970
00:58:55,908 --> 00:58:56,784
Yes.

971
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,577
A groom.

972
00:58:58,661 --> 00:58:59,787
A broom?

973
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,706
Are you going to help me clean?

974
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:04,792
No.

975
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,419
The must-have to get married.

976
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,171
The guy next to the bride.

977
00:59:09,255 --> 00:59:11,465
Oh, a groom.

978
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,593
-Be mine.
-Be what?

979
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:15,928
Be my groom.

980
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:21,058
Please be my groom.

981
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:40,995
EPILOGUE

982
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,538
By that time,

983
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,707
we wouldn't be dating in secret.

984
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,625
We'd be married.

985
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:48,585
Married?

986
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:50,963
Hae-yeong.

987
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:51,880
Yeah?

988
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:54,550
Are you the only one?

989
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,137
I'm talking about your mom.

990
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,140
Are you the only one…

991
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,059
who can take care of her?

992
