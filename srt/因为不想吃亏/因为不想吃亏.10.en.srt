We met at the police station...

because I was the one...

00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,215
I was trolling her.

She let me off
in exchange for community service hours.

That's why you... were at the orphanage?

147

And then...

148
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,692
I fell in love.

149
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,860
Huh?

150
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:48,695
With the orphanage?

[Gyu-hyun] No.

152
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,703
In love with her.

Uh...

154
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,292
But it was the day I confessed to her

155
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,837
that I found out about Mr. Kim Ji-uk.

You're saying...

that the one who posted
all those negative comments

160
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,099
was you, Mr. Bok?

161
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,227
And you fell in love with Ja-yeon?

162
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,063
But you discovered
your connection to Ji-uk,

163
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,233
and used that as an excuse to hug her?

What has he told you?

168
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,992
That if you do what he wants,
he'll back off me and Ji-uk?

169

Uh, it's not that at all.

there's been a misunderstanding.

Oh, what's your plan with that, ma'am?

You must be picking them with your feet!

Also, whose fault do you think it is
that I lost my job?

Would she... actually hit Ms. Yeon?

226

239
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,602
You're very concerned about hygiene,
aren't you?

240

Of all people, you're dating Bok Gyu-hyun?

246
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,723
But Hae-yeong, we're not!

247
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,059
[Hae-yeong] So you hugged someone
you're not even dating?

248
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,978
Seriously, I swear
you are getting on my last nerve.

[exhales deeply]

[Hae-yeong] Regardless, I'm against this.

254
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:42,614
You can't change my mind.

255
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:43,740
I'll never accept it!

256
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,408
So you decide.

257
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,160
Hae-yeong or Bok Gyu-hyun?

258
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,120
-Son Hae-yeong.
-What?

259
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,164
If it's between the two of you, it's you.

260
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,668
That's why I wasn't gonna bring it up,
but you took it all wrong

261
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:55,961
and I blurted it out.

262
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,421
I, uh... Well, I, uh...

263
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,507
It looked like...

264
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,050
[Ja-yeon] There's nothing to be against.

265
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,303
I said I liked him,
not that we're gonna date.

266
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,682
As if it would ever work out.

267
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,185
What makes you say that?

268
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:13,979
He should be so lucky.

You're amazing, Ja-yeon.

276

Bok Gyu-hyun doesn't deserve you.

Oh, gosh.

278
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,932
My Ja-yeon's all grown now,
and falling in love.

279
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,976

00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,152
Any child of yours is my child too.

358
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,578
[soft chuckle]

359
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,873
Hui-seong, will you...

360
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,167
marry me?

361
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,836
Babe! [chuckles]

362
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,673
Are you really proposing to me
with a child's ring?

363
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,676
Look, anything I picked out,
you wouldn't have liked anyway.

364
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,930
Babe...

365
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,016
it was a mistake.

366
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,559
And mistakes happen.

367
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:53,771
We're human, so mistakes,
they happen with the best of intentions.

368
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,649
But...

369
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,068
we can't let this happen again.

370
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,448
'Cause it's not just about us,
another life's involved.

371
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:04,532
I know.

372
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,493
So I'll ask...

373
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:10,663
just think about it one more time,
and take me into account, all right?

374
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,041
We don't want a second mistake.

375
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,419
And so...

376
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,423
if my decision's the same, then what?

377
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,009
Then it's our decision.
One we arrived at together.

378
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,220
Not you, alone.

379
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,075
[grunts]

380
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,829
Wait, where is everyone?

[dramatic sting]

383
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,131
Where is it?

384
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:03,758
[sighs heavily]

387
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,061
I am 33 years old.

388
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,314
A 33-year-old... doesn't poop his pants.

-[door opens]
-[Ji-uk] Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun?

393
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,750
Did you just call my name?

394
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:45,049
Yes, Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun.

395
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,051
I stay one night and you look down on me?

396
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,344
How dare you call the president...

397
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,512
-[stomach rumbling]
-[groans]

398
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,930
Oh, but I quit, sir.

399
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,474
Or did I get fired?

400
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,353
Lucifer, I... You're still...

401
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,900
Come in unless you wanna pee outside,
Bok Gyu-hyun.

402
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,657

-Given my rank and personal dignity...

[stomach rumbling]

404
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,745
I couldn't see Ms. Yeon
when I'm like this.

409
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,268
[Gyu-hyun] Ah, Team Leader Son.

410
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,521
Your home is so bright and lovely.

411
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,648
Did you rest well, President?

412
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,276
Yes. Yesterday, I...

413
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,029
Oh, it seemed
you had a lot to drink last night.

414
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,031
Is your stomach all right today?

415
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,867
-Yes, it's fine.
-That's not what I wanted to hear.

416
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:56,787
Still, with such an important guest
in our humble residence,

417
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,831
we can't let him leave without a meal.

418
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,125
-Enjoy some breakfast, sir.
-Oh, no, thank you.

419
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:02,668
Ah, Ja-yeon, you're awake!

[baby cooing effect]

423
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,180
This is my roommate, Nam Ja-yeon.

424
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,306
[Hae-yeong] Say hello, Ja-yeon.

425
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,392
This is President Bok Gyu-hyun of Kkulbee.

426
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:19,435
Hae-yeong!

[comical music playing]

428
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,565
[whispers] Team Leader,
you don't remember what happened?

429
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,777
You want me to?

430
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,736
Huh?

431
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,447
Well, how do you think
I should feel as the victim

432
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:35,326
of an unwarranted retaliatory
personnel change

433
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,120
ordered by you,
an internet troll who posts venom,

434
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:42,124
and even got sued... 'cause of it?

435
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,126
[exhales heavily]

436
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:47,838
Breakfast is served.

437
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:48,965
[Gyu-hyun] Uh...

438
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,052
The man who fell
for the woman that sued him

439
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:57,056
and slept in the room of an employee
whom he coerced to quit...

440
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,684
deserves a Western breakfast.

443
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,653

[Ji-uk clears throat]

445
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:17,910
[Hae-yeong] Mmm!

446
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:18,911
-Ja-yeon.
-Hmm?

447
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,622
Eat up. I bought that so you could eat it.

448
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:22,957
[Ja-yeon] Hmm.

449
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,001
Enjoy, Ms. Yeon.

450
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,800
I had this yesterday, so...

451
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,641
Oh!

452
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,813
[Gyu-hyun clears throat]

453
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,899
By the way, Ms. Yeon,
when do you move out?

454
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,068
-[gasps]
-[tense music playing]

455
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,029
Have you got a place?

456
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:56,741
[whispers]
She doesn't know I'm moving yet.

457
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,784
You're moving?

458
00:26:58,868 --> 00:26:59,827
[gasps]

459
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,664
Uh... I will...

460
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:04,623
Why?

461
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:07,668
Oh, Team Leader Son,

462
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:11,297
she's a little self-conscious
around a pair of newlyweds,

463
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,215
who are living on different floors.

464
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,762
Although, since Mr. Kim Ji-uk
is going overseas,

465
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,972
-Ms. Yeon, you don't have to leave.
-[dramatic sting]

466
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:23,225
-[gasps]
-Overseas?

467
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:26,187
[gulps] Mm...

468
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,563
[sighs]

469
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,566
[whispers] Lucifer, you haven't told her?

470
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,735
Why are you going?

00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,075
-[loud clank]
-[Ja-yeon gasps, breathes shakily]

00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,163
-But ma'am...
-Sis...

474
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,539

[comical music playing]

476
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,251
Stay, Mr. Bok. We need to talk.

477
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:53,798
I...

478
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,722
[exhales heavily]

479
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,476
Eat all you want.
It's the last meal you'll get.

00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,628
Sorry for the intrusion.

Well...

This taxi's mine.

488
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,347
Please call one for me too then.

489
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,182
I don't have my wallet,

490
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,309
and my phone's dead.

492
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,983
You're on your own to find a cab.

493
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:56,444
Will this get you there?

[stretching effect]

495
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,159
Don't see Ja-yeon anymore.

496
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,997
This doesn't seem like enough
for bribery, but...

497
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,045
Look, that's between her and I.
You should leave it be.

498
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:16,213
Are you so sure?

499
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:19,800
That no matter what happens,
you'll stay by her side?

500
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,512
-Of course.
-I know I will.

[soft music playing]

502
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,726
As far as she's concerned,
I'm all that she's got.

503
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,561
Not you, Mr. Bok.

504
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,066
Why aren't you bringing up Kim Ji-uk?

505
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,820
Are you sure, Team Leader Son...

506
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:43,949
that no matter what,
you'll stay by Kim Ji-uk's side?

507
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,120
I'm not sure.

508
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,331
But...

509
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:55,294
I am sure
that I can destroy the one who...

510
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,505
blew up my entire world.

511
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,383
And by the way,

512
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,052
I'm no longer "Team Leader."

Where am I?

[upbeat background music playing]

520
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,715
Mmm.

521
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,760
Even if we both got kicked out...

Good food is still good food.

523
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,226
Seriously though, why?

524
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,019
Why do you want to move?

525
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:56,855
Uh...

526
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,901
-If it's weird for you having me around...
-Ah, no.

527
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:05,197
No, it's... personal.

528
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,325
The only reason I even thought about it

529
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,453
is 'cause I knew with you around,
she wouldn't be alone.

530
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,378
Bro-in-law, do you have to go?

531
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,256
Hae-yeong isn't good
at doing long distance.

532
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,093
If I don't leave,
it's going to be worse for her.

533
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,096
If she can't get promoted,
and can't get another job...

534
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,308
Bok Gyu-hyun said that?
He's going to ruin her career?

535
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,686
No, he didn't say that, and anyway...

536
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,022
he has his own reasons for doing this.

537
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,773
And his reasons matter more than yours?

538
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,318
You were just kicked out of the house.

539
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:44,945
Ah.

540
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:46,030
[sighs]

541
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,699
Your sister's really upset, right?

542
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:51,910
I guess maybe I shouldn't go home today.

543
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:55,998
No, if you don't go back today,
she might never forgive you!

544
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,291
You know she holds grudges, right?

545
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,376
So then, let's go back together.

546
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,337
Uh, oh...

547
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,798
I won't be going home today.

548
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,925
Huh? Why?

549
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,719
I'm "hermitting" for a while.

550
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,929
"Hermitting"? What does "hermitting" mean?

551
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,723
It's what you do
when you shut yourself away

552
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,016
and just write.

553
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,518
It's an unconventional method
for when you have a deadline.

554
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:20,189
Hold on, you're saying
that you're not going home today at all?

555
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,483
You're leaving me alone
with your furious sister?

556
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,818
I made these plans... a while ago.

561
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,422
Ja-yeon and the president of your company?

562
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:46,507
[Hae-yeong] Mm-hmm.

563
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,392
[Hui-seong] And the president
is your husband's half-brother.

564
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,728
Ah, so that's why she wants to move.

565
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:02,064
She could date him
without you keeping an eye on her.

566
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,524
Ja-yeon said that?

567
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,110
[Hae-yeong sighs]
It'd be better if that's the reason.

568
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,404
You'll be living alone from now on then!

569
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,780
I won't let her move out.

Are you okay if he leaves?

572
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,414
Of course. I'm fine.

Is it your stomach?

[retches]

582
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,269

[Hui-seong breathes heavily, coughs]

586
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,407

593
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,755
Tae-hyeong apologized.

595
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,135
He's sorry that no matter how long

596
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,137
and how deeply that he's loved me...

597
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,973
he can't take my place.

598
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,433
What bullshit is that?

599
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,227
He proposed.

600
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,814
But you don't even wanna get married.

601
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:27,941
[Hae-yeong] It's 'cause of the baby?

602

[Eun-ok] A baby?

603
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,362

the same life that he had,

as his son to honor him.

00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,806
Oh, are they in season right now?

-Ranunculus.

Bro-in-law,
if there aren't any, buy roses.

715
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:11,154
She also likes roses a lot.

716
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,532
Are you there?

717
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:15,867

723
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,881
Yes, I'm here.

724
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:33,677
[sighs] I was just feeling worried.

725
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,180
I... said some things
that I shouldn't have earlier.

726
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:42,018
Team Leader Son
didn't yell at you again, right?

727
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:45,272
-<i>She's... really scary.</i>
-Hmm.

728
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:49,567
Did you get yelled at?

729
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:51,403
Yeah, I got an earful.

730
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,698
She can say whatever she wants though.

731
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:55,991
No matter what, I will not give up...

Do you wanna, um... meet now?

735
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,082
Right now?

736
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,501
<i>I-I mean, if you can't...</i>

737
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,753
I can, I can. Where should we go?

00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,647
The circuit breaker tripped.

745
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:11,483
Oh, I can check it tomorrow.

746
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,902
Those are my favorite flowers.

747
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:15,695
For me?

748
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:18,114
Yes, here you go.

749
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,076
Hmm. Oh, thank you.

750
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,079
You haven't eaten yet?

751
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,623
I haven't eaten either.

752
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:27,957
[Ji-uk] Ma'am.

753
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:29,584
[Hae-yeong] Mm-hmm?

754
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,215
Why aren't you angry?

755
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:38,885
What is there to be angry about?

756
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:42,305
That I'm leaving here,
and I didn't tell you.

757
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,724
You had your reasons.

758
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:48,853
Just make sure you tell me...
when you'll go.

759
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,731
Buying the bed was a waste though.

760
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,691
It didn't get much use.

761
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:56,903
What do you wanna eat?

762
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,071
Is that it?

763
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,325
I might be leaving for good.

764
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,620
And you could never see me again.

765
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:08,248
Yet that's all?

766
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,796
Do you even know...

767
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:20,635

Ja-yeon and Hui-seong...

771
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,437
are the only two who stuck around.

772

Living like family,

773
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,733
turning into family,

774
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,820
and then becoming strangers again?

775
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:41,823
I'm so used to it.

00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,164
So I'm just another person?

You have to leave, right?

779
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,126
You're gonna leave.

780
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,253
So go.

So when I agreed to be your fake groom,

00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,363
I was an angelic puppy.

your grandmother just this once?

-Ma'am.
-[Hae-yeong] And your mom?

held you in her arms

Look where we are.

I don't wanna give the wrong idea.

I'm here for novel research.

thinking this was... a date.

Oh my!

It's my show.

Uh...

-Nope.
-Not even once?

Huh.

861
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,145
Why do you ask?

862
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:50,608
Readers said the President
doesn't eat in the cafeteria,

863
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,193
that it's not believable.

864
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,987
They can tell
I've never worked in a place like this.

865
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:56,697
Who said that to you?

866
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:58,032
Well, it's true though!

867
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,995
Starting now, I'll eat all my meals here!

Is it okay to go in there?

Yes, I already made sure
that no one's in there.

00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:41,052
Based on your expression,
I can see you didn't know.

894
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,263
And I don't think you would've...

895
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:46,349
acted that way if you'd known.

896
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:48,392
I'm the one who signs the checks.

897
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:49,518
How dare you!

898
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:51,354
[laughs]

899
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:54,440
What on earth?

900
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,484
Don't you recognize it?

901
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,069
<i>Spice Up Our Love,</i> Chapter 7.

902
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,738
It's the part where she learns
he's the president of the company.

903
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:01,656
Ah!

904
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:03,866
[clears throat]

905
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:04,951
[giggles]

906
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:09,038
Ah, so the... picky eater

907
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:12,583
with the palate of a child,
who complained and hated my cuisine...

908
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,419
was you, President Bok?

909
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,089
But of course.

910
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:21,258
I'd like... to say one thing,
if you'll allow it?

911
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:24,470
If it's an apology,
100 won't be enough for me.

912
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:27,974
Yet... I can be generous.

913
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:29,767
Go on and say it.

914
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:32,645
That one thing.

915
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:34,563
[dramatic music playing]

916
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,108
[Ja-yeon] You, sir,

917
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:39,819
will eat whatever the hell
I choose for you,

918
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:41,529
you picky-picky snob!

919
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,075
[both laugh]

920
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:04,260
The novel doesn't have a scene like this.

921
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,430
It does.

922
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:09,223
Well, I'm the one who wrote it!

923
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:11,142
I read it...

924
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,060
in the comments.

925
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,271
Comments?

926
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:20,401
"Just kiss her!" is what it said.

927
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:21,652
[soft chuckle]

928
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,491
[uplifting music playing]

929
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:02,902
[Ja-yeon clears throat]

930
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:07,198
-The main office.
-Ah.

931
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,667
Can't have you getting lost.

932
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:20,044
No one's here now.

933
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:23,506
I know it's the weekend, but...

934
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,174
there really isn't a single person here.

935
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,759
-[Yi-lin] How can you be working now?
-[music stops]

936
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:29,220
-Ahn Woo-jae!

[Ja-yeon gasps]

938
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:33,057
[Yi-lin] Ahn Woo-jae!

939
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:35,351
Keep walking if you want a divorce!

940
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,435
[Woo-jae sighs]

941
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:39,522
[sighs]

942
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:42,066
[Yi-lin] Answer me.

943
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,235
What's going on between you and Ms. Son?

944
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:46,237
[Woo-jae] Nothing is going on.

945
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,363
It's true that we dated

946
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:49,657
before you and I met,
but there's nothing between us now.

947
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,535
Yi-lin, how many times can I say it?

948
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:53,702
[Yi-lin] How many?

949
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:55,287
Hundreds, thousands of times.

950
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:57,498
As many times
as you had chances to tell me.

951
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:00,334
Tell me every time I ask,
every time I'm insecure.

952
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,418
When does it end?

953
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:02,878
It ends when I believe it.

954
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:04,797
When I start to feel reassured!

955
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:12,596
[Woo-jae] In college,

956
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,266
it was after
Son Hae-yeong's father was murdered.

957
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:17,268
Murdered?

958
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:19,520
-[somber music playing]
-[Woo-jae sighs]

959
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:22,231
[Woo-jae] Seeing how ill her mother was
at the wedding,

960
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:23,691
I felt bad for her.

961
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:25,860
I'm sorry.

962
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,404
That's all of it. I swear.

963
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,531
Thank you.

964
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,076
[Woo-jae] But you need to tell me now...

965
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,078
Son Hae-yeong's demotion...

966
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:39,456
you didn't ask for it, right?

967
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:41,750
-[sighs]
-This isn't me

968
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:43,544
worrying about her, but about me.

969
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:46,172
[Woo-jae]
The top brass could get the wrong idea.

970
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:48,132
It wasn't you, right?

971
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,175
[Yi-lin sighs]

972
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,135
[Yi-lin] Mr. Kim Ji-uk...

973
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,179
is the CEO's son.

974
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,890
Out of... wedlock?

975
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,516
[Woo-jae] Mr. Kim Ji-uk?

976
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,227
[Yi-lin]
They're going to send him overseas.

977
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,564
It'll probably be hard
for Ms. Son to come back.

978
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,859
[somber music continues]

979
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:17,494
-[Gyu-hyun sighs]
-[footsteps receding]

980
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:21,999
I'll explain...

981
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:24,710
if you want.

982
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:26,712
You don't need to.

983
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,924
That is Hae-yeong's to deal with...

984
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,177
and this is mine to handle.

985
00:58:35,888 --> 00:58:37,514
It's completely my decision...

986
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:41,644
[breathes deeply]

987
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,564
...not to see you anymore.

988
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:48,025
[somber music playing]

989
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,193
Not see me anymore?

990
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:51,237
Yeah.

991
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,366
Today is our first and final date.

992
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,620
-Ms. Yeon...
-[Ja-yeon] Hmm...

993
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,750
Thank you for the tour you gave me today.

994
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,796
It was fun getting to be
the heroine of my novel.

995
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,257
I really hated the negative comments...

996
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:15,844
although it was nice
to see you grow and apologize.

997
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:17,930
And also...

998
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,394
thank you for liking me.

999
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:27,815
Ms. Yeon...

1000
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,151
-But you feel the same way...
-This is...

1001
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:35,364
our happy ending.

[sighs]

1003
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:48,377
What an irresponsible author.

1004
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:51,630
This isn't...

1005
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,801
This isn't an ending,
it's a sudden pause in the story,

1006
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:58,387
and it's definitely
not a happy one for me or you.

1007

1008

[Hae-yeong groans softly]

1009
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:39,428
Did you sleep well, Ji-uk?

1010
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:41,847
Yup.

1011
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:44,058
Sleep in.

1012
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:47,144
I'll make you a wonderful breakfast,

1013
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,313
and then you can eat in bed.

1014
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:50,814
[Hae-yeong chuckles]

1015
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:52,483
Sounds great.

1016
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:57,071
You can't make breakfast though.

1017
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,072
Hmm?

1018
01:00:58,989 --> 01:00:59,823
Why not?

The circuit breaker.

1020
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:03,452
The fridge.

01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,788
Oh.

1022
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,373
[sighs] Dang it.

1023
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:12,753
I got it. I'll clean it all up
and restock the fridge.

1024
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:14,713
[Hae-yeong] Mm.

1025
01:01:14,797 --> 01:01:15,964
Don't stop.

1026
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:19,676
And before that,
I'll buy us a tasty breakfast.

1027
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:21,428
What else?

1028
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:24,723
And before I do that...

1029
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:29,812
[Ji-uk] Hmm...

1030
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:32,106

-[Ja-yeon] I'm home.
-[Hae-yeong] Oh!

1033
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,821
Why's she home so early?

1034

Wait, wait, wait, wait, I...

1037
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:45,911
What?

1038
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,538
I look embarrassing.

-[Ja-yeon] Hae-yeong!
-Yeah, what?

1043

Uh...

1047
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,820
I'LL HEAD TO THE KITCHEN

1048
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,405
YOU GO OUTSIDE!

1049
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,656
GOT IT?

1050
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,408
OKAY!

1051
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:30,622
[Ja-yeon] The fridge...

1052
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:32,875
It melted.

1053
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:38,005
Uh... well, I guess the fridge blew out.

1054
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,674
The circuit breaker tripped.
We should fix it now.

1055
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:44,761
Hold on, you knew?

1056
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:46,013
About the circuit breaker?

1057
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:49,308
Oh, uh...

1058
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,226
[shouts] Bro-in-law!

1059
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,729
[Ja-yeon] Did you know about this?

1060
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:55,230
That the electricity was out?

1061
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:57,566
[comical music continues]

1062
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,572
Did you know
that the whole fridge was gonna melt?

1063
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:04,781
Yes.

1064
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,116
Wait...

1065
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:10,037
What were the two of you doing
while the fridge turned into a puddle?

1066
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,166
Uh, we...

1067
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,586
You told me to... make up with her.

1068
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:20,172
You should've thawed her heart,
not the fridge.

1069
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,299
My precious fridge...

1070
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:25,260
Uh...

1071
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:28,347
What are we going to eat
now that the whole fridge is melted?

1072
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:33,143
I'll go stock up right now.
Ja-yeon, what do you like...

1073
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:36,063
Well, this is the first time
I've seen her so angry.

1074
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:39,733
Must be that she's super hungry.
Bring something good to eat.

1075
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:40,692
Okay.

1076
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:45,989

Oh, I'm so pretty.

1082

Oh!

1083
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,066
Huh?

1084
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:04,985
[Hae-yeong] Why is Mom's picture...

[dramatic sting]

1086
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:34,097
The food is here.

1087
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:41,063
Ma'am, what are you doing?

[light dramatic music playing]

1089
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,330

"Ji-uk's allowance."

1093
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:08,298
The Ji-uk in these records...

1094
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,385
that's you?

1095
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:17,349
Answer the question.

1096
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,355
The Ji-uk written down here...

1097
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:25,482
this Kim Ji-uk is you?

1098
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,658
You lived here before?

Yes.

1100
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,539
You were my mom's foster kid?

1101

Yes.

1102
01:06:45,377 --> 01:06:46,753
Then did you know...

1103
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:52,384
who I was then?

1104
01:06:57,973 --> 01:06:59,099
Yes.

1105
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:06,857
I can explain.

[somber music playing]

1107
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:14,698
Get lost.

Ma'am...

1109
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:21,288
