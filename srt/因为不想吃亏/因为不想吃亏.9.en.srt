00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,090
-Guys, I need you to focus.
-Okay.

3
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:50,092
-I want all your eyes on me, okay?
-Got it!

4
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,635
The goalie goes here, right?

5
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,720
-Yes!
-Yes!

6
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,222
You'll all go on the offensive.
I'll be the only one back there.

7
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,975
Start driving the ball from here.

8
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,227
Travel across the field with it.

9
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,687
-Okay.
-And then,

10
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:04,899
let it hit the net.

11
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,317
-Easy, right?
-Yes!

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,027
Here's our strategy.

13
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,111
There's not much to it.

14
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,613
There'd be a goalie, right?

15
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,822
-Yes!
-Yes!

16
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,575
Drive the ball across the field,

17
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,619
find a suitable position,

18
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:17,953
and kick the ball…

19
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,581
to hit the goalie.

20
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,249
-Why?
-Why?

21
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,753
Think of this as dodgeball, okay?

22
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:26,712
-Okay!
-Okay!

23
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:28,172
On three.

24
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,382
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

25
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,301
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

26
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:45,773
Let the game begin!

27
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,317
Kids, let's keep it chill.

28
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:51,737
Get it going. That's it!

29
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:53,447
Trying too hard makes you look lame.

30
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:05,876
Come here! Well done!

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,504
Great job, kids!

32
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,130
To the side!

33
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,590
Shoot!

34
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,843
There we go! Well done!

35
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,011
Yes, that's it!

36
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,888
Atta boy!

37
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,434
That's what I'm talking about!

38
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,939
<i>All right. We're playing dodgeball here.</i>

39
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:27,857
<i>Here we go.</i>

40
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,321
Don't come near me!

41
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:35,573
Aim for his stomach!

42
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,329
That's it!

43
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,222
Since our team lost the game,

44
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,807
the snacks are on me.

45
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,980
-Let's go wash our hands.
-Okay.

46
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,356
Let's go!

47
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,154
This is odd.

48
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,031
We won, but it feels like we lost.

49
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,782
Guys, let's go!

50
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,951
Wait for me!

51
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,872
Great job. Go wait for the snacks.

52
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,833
There we go. Wait over there.

53
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,587
Well done. Go wait for the snacks.

54
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,631
Come here.

55
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,507
Let's dry your hands.

56
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:36,926
Gosh, they're cold.

57
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,012
Mister, let's play C&R next time.

58
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,555
What's C&R?

59
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,223
Cops and robbers!

60
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,643
Hey, he can't be a cop.

61
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,269
Oh, right.

62
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,356
What do you mean I can't be one?

63
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,775
You're here because you did something bad.

64
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,736
Aren't you spending time with us
as your punishment?

65
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,748
Did you not have fun
playing soccer with me earlier?

66
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:08,916
I had fun!

67
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,209
You had no idea we were playing dodgeball.

68
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,254
I had a blast too.

69
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,799
How could spending time with you guys
be punishment?

70
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:21,178
I'm only here because I was good.
This is my reward.

71
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,013
-Really?
-You bet.

72
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:26,100
So enjoy the snacks and let me play cop.

73
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,811
I'll catch all of you!

74
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,271
All right. Go wait for the snacks.

75
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,314
-Okay.
-Good.

76
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,567
-Hello.
-Hello.

77
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,534
Ms. Yeon?

78
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,744
Ms. Yeon.

79
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,832
I didn't expect to see you again.

80
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,291
What brings you here?

81
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,255
Secretary Yeo's out buying snacks.

82
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,969
I have something to ask you.

83
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,054
Me? What is it?

84
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,765
<i>Why didn't you tell me</i>

85
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,018
<i>that Ha-jun wrote hate comments too?</i>

86
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,854
<i>Why did you stay by my side the other day?</i>

87
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,606
<i>Why do you keep reading my novel?</i>

88
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,066
<i>Why do you…</i>

89
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:17,985
Ms. Yeon?

90
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,154
<i>Why do you keep…</i>

91
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,697
Do you like me?

92
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,615
What?

93
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,159
Huh?

94
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:28,620
Oh, no.

95
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,457
What did I…

96
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,460
say just now?

97
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,837
You asked me if I like you.

98
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,632
I mean…

99
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,301
That's not what I was trying to say.

100
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,103
Do you like me?

101
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,108
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,280
Don't be. I'm the one who misunderstood--

103
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,281
I do like you.

104
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,326
I'm sorry

105
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,369
for liking you.

106
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,791
I know I have no right to like you

107
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,460
and that it's shameless of me to do so,

108
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,340
but I've fallen for you, Ms. Yeon.

109
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,347
That's amazing.

110
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,976
To think something I write in my stories
could actually happen.

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,230
Two people who started off as enemies
fell in love with each other.

112
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,694
So what happens to us now?

113
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,448
Nothing.

114
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,453
Our story ends here.

115
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,391
So the feeling's mutual?

116
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,393
-Sorry?
-You just said,

117
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,062
"Two people who started off as enemies

118
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,231
fell in love with each other."

119
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,067
Well, that was…

120
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,402
I wouldn't go that far.

121
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,488
Let's just say
I realized you weren't so bad.

122
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,656
That's all I need.

123
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,366
Please give me a chance.

124
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,784
I swear I'll treat you well.

125
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,580
Don't your novels all have happy endings?

126
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,506
I'll never have

127
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:46,550
a happy ending.

128
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,140
Ms. Yeon Bo-ra!

129
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:57,811
Ja-yeon?

130
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,272
What are you doing here?

131
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,107
The thing is…

132
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,652
Why did you call her Ms. Yeon Bo-ra, sir?

133
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,365
-Secretary Yeo.
-Ha-jun.

134
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,994
Ja-yeon.

135
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,205
Yeon Bo-ra.

136
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,000
So you're Yeon Bo-ra?

137
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,179
No, that can't be right.

138
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,061
No!

139
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,816
-No way.
-Please give us our snacks!

140
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,193
-No.
-Give it to us!

141
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,570
-Come on!
-Give it to us!

142
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,656
-It can't be true.
-Me too!

143
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,199
Wait. I'll pass them along.

144
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,127
You're heading home, right?

145
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,296
You can drop me off over there.

146
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:08,757
But it's so cold--

147
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,718
Cold or not, I can get home on my own.

148
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,724
Are you mad at me?

149
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,059
It's all because of you.

150
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,732
Ha-jun found out I'm Yeon Bo-ra!

151
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,943
And I had to confess my feelings

152
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,737
because of you.

153
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,786
Just let me drop you off at home.

154
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,665
You live with Ms. Son, don't you?

155
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,375
I should have her number here.

Suit yourself.

161
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,183
I won't be there much longer.

162
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,646
Didn't she have a housewarming recently?
Are you all moving so soon?

163
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,273
No, just me.

164
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,152
I can't live with her anymore.

165
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,407
I guess that's understandable.
She's newlywed, after all.

-So what was it anyway?
-What do you mean?

00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,885
The thing you wanted to tell me.

169
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,513
Right.

170
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,352
What was…

171
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,023
your father like?

172
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,151
Father?

173
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,445
You mean my dad?

174
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,949
I've never heard you talk about him.

175
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,578
And your mother…

176
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,542
I mean, I've only heard about her.

177
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,845
Would you rather not talk about him?

178
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,431
No.

179
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,228
He's off-limits in this house.

180
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,149
All right. I won't bring him up again.

181
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,444
We're all set.

182
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,654
Hang it up.

183
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,670
We're here already.

184
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,549
Thank you for the ride.

185
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:57,676
No problem.

00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,063
Ms. Yeon!

187
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,071
Can't I be your friend

188
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,449
or even just a conglomerate you know?

189
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,951
I could help with your writing.

190
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,372
That'd be too painful for you.

191
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,336
Knowing that you don't deserve
to be around someone

192
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,923
but still staying out of guilt
to repay their kindness.

193
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,012
It's really rough.

194
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,180
So don't do it.

195
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,350
It sounds like you've had experience.

196
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,772
Goodbye.

197
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,115
MOTHER

198
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,244
Yes, Mother.

199
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,336
What?

200
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,255
The curtain…

201
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,220
There we go.

202
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,894
Aren't we too close together

203
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,312
in this confined space?

204
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,578
Why are you still--

205
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,745
Where's Kim Ji-uk?

206
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:32,247
Sorry?

207
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,753
You said your mind's only attracted to
what your body is.

208
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,214
And you said your mind and body are one.

209
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,758
We're not even officially dating yet.

210
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,635
Are you sure about this?

211
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,269
I want to respect your principles.

212
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,696
Mr. Bok?

213
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:06,948
Mr. Bok?

214
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,074
Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun?

215
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,784
You.

216
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,870
Are you really…

217
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:16,666
My father…

218
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,752
My father…

219
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,921
You're not Kim Ji-uk.

220
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,136
You're Bok Ji…

221
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,854
Are you the chairman's son
born out of wedlock?

222
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,154
Answer the question!

223
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,323
Who on earth are you?

224
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:50,992
I'm Kim Ji-uk.

225
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,163
And I was born without a father.

226
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,959
Oh, no, Mr. Bok.

227
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,961
Please just talk it out.

228
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,505
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

229
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:04,923
Answer the question.

230
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:06,925
Are you Chairman Bok Gi-ho's

231
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,927
hidden son?

232
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,184
I suggest you ask him instead.

233
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,644
I know nothing.

234
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,314
How could you not have known

235
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,025
that you were a child of an adulteress?

236
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,573
Watch your mouth.

237
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,034
You should've watched your actions then.

238
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,245
How dare you

239
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,539
try to steal my place right under my nose?

240
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,585
I didn't.

241
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,005
I was threatened to join Kkulbee
and I only recently found out who--

242
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,424
So you knew everything!

243
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,971
But you still feigned ignorance around me.

244
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,725
Leave my company.

245
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,518
Got that?

246
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,063
That goes for you too.

247
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,233
Mr. Bok.

248
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,027
Why am I being dismissed?

249
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,553
Excuse me, Mr. Bok!

250
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,519
I had my hopes up for a moment.

251
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,022
But in the end,

252
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,275
it seems I'll forever be a villain to you.

253
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,580
Why would he dismiss you too?

254
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,334
Don't worry. I'll do whatever it takes

255
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,170
-to save you from--
-"Whatever it takes"?

256
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,094
There's only one way out of this mess.

257
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,433
You have to take over Kkulbee

258
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,812
and overthrow Bok Gyu-hyun.

259
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,155
{\an8}EPISODE 9

260
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,281
{\an8}Father!

261
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,452
{\an8}Did you do this?

262
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,537
{\an8}Go back inside, Gyu-hyun.

263
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,955
{\an8}You don't have the right to…

264
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,209
{\an8}Mother!

265
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:47,335
{\an8}Jeong-a!

266
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,628
{\an8}Don't!

267
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,171
{\an8}Please, not that one.

268
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,631
{\an8}You know its story, don't you?

269
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,050
{\an8}I jumped through hoops to get it
and poured my heart into it.

270
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,011
{\an8}I could say the same about Gyu-hyun.

271
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:01,057
{\an8}How dare you bring in a child
you had out of wedlock into the company?

272
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,060
{\an8}I told you that it was for his sake!

273
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,938
{\an8}You had a child out of wedlock
and had me find out this way for my sake?

274
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,648
By making him an employee at <i>my</i> company?

275
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,484
I made my decision as a businessman,
not as your father.

276
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,821
I wanted a son steeled by competition,
not coddled like some houseplant--

277
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:15,989
Shut up!

278
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,324
Jeong-a?

279
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,994
You go through the trouble
to prune your stupid plants

280
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,745
but deny my son an easier life?

281
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,500
I'm cutting off everything you've grown.

282
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,751
No, Jeong-a!

283
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:33,006
Cut my head off instead. Here!

284
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:35,675
Your head?

285
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,805
I mean, hair. The hair on my head.

286
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,599
You clearly said head.

287
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,644
Jeong-a.

288
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:48,855
Jeong-a.

289
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,862
<i>I don't know my father.</i>

290
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,488
According to my grandmother,

291
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,825
he was an asshole
who wouldn't even claim his child.

292
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,079
Who knew that asshole
would be Chairman Bok?

293
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,373
So that's why…

294
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:11,586
My team will be defending
Ms. Son and Mr. Kim.

295
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,715
I thought they were looking out for me
because I was their key talent.

296
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,176
Hold on.

297
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,552
Bok Gi-un's a nepo baby.

298
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,387
I heard the owner's entourage

299
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:24,849
requested the list of applicants
at every step of recruitment.

300
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,063
So Bok Gi-un isn't a nepo baby?

301
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:31,981
Unbelievable.

302
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,483
And he dared to report me?

303
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,655
Okay. Bye then.

304
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,115
There always have been rumors
about a child born out of wedlock,

305
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,576
but why did it have to be him?

306
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,458
How's your mother?

307
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,001
She's shocked,

308
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,463
but it seems
they haven't informed her family yet.

309
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,926
They didn't cross the line at least.

310
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,011
Not yet, anyway.

311
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,432
I'm sorry.

312
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:08,851
It's not your fault.

313
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,938
Still, I wish I had known earlier.

314
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,150
Then I wouldn't have gotten you
tangled up in all this mess.

315
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:18,861
Ji-uk.

316
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,615
Come lie down.

317
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,257
So? Is it comfortable?

318
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:40,842
Yeah.

319
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,969
I'm glad to hear it, Your Majesty.

320
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,554
How is your royal heart?

321
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,937
You should look into your heart as well

322
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:54,981
and see if you're okay.

323
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:58,776
Well…

324
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,240
What are you doing?

325
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,159
Ji-uk,

326
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,704
I'm a bit heartbroken.

327
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,127
You were forced to join Kkulbee

328
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,005
at the threat of some unknown blackmailer,

329
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,468
but there I was, freaking out
and making a fuss about getting caught.

330
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,888
I can't imagine
how hard it must've been for you.

331
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,891
When we met the chairman at the hotel,

332
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,978
you had no one to confide in.

333
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,900
I know it's belated,

334
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,651
but tell me.

335
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,237
How did it make you feel?

336
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,199
I was sad.

337
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,868
Because you met your father?

338
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,830
I've always hoped…

339
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,627
to become an indispensable person.

340
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,713
Someone who's useful and helpful.

341
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,344
That doesn't mean
I wanted to be used by others.

342
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,971
But that's how I ended up.

343
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,518
From my birth to the rest of my life,

344
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:17,480
everything has been out of my control.

345
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,732
I find that dejecting

346
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,360
and sad.

347
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:27,782
I wanted to be someone useful to you.

348
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,494
-Ji-uk.
-I'm scared

349
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,122
you'll suffer because of me.

350
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,675
Start crying or something
so I can comfort you.

351
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,051
Give me a second.

352
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,401
Not scared now, are you?

353
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:05,945
I'm here as your partner.

354
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,116
No more secrets between us, okay?

355
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,420
I'm still scared.

356
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,717
Is that why your ears are red?

357
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,389
Ji-uk,

358
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,726
let's leave tomorrow's worries
for tomorrow.

359
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,353
Okay?

360
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:42,857
Okay.

361
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,854
<i>No more secrets between us, okay?</i>

362
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:32,990
Hae-yeong.

363
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:34,659
Ja-yeon.

364
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:35,952
Hey, you're here.

365
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,037
Ja-yeon's upstairs.

366
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,289
You seem fine.

367
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,042
I thought you might need a drink.

368
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,753
Alcohol won't solve anything.

369
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:47,755
Then what could?

370
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,594
"Labor Standards Act"? Are you preparing
because you might get fired?

371
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,471
I won't get fired.

372
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:59,850
Let that damned Fork-gyu say
that I'm fired all he wants.

373
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,311
That won't threaten me.

374
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:07,858
The 21st-century laborer
has the Labor Standards Act on their side.

375
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:12,655
I'll hold out and stay on
until the very end.

376
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,448
You seemed ready
to take over Kkulbee over text.

377
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,492
I can't beat a conglomerate, can I?

378
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,536
Be guided by your head and not your heart

379
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,413
if you don't want any losses.

380
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,583
What about your partner? Is he okay?

381
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,213
I think so.

382
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,632
It's good that he's tough.

383
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:33,926
That's what makes me sadder.

384
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,845
My heart goes out to him.

385
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:42,018
Do you like him?

386
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,313
-What?
-Isn't it weird?

387
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:48,232
You hate suffering losses,
but you're taking his side.

388
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:53,863
<i>Divided we will fall</i>

389
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,575
<i>Shaken we will fall</i>

390
00:26:57,658 --> 00:27:00,786
His life has been rough as it is.
You're going to make it worse.

391
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,914
His mom and Chairman Bok
are to blame for that.

392
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,833
I hope they both go to hell.

393
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:12,006
Parents are usually off-limits,
but I guess nothing can hold you off.

394
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,592
Come on, giving birth
doesn't make you a parent.

395
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:18,262
It's a crime to bring a life
into this world irresponsibly.

396
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,309
<i>Our comrade's promise shall be kept</i>

397
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:27,355
<i>Even if they split our skulls</i>

398
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,399
<i>Divided we will fall</i>

399
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,619
<i>I had my hopes up for a moment.</i>

400
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,081
But in the end,
it seems I'll forever be a villain

401
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,666
to you.

402
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,713
Don't worry.

403
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,091
Hey, Ms. Cha.

404
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,552
I have to admire
how resilient Hae-yeong is.

405
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:01,097
Fork-gyu or whatever his name is
should be worried.

406
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,684
What's wrong?

407
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,853
Is something else bothering you?

408
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:09,647
Not really.

409
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,233
I'm just worried
about resuming the series.

410
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,276
Don't whine, Ms. Successful Writer.

411
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,197
Rest up today and start tomorrow.

412
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,365
Now, have a drink.

413
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,700
You're so clumsy.

414
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:23,077
What's wrong with me?

415
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,122

EXAMINATION RESULTS
3 WEEKS

417
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:39,343
Ms. Cha.

418
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,847
I took contraceptives.

419
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,850
But I had to switch the make
because of the side effects.

420
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,270
They both used condoms.

421
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,938
Isn't that worse?

422
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,357
You don't know whose it is.

423
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,656
Don't tell Hae-yeong.

424
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,465
What are you going to do?

425
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:21,844
Have you…

426
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,347
made up your mind?

427
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,146
Yeah.

428
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,569
Ms. Cha,

429
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:40,779
you're a good person.

430
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:44,366
Whatever you decide to do
won't ever change that.

431
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,451
But here's the thing.

432
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:47,995
We both know

433
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,998
the kind of hell

434
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,626
unprepared parents create.

435
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,464
I know you're not that kind of person.

436
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,758
I know full well that you're good.

437
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:01,842
I hear you.

438
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,721
I know what you're trying to say.

439
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,065
I'm sorry.

440
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,944
I wish I had better things to say.

441
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:24,740
It's okay.

442
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,577
Don't apologize.

443
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,332
It's all right.

444
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:46,762
You look especially sharp today.

445
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,389
I put in some effort

446
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,183
since it's my last time
going to work with you.

{\an8}RESIGNATION LETTER

448
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,775
-You're quitting?
-Yes.

449
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,987
I've already been the unwanted presence

450
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,822
who ruined someone else's life,

451
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,949
and once was more than enough.

452
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,743
I don't want to repeat the experience.

453
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:13,080
As I said, it's not your fault.
It never has been.

454
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:15,583
I know,

455
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,211
but none of this
is Mr. Bok's fault either.

456
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:28,345
Anyhow, who hands in a resignation letter
in person these days?

457
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,017
-Isn't this how you do it?
-You're supposed to submit it online.

458
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:36,687
I see.

00:31:56,707 --> 00:32:00,294
I'll talk to Mr. Bok.

00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,880
-I'll tell him I'm quitting--
-Do you think

466
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:04,715
I'll be safe if you quit?

467
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,884
This is a clear sign

468
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:10,137
that the asshole CEO
is set on firing me too.

469
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:12,973
Good morning, sir.

470
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,061
-Hello, Mr. Bok.
-Hello, Mr. Bok.

471
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,730
-Good morning, Mr. Bok.
-That son of a bitch.

Mr. Bok.

473
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:24,735
Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun!

474
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,710
I need to speak to you.

475
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:46,340
Mr. Kim, please contact me
to make an appointment with…

476
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,426
I'm curious.

477
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,387
It's about my family.

478
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:52,680
Ji-uk.

479
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:54,932
You want to talk here?

480
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,601
That's right.

481
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,902
Go ahead if you're prepared
to go all the way with me.

482
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:09,488
Kim Ji-uk.

483
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,450
I'm divorced.

484
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:17,913
"Divorced"?

485
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:20,499
What?

486
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,669
Ms. Son and I got a divorce.

487
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,639
{\an8}CRITICAL ERROR

488
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,808
I'm divorced.

489
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,393
What?

490
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,104
Ms. Son and I got a divorce.

491
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,231
So you two…

492
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,443
are no longer married?

493
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,194
Ji-uk.

494
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,743
Now,

495
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,786
Son Hae-yeong…

496
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:02,583
isn't between us anymore.

497
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:13,677
So you two are no longer married?

498
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,891
Son Hae-yeong…

499
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,687
isn't between us anymore.

00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,987
{\an8}RESIGNATION LETTER

501
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,739
I'll quit

502
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,699
as you want me to.

503
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,202
In exchange,

504
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,455
please cancel Ms. Son's reassignment.

505
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,832
She has nothing to do with this.

506
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,502
You expect me to believe
that you're divorced already?

507
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,712
You saw my rooftop room yourself.

508
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,380
We did get a divorce,

509
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,424
but I had nowhere to go.

510
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:54,635
You two seemed
pretty affectionate for divorcees.

511
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,138
-That's because--
-If you wanted to lie,

512
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:01,475
you should've removed your ring first.

513
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:09,358
At any rate,
your resignation isn't what I want.

514
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:12,736
Then…

515
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,081
What did you just say?

516
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,960
Send him abroad so he can never come back

517
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,336
just like his mother.

518
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:32,130
That's way out of line.

519
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,841
-Let me take care of--
-"Out of line"?

520
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,927
And this indignity I'm facing isn't?

521
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,387
That's not what I meant.

522
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,683
He just got married
and his wife is his only family.

523
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,476
Then we can use that woman.

524
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,561
Mother!

525
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:49,314
If you're going to strike anyway,
do so without any mercy.

526
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,441
Or your enemy
will only come back stronger.

527
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,446
I sincerely hope

528
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,575
you won't let me down again
like your father.

529
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,171
Your existence itself

530
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,592
is trouble and a ticking bomb
for the company.

531
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,886
Leave the country quietly.

532
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:22,472
And then what?

533
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,892
Don't come back.

534
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:26,977
Forever.

535
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:34,693

Apparently, the reason behind
Ji-uk and Ms. Son's divorce is…

00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,863
What are you up to, Ms. Son?

545
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,740

for you, Mr. Ahn.

547
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,498
FORK-GYU, YOU ASSHOLE! GO SCREW YOURSELF

548
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,421
Hae-yeong,
I realize this isn't the best time to ask,

549
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,215
but if you're "divorced,"

550
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,258
is your fake marriage…

551
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,596
over now?

552
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,558
I don't follow.

553
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,686
What fake marriage?

554
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:51,937
What?

555
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:56,066
You told me at the orphanage
that it was a fake marriage.

556
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:57,776
Me?

557
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,195
I never said that.

558
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,031
How could you fake-marry someone?

559
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,701
But the orphanage director didn't know
Mr. Kim was married,

560
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,327
and you didn't let me tell her.

561
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,038
-Because we were divorced.
-What?

562
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:11,415
We already got a divorce.

563
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,584
Why would I tell her he got married
when she was none the wiser?

564
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,169
That would be ill-mannered of me

565
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,130
to my ex-husband.

566
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,511
You know, I'm freaking

567
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,098
tired enough as is preparing
the material for you.

568
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:30,308
-So can you leave?
-Right, okay.

569
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,696
Damn, the good judgment and quick wits.

570
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,115
I'm amazing.

571
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:49,578
I mean, I'm obviously a great talent.

572
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,621
And he dares fire me?

573
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:53,373
That fucking bastard.

574
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,011
You wanted to see me, Ms. Gong?

575
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:07,596
Mr. Ahn.

576
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,765
I'm only asking you this

577
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:13,018
hoping that it wouldn't be true,

578
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,607
but you didn't have anything

579
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,109
to do with Ms. Son's demotion, right??

580
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:23,153
Please, Ms. Gong.

581
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,450
Obviously, I trust you didn't,
but the rumor mill is already churning.

582
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,161
Ultimately, you benefit from it the most.

583
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:36,958
Take my friendly advice
and watch yourself for the time being.

584
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:39,878
I will.

585
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,346
-Tae-hyeong.
-Oh, jeez!

586
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,227
I'm pregnant.

587
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,854
I'm five weeks in.

588
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:00,482
Really?

589
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:02,818
Are you serious?

590
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,196
And you're telling me that here?

591
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,614
I found out in a bathroom too.

592
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,951
Wait up, Hui-seong.

593
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,828
Five weeks, huh?

594
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,413
Yeah.

595
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,166
Five weeks.

596
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,253
If we go back five weeks…

597
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,967
-Isn't it mine?
-That's five weeks from my last period,

598
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,427
not from its conception.

599
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,680
But don't women just know?
I hear their gut tells them.

600
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,934
If we did, we'd be fortune-tellers
and not pregnant ladies.

601
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,855
How would I know what the guy doesn't?

602
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,863
-Stop looking at it.
-What’s wrong?

603
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,323
Do you have any idea how anxious I am?

604
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:51,908
The audition is coming up,

605
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:53,994
and I had to take a pregnancy test
and go to the hospital.

606
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,538
I'm losing my mind,

607
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,083
worried that surgery might affect
my breathing and vocalization.

608
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:03,336
Are you being indifferent
because it's happening to someone else?

609
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,213
"Someone else"? How can you say that?

610
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,799
-It's not like that.
-Then what is it?

611
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,433
My mom

612
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,644
had a dream about a pig last week.

613
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:23,023
I thought it was a lucky dream
and bought a lottery ticket,

614
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,232
but I didn't win.

615
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,360
Maybe it was a conception dream.

616
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:29,738
If it was…

617
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,450
We had an agreement, remember?

618
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,161
If something like this were to happen,

619
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:40,373
we'd all take responsibility
so no one person has to.

620
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,293
-Hui-seong.
-I'll let you know the surgery date.

621
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:57,307
<i>Leave the country quietly
and don't come back.</i>

622
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,184
Forever.

623
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:00,727
What if I don't want to?

624
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:04,022
What if I refuse?

625
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,608
I'll return the shock and pain
my mother and I endured…

626
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:10,779
No, I'll multiply them and return them
to the people you wish to protect.

627
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,739
-Mr. Bok.
-It's your call.

628
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:16,159
Either ruin your mom's life
and stay with Ms. Son

629
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,411
or leave on your own.

630
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:22,582
<i>Having you around
won't make Ms. Son happier.</i>

631
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:25,418
Ji-uk.

632
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:30,840
Don't you get the craving?

633
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:35,804
Shall we?

634
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:37,722
Right now?

635
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,267
But this is a no-smoking area.

636
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,810
Who cares?

637
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:45,105
The company's screwing me over

638
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,440
and the country won't protect me.

639
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:49,818
Join me. I'll teach you how.

640
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,989
It's not worth teaching or learning.

641
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:55,824
You know what?

642
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,660
You can never forget
the person who teaches you this.

643
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,870
Because you get hooked
and resent them forever?

644
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,665
Who even taught you how to…

645
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:06,418
What?

646
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:08,169
What are those?

647
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,964
Fully legal bubble wands.

648
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,096
Oh, wow.

649
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:08,897
Am I right or what?

650
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,399
Yes, I think I might be addicted.

651
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:16,696
I meant about Mr. Bok
wanting to fire me as well.

652
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,115
I knew it.

653
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,160
That petty bastard.

654
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:25,789
Ma'am.

655
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:27,791
Don't worry.

656
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,793
There are other companies out there.

657
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,546
Recruiters would go crazy
for someone with my resume.

658
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:37,133
I'll get a job at a rival company
and avenge you.

659
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:44,265
I thought saying we got divorced
would solve things.

660
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,435
I also thought getting married
would solve all my problems too.

661
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,940
I guess the saying,
"The end justifies the means,"

662
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,692
was only popularized
by those who achieved their means.

663
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:58,613
I'm sorry.

664
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,784
And our fake divorce story…

665
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,162
didn't fly.

666
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:08,331
Mr. Bok saw through it.

667
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:11,876
To tell you the truth,

668
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,172
our fake marriage was almost caught out.

669
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:17,924
By who?

670
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:19,926
Ahn Woo-jae.

671
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:21,886
What?

672
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,681
That little punk.

673
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:36,901
You'll be quite busy for some time
managing both teams.

674
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:39,487
I could just commute alone--

675
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:40,488
Yi-lin.

676
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:42,407
Was it your doing?

677
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,576
I'm asking if you had

678
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:46,995
anything to do
with Ms. Son's reassignment.

679
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:50,457
No.

680
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,167
So why was she demoted?

681
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,626
How should I know?

682
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:56,045
Why does that matter?

683
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:57,881
It all worked out for you.

684
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,507
How did it work out for me?

685
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:02,802
People were already saying
I was leeching off of Hae-yeong's work,

686
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:04,721
and now she's chucked away.

687
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,308
What do you think they'll say?

688
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,436
Are you worried about
people misunderstanding you

689
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,564
or Ms. Son misunderstanding you?

690
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:16,774
What?

691
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,570
Are you worried for her as a colleague

692
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,156
or as her ex?

693
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:30,538
Yi-lin.

694
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:31,831
How did you know?

695
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:32,957
Is Son Hae-yeong

696
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,921
your hidden past
or your unspeakable present?

697
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,006
Is that why you had Hae-yeong--

698
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,758
What I'm wondering

699
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:43,635
is why she got divorced.

700
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:47,096
I had nothing to do with it.
Nothing happened between us.

701
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:49,682
"Us"?

702
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:52,060
I mean…

703
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:55,522
Just go.

704
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,774
Where to?

705
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:00,485
Oh, right.

706
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:14,332
{\an8}I picked up some bread, Ja-yeon!
Come have some!

707
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,127
I'm home.

708
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:22,549
{\an8}GYEONGJU BREAD

709
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:25,802
{\an8}JEONJU BREAD

710
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,602
Another business trip?

711
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,604
Yeah, I'm off to Busan today.

712
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,274
What's with all these trips?

713
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,152
The decrease in the student population
and preference for face-to-face consults

714
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:47,073
has Popcorn Experience Centers
and Popcorn Houses practically crippled,

715
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:49,033
so they need to be shut down.

716
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:51,119
I see.

717
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:53,037
That doesn't sound too exciting.

718
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:54,372
I'm not traveling for work.

719
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,749
I'm traveling to buy bread.

720
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,544
Bye then.

721
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:02,547
-Safe travels.
-See you.

722
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:08,094
Jeez, who's calling this early?

723
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:32,660
<i>Passengers for the KTX
soon departing for Busan…</i>

724
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,800
Excuse me, this is my…

725
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:51,512
Wait, what?

726
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:53,848
Why are you here?

727
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,601
I'm in your seat because I'm yours.

728
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:00,813
Have a seat.

729
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,951
So this is why you hovered around me
when I was buying tickets.

730
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:18,706
I realized that aside from the wedding,
we hadn't done anything together.

731
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:22,669
You're busy on the weekdays
and have to rest on the weekends.

732
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,545
So what's on your agenda?

733
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:28,549
-Let's go to the beach.
-You've never been to the beach?

734
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,345
Get good food.

735
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,763
Good food?

736
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:36,974
Fine.

737
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:39,477
Just watch me then.

738
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,146
Watch me take in the beach
and eat good food.

739
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,274
I suppose that could be…

740
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:55,034
-Are you uncomfortable at home?
-What?

741
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:56,994
Is Ja-yeon mean to you when I'm away?

742
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,538
Is that why you're here?

743
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,457
What? It's not like that at all.

744
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,837
Speaking of which,
Ja-yeon's been leaving the house a lot.

745
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,380
Doesn't she work from home?

746
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,840
Yeah.

747
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,134
She rarely leaves the place.

748
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,220
Is it because
I'm making her uncomfortable?

749
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,681
Or is she…

750
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:19,142
seeing someone?

751
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:21,436
Ja-yeon?

752
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:24,772
-I doubt it.
<i>-The train will be departing soon.</i>

753
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:26,941
Take a look around.

754
00:50:27,275 --> 00:50:30,069
This is a new building,
and the units are quite spacious.

755
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:31,404
The subway station's nearby as well.

756
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,448
Could I sign the contract right away?

757
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:36,200
Of course. You can even move in today.

758
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,577
I'll take the unit then.

759
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:39,495
{\an8}NAM JA-YEON

760
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,125
I wired the money.

761
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,461
Can I register my move right away?

762
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:50,131
You're in a hurry.
Is someone after you or something?

763
00:51:06,773 --> 00:51:10,026
<i>Can you spare me some time today, Ja-yeon?</i>

764
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:16,616
HANBYEOL ORPHANAGE
SHOTS FROM THE SITE

765
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,034
LEARNING TIME

766
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:21,996
EVERYDAY LIFE

767
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:29,545
<i>I've never once thought you were dirty.</i>

768
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,881
I have no right to think so.

769
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:32,965
"No right"?

770
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:34,967
Did you also do something wrong, Lucifer?

771
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,178
I exist, for one.

772
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:40,681
But there's still a chance
to become clean.

773
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:43,100
I'll return the shock and pain
my mother and I endured…

774
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:45,394
No, I'll multiply them and return them

775
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:47,605
to the people you wish to protect.

776
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:55,863
Lucifer…

777
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,416
Sir, I'm taking a half-day off.

778
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,086
I'm aware. You can leave.

779
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:13,005
Don't you want to know who I'm seeing?

780
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,433
See you tomorrow, sir.

781
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,908
What kind of secretary
takes a half-day off?

782
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,245
KKULBEE EDUCATION POPCORN HOUSE

783
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:45,538
Is this it?

784
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,290
Yeah.

785
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:49,542
Keep yourself entertained, okay?

786
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:52,837
If you go that way, the beach and…

787
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:58,676
I won't do, see, or eat anything.

788
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,887
It'll be dull and uneventful.

789
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:02,972
I'll try to be done soon.

790
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,686
I'll be quick.

791
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:11,772
I'll just rush things and be done.

792
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,528
What am I supposed to say?

793
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,280
Take your time and do your best.

794
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:20,573
Don't worry about me.

795
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:31,250
Hello.

796
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:35,212
I'm Manager Son Hae-yeong
of Sales Management.

797
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:38,466
Oh, hello. I did get a call.

798
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,927
So are you the headquarters' inspector?

799
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,094
That's right.

800
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:45,890
I reviewed your consultation records,
utilization rate, and recruitment rate.

801
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,267
And I'm afraid--

802
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:50,645
You want me to
close this place down, right?

803
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,610
I started out as a Kkulbee Planner

804
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,904
and have worked for you
for over 30 years now.

805
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,953
The headquarters
have considered your predicament

806
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:09,205
and are willing to
assist long-time keepers

807
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:11,165
with career transfer programs--

808
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,834
Switching a career at my age
isn't all that easy!

809
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:16,045
Don't be so heartless.

810
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:18,923
Are you closing down?

811
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,175
Oh my, I didn't know you were here, ma'am.

812
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,594
Are you closing down?

813
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:24,971
Not right away.

814
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:27,807
Please have a seat. Come on.

815
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,058
It's all right.

816
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:33,729
I see you have a guest,
so I'll just get going.

817
00:54:34,689 --> 00:54:37,608
Come back tomorrow, ma'am.

818
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:42,488
Does she have a grandchild?

819
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,366
No, it's just that…

820
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:49,704
she wants to prevent dementia.

821
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:53,290
She started attending
the senior citizen center to play cards,

822
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:54,917
but she found it boring

823
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:57,378
and couldn't fit in with the crowd.

824
00:54:58,254 --> 00:55:00,131
She saw her grandchildren come here

825
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,299
and seemed to think it was preferable.

826
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,677
She's been coming every day ever since.

827
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,015
When this place closes down,

828
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,184
she'll be more distraught than me.

829
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:26,782
Hey.

830
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,536
Hi.

831
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:48,596
I hope I didn’t interrupt your work
by asking to see you.

832
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:49,764
It's okay.

833
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,850
I was out anyway.

834
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:58,272
I also thought
I should see you at least once.

835
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:02,068
"Once"?

836
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:04,904
It's uncomfortable for both of us.

837
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,783
It is for me, at least.

838
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:15,039
It makes me angry
that you wrote the most hurtful comment.

839
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:18,876
I'm sorry.

840
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:20,628
But then again,

841
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:24,006
I'm so ashamed that I lied to you

842
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,300
about writing children's stories.

843
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:29,720
And I'm so embarrassed
that you read my novel.

844
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:31,847
Not only that, I used your name…

845
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:33,140
Right.

846
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:36,393
I was embarrassed.

847
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,272
The male lead in your novel and I

848
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:44,110
couldn't be more different.

849
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:48,072
Thank you

850
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,576
for giving my name
to your awesome character.

851
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:56,080
It's an honor.

852
00:56:57,665 --> 00:56:58,541
And…

853
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,420
I'm really sorry.

854
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,507
For destroying the Ha-jun in your fantasy

855
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,510
and writing those hurtful hate comments.

856
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:12,513
I regret it so much.

857
00:57:12,972 --> 00:57:16,308
You should be sorry,
even if you were just following orders.

858
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:19,520
I know.

859
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:20,855
I should've refused.

860
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,524
I'm sorry I didn't.

861
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,276
Even if the comments
weren't directed at me

862
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:27,695
but a writer you didn't know.

863
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:28,737
You're right.

864
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:32,741
I won't ever write hate comments again.

865
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,035
Please forgive me.

866
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,251
I hear the food here is great.

867
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:58,684
MURDERER

868
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:11,989
Bro!

869
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,283
-Wait for me, bro!
-Okay.

870
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:17,453
I told you not to run.

871
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,289
Slow down.

872
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:24,335
Lucifer, we're friends who hung up laundry
and piggybacked each other.

873
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:27,296
Consider me your brother.

874
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:30,466
Ji-uk!

875
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:34,887
Kim Ji-uk!

876
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:41,101
<i>Having you around
won't make Ms. Son happier.</i>

877
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,263
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

878
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:22,810
Damn it.

879
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,853
What's wrong? Is it bad?

880
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,276
Isn't it amazing?

881
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:33,445
We should've had drinks last night.

882
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:35,948
This would've been so much better
as a hangover cure.

883
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:00,639
It's so pretty.

884
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,062
Look at the bird.

885
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:13,736
-Do we go in to touch it?
-I think so.

886
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,783
Here it is!

887
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:22,244
-It's so cute.
-It's adorable.

888
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:24,747
It's the one from earlier.

889
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:26,081
-A stingray.
-Look at the shark.

890
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,794
-Look, there's a stingray.
-Why is it following us?

891
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,087
Can we touch the shell?

892
01:00:32,171 --> 01:00:33,005
It has nostrils!

893
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:35,716
Look.

894
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,639
I can't tell which one's the flower.

895
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:46,060
Just as majestic as the bell.

896
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,567
We must be really high up.

897
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:03,327
It's so beautiful.

898
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,434
What's on your mind?

899
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:32,231
Is it the unforgettable person
who taught you that no-good habit?

900
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,817
No, my mom.

901
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:39,321
When my dad passed away,

902
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,366
I moved out right away

903
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:45,327
and didn't live with her.

904
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,414
After about five years,

905
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:51,708
she said she wanted to
move back to the countryside,

906
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,837
and that's when I moved back home.

907
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,882
If I had stayed with her back then,

908
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:03,053
played cards with her,

909
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,223
and read books together,

910
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:09,935
would she not have gotten dementia?

911
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,565
Ma'am.

912
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:16,984
I can't help but wonder sometimes

913
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:21,864
what her life was like

914
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:25,200
while I was away.

915
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:28,495
What would she have thought about?

916
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,834
I guess I'll never find out.

917
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:53,812
<i>The KTX train leaving for Seoul…</i>

918
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:55,105
By the way,

919
01:02:57,608 --> 01:02:59,193
why won't you tell me?

920
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:00,903
Tell you what?

921
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:02,696
The person who taught you how to smoke.

922
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,698
The person you'll remember forever.

923
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:11,663
Only the addicted can't forget,
but I've quit smoking.

924
01:03:12,915 --> 01:03:15,000
So who was it?

925
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,086
My memory isn't that great.

926
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,463
I forget easily.

927
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:21,298
Then I guess
you'll forget today easily too.

928
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:22,883
-Yeah.
-What?

929
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:25,427
Since that's the case,

930
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:30,974
let's come back before I forget.

931
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:41,026
Okay?

932
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,211
I won't get to see this again once I move.
I should take a photo.

933
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,219
<i>I bought you a new phone.</i>

934
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:10,472
I actually came in to leave this.

935
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:15,561
<i>Do you keep in touch with my boss?</i>

936
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:19,147
We're not that close.

937
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,487
It seems to me he feels differently.

938
01:04:30,576 --> 01:04:32,244
I doubt he could contact you first,

939
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,705
given the situation with Ms. Son
and whatnot.

940
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,294
Is he doing okay?

941
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:42,713
Your boss, I mean.

942
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,174
He's been acting strange lately.

943
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:48,010
He doesn't talk as much.

944
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:55,934
He's a jerk.

945
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,811
An utter jerk.

946
01:05:35,307 --> 01:05:39,770
MURDERER

947
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:43,607
Ja-yeon would love the soup
after having to eat all the bread.

948
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:47,903
Have a drink tonight
so you can enjoy it more tomorrow.

949
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:51,948
Good evening.

950
01:05:52,324 --> 01:05:53,158
Wait.

951
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:56,078
Why are you two together?

952
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:58,538
Do you know each other?

953
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,958
Do you know her?

954
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:06,046
Miss, I hope you're checking
your mail regularly.

955
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:07,339
Excuse me?

956
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:11,510
I can't go into detail
because of human rights and whatnot,

957
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:15,347
but make sure to check your mail
and text messages.

958
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:28,944
NAM CHANG-IL WAS RELEASED ON PAROLE
ON MARCH 16, 2024

959
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,697
RELEASED ON PAROLE

960
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:36,910
What's the matter?

961
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:38,704
Ja-yeon…

962
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:42,374
Ja-yeon.

963
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:43,667
Ma'am!

964
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,065
Isn't that Ja-yeon?

965
01:07:07,858 --> 01:07:08,692
CODFISH SOUP

966
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:10,652
Excuse me!

967
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:14,865
Ja-yeon!

968
01:07:16,283 --> 01:07:17,492
Are you okay?

969
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:18,618
Hae-yeong.

970
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:21,663
Who the hell are you?

971
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:27,627
Ma'am.

972
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:29,421
Ji-uk, call the cops
on that bastard right…

973
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:38,472
Mr. Bok?

974
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:20,222
{\an8}<i>Have you lost it?</i>

975
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:23,016
{\an8}<i>Of all the men to fall for,
you fell for your hater?</i>

976
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,101
{\an8}<i>Mr. Kim Ji-uk is the chairman's son
born out of wedlock.</i>

977
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:27,771
{\an8}<i>I doubt Ms. Son can regain
her position at the company.</i>

978
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:29,189
{\an8}<i>How dare you show up here?</i>

979
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:31,775
{\an8}<i>Especially after what you did!</i>

980
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,401
{\an8}<i>Stay away from Ja-yeon.</i>

981
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:36,321
{\an8}<i>-Are you sure you're up for it?
-What about you, Ms. Son?</i>

982
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:37,823
{\an8}<i>Can you stay by Ji-uk's side?</i>

983
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,324
{\an8}<i>I love you.</i>

984
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:40,492
{\an8}<i>I love you, Hae-yeong.</i>

985
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,660
{\an8}<i>You're leaving?</i>

986
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:45,539
{\an8}<i>You've never held me in your arms
and told me you loved me either.</i>

987
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:50,836
{\an8}Subtitle: Ji-hun Lee
