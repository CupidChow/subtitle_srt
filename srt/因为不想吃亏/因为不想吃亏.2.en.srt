00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,717
just hire a woman with a masculine name.

179
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,051
Your mom will never know.

180
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,680
Secretary.

181
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,143
Should I put up a listing for the job?

182
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:02,894
No way.

183
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,022
I won't lie to my mother.

184
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,315
Mm.

185
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,028
[sighs]

186
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,032
When will he ever...
settle down with someone?

187
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:24,833
[Yi-lin] There you are.

188
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,543
[Hae-yeong] I came as quickly as I could.

189
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,836
What do you need?

190
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,588
I'll explain when everyone's here.

191
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,423
Someone else is joining us?

192
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,848
Ahn Woo, uh...

193
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,851
Um, what is he doing here?

194
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:46,063
Is your meeting not done yet?

195
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,440
Please come in.
I wanted to talk to both of you.

196
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:51,902
Okay.

197
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,160
I thought it necessary
all three of us talk.

198
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,287
You wanted to talk to us?

199
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,210
You two are so much closer
than I had originally been aware of.

200
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,338
[comical music playing]

201
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,673
You were together, right?

202
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,717
[suspenseful music playing]

203
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,393
Well, it's not like I expected
Woo-jae to be a clean slate.

204
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,727
I wouldn't have dated him.

205
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,771
I don't want a guy with no past.

206
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,980
And, yet...

207
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,484
[sighs] ...a woman
he should've left behind him

208
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,030
comes to my wedding
and even catches the bouquet.

209
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,202
I looked like a complete idiot, you know.

210
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,620
[nervous chuckle]
Yi-lin...

211
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,788
That's...

212
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,295
[sighs in relief]

213
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,089
Wow, what a seal.

214
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,091
Sike.

215
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,933
[gasps]

216
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,561
Oh! The heat retention.

217
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,730
-[knife slash sound effect]
-[squeals]

218
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,526
[Yi-lin] I know it wasn't on purpose.

219
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:18,530
However, the president
is watching the competition closely,

220
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,449
so once a proposal goes through,

221
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,660
each one is going through
a rigorous review process.

222
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,537
I wanted to talk to the two of you

223
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,541
because I thought it best to deal
with it myself before it comes to a head.

224
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:34,087
Ah, you're saying that the proposal
I submitted for the contest

225
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,256
is similar to the one
Manager Ahn submitted.

226
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,841
Is that what the issue is?

227
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:42,304
Well, they're not just similar,
about 90 percent of the two is identical.

228
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,974
Now, I believe that you both came up
with similar ideas

229
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,684
through sheer coincidence.

230
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,353
Since you work on the same projects

231
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,023
and exchanging ideas
is how you collaborate.

232
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,694
[Woo-jae] <i>An educational game?</i>

233
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,778
[Hae-yeong] Mm-hmm.

234
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,907
Imagine creating a game together

235
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,075
to teach arithmetic with AI.

236
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,411
[Woo-jae] Hmm...

237
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:09,498
Teaching video game
doesn't sound very fun.

238
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,292
That's why we would make it fun.

239
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,462
Like, there's a game,

240
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,797
a farming game
I've been playing on my phone.

241
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,218
So that's why your texts
have been so boring, hmm...

242
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,387
I use game credits,
so I harvest my crops faster.

243
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,598
We could do the same
with the teaching game.

244
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,976
But instead of credits,
player would need to use arithmetic to...

245
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,686
Hey!

246
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,896
Listen to me.

247
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,356
I'm listening.

248
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,484
No, actually, focus and pay attention.

249
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,402
I am focusing.

250
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,987
[chuckles] You little...

251
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,325
[Yi-lin] Please talk about it
and come to a decision

252
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,452
before I submit these ideas
for final judging.

253
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,703
Right.
[awkward chuckle]

254
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,133
Manager Son, where are you going?

255
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,345
Cafeteria. It's time for lunch.

256
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,430
Did you not understand
what she was saying?

257
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,099
If we don't come to an agreement,
then we...

258
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:10,809
"An agreement"?

259
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,770
You mean a settlement?
Like in a court of law?

260
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,230
"Court of law"?
What are you saying?

261
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,482
It's a crime to plagiarize an idea.

262
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,109
Don't pretend.

263
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,821
You know exactly, Manager Ahn,
whose idea it was.

264
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,490
-It's not just...
-Withdraw from the contest.

265
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,076
[breathes in annoyance]

266

268
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,632
What? You wanna beg again? [scoffs]

269
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,594
Kneeling won't pay me back, okay?

270
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,555
Making a settlement with me
is gonna take a lot more than kneeling.

271
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,223
You haven't heard the rumors yet?

272
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,642
You can't get first place in this contest.

273
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,644
Single women in any department...

274
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,229
Regardless of that, it's my idea.

275
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,481
[sighs] You're gonna leave it to rot?

276
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,318
Missing this opportunity
would be a huge waste.

277
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,113
Listen, I promise if I win,
I'll make sure it succeeds.

278
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,615
Believe me, I'd rather slap you.

279
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:07,991
[sighs]

280
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,951
Listen, I didn't wanna bring this up...

281
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,120
but my mother-in-law

282
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,830
-is very good friends with...
-Hey!

283
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,915
How about we not take this there?

284
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,208
It's pathetic.

285
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,045
Then you knew...

286
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,882
Withdraw your proposal,
or I'm telling HR

287
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:27,844
in the most entertaining way
with X-rated details,

288
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:32,223
when and where and how and why
I shared that idea with you.

289
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,268
Make the right call
if you don't wanna end up divorced.

290
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,936
"We did date at one time."

291
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,318
"And we did discuss the idea back then."

292
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,695
"But Son Hae-yeong couldn't take it

293
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,865

and I think this is her payback."

Me.

299
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,587
A lie can't win against the truth,

300
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,923
but not even the truth can beat a scandal.

301
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,135
A single woman obsessing
over her married ex?

302
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,221
You'd be the perfect scapegoat,
you know that?

303
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,183
Make the right call...

304
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,519
if you don't want to be caught up
in a scandal.

with your earlier suggestion, I'm afraid.

[Hae-yeong] Good work.

00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,482
Bye! Nice work, everyone.

[hand pounds]
...are you up to?

373
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,077
I need a husband, all right?

374
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,121
I have déjà vu. [scoffs]

375
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,039
Just a fake husband
for a wedding ceremony,

00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,416
not a real one.

00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,501
Have you been drinking?

378
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,255
If the word "husband" is too much,
call it a part-time job.

379
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,632
You just need to walk down the aisle
with me.

380

-Are you serious?
-Uh-huh.

381

You're really going to have
a fake wedding?

Yeah, I'm up on the third floor!

-Uh...

392
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,792

You are? To who?

-I'm looking for him.
-Huh?

414
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,842
It's a fake marriage.

415
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,468
But that's my thing.

416
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,847
Contract dating and marriages
are common in romance novels.

417
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,181
[Hae-yeong] This is a little different.

418
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,267
It'll end once I have my cash.

419
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:50,810
It's a fake wedding.

420
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,228
One minute.

421
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,440
I'm the only one who finds this weird?

422
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,483
Who holds a wedding
just to collect money gifts from people?

423
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,484
It's a con!

424
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,611
Gyeong-jin,
from our first year in high school.

425
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:01,863
He met somebody,

426
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,073
and the two of them got married
for the money really quick.

427
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,993
He did it before his dad retired,
but he had to get married.

428
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,704
He did it before his dad's retirement
to get more cash.

429
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,081
They're still together, though,
because that was a real marriage.

430
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,625
What if a couple gets divorced
after the honeymoon?

431
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,585
Is the marriage fake?

432
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:17,420
You can get divorced
even though you married for love.

433
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,214
And if you marry for pragmatic reasons,
it's a con?

434
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,302
It's not any different
from marrying someone you don't love,

435
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,261
and getting divorced.

436
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,847
What happens if you end up
marrying someone you love later on?

437
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,015
Then it'll be my second.

438
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,477
The tradeoff
is that now I get all my money back,

439
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,104
benefits, win the contest, get promoted...

440
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,231
It makes business sense.

441
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,608
What sense?

442
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,485
You really think that?

443
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,738
That marriage
is some kind of business proposal?

444
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,199
Ja-yeon, what do you think of her
using Mom like that?

445
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,158
Well, I...

446
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,452
Sounds like you're the real daughter,
not me.

447
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:53,289
You always bring that up
at times like this to distance yourself.

448
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,917
-Hui-seong...
-You've done it before.

449
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,461
When all that stuff happened with Dad,
you just left Mom at home.

450
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,505
Just when she needed you the most!

451
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,217
And now her real daughter is doing this?
Giving her a fake son-in-law?

452
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,843
What kind of son-in-law should I get her?

453
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,138
Someone like your producer,
who you break up with,

454
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:10,973
-and get back with every time?
-Hey!

455
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,226
Why bring him into this, huh?

456
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:15,353
I'm so sick of you.

457
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,357
So then you weren't sick of me yet?

458
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,775

-Nam Ja-yeon!

465

You heard what Son Hae-yeong said.
That's how she really thinks.

466
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:36,040
When she needs us, we're family.

467
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,084
But whenever we upset her,
then we're just shitty friends.

468
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,212
She didn't go that far.

469
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,213
She absolutely did!

470
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,714
Whose side are you on, anyway?

471
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,135
Sides? Between the three of us?

472
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,139
Yours for sure. Yours always.

473
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,223
You're on my side, right?

474
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,976
Then move out. I'll find you a new place.

00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,520
-Huh?
-I've never understood

476
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,064
how you can live with Hae-yeong
and put up with any of her bullshit.

477
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:05,153
You know she hated the fact that...
that her mom ran a foster home.

478
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,530
She never wanted foster kids around.
Just her.

00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,767
[Hae-yeong's mother]
Get her. Grab that bitch.

702
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,602
-Mom!
-Grab that bitch. Stop her!

703
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:48,146
-Mom!
-You have to catch her, get her back!

704
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:55,362
[Hui-seong sighs]

705
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,408
How did you know?

706
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:02,828
I got a phone call.

707
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,874
It was an unknown number,
so I almost ignored it,

708
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,168
but picked up
and they said you weren't answering.

709
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:14,798
So I came here, and Mom was...

710
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,175
You must've been shocked.

711
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,596
"You must've been shocked"?

712
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,097
How could you do this, Hae-yeong?

713
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,892
Our mom is sick and you said nothing?

714
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,019
I didn't know either.

715
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,563
[somber music playing]

716
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:31,607
I thought she was doing fine
out in the country,

717
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,609
but she called out of the blue,

718
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,612
said, "It's Mom. I have dementia."

719
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:40,365
"Don't worry about it.
I'm in a home."

720
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,327
[sighs deeply]

721
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,330
Why are Mom and I like this?

722
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,250
She was a literal angel on earth
to so many kids.

723
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,962
So why could she
and her own daughter never get along?

724
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,840
Even so,

725
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,426
shouldn't she have told me she was sick?

726
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,932
Well, Mom just did it
out of concern for you.

727
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,478
Her condition is one
that's hard to care for.

728
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,189
She didn't want to trouble you.

729
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,442
And maybe it would've been tough for you.

730
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:20,197
[sighs]

731
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:21,990
You're smart.

732
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,910
I didn't understand for a year.

733
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:28,038
You figured it out in a day.

734
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,173
[somber music continues]

735
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,557
How did the nursing home get my number?

736
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:49,184
[Hae-yeong sniffles]

737
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,061
I gave it to them.

738
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:55,315
I told them they should call you
if I couldn't make it

739
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:56,817
or I couldn't be reached.

740
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,737
You're my mom's daughter too.

741
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:07,411
I'm sorry.

742
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,082
I'm sorry too.

743
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,715
I'm still against this fake marriage idea.

744
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,134
Don't do it.

745
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,971
I booked the wedding hall.

746
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,557
-Already?
-Three weeks on Saturday.

747
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,894
Hae-yeong. [groans]

748
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:37,441
Even if weddings can be a charade
and a chance to get money,

749
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:39,901
some want to genuinely celebrate you.

750
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,320
So, tricking those people is a bit...

751
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,656
And...

752
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,993
what if, later on, there's someone
you actually love and want to marry?

753
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:49,119
What about then?

754
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:51,747
Yeah, it'd be nice
to marry someone I love.

755
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,625
But I would need
to stay in love with them.

756
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:56,960
So stay in love!

757
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:57,878
[Hae-yeong] Hui-seong.

758
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,548
Am I lovable?

759
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:03,592
Even in relationships,

760
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,844
I'm calculating
because I don't want to lose out.

761
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,055
Is that lovable to you?

762
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:13,393
You just need to meet someone
who loves that side of you.

763
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:16,855
Someone must exist...

764
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:19,858
like that somewhere.

765
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:24,404
I mean, I can wait around
for that person to show up.

766
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:25,822
Our Mom, though?

767
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,242
Will she hold on till then?

768
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,166
[sighs thoughtfully]

769
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,180
You made up, right?
You and Hae-yeong?

770
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:53,850
Yeah, now I'm mad at you.

771
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,353
You knew that Mom
was in a home, didn't you?

772
00:39:58,939 --> 00:39:59,940
Sorry.

773
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:01,983
We'll deal with it after the wedding.

774
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,027
It's gonna cost you.

775
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,196
[Ja-yeon squeals happily]

776
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,823
[Ja-yeon] I'll treat you to a fancy meal.

777
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,368
Does that mean you changed your mind
about the wedding?

778
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,495
She said she wants Mom
to see her get married,

779
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,955
how could I say no to that?

780
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,207
Plus, she booked the venue already.

781
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,292
We need to make the invitations quick!

782
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,712
I'll ask Tae-hyeong
to be the photographer.

783
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:25,882
Oh, love that!
He takes really amazing pics.

784
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,676
You're just the greatest-est!

785
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:33,932
[Ja-yeon squealing]
Hui-seong's the greatest

786
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,100
in the whole world.

787
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,726
-[Hui-seong] You're so clingy!
-[Ja-yeon chuckling]

788
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,728
[pensive music playing]

789
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:40,522
[sighs]

[automatic door chirping]

791
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:47,529
Welcome to...

792
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,282
What kind of psycho would look for
a husband on a marketplace app?

793
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:53,910
Let's just meet up with her first,
see what I'm working with.

794
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,247
Loser! No hello?

795
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:58,915
Hello there.

796
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,000
[man in black scoffs]

797
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:02,669
I'm getting some cigs.

798
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:05,088
So you hate cigarettes
but are willing to sell them?

799
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:06,464
[man in black scoffs]

800
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,091
Selling your beliefs too?

801
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:10,427
Smoke as much as you like,
you'll die quicker.

802
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,595
Now how would you like to die?

803
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:12,929
[sighs in disbelief]

804
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,764
Magol.

805
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,474
Okay.

806
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:21,771
Forty-eight hundred won.

807
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,779
Scan it.
Isn't that your job, Loser?

808
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,865
You can do it yourself...

809
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:32,782

NEW MESSAGE FROM LOSSZERO

810

812
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,003
Here, I'll scan it.

813
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,383
-Hey, that's a new phone!
-Oh, no. Forgive me.

814
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,719
[Ji-uk] Oh gosh. Hope it isn't broken.

815
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:55,430
[man in black] What the hell!

-[Ji-uk] Oh!
-Hey!

817
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,433
[Ji-uk] What are we gonna do? Oh no.

818
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,435
-[man in black] Is it broken?
-[Ji-uk] Yeah.

819
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:02,646
Shattered.

Ma'am!

Oh.

830
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:37,430
Good morning.

831
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:40,183
Are you really going through
with the wedding?

832
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,936
-Mm-hmm.
-You're really serious?

833
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,729
Why keep making me say it?

834
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,734
You're in my way.
I need to go to work.

835
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,236
Just give me a second.

836

[romantic song playing]

837
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,340
Wh... What on earth?

838
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:15,218
Are you okay?

839
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,054
-Meaning?
-Is your heart pounding?

840
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:20,765
Are you breathing rapidly?

841
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:23,018
Feeling an itch?

842
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,854
[scoffs] Uh, no, not at all.

843
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,776
[romantic song continues]

844
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,208
Even now?

845
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,674
No. Doing great.

846
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:55,967
All right then, I'll do it.

847
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:58,345
Do what?

848
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,597
Your offer. The groom job.

849
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,934
Really? You really will?

850
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:06,144
On one condition.

851
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,021
[hesitates] What?

852
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,773
I need you to take care of...

853
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:13,735
Huh?

854
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:14,819
...of someone.

[Kitty meows]

857
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,544
This is Kitty.

858
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,008
She looks full-grown.

859
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,760
She's a kitten?

860
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,678
She'll be huge as an adult.

861
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,389
No, her name is Kitty.

862
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:44,391
Ah...

863
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,851
[Ji-uk] I want to get her spayed,
but after that,

864
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:49,521
she'll need to be inside for a week,

865
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,523
while she's healing from the surgery.

866
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,900
I live in a studio, so...

867
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,277
Why can't you keep her inside your store?

868
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,405
My manager is afraid of cats.

869
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:02,325
If you'll keep her just for one week,
I'll do the job for you.

870
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,371
A whole week?

871
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:10,375
I'll give you all the food and litter
you might need.

872
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,419
All I need is for you
to share your house with her.

873
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:14,629
My house?

874
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,839
[comical music playing]

875
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,715
Ah...

-My landlord...
-You own, right?

877
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,472
It's a shared building, and...

878
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:25,473
You own the building.

879
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,687
Okay, so find another groom.

880
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,022
Hold on. I like cats.

881
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,234
Kitty!

884
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:52,333
Where did that psycho
looking for a groom go?

[groans]

886
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:55,170
She found one already?

887
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,505
Yikes, pity the bastard who did it.

[comical music playing]

889
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,094
Loser.

890
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:04,429
You only make minimum wage.

891
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:05,930
How can I accept this?

892
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:07,891
You're making me feel guilty.

893
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,726
Your breath stinks. Stop breathing.

894
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:14,230
That fucker thinks
he owns the air around here?

Really?

00:46:36,753 --> 00:46:38,755
All I do is walk down the aisle with her?

00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,720
-I'm going dress shopping.
-With Hui-seong?

913
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:30,807
Well, that was the idea,
but she booked a session.

914
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,433
Then you're going all on your own?

915
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,394
-Hmm.
-But that's not right.

916
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,729
I'll cancel my meeting and go with you.

917
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:40,692
Ja-yeon, hey, this is not a real wedding.

918
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:42,318
I'm just going to choose a dress.

919

Going solo is fine.

923
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,451
Now go get your funding, okay?

924

It's all good. [pats]

[manager] Wow, sales
of zero-calorie drinks have shot up.

926
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:07,218
You were right, putting them all
in one place was god-tier.

God-tier, man!

As for protein bars and drinks...

934
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:27,530
Uh...

935
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:30,617
Let me check the nutrition info.
Be right with you.

You want your groom's measurements...

946
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,891
in advance of his name and age?

947
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:59,646
Ah, your name is Kim Ji-uk.

Younger than me.

00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:06,235
-What's your pant size?
-Can you explain first?

951
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:07,945
These are kind of rude questions.

952
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:10,531
Ah...

953
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,116
I'm going to the bridal shop now,

954
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,494
and thought I'd get your tuxedo
while I'm there.

-Mm.

-What day?
-When it rained?

960
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,319
You said you would...

961
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,698
I mean, you'd take on the gig.

962
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,825
All of a sudden, you...

963
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:56,119
[whispers]
...you hugged me.

964
00:49:58,371 --> 00:49:59,372
[whispers] I wasn't a hug.

965
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:01,541
[normally] I was testing you.

966
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:03,292
What kind of a test?

967
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,461
To see if you were allergic
to cats at all.

968
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,922
There was cat hair all over my clothes.

969
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:10,383
[Hae-yeong] Oh.

970
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:12,093
I thought it was...

971
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,178
a different kind of test.

972
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,389
What kind of test?

973
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:17,348
For chemistry.

974
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,143
-Huh?
-Just to make sure.

975
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:23,813
Since this is business,
and it would be inconvenient if we...

976
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,315
-caught feelings.
-[scoffs]

977
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:27,984
Caught feeling...

[Ji-uk clears throat]

979
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,367
The only feelings developing
between you and me, Miss,

980
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:39,203
would be dislike or hatred.

981
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:42,749
Hmm, for a young person,
you're quite cynical.

982
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:45,835
I know too much about you
to be romantically interested in you.

983
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,837
The head is the domain of knowledge.

984
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,173
Our heart is where love resides.

985
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:52,967
Don't act so confident.

Wow.

990
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,527
[Ji-uk] I'm so...

991
00:51:13,196 --> 00:51:14,238
so very...

992
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:16,866
embarrassed.

996
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:25,708

ever tried this dress on?

This is the first time.

998
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:29,962
[Ji-uk] Ah.

999
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:31,297
You hear that?

1000
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,258
If that's what you're wearing,
you should pay me to see you in it.

1001
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:35,927
Hmm.

I'm sorry. Please excuse me for a moment.

[Hae-yeong groans]

1005
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,436
Is this dress that bad?

1006
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,730
Well, is it your goal to get laughed at?

1007
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:51,108
Oh, my goal is for the guests
to only remember the bride.

1008
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,026
[Ji-uk] Why?

1009
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,779
Because no one
should outshine her at the wedding?

1010
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,948
So that the groom
gets completely forgotten.

1011
00:51:57,824 --> 00:51:58,741
[Hae-yeong sighs]

1012
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,785
I'm, well...

1013
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:03,579
getting married because it's my choice to.

1014
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,623
It's only a job for you.

1015
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:08,376
You're young and have a bright future.

1016
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:11,295
I'm worried
that someone might remember you

1017
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:12,964
as being married.

1018
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:17,218
You're... worried for me?

1019
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:20,012
Mm-hmm. [clicks tongue]

I don't want ever want to lose out,

1022
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,812
I don't want you to lose out either.

00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,122
-It's very nice to meet you.
-[editor] Right.

1026
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:48,583
And of course, our investor

1027
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,460
in the audio drama of <i>Spice Up Our Love.</i>

1028
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,672
And, your real name, what was it?

1029
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:58,384
I'm HajunLove.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

1030
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,595
I am a frequent commenter.

1031
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,013
HajunLove's your handle?

1032
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:05,349
Of course. I... I know you, HajunLove!

1033
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:08,102
Oh. [chuckles]
Wonderful. That's an honor.

1034
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,397
No, no, I should be thanking you.

1035
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,691
Just one of your comments
helps me ignore the negative ones.

1036
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,986
Your kind words keep me going.

1037
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,864
I've actually read every single chapter

1038
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,658
of all of your novels
100 times, Miss Yeon!

1039
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:26,120
Every time I read your work,
it feels new and always fun!

1040
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,830
[Jeong-a laughing]

1041
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:29,415
And they're so poignant!

1042
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:32,543
Like the walk-in fridge scene
in <i>The Boss's Menu Table.</i>

1043
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:36,255
As I was reading through it,

1044
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:39,050
I could sense the depth
with which you approached

1045
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:42,970
humanity's two greatest desires
of appetite and of sexuality.

1046
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:44,013
It was amazing.

1047
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:46,557
Appetite, represented by the nutritionist,

1048
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,185
encounters her boss
and with her sexual desire awakened,

1049
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,062
strips him naked!

1050
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,483
-[all laugh]
-Oh, goodness! Whoo!

1051
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,776
I stood up and clapped.

1052
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:59,987
Yeah, I think that was such a shame
that it was only the written word, right?

1053
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:00,947
[Jeong-a laughs]

1054
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:04,200
And the boss character is just so perfect.

1055
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:07,954
And I've tried to envision
what he might look like...

1056
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,873
[brooding music playing]

1057
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,926
I feel it's a depth
my imagination can't reach.

1058
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,052
-[shrieks]
-[Jeong-a] I would love to...

1059
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,721
-What is it, Ms. Yeon?
-Everything all right?

1060
00:54:25,805 --> 00:54:26,973
Wh-What is it?

1061
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:28,182
[comical music playing]

1062
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,309
-Secretary Yeo.
-[gasps]

1063
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:34,689
Um, HajunLove, are you okay?

1064
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:35,815
Yeah.

1065
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,066
Yeo Ha-jun!

1066
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:41,862
Why do you need a secretary
at your personal training?

1067
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:44,156
I owe him an extra set
after skipping last week.

1068
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,616
What if I drop dead?

1069
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,701
I'll get a new job.

1070
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:47,910
[sucks teeth]

1071
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:50,037
Watch me, and when I give you
the signal, rush over

1072
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:51,956
and say there's an urgent issue,
all right?

1073
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,418
-Speak up.
-Yes.

1074
00:54:56,002 --> 00:54:57,461
-Try again!
-[cutely] Yes.

1075
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:58,504
Good.

1076
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,757
[sighs deeply]

1077
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,802
Did you see someone who you know?

1078
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,262
-No.
-Ah, no.

1079
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:09,098
[both laugh nervously]

1080
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,142
[Ja-yeon sighs]

1081
00:55:14,437 --> 00:55:15,521
One moment.

1082
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,401
What do I wear?

1083
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:23,738
Whatever you want is fine by me.

1084
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,127
Hmm, that can work.

1085
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:46,719
[Woo-jae] Manager Son Hae-yeong?

1086
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,556
Ahn Woo-jae?

1087
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,600
[brooding music playing]

1088
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,936
[Hae-yeong] <i>Manager Ahn Woo-jae!</i>

1089
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,814
Manager Son!

1090
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:00,649
-Oh, be quiet.
-[Woo-jae laughs]

1091
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:02,818
[Woo-jae] Manager Son Hae-yeong.

1092
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,324
Honey, what are you doing?

1093
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,869
-Oh, Manager Son!
-[gasps softly]

1094
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,412
Yi-lin.

1095
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,039
I heard you were getting married.

1096
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:16,832
Are you just checking out
bridal shops now?

1097
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:20,127
Oh, yeah, I've been a bit busy.

1098
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:21,962
[Hae-yeong] What are you two doing here?

1099
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,590
A cousin of mine is getting married,
so she asked me to look with her.

1100
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,967
She thought my dress
and <i>hanbok</i> were really pretty.

1101
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,177
[awkward chuckle]

1102
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,470
[gasps] This is great!

1103
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:30,763
We have some time to spare.

1104
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,389
Would you like us
to help you choose a dress?

1105
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,142
Oh, ah, no,
I've already chosen mine.

1106
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:37,520
-[laughs nervously]
-[Yi-lin] Oh, really?

1107
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,563
What about where you'll get the tuxedo?

1108
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,524
I have a tailor shop I can recommend.

1109
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,984
Off-the-rack suits here,
they're all right,

1110
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,362
-but it's better to get custom-made...
-[Ji-uk] I'm done changing.

1111
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:49,448
[gasps] Uh...

1112
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:51,075
Is that your groom?

1113
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:54,453
[Ji-uk] May I come out?

1114
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:55,412
-Not yet!
-Oh, yes!

1115
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:57,790
[grandiose music playing]

1116
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:01,752
[gasps]

1117
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:04,630
Uh, he just came from a shift at work.

1118
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:06,340
He usually looks better...

1119
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,424
[gasps in shock]

1120
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,847
[uplifting music playing]

1121

[muffled gasp]

1122

[scoffs]

[upbeat music playing]

1124
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,699
How is it, ma'am?

1125
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,500
EPILOGUE

1126
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:42,835
[keyboard clacking]

1127
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:51,385
How many invitations did you need?

1128
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,595
One hundred and sixty-three.

1129
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,430
CONTEST PROPOSAL SUMMARY

1130
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:57,683
We can do 100, 150 or 200.

1131
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,019
Let's make it 200.

1132
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:01,520
We'll just invite 37 more.

1133
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:02,855
[Ja-yeon groans]

1134
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,815
This design's pretty boring.

1135
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:07,401
How about a laser-cut frame and...

1136
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:09,862
[gasps]

1137
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,364
Then we could add a ribbon!

1138
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:14,200
Silk's better than satin, right?

1139
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:15,993
Orders over 100,
they'll add a sealing stamp

1140
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,161
-or a wedding stamp for free.
-[sighs]

1141
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:19,413
Now, we could add a dried flower...

1142
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,623
Nam Ja-yeon!

1143
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,083
-Hm?
-I don't know what any of this means.

1144
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:25,419
Just order the cheapest one.

1145
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,837
Cheap designs aren't pretty!

1146
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,006
I got my groom at the convenience store.

1147
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:30,674
If they were on scrap paper,
I wouldn't care.

1148
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,677
Ja-yeon, why am I doing this wedding?

1149
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,346
To get your cashback.

1150
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:38,057
Minimize costs, maximize revenue.

1151
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,974
You got that?

1152
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:42,228
-[Hui-seong shouts] No, but wait!
-[screams] That was scary.

1153
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:43,729
Why choose him of all people?

1154
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,023
The groom
should at least have a decent job!

1155
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,441
People will ask what your husband does!

1156
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,693
Couldn't she just name
some random company?

1157
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:51,570
You'll get found out eventually.

1158
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:52,821
It'll come to light it was a lie.

1159
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:55,866
And that's why he's the perfect guy.

1160
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,618
That rabid dog part-timer.

1161
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,454
He doesn't have a job,
doesn't know anyone.

1162
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:04,375
If he's unemployed,
shouldn't he at least be attractive?

1163
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,961
That would make your story more plausible,
you know what I mean?

1164
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:09,797
That's right. Believability,
that's what you're lacking.

1165
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,507
No, a good-looking guy would be worse.

1166
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,424
[both] Why?

1167
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:15,386
You know when we went to Bali together?
We met that guy?

1168
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,972
That guy!
The Seminyak Beach Bum!

1169
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,057
He was on a blue surfboard
and wearing yellow shorts!

1170
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,642
I'll never forget him.

1171
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:24,019
See what I mean?
Both of you remembered

1172
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:25,229
once I said "Bali Guy".

1173
00:59:25,813 --> 00:59:27,856
Hot guys are memorable.
If the groom's hot,

1174
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,316
the guests won't forget him.

1175
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,193
He's going to be my groom for a day.

1176
00:59:31,277 --> 00:59:33,612
For him to be memorable
doesn't make sense.

1177
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:38,617
Therefore, he has got to be
someone average.

1178
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:41,537
Ugly? No. Attractive? No.

1179
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,997
And not...

1180
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:45,666
anyone who is super hot.

1181
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,172
{\an8}THANKS TO KIM HAE-SOOK,
