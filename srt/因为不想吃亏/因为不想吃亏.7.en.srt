1
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:16,934
KKULBEE EDUCATION

2
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,679
This is ridiculous, Secretary Yeo.

3
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,973
I've heard of obeying your superiors,

4
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,392
but piggybacking on them is a first!

5
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,771
I consider this insubordination.

6
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,776
-Jeez.
-I'm sorry.

7
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,029
-Ms. Son.
-Mr. Volunteer!

8
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,823
So the thing is…

9
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:17,620
-Washing can make anything clean.
-Oh, jeez.

10
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:22,416
If you just keep rubbing it like this,
the stains will come right off.

11
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,752
-Lucifer.
-So don't worry, okay?

12
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:28,130
I like you best when you're sleeping
and completely quiet.

13
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,926
You're sweating, Mr. Volunteer!

14
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,054
Get off our boss, you bum!

15
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,389
Get off!

16
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,435
Ms. Son!

17
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:45,314
I'll lighten your load, Mr. Bok!

18
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,235
I appreciate it.

19
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,986
-Open the door!
-Sir!

20
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,488
-Oh, jeez!
-Here.

21
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:54,323
Now, go sleep!

22
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,076
-My husband goes here, Secretary Yeo.
-Okay.

23
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:58,494
In there?

24
00:01:58,577 --> 00:01:59,745
Here.

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,958
Yi-lin,

26
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,502
Ms. Son, and the new recruit--

27
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,711
Should be fired!

28
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:14,426
I was going to say to give time off
as a reward.

29
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,180
Wait for me! That's my car.

30
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,099
Just a minute, Gyu-hyun.

31
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,684
About Mr. Kim…

32
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,521
Wouldn't it be a waste
to assign him to a new team

33
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,398
after the whole press conference?

34
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,608
It could be good PR for Ms. Son's team.

35
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,279
You have a point,
but we don't have a choice.

36
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,948
I have a pretty good idea.

37
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:37,700
How good is it?

38
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,743
Is your car in the basement?

39
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,954
Let's talk on the way.
I have to go get something anyway.

40
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,600
What the heck?

41
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,477
Why are you two here?

42
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,396
-I don't know.
-Same here.

43
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,564
Why am I here?

44
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:54,318
Wait, why are you shocked?

45
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,987
-What?
-You're her husband, aren't you?

46
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,950
-I am.
-Right.

47
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,084
-Who's that?
-Who is it?

48
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,086
-You go.
-Me?

49
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:13,754
It's your room!

50
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,172
Exactly, so get out.

51
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,051
Are you awake?

52
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,595
Ms. Son! Mr. Kim!

53
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,639
Mr. Ahn!

54
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,018
-It's Ms. Kwon.
-She sounds pissed. What do we do?

55
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,563
This is an inappropriate situation
to be in, isn't it?

56
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:32,690
No.

57
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:33,941
It's very,

58
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,360
very immoral.

59
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,946
This goes against Korea's social norms.

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,116
But nothing happened, right?

61
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:45,953
Right?

62
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,998
Why are you asking me?

63
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,212
We need to be bolder than ever.

64
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,842
You drunkenly entered the wrong room.

65
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,844
And we were too drunk to notice.

66
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:06,181
We're lightweights
who just happened to share a bed.

67
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:21,947
Did you have a good night, Mr. Ahn?

68
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:23,866
And you, Mr. Kim?

69
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,578
Where's Ms. Son?

70
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,253
So what happened is--

71
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,880
Do you actually remember?

72
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,856
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">None of you would pick up</font></i>

73
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,484
and they said using
the master key was against policy.

74
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:02,196
Do you know how worried I was
that you might wake up and fight?

75
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,864
I didn't sleep a wink.

76
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,075
But you told me to drink last night.

77
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,911
I told you to drink alcohol,
not to be consumed by it.

78
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,371
-What's wrong with him?
-I know, right?

79
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,333
Let's go. You're being a nuisance.

80
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,375
Okay.

81
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,255
By the way, Mr. Bok gave
both of you time off as a reward.

82
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:21,757
Have a great time.

83
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,177
Where's my watch?

84
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:26,720
Did you check your shoes?

85
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,352
Oh, it's here.

86
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,062
Have you seen my phone?

87
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,814
It's probably under the mattress.

88
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,959
You and Ms. Son are quite…

89
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,378
What's wrong?

90
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,713
You two really--

91
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:05,259
They have great chemistry, don't they?

92
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,095
And it makes sense,
as they've worked together for so long.

93
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,224
But they don't just have great chemistry.

94
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,935
Something's in the air.

95
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,061
Our minds!

96
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,729
We're like-minded.

97
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,315
And it's hard to find
a like-minded colleague.

98
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,151
It's the best benefit.

99
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,444
Yeah!

100
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:27,406
Don't you two

101
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,658
argue quite a lot?

102
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,411
We were just joking around.

103
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,080
Well, that's good to hear.

104
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,749
You're on the same team now.

105
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,418
-What?
-Excuse me?

106
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,628
Instead of Mr. Kim moving teams,

107
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,964
Mr. Ahn will be assigned
to the New Business Development Team.

108
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,133
You're the leader of Team One.

109
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,093
And you're the leader of Team Two.

110
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,261
What?

111
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:51,722
Let me get this straight.

112
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,017
Manager Ahn…

113
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,310
{\an8}TWO-TIMING EX-BOYFRIEND

114
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,519
{\an8}…and Mr. Kim…

115
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:58,729
{\an8}FAKE HUSBAND ON WEEKDAYS

116
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,647
…will be working together?

117
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,357
Yes, isn't it exciting?

118
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,153
I can already imagine
the chemistry overflowing.

119
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,410
Wow, that's really just the best.

120
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,751
{\an8}Don't feel bad about it.

121
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,587
{\an8}You'll be a team leader too,
not Ms. Son's subordinate.

122
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,797
{\an8}If anything, Ms. Son might hate it.

123
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,967
{\an8}Her husband's performance evaluation
will be in your hands.

124
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:29,927
{\an8}Yi-lin.

125
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,805
{\an8}It's my career.
Why didn't you discuss this with me first?

126
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,850
{\an8}It's such a good opportunity
that I didn't have to.

127
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,936
{\an8}You just do as I say.

128
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,356
{\an8}I'm heading home first.

129
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,733
{\an8}Go ahead to work.

130
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,569
{\an8}Are you taking a day off?

131
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,239
{\an8}You need to save it
for my grandma's memorial service!

132
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,171
I shouldn't have gotten married.

133
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,049
I regret it.

134
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,807
Do you regret

135
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,725
marrying me?

136
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,310
Yeah.

137
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,066
Still,

138
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,152
you got promoted to team leader
just like you planned,

139
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:31,989
thanks to our marriage.

140
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,617
And thanks to that,
Ahn Woo-jae is going to benefit from me.

141
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,619
That's what pisses me off.

142
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,043
And if we hadn't gotten married,

143
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,755
I would've genuinely been happy
for you joining Kkulbee.

144
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,049
I would've congratulated you.

145
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,011
And…

146
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,264
I wasn't afraid or hesitant

147
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,058
to love Ms. Son.

148
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,771
…I wouldn't feel confused.

149
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,106
What?

150
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:07,983
About what?

151
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,570
Never mind.

152
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,656
Look.

153
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,743
If at any point you want to get divorced,

154
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,578
just let me know.

155
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,705
At any point?

156
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,791
As long as you want to.

157
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,300
Now's not the time though.

158
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,344
When assigning important roles,

159
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,637
the company looks into
our personal and family lives.

160
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,308
They check if the family is together
and if love is still present.

161
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,061
Behind a wise ruler
is a peaceful family, you know?

162
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,357
Then you go and rule.

163
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,317
I'll take care of…

164
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,113
Jeez, my head hurts so much.

165
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,491
Why do people drink?

166
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,079
You know what?
Let's go get some hangover soup.

167
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,789
You're so weak.

168
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,299
Here is the beer you ordered, sir.

169
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,468
Let me take your empty glass.

170
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:19,888
"Divorce"?

171
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,537
You haven't changed your door passcode.

172
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,542
I didn't have to.

173
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,335
I'll be leaving soon anyway.

174
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,295
Are you going back home?

175
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,840
Have you made up with your wife?

176
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,383
Are you going to keep tailing me?

177
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,386
My job isn't to tail you.

178
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,389
-What Chairman Bok ordered is--
-I don't want to know.

179
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,225
You'll find out eventually.

180
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,438
What I wanted to know

181
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,023
was who my father was,

182
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,695
why he neglected me and my mom,
and why he hadn't looked for me.

183
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,991
But now I know.

184
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,702
I don't have a father who loves me.

185
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,123
The past doesn't matter, Mr. Kim.

186
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,458
What matters is the present.

187
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,336
Who your father is now,

188
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,090
why he looked for you,
and what he can do for you

189
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:39,926
are more important.

190
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,429
Mr. Jang, was it?

191
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,391
-That's right.
-Tell him I'm grateful for the job

192
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,436
and that I won't accept anything else.

193
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,149
Do you realize how much of a loss

194
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,901
this will be to you?

195
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,405
Will it?

196
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,871
In that case…

197
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,583
can I keep the car?

198
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,127
My wife likes it.

199
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,967
Will you be at the studio today,
Hui-seong?

200
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,928
Will it take long? I have to talk to you.

201
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,263
I'm almost there.

202
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,599
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">What do you mean? Where are you?</font></i>

203
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,894
I'm in front of Producer Yun's studio.

204
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:31,853
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">What?</font></i>

205
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,271
Don't worry about that.

206
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:34,731
-I see Producer Yun!
-All right.

207
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,320
He's with some girl…

208
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,532
and they're hugging.

209
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,492
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">What?</font></i>

210
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,371
Go over to my house.
Don't come here, okay?

211
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,956
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Son Hae-yeong!</font></i>

212
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,792
That little…

213
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,919
Text me when you get there.

214
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,587
Well,

215
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,006
as long we kiss before I go.

216
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,480
Oh, my gosh!

217
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,190
Who's this?

218
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,859
Hae…

219
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:20,819
Your hand?

220
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,114
No, this isn't right, Min-ji.

221
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:26,950
Are you Min-ji?

222
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,120
Yes, who are you?

223
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,621
The woman you'll be suing.

224
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,624
-Excuse me?
-Do you want a long-winded

225
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,043
factual defamation suit?

226
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,838
Or do you want to end this
with simple assault?

227
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:44,175
This situation might be strange
and hard to understand,

228
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,427
but the truth is…

229
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,013
Damn it, you weren't supposed
to find out about this.

230
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,016
I already found you hard to understand
ten years ago!

231
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,268
And it's not
that I shouldn't have found out.

232
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,645
You shouldn't have done this
to Hui-seong in the first place!

233
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,815
Oh, are you Hui-seong's friend?

234
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,028
Wait, Hui-seong knows you?

235
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,947
-You cheated with her friend?
-It's not that.

236
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,699
You must not know then.

237
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,411
If you aren't even
that close to Hui-seong,

238
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,954
stop sticking your nose in.

239
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,497
-Please, Min-ji.
-Got it?

240
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,249
I'm not close to Hui-seong?

241
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,754
Did you know that Hui-seong
was born prematurely?

242
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,255
What?

243
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,342
Hui-seong started school at seven
because she was born early.

244
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,386
Hui-seong completely bombed
her college entrance exam

245
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,097
but still went to college
without repeating and even graduated.

246
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:32,849
What does that have to do--

247
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,518
To Hui-seong, time is gold!

248
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:39,022
And yet you took her precious pile of gold

249
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,815
and stole it for ten years.

250
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,901
You did that, Yun Tae-hyeong!

251
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,111
Calm down, Hae-yeong.

252
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,155
Breathe.

253
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,741
Calm down.

254
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,076
Okay, I'll be calm…

255
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,246
and go for special violence.

256
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,123
Wait, Hae-yeong.

257
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,291
You son of a bitch!

258
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,001
Hae-yeong!

259
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,254
Why are you here?

260
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,547
I told you to go to my place!

261
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,174
Just calm down.

262
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,967
What took you so long? I was so scared.

263
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,928
Are you out of your mind?

264
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,429
Hae-yeong!

265
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:12,639
Don't hold me back.

266
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,516
Cheaters deserve to die.

267
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,351
Two-timers should be
ripped up into two pieces!

268
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,894
He's not a two-timer!

269
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,022
Is he a three-timer?

270
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,402
The ending…

271
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,780
I can't think of an ending.

272
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,365
The ending!

273
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,202
Should I kill them all?

274
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,957
DIRECTOR

275
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,793
Hello, director.

276
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,129
Yes, I'm free right now.

277
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,674
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Thank you again
for your donation this month.</font></i>

278
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,551
Don't mention it.

279
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,053
Is everything okay?

280
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,513
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Everything's fine.</font></i>

281
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,598
But it's just that the volunteer you sent…

282
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,560
{\an8}CL WHITE WASHING MACHINE

283
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,519
{\an8}<i><font face="Arial" color="white">What?</font></i>

284
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,604
Did he buy them to skip community service?

285
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,816
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">No, he didn't,
but I wanted to ask you to make sure.</font></i>

286
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,985
Can I accept these?

287
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,948
If they're needed, then go ahead.

288
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,661
I'll tell him donations and forgiveness
are two separate matters.

289
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,038
No problem.

290
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,541
When does he go there again?

291
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,087
Yes, I'll be there then.

292
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:27,630
All right.

293
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,801
Who's that?

294
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,099
Did you take a half-day off?
Are you feeling unwell?

295
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,852
What's the world coming to, Ja-yeon?

296
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:42,562
It's the end times.

297
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,981
Quit your job.
Let's spend our money and die.

298
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,987
Why are you going nuts
about what Tae-hyeong and I agreed on?

299
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,532
You know how much I love those heels.

300
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,327
And I was willing to beat him with them.

301
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,204
Don't I have the right to go nuts?

302
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,580
Who told you to?

303
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,208
Why would you use those pretty heels
to beat up a guy?

304
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,961
What's the matter now, you two?

305
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,381
Hui-seong's out of her mind.

306
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,133
Do you know what she said?

307
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,344
Producer Yun's seeing another girl and…

308
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,265
Are you talking about Ms. Cho Min-ji?

309
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,767
You knew?

310
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,937
She's the writer
for my audio drama adaptation.

311
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,939
I saw her get in his car.

312
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,149
Is he cheating on her?

313
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,651
He's not cheating on me.

314
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,402
He's not!

315
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,947
It'd be a lot better
if it was an ordinary affair.

316
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,948
What do you mean?

317
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,243
They're

318
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,036
in a polyamorous relationship.

319
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,205
What's that?

320
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,374
It's when you sleep around with everybody.

321
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,836
And that's why I didn't tell you.

322
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,087
Dating isn't just about sleeping around!

323
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,257
At least I only sleep
with one guy at a time.

324
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,092
I've never slept with two…

325
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,098
Okay, I've slept with two.
But only sleeping.

326
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,392
Listen.

327
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,435
Dating is about love.

328
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:08,106
We agreed to accept
that we also love other people!

329
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,276
How can you love two people at once?
Is it a club or something?

330
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,652
You've loved so many guys.

331
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,904
Stingy, Battery, and Two-timer.

332
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,197
Didn't you love all of them?

333
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,701
But I only dated them one at a time.
I had a conscience.

334
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,536
This is the global standard.

335
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,372
In good conscience, can you stop yourself
from being attracted to someone?

336
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,085
Tae-hyeong and I
would be lying to ourselves

337
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,213
if we ignored that feeling
or broke up when we still love each other.

338
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,298
Just lie to yourselves.

339
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,967
We only live once and time is running out!

340
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:39,929
Ja-yeon.

341
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,607
Don't let go of your hands!

342
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,328
Were you texting
your second boyfriend on my couch?

343
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,955
Yeah, I messed around
with him on your couch.

344
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,041
-You're a mess.
-You're close-minded.

345
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,294
I'm adding ten more minutes!

346
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,720
If time is so valuable to you,
why do you hang out with me?

347
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:22,931
Go date a third guy in that time.

348
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,391
I spend time with you because I love you.

349
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,852
And I'm just worried about you.

350
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,025
We live in a world where anything
out of the ordinary is considered wrong.

351
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,777
But polyamory?

352
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,363
"We're not wrong, we're just different."

353
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,657
That's what you and Tae-hyeong think.

354
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,076
The rest of the world thinks
you're destroying the social order.

355
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,827
I'm not the least bit afraid

356
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,498
of people pointing fingers at me,
as long as you and Ja-yeon are on my side.

357
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,418
Do you know how scared I was
when you found out?

358
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,213
I thought you might not support me.

359
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,760
If you were scared,
you should've acted like it.

360
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,387
Why'd you get mad at me?

361
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:06,516
Hui-seong.

362
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,644
Hae-yeong.

363
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,899
I can't think of an ending!

364
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,818
{\an8}EMPLOYEE OF KKULBEE STEALS 48 MILLION WON
WITH FAKE BIRTH REGISTRATION

365
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,154
{\an8}How could you dirty Kkulbee's name
after all the PR we paid for?

366
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,990
Why can't you do anything right?

367
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,493
"First in employment desirability"?

368
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,079
No, it's just the easiest company
to defraud and embezzle from!

369
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,124
I told you not to recklessly
enhance employee benefits!

370
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,918
That case is a crime.
What does it have to do with benefits?

371
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,504
It has everything to do with it!
Opportunity makes a thief.

372
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:40,425
Who wouldn't steal
when you could make money without working?

373
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:44,053
Treat your workers well
and they'll thank you at first.

374
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,056
But keep it up
and they'll consider it their right.

375
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,141
Make it clear

376
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,310
that benefits are the company's goodwill,
not what they have a right to.

377
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:52,895
Got it?

378
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,857
This is your last chance.

379
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,027
Understood, sir.

380
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,988
So your fake husband joined your company

381
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,240
and now your ex is on your team?

382
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,284
What are you going to do?

383
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,037
What can I do? I don't have a choice.

384
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,747
I'll just have to do the work

385
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,166
and share the fruit.

386
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,419
I don't mean that.
You used to date Ahn Woo-jae.

387
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,171
He knows what you're like

388
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,965
when you're in love
and when you're dating.

389
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,055
He'll notice that you
and your husband are fake.

390
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:29,807
And doesn't his wife work in HR?

391
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:21,943
MEDIA/RADIO

392
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,203
Traffic's horrible today.

393
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,835
Did you not get any sleep?

394
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,968
Look how puffy my face is.

395
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,306
Tell me I'm still pretty.

396
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,059
What?

397
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,727
Tell me I'm still pretty

398
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,313
even with wax in my eye
and even when I yawn.

399
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,900
-What's gotten into you?
-Just do it.

400
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,443
Say, "You're still pretty."

401
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,280
I'm driving right now.

402
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:09,615
What's this about?

403
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,786
Hui-seong says

404
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,206
Ahn Woo-jae
will notice that we're a fake couple.

405
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,794
He knows how I am
when I'm in love and dating.

406
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,255
We actually dated for real.

407
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,840
That's right.

408
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,383
And we're fake.

409
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,178
With that being said,
instead of just the weekdays,

410
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,805
we'll have to be in honeymoon mode
full-time now.

411
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:36,642
Live every day like it's the real thing.

412
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:40,563
Okay.

413
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:44,108
Now say, "You're still pretty."

414
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,033
Get rid of your eye wax.

415
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,786
And cover your mouth when you yawn.

416
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:57,121
Hey!

417
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,792
I still like you.

418
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,086
What?

419
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:05,588
I like you.

420
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,760
How was that?

421
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,054
Did it sound real?

422
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,185
Well, it wasn't bad.

423
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,687
But you need more practice.

424
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:22,772
"Practice"?

425
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:39,747
What about this?

426
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,499
Does it feel real?

427
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,182
KKULBEE EDUCATION

428
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,331
Does this feel real?

429
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:40,933
What are you doing?

430
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:43,728
Why are you so surprised?
It's not like we're fake.

431
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:01,162
As you already know, I'm Ahn Woo-jae
and I'm the new leader of Team Two.

432
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,457
Instead of losing someone,
you got a new superior.

433
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,583
How uncomfortable.

434
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,840
To avoid causing any discomfort, I will--

435
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:15,217
Well, it'll be uncomfortable.

436
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,803
Unless you two get a divorce.

437
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:21,849
What?

438
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:23,976
What matters

439
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,897
is that we're working together
to successfully launch a new business.

440
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,815
Let's do our best.

441
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,610
Keep it up, Gi-un.

442
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:35,613
Sure.

443
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,782
Based on feng shui,

444
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,785
let's think of the wall as a mountain
and the window as a river.

445
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,745
Turn the desk. That's it.

446
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,330
This will bring in energy.

447
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,539
This isn't right.

448
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:48,167
The desk should be turned
so I'm facing Ms. Son's office.

449
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:51,087
-You want to face that way?
-Why isn't he doing it himself?

450
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,589
Bring the table over this way.

451
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,133
-Okay.
-Yes, turn it slightly.

452
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,011
Are you all right?

453
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,555
I'm sorry.

454
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,391
-Are you all right?
-Darn it.

455
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:04,475
What's wrong?

456
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,227
It's nothing, Ms. Son.

457
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,895
The desk landed on my foot.

458
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,648
Oh, really? Why don't we go eat then?

459
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,276
-Sounds good.
-But my foot…

460
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,653
We're off to lunch, sir.

461
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,196
-I hurt my foot!
-I'm sorry.

462
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,948
I want to go too!

463
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:22,701
Oh, my goodness.

464
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,497
What's all this, Ms. Son?

465
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:27,832
Well,

466
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:31,252
I've been craving
homemade <i><font face="Arial" color="white">gimbap</font></i> recently.

467
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,046
So he got up early and made it for me.

468
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,756
That's why you seemed so…

469
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,552
Ji-uk, my husband, made it for me.

470
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,807
Yes, I woke up at dawn and--

471
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,183
You told me you can't cook.

472
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,772
Cooking isn't a skill.
It's all about love.

473
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:55,401
You two are trying so hard.

474
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,032
You should all have some.
I'm sure you'll love it.

475
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,535
Is it okay
that you're sharing his love with us?

476
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,328
-Of course.
-This smells amazing.

477
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,413
Right?

478
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:28,684
Isn't it good?

479
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,191
This is grounds for divorce.

480
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:36,859
You're at fault here.

481
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,652
Jeez.

482
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:42,406
I'm sorry.

483
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,200
I must've used sugar

484
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:45,868
instead of salt.

485
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,080
I love it.

486
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,249
It suits my taste perfectly.

487
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:54,627
Does it really?

488
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,921
Of course, you made it.

489
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,050
Then you should have more.

490
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,176
Here.

491
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,303
Open wide.

492
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,555
Come on.

493
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,349
Have some more.

494
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:09,850
Open wide.

495
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,646
-There you go.
-Okay.

496
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,024
Make sure to chew slowly.
You might upset your stomach.

497
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,152
I didn't know
our cafeteria food was this good.

498
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,114
I told you that I didn't know!

499
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,783
It wasn't even a lot.

500
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:28,786
Damn it.

501
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,873
What's that about?

502
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,042
You haven't heard?

503
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,795
-Apparently, Chairman Bok is furious.
-Why?

504
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:41,257
Someone misused their employee benefits
and made the headlines.

505
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,425
HR just launched
a full-scale investigation

506
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,095
and whoever gets caught
won't get off easy.

507
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,973
There's no need to worry
if you've done nothing wrong.

508
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,309
And yet I still got caught.

509
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,521
Were you caught for something?

510
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:59,567
I signed up for the resort three years ago
but couldn't go because my kid got sick,

511
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,236
so I let my aunt and cousin go instead.

512
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,446
And they said I couldn't do that
as aunts aren't immediate family.

513
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,449
I'm banned from using the resort
for six months.

514
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,451
-What?
-How did they know that?

515
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,495
HR goes undercover, you know?

516
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,877
Did you know they collect rumors, jokes,
and talks among employees

517
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,462
and write up detailed reports?

518
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:27,720
Mr. Ahn,

519
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,930
don't talk about this at home.

520
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,016
Of course.

521
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:37,646
The only people
who can come out of this unscathed

522
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,356
are these two.

523
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:42,568
You two haven't used
any employee benefits, right?

524
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,403
-Right.
-Not at all.

525
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,488
I'm not sure about Mr. Kim.

526
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,240
You benefited when you got married.

527
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,326
I got those benefits!

528
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,036
He wasn't even working here then.

529
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,912
Don't try to frame him.

530
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:57,708
All I meant was that Mr. Kim
indirectly enjoyed the benefits

531
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,084
and you're all up in arms.

532
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,586
Are you guilty or something?

533
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:26,737
This is my car.

534
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,366
Only team leaders and higher
can park in the company building.

535
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,743
This car is parked in my parking spot.
So whose car is it?

536
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:35,746
Yours.

537
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,792
On that note,

538
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:42,711
why don't you move into my house?

539
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,339
How does that make sense?

540
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,676
You'll only be fully mine
once you move in with me.

541
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,720
I'm already yours now,
at least in other people's eyes.

542
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,266
Isn't Ahn Woo-jae acting so off?

543
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,812
He keeps testing us
and talking about us getting divorced.

544
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,022
I feel like he knows.

545
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,194
I mean, I have to move anyway.

546
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,447
You do?

547
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:12,366
But is there a room for me at your house?

548
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,534
Of course.

549
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,202
The penthouse.

550
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,499
The penthouse?

551
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,877
Do you know what that is?

552
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:27,548
You could call this a penthouse,
especially compared to your <i><font face="Arial" color="white">gosiwon.</font></i>

553
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,258
Compared to where I'm staying right now…

554
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,811
And I don't just sleep at home, you know?

555
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,230
I at least need a bathroom and a sink.

556
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:47,609
There's a shared bathroom and kitchen
down on the first floor.

557
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:53,949
Wait a minute.

558
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,201
You haven't even gone in yet.

559
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,662
How did you know
there's no bathroom and sink?

560
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:05,085
Rooftop rooms
aren't allowed to have those by law.

561
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,260
I'll have the walls
and floor newly plastered,

562
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,678
along with a lot of insulation.

563
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:16,972
It's not fit for anyone
to live in it, is it?

564
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,017
It definitely is.
And it's been lived in before.

565
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:21,769
It just needs to be cleaned.

566
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:23,353
So why am I here?

567
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:26,106
I told you. It needs to be cleaned.

568
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,109
You want me to organize stuff
and clean the room?

569
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,279
There's no need to organize anything.
Just throw it all out.

570
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,656
I'll get the cleaning supplies.

571
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,293
It's been a while.

572
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,700
Is she going to throw this out too?

573
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,278
{\an8}9 YEARS AGO

574
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,171
Oh, hi there.

575
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,258
You must be Ji-uk.
Geum-duk's grandson, right?

576
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:17,885
Yes, I am.

577
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:19,761
I'm Eun-ok.

578
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,599
Auntie, Mom, Lady, or Ms. Lee.

579
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,893
Call me however you'd like
except for Grandma.

580
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:35,527
What are you doing?

581
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,965
I'm letting fresh air in.

582
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,217
Why didn't you just

583
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,179
have us register our marriage?

584
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:03,722
That's the best way.

585
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,600
I did think about doing that.

586
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:10,771
The thing is, I could bear to dirty you
but not your family register.

587
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,273
My conscience wouldn't let me.

588
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,986
So you do have a conscience?

589
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:28,705
Is this a board game?

590
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:31,583
What's that?

591
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,921
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">-Happy 30th birthday
-Happy 30th birthday</font></i>

592
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,256
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">-Happy birthday dear Hae-yeong
-Happy birthday dear Hae-yeong</font></i>

593
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,092
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">-Happy 30th birthday
-Happy 30th birthday</font></i>

594
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,434
This is huge. You really didn't have to.

595
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,853
I carefully selected one
from each continent.

596
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:52,813
Music boxes?

597
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:56,733
Travel the world lying down!

598
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:06,159
Wait.

599
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,161
No, wait!

600
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:22,968
So this is…

601
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:25,595
how you traveled the world.

602
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:29,725
Say hi to Bruno, Chris…

603
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,059
I forgot his name.

604
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,359
I guess you're shy.

605
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,449
Did you just step back?

606
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:46,908
Let me make this clear.

607
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,119
Even if I live here, my body is mine.

608
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:51,788
And my body is one with my mind.

609
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,458
I won't do anything my mind says no to.

610
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,960
What on earth are you talking about?

611
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,712
How could you think of me like that?

612
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:07,095
My mind's only attracted to
what my body is.

613
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:10,140
I guess you and I won't ever do it
since we're out of sync.

614
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,644
Why are you taking that?
Aren't you going to throw it out?

615
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,004
What are you doing?
The performance is over.

616
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:48,762
Bok…

617
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:50,514
Gyu…

618
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:52,057
Hyun!

619
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,436
Sir.

620
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,274
That "sir" came a little late.

621
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:05,612
I'd hate for you to be forgiven,

622
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,281
but Ms. Yeon made you do this
for your crime.

623
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:09,908
So why am I here?

624
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,619
And on my precious day off at that?

625
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:19,459
I'm taking this precious chance
to repent with my precious secretary.

626
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:23,505
So you should be happy
to spend your precious day off

627
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,799
together with your precious boss.

628
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,929
And don't call me your boss here.

629
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:32,264
Then what do I call you?

630
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:33,807
Gyu-hyun?

631
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:35,934
Mr. Volunteer.

632
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,603
That's just as formal as Mr. Bok.

633
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:40,772
Go.

634
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,686
HANBYEOL ORPHANAGE

635
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:23,899
{\an8}NAM JA-YEON

636
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:52,802
Ms. Yeon,

637
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:54,512
how did you…

638
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,139
I know this orphanage.

639
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,349
No, I mean…

640
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:01,478
-Why are you here?
-To ask you why

641
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,104
you donated the washing machines.

642
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,482
Oh, those machines?

643
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,067
If you think I'll reduce your service

644
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,819
just because you spent money
on the washing machines,

645
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,279
you'd be highly…

646
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,615
Where are you, Mr. Volunteer?

647
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,244
Hey!

648
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:20,580
-Run.
-What?

649
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:22,999
Run!

650
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,044
Mr. Volunteer!

651
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,050
Are you serious?

652
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,637
Jeez, I knew he'd do this.

653
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,474
Repent, my ass.

654
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:25,478
Stop running, Ms. Yeon.

655
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,231
How far are you going?

656
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,609
You told me to run.

657
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:46,041
So why did we run?

658
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,181
The thing is…

659
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,768
Is somebody there?

660
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,644
Ha-jun.

661
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,313
What?

662
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:14,402
What?

663
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:17,197
What did I just say?

664
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,532
I asked if somebody was there.

665
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,701
And you said, "Ha-jun."

666
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:26,581
Yes, Ha-jun.

667
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,583
The male lead in your novel.

668
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:30,502
Why is his name Ha-jun?

669
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:35,507
You made us run just to ask that?

670
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:38,676
Yes, remember what you said?

671
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,012
You were prepared for social ruin
if your identity got leaked.

672
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:43,848
So I was worried
someone might overhear us.

673
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:55,068
Ha-jun is just a name that I like.

674
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:58,488
Why do you like that name?

675
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:03,451
It's the name of someone I like,

676
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:05,328
which is a secret.

677
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,752
Were you that curious?

678
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,879
No, I wasn't.

679
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:18,299
I didn't want to know.

680
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,565
How did he get eczema already?
He's barely washed anything.

681
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:36,609
Why didn't he buy ointment
instead of washing machines?

682
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:40,572
What a weirdo.

683
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:48,288
PHARMACY

684
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,295
Hello.

685
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:57,255
How can I help you?

686
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,008
I need ointment for eczema.

687
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:01,301
Eczema?

688
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,265
I'm not buying this because I'm worried.

689
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:10,560
Even prisons have clinics, you know?

690
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:12,979
Okay. Here you go.

691
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:16,900
Secretary Yeo.

692
00:46:18,735 --> 00:46:19,736
Open the door for me.

693
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,045
When your boss tells you to open the door,

694
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:39,380
you're supposed to open the door,

695
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:42,217
escort your boss to his seat,

696
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,302
and bow like this!

697
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,644
Did you meet the writer?

698
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,188
-The director asked about it.
-Oh, yeah.

699
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,818
What should we get for dinner?

700
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,154
-What about noodles over--
-Secretary Yeo!

701
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,906
Secretary Yeo! What are you craving?

702
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:06,699
I'll buy you anything!

703
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,244
-Seriously?
-Yeah, of course.

704
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:11,871
-Actually, I'm craving--
-Secretary Yeo!

705
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:15,291
I can't let my precious secretary's
precious stomach stay empty.

706
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,001
-Are you driving?
-Yeah, you just lean back.

707
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:19,546
-What are you doing?
-Just lean back.

708
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:21,339
-What?
-Lean back!

709
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:01,045
You said goodbye
like it was our last time.

710
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:05,008
Come on. I said I wouldn't be able to
see you for the time being.

711
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,134
Jeez.

712
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:10,346
At my age, you could see me today

713
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,473
and be at my funeral tomorrow.

714
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:15,810
Any time apart could mean forever.

715
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:19,647
I'm moving into the rooftop room here.

716
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,192
We should see each other more often.
What do you say?

717
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:24,861
Whatever.

718
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,032
-Here.
-I'm all right, sir. You have it.

719
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:30,742
Throw it away then!

720
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:33,328
Thank you.

721
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:34,829
Take care!

722
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,354
Did he take all the waste paper?

723
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,732
Yes. I'll throw the recyclables out
on collection day.

724
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,443
Don't worry about it. I can do it.

725
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:07,820
I'll be going then.

726
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:09,572
But you're all dirty.

727
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,449
Wash up and change first.

728
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:13,201
I didn't bring any clothes.

729
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,578
I have some for you. They should fit.

730
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,125
Is this okay?

731
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,504
Why do you have men's clothes?

732
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:28,758
Are these your ex's?

733
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:32,220
We're just girls here.

734
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,808
I needed men's clothes to hang outside

735
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:38,851
but didn't want to buy new ones.

736
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,521
I'm not wearing it.

737
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:45,066
Well, the underwear's new.

738
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:47,068
Roar!

739
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,241
Wait, is that Baby?

740
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,327
You didn't let it out?

741
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,413
No, I could never find it.

742
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:00,957
Really?

743
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,584
Baby!

744
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,462
Come here. There you are.

745
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:08,131
There, there.

746
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,883
Where were you, Baby?

747
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,803
I'm the one who fed it for months.

748
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:16,681
I'm kicking you out today, Baby.

749
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:18,725
Ma'am.

750
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:21,269
Don't look at me like that.
I'll kick you out too.

751
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,604
Wait, Baby's saying something.

752
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:25,398
What?

753
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:28,651
Baby is grateful for being taken care of
and for staying here.

754
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:30,528
What?

755
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,115
Baby will always remember your kindness.

00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:53,259
THE WRITER WILL BE GOING ON A HIATUS.
THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING.

00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:11,486
{\an8}MS. YEON, PLEASE CALL ME

760
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,915
I'll take it
that you'll be joining us then.

761
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:24,832
Okay.

762
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,799
Are you going somewhere with Ms. Son?

763
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:36,511
She's hosting a housewarming party
and team dinner.

764
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:40,389
Why would she invite you
to her housewarming?

765
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,559
My friend who's a children's story writer
lives with her.

766
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:47,063
She's more or less Ms. Son's sister.

767
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:55,613
Secretary Yeo,

768
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,032
should I go too?

769
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,954
No one wants to see their boss
on the one Kkul-Friday of the month.

770
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,872
I came up with Kkul-Friday!

771
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:06,541
Well, thank you.

772
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:10,545
-Where are you off to?
-The marketing team.

773
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:14,423
I thought I was close to Ms. Son.

774
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:16,801

Mr. Bok.

777
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,819
Why did you want to see me?

778
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,030
Mr. Kim.

779
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:39,907
What are we?

780
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:42,326
Excuse me?

781
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:46,289
Are you pretending
not to know like a coward?

782
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:52,044
I thought it'd be appropriate to pretend.

783
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,255
If I keep my mouth shut,

784
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,465
there won't be any problems.

785
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:01,387
Lucifer,

786
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,931
we're friends who hung up laundry
and piggybacked each other.

787
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:06,767
Consider me your brother.

788
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:11,564
-Your brother?
-Yeah.

789
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,149
Brother.

790
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,150
Oh, right.

791
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,777
I heard you're having a housewarming.

792
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,989
I wonder what it'd be like.

793
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,950
I've never been to one before.

794
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:24,201
Right, the housewarming!

795
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,496
We need to order food.

796
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,707
If we're done here, please excuse me.

797
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:31,834

799
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:35,421
I'm your brother!

800
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:38,716

00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:58,629
What's wrong?

810
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,381
Your first love Ha-jun is coming.

811
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,263
Are you not happy about it?

812
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:12,143
Well, he doesn't know
you write web novels, so I can see why.

813
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,937
-I'll call Hae-yeong and--
-No, it's okay.

814
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,982
Hae-yeong will only feel at ease
if he's here.

815
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,026
She needs him here.

816
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:29,535
Ja-yeon.

817
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,788
I know we're basically family,

818
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,000
but we're like sisters, not like parents.

819
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:42,006
I'm saying you're not Hae-yeong's parents.

820
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,012
You don't have to cater to her
all the time.

821
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:52,683
I know.

822
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,604
But I'm honestly fine.

823
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,294
Welcome.

824
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:24,423
-This place is amazing.
-It's so nice.

825
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:27,176
It's a bit old, but it's where I was born.

826
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:30,346
A home full of memories is better
than a house worth a billion won.

827
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:31,764
I'd prefer a billion won.

828
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:35,309
Hello.

829
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,228
She's my friend
who lives on the second floor.

830
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,729
She went to school with Secretary Yeo.

831
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,697
-Oh, my.
-My goodness, girl.

832
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,575
You didn't have to prepare so much.

833
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:54,245
You didn't cook all this,
did you, Mr. Kim?

834
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:57,706
It's from a popular restaurant.

835
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:59,416
That's good news.

836
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,627
Leave cooking to the chefs.

837
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:04,004
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

838
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:05,798
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

839
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,509
I guess you didn't get any new furniture.
Nothing's changed.

840
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,142
How do you know that?

841
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,981
Oh. Well, the thing is…

842
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:24,066
Well…

843
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,234
Her partner…

844
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,406
I mean, my brother-in-law

845
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:34,827
moved in empty-handed
without buying anything.

846
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:39,665
-I see.
-That's why there's no new furniture.

847
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:47,047
See? I asked you to give me time
to buy stuff.

848
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,551
Just treat me right.
No one else will put up with you.

849
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:54,638
I doubt that. Ji-uk was super popular.

850
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,433
-I was?
-You didn't know?

851
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:00,477
You were voted most popular
by the 23rd cohort.

852
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:04,648
Why? Because of his looks?

853
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:08,444
No, nobody noticed his looks because
he never bothered with his appearance.

854
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:10,821
But he was really nice.

855
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:15,743
He even did all the work
for our group project.

856
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,787
He's also great at English and Chinese.

857
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:20,831
And he carried stuff for all the girls.

858
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:25,753
Oh right, funny story.

859
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,380
Our cohort went on a hike once

860
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:31,342
and one of the girls twisted her ankle.

861
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,886
Ji-uk carried her on his back

862
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:37,306
all the way down from the summit.

863
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:40,684
Did you really, my dear husband?

864
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:43,979
It wasn't from the summit.

865
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,065
Even I thought he looked cool,
and I'm a guy.

866
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,859
Imagine how impressed the girls were.

867
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,154
Come on, Gi-un.

868
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:54,240
No one thought that.

869
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:56,784
Sure, they did. When they found out
you were married,

870
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,745
all the girls got together
and drank all night.

871
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:04,625
"The fact that an older woman
got a good-looking and tall…"

872
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:08,295
Never mind.

873
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:13,425
Girl, whoever calls dibs first
and puts a ring on it is the winner.

874
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:15,886
Ms. Son, you win!

875
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:16,971
-Win!
-Win!

876
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,806
-We wish you happiness!
-All right.

877
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,376
Fold the table up and…

878
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,343
I can see why you were popular.

879
00:59:58,387 --> 00:59:59,388
What?

880
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,142
What did you say?

881
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:04,935
I didn't even realize.

882
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:07,229
I'm sorry.

883
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:13,110
This is nothing
compared to cleaning the rooftop room.

884
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:16,697
No, it's not that.

885
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:19,616
I'm sorry for making you spend

886
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:22,286
your one-time newbie days like this.

887
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,371
What do you mean?

888
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:27,750
You should be hanging out
with your colleagues, having flings,

889
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:31,503
and actually dating.

890
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,589
But you can't because of me

891
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,300
since we have to be a fake couple.

892
01:00:36,884 --> 01:00:39,595
Do you want me to have flings

893
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,307
and go on dates?

894
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,018
Yeah.

895
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:48,270
Really?

896
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:53,984
Yeah.

897
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:57,446
You know,

898
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,491
I can still do that now.

899
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:04,411
If it's what you want.

900
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:58,507
I told you

901
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,427
that my body and mind are one.

902
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,012
My body

903
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:07,182
is where my mind is right now.

904
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:29,913
I'll head up.

905

910

EPILOGUE

912
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,195
Go sleep on the couch.

913
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:41,688
I'll help you.

914
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:02,125
Here.

915
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:09,841
Thank you.

916
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:19,601
Don't take off our ring.

917
01:06:22,104 --> 01:06:23,146
Keep it on.

918
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,276
Ji-uk, this is--

919
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,571
I'm your priority and your partner,

920
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,366
as long as our rings are on.

921
01:06:36,952 --> 01:06:38,245
Is that why you bought it?

922
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:46,336
You want me to be your partner?

923
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:53,593
You…

924
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:57,681
You…

925
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,063
You're so adorable.
