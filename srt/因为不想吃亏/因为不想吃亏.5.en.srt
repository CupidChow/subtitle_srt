a bit of a misunderstanding here.

In Canada,
a beloved pastor's wife had a child

many years ago, out of wedlock.

what you should ask
is what you can be doing

27

to help protect the reputation of...
this happy family.

28
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:16,136
I don't know what your game is
or why you're threatening me,

30
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,641
I suggest you take up plumbing

32
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,854

weren't even close enough...

180

Oh...

181
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,347

I guess it doesn't matter, does it,

182

or answer your calls then?

Ah, and that's why you showed up
out of nowhere?

if I get in trouble or not?

00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,289
So?

485
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,208
He didn't get that bruise
just yesterday either.

and ten days ago.

I didn't. I hope that's not the case.

494
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:04,105
I really hope from the bottom of my heart
that he actually just fell.

00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,440
Ah, my Hui-seong's gonna be
even busier now

529
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:30,649
with all that audition prep.

530
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,652
This station only holds them once a year.
What if I get rejected again?

531
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,155
[Producer Yun grunts]

532
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,534
You've really put in the work
these past 12 years

533
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,703
and that's why
you're gonna get in this time, Hui-seong.

534
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,706
And the other actors?
All of them will catch a cold!

535
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,000
Have to get their wisdom teeth out!
Bite their tongues!

536
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,585
And only you'll make the cut!

537
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,004
What, you can see into the future now?

538
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,133
Actually, last week...
my mom went to a fortune teller.

539
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,512
But your mom's a deacon at church.

540
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,348
That fortune teller is the real deal.
You know why?

541
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,891
My mom came in and she said...

542
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,559
-[bells jingling effect]
-[in altered voice] "You work for someone

543
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,019
with billions of fans."

544
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,021
-[in normal voice] That's what she said.
-[both chuckle]

545
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:11,690
According to the fortune teller...

546
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,528
I'm getting married this year.

547
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,323
Oh, you are? And?

548
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,616
I remember everything.

549
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,119
You said once you pass that open audition,
we should get married.

550
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:25,037
[inhales deeply]

551
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:27,248
I did, yes.
Ten years ago, I think?

552
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,044
To be honest,
after the way we changed our relationship,

553
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,297
I thought, "Hmm, marriage might be
a difficult step for us",

554
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,634
but when I saw you catch the bouquet
at Hae-yeong's wedding, I just knew.

555
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,096
That was a sign from you, wasn't it?

556
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:44,890
[awkward chuckle]

557
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,976
[gentle music playing]

558
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,185
[Producer Yun sighs]

559
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:49,895
So that means
you're definitely going to pass

560
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,063
that audition this year.

561
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:52,815
And then...

562
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,194
let's finally get married, Hui-seong.

563
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,281
[breathes deeply]

564
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,326
[Si-ho's father] I'm telling you,
I didn't do anything wrong.

565
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,995
You know? But this woman,

566
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,247
she took photos of my son,
Si-ho, without permission,

567
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,916
so I just went up to her
to say something, okay?

568
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,419
I told her she couldn't do that
without asking,

569
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,753
that even a kid has rights.

570
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,755
But then this guy, out of nowhere...

571
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,466
What? A child's rights?

572
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,469
[scoffs] And that's why
you beat your own kid, huh?

573
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:23,137
[Hae-yeong] Come here then,
I'll protect your rights!

574
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,346
[officer] Please calm down, ma'am.

575
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,599
You see this? Just like before.

576
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,185
What this bitch just did!
Wow, you've gotta...

577
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,269
You watch your mouth.

578
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,188
Hey, go ahead and hit me.

579
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,689
If we don't settle this,

580
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,442
we'll both be charged with assault
and end up with a record.

581
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,695
But I... I have my own business,

582
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,947
so having a record doesn't affect me.

583
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:44,158
But white-collar workers like you?
[scoffs]

584
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,911
If your boss finds out,
what about your jobs, huh?

585
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,622
[indistinct police radio chatter]

586
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:55,085
You're right.

587
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,838
Well, if we're gonna end up
in the system anyway...

588
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,799
then we might as well make sure
it's for a good reason!

589
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:03,844
-What? No... Don't...
-You wanna go? Come on! Let's go!

590
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:04,803
-[Si-ho's father] See, see, right there!
-[Ji-uk] Stop!

591
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:05,804
-What are you doing with that chair?
-[officer] Put the chair down!

592
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,097
-Put it down!
-Come on!

593
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,557
[woman] Ms. Son Hae-yeong?

594
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:10,434
[Hae-yeong gasps]

595
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,398
[officer] Who are you?

596
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,400
-Evening, I'm Kkulbee Educ...
-My name's Cho Yul.

597
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:22,071
I'm five and I'm in a Honeybee Class
of Kkulbee Daycare.

598
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,533
Hi, I'm from Kkulbee's legal team.

599
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:26,700
My name is Kang Bit-na.

600
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,870
From this point forward,
Kkulbee Education's legal department

601
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:32,122
will represent Ms. Son and Mr. Kim.

602
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,335
Since you run your own business,
please ask your legal team to join.

603
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,170
Uh...

604
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:41,549
yeah, we can just, uh... talk this out.

605
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,763
[Hae-yeong sighs] What a nightmare.

606
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,640
Sorry to inconvenience you two like this.

607
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:53,185
But how did you know
all this even happened, Ms. Kang?

608
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:56,063
I'm neither an executive
nor a part of the Bok family.

609
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:59,400
You must be just as important
as an executive then, Ms. Son.

610
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,068
We have witness statements

611
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,903
and surveillance camera footage
from the scene.

612
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:06,115
We'll settle this amicably,
so there's no need for you both to worry.

613
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,700
-[Hae-yeong sighs] Thank you.
-Thank you, ma'am.

614
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,245
But, uh, what'll happen to Si-ho?

615
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,205
He was being abused.

616
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,957
Can his dad be charged?

617
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,292
[Ji-uk] Is that possible?

618
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,253
I took some photos.
It's proof there's physical abuse.

619
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:23,132
Well, the thing is, the child is claiming
that he wasn't abused, and also...

620
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,302
this falls outside
legal's responsibilities, so...

621
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,347
[gentle music playing]

622
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,517
"Education isn't for the grades
or college, it's for the kids.

623
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:35,185
It should be about arming them

624
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,396
with the skills
to protect themselves in life.

625
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,649
Kkulbee can also provide these skills

626
00:31:40,733 --> 00:31:42,901
so kids can thrive
and overcome any obstacle."

627
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:45,487
That's what President Bok said
during his inaugural speech.

628
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,991
Has his feelings changed since then?

629
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:53,412
[sighs]

630
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,960
Send those pictures
to the email address on my business card.

631
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:03,047
I'll report this to the president
and try to find a solution.

632
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,048
[sighs in relief]

633
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,799
-Thank you.
-[Bit-na] Good night.

634
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:07,718
Let's go.

635
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,139
[sighs in relief]

636
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,393
The police just wrapped the investigation.

637
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:21,231
Yes. They believed my reason
for being there.

638
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:22,941
I said I was there to protect Ms. Son.

639
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,527
Yes, I understand.

640
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,405
[car window rolling down]

641
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,408
Mommy, I'm really tired.

642
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,994
Let's go, come on.

643
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,621
All right, roll up the window, okay?

644
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,291
Ugh, the owner and his family
are such a pain in the neck.

645
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,712
I'm exhausted from all this extra work
they keep putting me on.

646
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:45,923
[baby giggles effect]

647
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,676
[Hae-yeong sighs]

648
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,761
Why'd he have to punch you in the face?

649
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,429
I got more hits in than he did.

650
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:54,556
Don't you dare compare
your face to that ugly guy.

651
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,433
-[soft chuckle]
-This better not scar.

652
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,563
[Hae-yeong] Look at me.

653
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:05,734
Oh, I'm fine.

654
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,199
[groans]

655
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,539
[soft groan]

656
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,166
[gentle music playing]

657
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:26,296
Thanks... for saving me again today.

658
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,136
Sure.

659
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,639
And thanks for punching out that guy too.

660
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,604
You're pretty good at fighting,
by the way.

661
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:43,689
What's your secret?

662
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,691
I wanna know.

663
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,234
Well, first...

664
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:49,695
you can't be afraid to get hit at all,

665
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,029
no matter how much it's gonna hurt.

666
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:54,158
Guess I'll never be good at fighting then.

667
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,077
-I can't even stand being rained on.
-[soft chuckle]

668
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:00,122
But who was hitting you so much anyway?

669
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:01,749
My grandma.

670
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,835
So I'd always be on my best behavior.

671
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,506
Uh... uh, it wasn't as bad as you think.

672
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,342
Seriously.

673
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:16,597
I almost reported your grandma
for child abuse.

674
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,681
[soft chuckle]

675
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:20,684
By the way,

676
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:24,396
how did you know...
that kid today was being abused?

677
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,731
You could've been wrong.

678
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,149
I've seen it a lot.

679
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:30,944
Ah, I never mentioned.

680
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:35,616
For a long time,
my mother ran a foster home...

681
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:36,784
until, uh...

682
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,371
until my dad passed away.

683
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,292
Ah... I see.

684
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,295
Some of the kids
weren't abused like that...

685
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:50,881
but most of them were.

686
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:53,801
I guess that's why I saw it.

687
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,096
It's all thanks to your mother.

688
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,390
Is it?

689
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:01,683
[Ji-uk] Your mother...

690
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,063
she's a really good person.

691
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:10,901
She was a good person...
to everybody else.

692
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,362
What about to you, ma'am?

693
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,530
To me?

694
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,449
[grunts] To me, she was...

695
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,076
Oh! Here comes my bus.

696
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:21,662
You okay going alone?

697
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:22,788
[chuckles]

698
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,083
Take good care of your face
so it doesn't scar.

00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,548
-Hey!
-[bus door opens]

700
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,800
It was really nice to see you again today.

701
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,261
See you tomorrow.

702
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:57,781
"Tomorrow"?

703
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:01,243
Ah, really? Go to a branch office! God!

704
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,120
[sighs]

705
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:16,967
[tense music playing]

706
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:21,555
You're better at following people
than you are at blackmailing them.

707
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,266
How did you know I was here?

708
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,478
This doesn't mean
we're reneging on your job offer.

709
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:32,024
So If I were you,
I wouldn't make trouble just because...

710
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,525
I wasn't the one who started it.

711
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,032
Where exactly are we going?

712
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:44,202
[door chimes]

713
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,340
[man] This is where you'll be living,
Mr. Kim Ji-uk.

714
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,013
-And who decided this?
-Going forward,

715
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,807
this apartment is where you'll stay.

716
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,060
[scoffs]

717
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,981
If you follow your orders to the letter,
Kim Ji-uk...

718
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:16,193
you'll be the owner of this apartment.

719
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,030
[Ji-uk] What kind of threat is this?

720
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,865
You give me a job and an apartment.

721
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:24,284
The position,
you got on your own merits.

722
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:26,370
All the way up to the final decision,

723
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,747
I'm told no one had to step in
to make sure you were hired.

724
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,084
And these...

725
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:36,421
you can use them whenever you need.

726
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,425
What do I need to do then?

727
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,843
Leak company secrets?

728
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,762
What? Surveillance?

729
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,015
All we ask...

730
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,852
is that you're on time to work...

731
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:53,397
and that you always work hard.

732
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,232
All right?

733
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,318
Are you...

734
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,866
by chance...

735
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:06,660
By chance?

736
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:10,038
You phrase everything
like a threat, but...

737
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,332
by chance...

738
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:14,960
are you him?

739
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,130
My, uh...

740
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,048
Um...

741
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,592
my fa...

742
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:25,470
-Uh...
-I've been infertile for years.

743
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,180
-[frog croaking effect]
-Ah...

744
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:28,932
[comical sting]

745
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:30,267
Oh.

746
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,435
I'll show you the medical report.

747
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,353
No, that's quite all right.

748
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:35,147
And Mr. Kim Ji-uk,

749
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,648
I was only 13 the year you were born.

750
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:37,858
13?

751
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,569
Oh? And this year, you're...

752
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,320
-I'm 40.
-Huh?

753
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:44,114
-Wanna see my ID?
-Yes.

754
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,616
-[squeaking effect]
-No, I mean no.

755
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,785
[sighs] That's okay.

756
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,372
And I wasn't just phrasing things
to sound like threats.

757
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,416
They're threats, I mean it.

758
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,961
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

759
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:05,802
[door opens, chimes]

760
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:09,848

[Ja-yeon gasps]

764
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,274
Is it bad?

765
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,777
How could Ji-uk not take you
to the hospital after seeing this?

766
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,111
[cat meowing]

767
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,571
How could I show him my bare back?

768
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,532
What if he falls for me after seeing it?

769
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,160
[Hae-yeong chuckles]

770
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:32,662
-[Ja-yeon sighs]
-[Hae-yeong] Ow.

771
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,542
You can't get mixed up
in things like that.

772
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,878
What if you'd gotten hurt even worse?

773
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,421
He could've killed you.

774
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,966
What if that man holds a grudge
and comes to the house one night?

775
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,803
That's not going to happen.

776
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,596
I'm a company asset.

777
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,766
At the police station,
a company lawyer came to help us.

778
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,602
Is everything really okay?

779
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:56,770
[sighs]

780
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,855
I'll make sure of it, all right?

781
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,275
Uh, can we keep it a secret
from Hui-seong?

782
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:03,985
I mean about Ji-uk coming to my company?

783
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,113
Until he's assigned to a branch office.

784
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:07,906
Why keep it from her?

785
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,533
'Cause if she finds out, she's gonna go,

786
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:10,909
-"Hey, I knew it..."
-[door opens]

787
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:13,453
-[Hui-seong] I knew it!
-[comical music playing]

788
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,580
I knew this would happen.

789
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,582
I told you this wedding was a bad idea.

790
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,171
[keyboard keys clacking]

791
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:36,893
[Hae-yeong] Hmm...

792
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,604
You dated him for ten years,

793
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:40,981
but you have zero interest
in getting married?

794
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:42,691
Now you realize?

795
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,819
-Am I a terrible person?
-You're trash.

796
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:47,445
I mean, feelings can change.

797
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:48,989
Stinky trash.

798
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,533
So much changes in ten years.

799
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,702
Entire neighborhoods
can be completely redeveloped.

800
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,787
-Ten years ago, I was 22 and...
-23.

801
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,457
22, okay? A kid.

802
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,209
How could I promise to marry someone?

803
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:02,669
It's too young! Right?

804
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:03,879
[sighs]

805
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:06,423
So while that neighborhood
was getting redeveloped,

806
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:07,757
you forgot how to use your voice?

807
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:11,261
If you lost interest in marriage,
you should've told him beforehand.

808
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,763
I only realized today
that I don't wanna marry him.

809
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:14,681
[Hae-yeong scoffs]

810
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:17,893
Why is marriage always the end goal?

811
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:21,313
Look, can't the story just end with a...

812
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,315
"Hui-seong and Tae-hyeong
dated happily ever after"?

813
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,274
What's wrong with that?

814
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:28,195
After ten years,
you're basically husband and wife.

815
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,989
When you break up with him later,
at least pay him alimony.

816
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:31,948
But I don't wanna break up.

817
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:33,783
He's my man. I love Tae-hyeong.

818
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,452
Then keep failing those auditions,

819
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,454
-so your man can keep waiting.
-Hey!

820
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,041
-[sighs]
-[Hui-seong clears throat]

821
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:41,958
Look.

822
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:43,835
Tae-hyeong told you
he wants to get married

823
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,545
and that he definitely wants children.

824
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:47,047
If you've robbed him
the chance to have kids

825
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,550
while his sperm's still in its prime,
at least have the decency to break up.

826
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:53,094
That way, Tae-hyeong will have
the opportunity to have kids

827
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,555
with the youngest sperm
he can shoot out for the rest of his life!

828
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,725
You know how important sperm age is
to the child's health?

829
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:00,852
You keep talking about his sperm,

830
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,938
but I thought that was something
we weren't supposed to share?

831

Ugh, you're gross!

834
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,072
What are you gonna do with that?

835
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,490
[Hui-seong] Tae-hyeong said
it was his wedding present,

836
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:14,783
so I brought it home.

837
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,160
I'll throw it out. I guess.

838
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:18,161
[Hui-seong] Throw it out?

839
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:20,121
Why not just hang it up?
You said you missed him.

840
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,457
Me? When?

841
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,125
When you refill Kitty's bowl.

842
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,045
You complained you don't see
this cat or that damn guy.

843
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:29,756
Isn't he the guy you were complaining
you never got to see?

844
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,091
Enough!

who's redistributing all his wealth
through fines and settlements.

851
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:20,557
Are you on your way to the office
or the police station?

To the gym, actually.

853
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,855
[Gyu-hyun] Ah, Ms. Kang.
I was meaning to call you today.

854
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,316
The child abuse case you mentioned.

855
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,401
Let's have legal deal with it.
You take care of it.

856
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:32,569
Will do, Mr. President.

857
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:35,947
I'm told our New Biz Dev Leader
and a new hire were responsible.

858
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,615
Keep them on the same team.

859
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,075
This will be good press for us.

860

00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,085
I care more about your affairs.

863

Shut up and sign here.

You two finally getting a divorce?

866
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:03,516
Well, if I have to decide
whether to live with Mommy or Daddy...

867
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:06,770
I should probably run away
crying right now.

Are you disowning me or something?

874
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,945
Just sign your name and go to the gym
or wherever you're headed.

875
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:18,198
You really think
I'm stupid enough to sign this?

876
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:20,575
You can call someone names,
but you can't sign your own?

877
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,160
Are you sure
you can deal with this quietly?

878
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,161
That's not why.

879
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,996
It's because it's my responsibility,

880
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,248
I don't need to sign
some document to prove it.

881
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:31,169
Ms. Kang, you brought my will
with revisions like I asked?

882
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:33,838
Yes, I did, sir.

883
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:37,926
If you don't sign that waiver,
I'm going to sign this new will.

884
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,594
-Father!
-Bok Gyu-hyun!

885
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,554
[tense music playing]

886
00:44:41,638 --> 00:44:43,264
This is me giving you a chance.

887
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,725
It means that while you lack
what it takes to be a business owner,

888
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:48,436
if you at least have the ability
to deal with a crisis,

889
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,729
I'll make you my successor regardless.

890
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,190
But perhaps it's too big of an opportunity

891
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:54,776
for a guy who doesn't really understand
what that actually means.

892
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,237
And worse still,
doesn't have the guts to sign his name.

893
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,239
[sighs]

894
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,282
[tense music continues]

895
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:08,415
All right then.

896
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,125
I'll sign my name.

897
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,086
[Gyu-hyun sighs]

898
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:19,342
[Jeong-a] One moment.

[tense music swells, fades]

900
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,811
Ms. Kang,
can you please draft another waiver?

901
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:32,397
Uh... to say what?

902
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,190
"I, Bok Gi-ho, state:

903
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,402
in the event my actions
harm the company's reputation...

904
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:41,531
I will immediately resign as CEO,

905
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,450
and transfer my assets...

906
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,995
in their entirety to my spouse,
Seon Jeong-a."

907
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:47,996
Mother?

908
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:49,205
Jeong-a.

909
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:51,124
The guts to sign your own name, huh?

910
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,209
[dramatic music playing]

911
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,253
I'd like to see yours as well.

912
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,506

KKULBEE EDUCATION

915
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:05,221
Hey, Ms. Lee,
how's the research prep been going?

916
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:07,474
I got the list of directors
for the After School programs

917
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,893
and private schools,
and I am drafting the questionnaire.

918
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:10,810
Okay.

919
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:12,145
And you, Mr. Kim?

920
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:15,440
I only see data on the status
of After School programs in the city.

921
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,484
-And outside Seoul?
-I'm working on it right now.

922
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:20,695
Grab regional population changes
and the number of two-income houses.

923
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:22,947
Only for families with one or more kids.

924
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:23,907
Team Leader...

925
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,742
I'll divvy up the work
once the new hires get here.

926
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:26,868
Just hold out till then.

927
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,077
[knocking on door]

928
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:29,204
Look at that!

929
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:30,997
Hello, everyone!

930
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:34,250
[tense music rising]

931
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,008

[Asst. Manager Kim] New recruits?

00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,142
Uh...

935
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:54,812
Do I know you?

[gulps]

939
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,325
If we did, it must've been
somewhere better than here.

940
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:09,661
Abandon all hope.

941
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,037
Welcome to hell!

Why don't we do a team dinner tonight?

keep your core engaged!

Good, but don't lift your head first.

954
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,019
Okay!

You see that client there doing squats?

961
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:54,747
[trainer]
She has a wedding coming up soon.

962
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:57,375
Do women try and bulk up
before their wedding?

963
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,751
It's her ex-husband's wedding.

964
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,587
[trainer] He's getting remarried
on a cruise ship,

965
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,714
-and he hasn't been paying child support.
-[woman grunts]

966
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,133
She wants to toss him overboard
on his wedding day.

968
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:08,052
As for that older gentleman...

his daughter is pregnant.

970
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,516
He started working out
because he wants to be able to lift

971
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,518
his grandkid
until they start elementary school.

972
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:17,353
[groans]

973
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:18,813
You should set a goal.

974
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,356
Like becoming stronger.

975
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,901
So that you can lift your girlfriend
in a bridal carry once you're married.

976
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:26,904
Bridal carry?

977
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,034
Although, it'd be faster
for you to have a girlfriend

978
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:31,951
who's light as air.

979
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:35,747
And invisible like air too.

980
00:48:36,873 --> 00:48:39,083
What was that?
What did you just say to me?

981
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,835
[groans, pants]

982
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,170
[detective] As you know,

983
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,672
defamation and libel
are two different crimes,

984
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:46,758
and libel carries a harsher sentence.

985
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,761
But these comments, they're defamation.

986
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,388
Then he won't go to jail?

987
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:53,389
No.

988
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,310
Right here. Chapter 51.

989
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,687
He's a real piece of work, this guy, huh?

990
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,397
Insulting your folks.

991
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,815
Okay, what about that comment?

992
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,776
It's libel, but the thing with libel is

993
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,904
the punishment depends on
whether the statement is true,

994
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:11,616
which is why I contacted you
in order to confirm its veracity directly.

995
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:12,742
By chance...

996
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:14,577

I got an apology letter from him.

1001
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,515
What should I do with it?

1002
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,016
Well, why don't you read it over?

1003
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,601
Then do what you want with it.

1004
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,229
Oh, wow, nice handwriting.

1005
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,648
Did his lawyer write this?

[Gyu-hyun groans] Yeo Ha-jun.

1007
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,448
I distinctly told him
I'd be at the police station

1008
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:54,367
to submit a petition. [sucks teeth]

1009
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,119
What's even the point of a secretary?

[sighs]

1018
00:50:19,851 --> 00:50:20,977
What do you think you're doing?

1019
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,895
You think by handwriting an apology

1020
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,898
that I'll just forgive you
for sending me a death wish?

1021
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,275
A death wish? You think that...

1022
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,531
My comments weren't that malicious.

1023
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:34,782
They weren't?

1024
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,201
So you meant for them
to make me feel like shit,

1025
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:39,078
but not to make me
wanna slit my wrists, is that it?

1026
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:41,289
And now I get to feel like garbage,

1027
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,624
exactly as you intended,
but I also have to forgive you?

1028
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,587
Don't send me any more letters.

1029
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:50,965
'Cause I'll never forgive you or settle.

1030
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:55,470
Do whatever you want.

1031
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,434
I don't need you to forgive me or settle.

1032
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,770
But still, my apology...

1033
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,688
I meant every word.

1034
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,232
I truly regret what I've done...

1035
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:11,778
and I genuinely... want to apologize.

1036
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,155
"Genuinely"?

1037
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:18,034
What can I do to make you believe me?

1038
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:20,119
If there's a way,
whatever it is, I'll do it right now.

1039
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:21,204
Kill yourself.

1040
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,665
-What?
-I said kill yourself!

1041
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:27,960
That's going way too far.

1042
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:31,130
[tearfully] You said that to me
in more than 100 different comments.

1043
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:34,217
I was forced to think more than 100 times

1044
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,760
about whether I deserved to die or not.

1045
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:39,096
So now you think about it.

1046
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,058
Whether or not you deserve to die.

to Hae-yeong last night?

I'll call her again.
She might've slept in.

We're investigating

You reported her for workplace harassment?

Did she do something to you?

1274
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:10,657
Why would you report her?

1275

I heard the whole thing.

1276
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,954
If you look at the contents of the report,
Team Leader Son Hae-yeong

1277
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:18,665
said to new hire Kim Ji-uk
yesterday evening

1278
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:20,834
that if an employee eats
breakfast at work,

1279
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,794
it makes the team leader look incompetent.

1280
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,422
That if a new employee's pants...

...aren't pressed,

1283
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:31,386
that it would appear
that the team leader is inadequate.

1284
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:34,264
[inquirer 1] And even if a new employee
makes a mistake...

1285
01:05:34,348 --> 01:05:36,016
[inquirer 2]
New employees all make mistakes!

1286

Isn't that expected?

Team Leader Son,

1288
01:05:39,061 --> 01:05:42,022
when you were a new hire,
didn't you ever make a mistake?

1289
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:44,566
I'm really sorry.

1290

[inquirer 1] And Kim Ji-uk

1291
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:50,405
is a ticking time bomb
that could explode any...

1292
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,201
Clearly, this is textbook workplace abuse!

This entire report is a textbook case.

You were upset, yeah?

1295

Hearing all of that.

1296
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:02,918
