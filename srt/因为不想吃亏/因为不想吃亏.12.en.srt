I'll need to have that information.

Once it's business hours,
you can go to the Administration Center...

You're the chief mourner?

Yes.

45
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,162
Could you list the chief mourners' names?

Sure. There's, um...

I'd like the best one you have.

54
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,237
You'll also need to choose a shroud.

00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,180
I brought
some of Auntie's favorite smokes.

92

What do you mean? Mom didn't smoke.

You had no idea.

00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,811
Auntie was quite the smoker.

95
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,146
I promised her
I would take her secret to the grave.

not to hers, nerd.

[Min-guk] Hey, Hae-yeong,
you heard this one?

106
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,381
In high school,
Auntie once duked it out with my bully.

107
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,383
-[men chuckling]
-Duked it out?

108
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,551
A bully?

109
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,470
Yeah, there was a bully
who thought I was a waste of space,

110
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,473
and once Auntie found out,
she called him up and challenged him.

111
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,474
[laughter]

112
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,059
So then what happened?

113
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:16,770
[Min-guk] Well, what do you think?
You know what Auntie was like.

114
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:17,980
So, he got scared,

115
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,232
and he was kinda...
crouching down like this,

116
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,442
{\an8}and Auntie didn't even put her guard up,
she was just like,

117
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,569
"Bring it on.

118
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,237
-Hey, come at me! Let's go!"
-[all laugh]

119
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,321
No way she did.

120
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,157
[Min-guk] I'm telling you, it's the truth.

121
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,325
-[man 3] Dude, you're making that up.
-[Min-guk] It's true, I swear to God!

122
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,577
She'd get like that sometimes.

123
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,412
-[woman 1] Yeah, she'd get so intense.
-[Min-guk] Hey, let's eat. Come on.

124
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,122
I'm sorry for your loss.

Just the first day.

129
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,189
Looks like she lived a meaningful life.

130
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,444
-[Woo-jae] Right.
-[Gi-un] Did you know her mom at all?

131
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,362
From the looks of things, so have you.

132
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,698
A lot of the guests here are yours.

133
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,619
I've given money for the happy times,

134
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,495
but I'll always show up for the sad ones.

135
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,957
Show up for those
who show up for you, right?

136
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,211
[Hui-seong chuckles]

137
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,505
How are you feeling, Hui-seong?

138
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,632
Mm.

139
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,050
When will your boyfriend be here?

140
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,095
He won't be here.

141
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,766
I'm the one who told him not to come,
so don't bad-mouth him.

142
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,142
How come?

143
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,685
We ended things.

144
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,687
-Huh?
-What?

145
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,272
I was the one who broke up with him.

146
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,441
Things weren't feeling right.

147
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,738
[Hae-yeong] Good for you.

148
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,367
You had no interest in marriage, or a kid.

149
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,828
I'll still...

150
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,373
have the kid.

[gentle music playing]

154
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,343
[Hui-seong] I want a life that goes on,
like Mom's.

155
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,852
She might have passed away, but...

156
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,816
I'm looking at her.

157
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,528
She's here in your face,

158
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,322
your personality,

159
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,659
even in how you talk. [chuckles]

161
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,209
Our mom will never die. [chuckles]

162
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,086
Still though...

163
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,588
[Min-guk] There's no way, no way!

164
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,008
Come smoke just one!

165
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,427
-They're six-milligram tar decaffeinated!
-[Hae-yeong groans]

166
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,512
Come on! Stop drinking and go home!

167
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,433
Nope! I will stay here
till Auntie is cleaned and shrouded.

168
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,600
[man 3 chuckles]

169
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,644
Hae-yeong, we'll all come back
in the morning.

170
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:03,979
-[man 3] Don't try and stop me!
-[woman 1] All right.

171
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,022
Go on!

172

00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:36,553
[Ji-uk] Ma'am.

178
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,396
You had a fake wedding and a fake husband,

179
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,731
and now chief mourners?

180
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,069
CHIEF MOURNERS: SON HAE-YEONG,

181
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,528
YANG DONG-SEOK,
WOO JI-WON, JANG MIN-GUK...

182
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,613
[Hae-yeong] <i>Mom.</i>

183
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,242
<i>I thought
you were always losing out in life.</i>

184
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,703
<i>Guess I was wrong.</i>

185
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,414
<i>Look at how many kids you have.</i>

186
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,666
...CHA HUI-SEONG,
NAM JA-YEON, KIM JI-UK

187
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,085
I'm the youngest son.

188
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,170
[gentle music playing]

189
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,839
I didn't want to list you
as Kim Ji-uk, the son-in-law.

190
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,051
Because...

191
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,764
since before we met, you've been her son.

192
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,352
Thank you, Ji-uk,

193
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,063
for being by Mom's side.

194
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,692
I appreciate you saying that.

195
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,494
From now on,
I'm never going to deceive you ever again.

196
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,123
I swear it to you.

197
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,099
{\an8}FINALE

198
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,232
{\an8}[Hae-yeong] Hello, Dad.

199
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,693
{\an8}Mom is here.

200
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,614
{\an8}It's a bit too soon, isn't it?

201
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,700
{\an8}SON MYUNG-SOO, LEE EUN-OK

202
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,952
{\an8}[Hae-yeong]
Now be nice to each other, okay?

203
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,040
{\an8}This is your first time here, right?

204
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,045
{\an8}Dad must be glad you're here now.

205
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,756
Let's visit more often.

206
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,969
[breathes shakily, sobs softly]

207
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,806
Oh...

208
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:49,311
Now Mom can...
be at rest in this beautiful spot,

209
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,520
right beside our dad.

210
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,439
[deep breath]

211
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,523
She also has a friend.

212
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,026
There.

213
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,362
{\an8}KIM GEUM-DUK

214
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,657
[sentimental music playing]

215
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,284
And so she does.

216
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,703
{\an8}[Ji-uk] Mom picked this place...

217
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,624
when Grandma... passed away.

218
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,379
[Hui-seong] Mom had
her post-retirement life all figured out.

219
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,967
Rather... I guess
her plan for the afterlife.

220
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,344
Keep things interesting.

221
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,428
Had I been Mom's age,

222
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:25,388
I don't think
that we would've been friends.

223
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,184
She and I were very different.

224
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,604
We should get Mom's opinion.

225
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,608
She probably wouldn't have
been friends with you either.

226
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:38,193
-[Hui-seong snickers]
-Hmm.

227
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,486
Oh, yeah?

228
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,112
{\an8}LEE EUN-OK

229
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,990
That must be how you ended up family.

230
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,828
Your two souls,

231
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:54,209
they knew they wanted to love each other,
and couldn't have done it as peers.

232
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,052
[Ji-uk]
<i>I'm sorry for not keeping my promise.</i>

233
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,596
<i>But I will stay by her side.</i>

234
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,643
<i>I won't ever... let go of her hand.</i>

235
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,951
[Ji-uk] I made a promise to your mom

236
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,788
that I would... never let you go.

237
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,875
Grandma had one last wish.

238
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,878
For the sake of my grandmother
who raised me,

239
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,589
I'll stay alone.

240
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,090
Ma'am, I kept it a secret

241
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,300
because I promised Mom
that I wouldn't tell you.

242
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,801
But then why disappear?

243
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,262
Back then, I was worried
I wouldn't keep the promise...

244
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,264
that I made to Mom.

245
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,645
[Hae-yeong] Ji-uk.

246
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,027
Let go of the promises you've held.

247
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,573
You're free now, Ji-uk.

248
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,368
There are no promises to keep,

249
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,246
there is no one to protect.

250
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,999
Just worry about you.

251
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,128
What's that supposed to mean?

252
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,713
You've lived your life...

253
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:24,341
honoring your grandmother.

254
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,177
You've lived for your mom and mine.

255
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:31,056
You held back seeing your mom
even when you miss her.

256
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,809
You held back feelings for me.

257
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:39,981
And from now on,

258
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,442
what'll you hold back

259
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,695
in the name of keeping me safe,

260
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,740
in order to keep promises that you made?

261
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:49,658
[Ji-uk] That...

262
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,202
is what you do when you lo...

263
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,620
[Hae-yeong] I'm sorry, but...

264
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,248
I don't want you
to feel responsible for me.

265
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,127
Or be the reason
for your entire existence.

266
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,838
It's just...

267
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,886
too much to ask, Ji-uk.

268
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,102
It's way too heavy.

269
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,689
[somber music playing]

270
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:25,944
[Hae-yeong] So...

271
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,366
[sniffles]

272
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,617
[Hae-yeong] Ji-uk...

273
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,705
help me.

274
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,710
I want you to protect me,

275
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,212
one last time...

276
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,093
so I can be me.

277
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,935
[somber music continues]

278
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,914
[shaky breathing]

279
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,550
Huh? Why is she alone?

280
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,136
[Ja-yeon] Hae-yeong!

281
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,346
Hae-yeong!

282
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,538
[somber music continues]

283
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,749

{\an8}KIM GEUM-DUK

285
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,655
[Ja-yeon] You could've waited a bit,
you know.

286
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,198
Bro...

287
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:42,038
Ji-uk was... hurting too,
saying goodbye to her.

288
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,959
If I hadn't pulled the trigger now...

289
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,713
I never would've done it, so...

290
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,677
I thought that I would keep wanting...

291
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,264
his support and to rely on him.

292
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,849
Then you can let those things happen.

293
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,518
Why do you always
have to make things so complicated?

294
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,103
And he didn't try to stop you?

295
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,730
He just agreed with the breakup?

296
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,277
You know when kids throw a tantrum?

297
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,654
Screaming and crying?

298
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,489
Those kids...

299
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,410
know that no matter what they say...

300
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,914
or how they act...

301
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:33,339
they know that they won't... be abandoned.

302
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,052
And Ji-uk just...

303
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,433
[sniffles]

304
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,102

Okay, children!

This is the president of Kkulbee

It'll be soccer this time.
No more secret dodgeball.

[Woo-jae] Thank you for having us.

343
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,063
[Ms. Gong] Yeah, he looks pretty proud
of stealing your idea.

344
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,064
All that strutting around.

345
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,066
Wait, you heard that?

346
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,151
[chuckles] Yeah, you basically yelled it!

347
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,905
Girl, you are practically a saint though,
you know that?

348
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:29,033
In your place,
boy, I'd pray for him to fail.

349
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,119
And what's more,
I wouldn't have come to help.

350
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,621
It might be messed up and unfair,

351
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,998
but to succeed in corporate hell,

352
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,959

00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,671
...and take Kkulbee out of commission.

531
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:14,136
[Ha-jun] I want to quit too,
and just code for a living.

532
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,054
[employee] Oh, well done!

534
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,016
Secretary... Uh...

535
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,896
Or rather... Developer Yeo.

536
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,776
You know the contest that I won?

537
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,861
That idea... That was nothing.

538
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:33,447
I have an even better business idea.

539
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,698

540
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:36,617
So?

541
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,868
Coding...

542
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,328
will only be...

543
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,662
your main task.

546
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,130

-And nothing more!

{\an8}I said
I didn't want secretary work anymore.

550
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,723
Did I say that I wanted both?

551
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,433
Code and be a secretary?

552
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:03,977
Secretary Yeo,

553
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:06,313
{\an8}you have a lot of friends
who are working in start-ups.

554

-[sighs]
-Haven't they told you?

555
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,568
This is how it is at the start.
Once we get investors...

Right. Investors...

561
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:21,870
When will they come?

562
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,872
Where will you find them?
How will you make them invest?

563
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,709
{\an8}Soon, by someone, and willingly.

Instead of biding our time,

567
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,388
why don't we ask Bok-you for help,
just this once.

568
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:42,683
{\an8}Secretary Yeo! Who are we?

Hello, Mr. Bok, welcome.

574

Have my parents arrived already?

575
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,077
What?

576

Let's get this over with.

581
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,898
Who are you? You know me?

582
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:33,317
Bok Gyu-hyun,
president of Kkulbee Education.

583
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:34,860
I'm Eom Ji-hye...

584

the younger sister of Eom So-hye,

585
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:41,783
head of the art gallery.

586
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,328
Director Eom's younger sister?

587
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,413
You're the child
who came out of that affair.

588
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,250
Hmph.

589
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,461
Kids out of wedlock are quite common now.

590
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,341
There's one in your family too.

591
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,009
Who... Who told you that?

592
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,218
[soft chuckle]

593
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:02,930
That's why the two of us
are on an arranged blind date.

594
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:05,515
Scandal and scandal.

595
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,850
Date?

596
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,477
Mm-hmm.

597
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:12,814
A date?

598
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,234
Mm. Thank you very much.

599
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,446
Sorry for setting this up last-minute.

600
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,906
It's all right.

601
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,033
I had some news to deliver...

602
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,534
and wanted to introduce our intern.

603
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:25,827
Ah!

604
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,081
Hello, I'm Yeon Bo-ra.

605
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,333
[softly] Uh, nice to meet you, miss.

606
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,418
I'm Min Ju-won.

607
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,962
Here's to working together.

608
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,296
Hmm? Sorry?

609
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,547
Uh...

610
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,008
I'm a fan of yours. [shy chuckle]

[awkward laugh]

613
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,224
I see.

614
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:51,228
So they arranged this blind date for us...
without asking our permission?

615
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,480
-[Ji-hye] Mm-hmm.
-[Gyu-hyun sighs]

616
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,983
[Ji-hye] Mm...

617
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:59,528
You only need to know
three things about me.

618
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:03,490
I have zero interest, at all,
in getting married is one.

619
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,492
I have zero interest, at all,

620
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,619
in getting married to you
is the second one.

621
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,874
[comical music playing]

622
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,376
The third one would be?

623
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,961
[gasps]

624
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,671
Just those two things.

625
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,757
-[chuckles]
-[Gyu-hyun] Ah... [awkward chuckle]

626
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,468
[mutters] How rude can she get?

627
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,972
A lecture at a college? Alone?

628
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,058
You know that web novels
and webtoons are something

629
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,643
they're renowned for, right?

630
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:35,564
They've been begging us since last year
for you to give a guest lecture there...

631
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:39,401
and I told them I was waiting
for your novel to be completed.

632
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,446
Even though you don't do
much out in the public, I...

Hello, Professor. Yes.

638
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,752
Uh... I'm gonna run to the bathroom.

639
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,170
Ah, okay.

Mm. Thank you.

646

[Gyu-hyun] Uh... excuse me,
why'd you take the flowers?

647
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:39,044
-They weren't for you, you know?
-[Ji-hye chuckles softly]

648
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,713
The third thing you should know

649
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:44,216
is I like flowers a hell of a lot.

650
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,094

This is the first time
they've done this to you, huh?

656

Tell your mother
the vibe at the blind date was...

657

You had the nerve to cheat on me?

You had nothing going on in your life,

664

And now you're two-timing me?

Terrible, I'm sure.

she would argue that it was red.

What?

Why didn't you say something
if you already knew that?

Since long ago...

00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,774
dating a rich guy, disapproving parents,
being forced into blind dates,

688
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:26,568
these are all classic plot points.

689

We love a good cliché, you know?

690

00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:06,189
Those two people,
are they the clients you meant?

881
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,315
Yeah.

882
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,902
Do you... know him by any chance?

883
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:12,904
Why?

884
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,864
It's just that the young lady liked it,

885
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,075
but he said he would never buy this house.

886
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:21,579
[sentimental music playing]

887
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:31,839
[woman] Ji-uk, what's wrong?

888
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,549
You look upset.

889
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:37,553
I think...

890
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:42,183
I saw too many abandoned houses
as I passed by.

891
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:04,205
Hae-yeong, can you not sleep?

892
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,086
Why?

893
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,588
Is it 'cause you couldn't sell the house?

894
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,967
You know, I could buy it...

895
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,093
Ja-yeon!

896
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:19,303
I have a meeting later. With an investor.

897
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,514
I'm gonna get their money.

898
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:23,391
Hmm.

899
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,977
Why are you up at this hour?

900
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,314
[whines] My lecture's this afternoon.

901
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,569
Ah! Don't be scared!

902
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:38,114
Just... look in the crowd
and pick one person.

903
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:40,491
Give them your lecture. You got it?

904
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,369
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

905
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:45,371

906
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:51,002

911
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:15,484
Secretary.

912
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,695
Are we doing what's best?

913
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,947
Secretary? Don't think so.

914
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:21,324
It's Principal Developer.

915
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,827
Now that Kkulbee's
at the top of the industry,

916
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:27,038
they'll be looking
at aggressive expansion.

917
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,082
Which means
they'll be looking for where to invest.

918
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,334
God.

919
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,461
I can't even bear to look at this place.

920
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,255
After what I went through at this company?

921
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:39,008
President, you and I will have to bear it.

922
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:41,010
Let's go.

923
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:43,596
Bok-you is... about to be less rich.

924
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,057
Okay.

We have an element

936
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,764
The element is communication.

937

Just write on this page
with our proprietary AI pen...

938
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,774
It connects to your phone

Hmm!

945
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:58,838
And what if I decide not to...
invest in it, hmm?

946
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,258
Think of Ja-yeon.

947
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,260
Know why you should?

948
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:08,556
Because... it'd be a "giant" help.

949
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:09,682

-Okay, Ja-yeon.
-[Ja-yeon] How do I do it?

1061
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,163
-Look through the middle.
-Huh?

-Look. Over there.
-Just ride the waves.

1069
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,517
So pretty.

[camera shutter clicking]

1071
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,273
Wow.

1072
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:04,620
Ah! Great night.

1073
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:06,663
It was great.

1074
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:11,835
-Ja-yeon.
-Yes?

1075
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:15,964
We... should take another picture here.

1076
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:17,716
Okay.

1077
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,138
One, two, three.

[Gyu-hyun] Ah...

1083
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:35,359
But I wanna make sure
we get the whole scene in.

1084
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:39,363
Just one moment.

1085
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:41,073

01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:10,727
I wanted us... to each wear couple rings.

1092
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:14,898
Do you like it?

1093
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:18,110
Yes.

1094
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:21,155
Will you wear it?

[joyful music playing]

1096
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,473
[Gyu-hyun] Our next chapter...

1097
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:51,852
is going to be...
even better than the first.

1098
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,105
I already couldn't be happier.

1099
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,692
Go on.

1112
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:34,848
So, are you ready to pay, ma'am?

Are you crying?

1118
01:05:58,205 --> 01:05:59,581
Why are you crying?

1119
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:03,460
This store went out of business.

1120
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,588
Where am I gonna get
my cigarettes and booze?

1121

[whimpers]

1122
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:15,430

loyal patron!

1124
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,770
I have some booze left.

1125
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:22,938
You can have it.

[Hae-yeong sobbing]

1127
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:28,443
Oh, Ji-uk, yes. You go on home.

[manager sighs] Thanks so much for coming.

1129
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:35,742
I'll definitely attend this.

Oh, ma'am.

1133
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,342
Are you still smoking?

1134
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:56,179
You must've run out of jellies.

1135
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:57,764
Aren't you getting married?

1136
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:00,058
What?

1137
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,104
I heard you came back to Korea
for the wedding.

1138
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:07,983
Ah...

1139
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:12,988
Your girlfriend's beautiful.

1140
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,159
Ah.

1141
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,828
I was at Mom's country house.

1142
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,039
I debated saying hi...

1143
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,001
and I'm glad I didn't.

1144
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:29,087
Congrats.

1145
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,091
Is that all?

1146
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:36,344
You just heard I'm getting married.

1148
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:43,852
Want cash?

[Hae-yeong chuckles]

1150
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:48,023
Well, it'd be weird for me
to be at the wedding.

1151
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,650
I'll give it to Gi-un, and...

1152
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:53,945
Oh, that might be weird too.

1153
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:56,740
Good vibes then.
That's what I'll send.

1154
01:07:57,908 --> 01:07:59,910
Well, I don't need good vibes.

1155
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:11,797
I'll go now.

1156
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,600
[sentimental music playing]

1157
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:25,185
Ji-uk.

1158
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:28,647
The person who gave me my first cigarette,

1159
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,649
I remembered who it was.

1160
01:08:31,525 --> 01:08:32,400
What?

1161
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:34,194
A year after my dad died...

1162
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:37,864
I got my first-ever cigarettes,

1163
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,450
although, I didn't get a lighter.

1164
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:45,080
I figured I'd ask a passerby
to see if they had a light,

1165
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:48,041
and if they did, I would smoke it.

1166
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:50,752
And if not, I wouldn't.

1167
01:08:54,256 --> 01:08:55,340
[Hae-yeong] Hey.

1168
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:57,676
You got a light?

1169
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,930
[smacks lips] Never mind if you don't.

1170
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:05,809
Guess you started smoking young,

1171
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,018
half-pint.

1172
01:09:17,863 --> 01:09:19,030
[Hae-yeong] <i>You know what?</i>

1173
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:22,576

who gave you your first cigarette.</i>

[breathes heavily]

1179
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:01,740
Why would you tell me that?

1180
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:04,618
Why'd you tell a man
who's about to get married

1181
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,745
that he's the one
who gave you your first cigarette?

1182
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:08,830
I saw you...

1183
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:11,291
and felt like it.

1184
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:13,335
That means you won't be able to forget me.

1185
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:17,005
You're saying that you missed me.

1186
01:10:19,466 --> 01:10:20,425
That letting me go...

1187
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:24,471
is something that you regret.

1188
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,599
[sentimental music playing]

1189
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:31,645
I have missed you...

1190
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:34,439
and I couldn't forget you.

1191
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,027
I don't regret letting you go though.

1192
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:42,530
Why not?

1193
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:44,741
Ji-uk.

1194
01:10:46,952 --> 01:10:48,870
How was your time abroad?

1195
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:51,247
How did it feel...

1196
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:54,668
not having to protect anyone
or keep any promises?

1197
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:59,839
It was pleasant.

1198
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:04,177
That's great.

1199
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:05,887
[Ji-uk] But...

1200
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,431
no bed I encountered...

1201
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:12,602
was as pleasant as the one
that you had bought for me.

1202
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,316
I really missed it.

1203
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:22,028
Ji-uk.

1204
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:25,865
[sighs] You shouldn't be doing this.

1205
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:26,908
Ah.

1206
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,452
Here.

1207
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:31,162
I want to give you this.

1208
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:34,124
Today's your birthday, right?

1209
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:42,966
Sarah's pretty, isn't she?

1210
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:46,011
She takes after my mother. [hiccups]

1211
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:49,389
Sarah's dad and I...

1212
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,391
No, it was, uh...

1213
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:53,268
my stepfather.

1214
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,520
He and I got close.

1215
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:58,690
So he asked me
to look for a house for him,

1216
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:01,901
and for me to attend
a relative's wedding on his behalf.

1217
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,740
It's not my wedding.

1218
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:12,787
I came back
to where I left my heart behind.

1219
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:15,832

01:12:20,128 --> 01:12:21,254
So just...

1222
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,593
bear with me a little, ma'am.

1223
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:29,137
I'm not that heavy.

1224
01:12:34,893 --> 01:12:35,769
[Hae-yeong] Ji-uk.

1225
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,771
I'm not heavy.

1226
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:39,898
[soft chuckle]

1227
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:42,067
Are you drunk?

1228
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:43,485
'Course not.

1229
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:46,446
I'm not heavy at all.

1230
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:48,740
I'm not heavy.

1231
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,036
You are though! [laughs]

1232
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,746
[Ji-uk] Oh, hey, there it is.

1233

-Ow!
-[Ji-uk moaning]

1236
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:04,881
So warm and toasty.

1237
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:08,510
Hmm.

1238
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:39,290
[door opens]

1239
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:41,918
[sentimental music continues]

1240
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:53,221
[music fades]

1241
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:01,062
Ji-uk?

1242
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,527
[unsettling music playing]

1243
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:10,155

[shaky breathing]

1245
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,420

Hey!

01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:45,481
Where did you go?

1250
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:47,192
For this.

1251
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:48,860
To buy some seaweed soup.

1252
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:51,362
I thought
you might not have had it yesterday.

1253
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:52,906
[sighs]

1254
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,700
I thought that you were really gone.

1255
01:14:57,577 --> 01:14:59,162
What, and stole the ring?

1256
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,164
The ring?

I love you.
