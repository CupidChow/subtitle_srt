[Eun-ok] Oh, hi there.

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,198
You must be Ji-uk, right?
Geum-duk's grandson.

00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,115
Yes.

10
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:14,992
[chuckles] I'm Eun-ok.

11
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,537
Hmm... You can call me
"Auntie, Mom, Eun-ok" or "Mrs. Lee".

12
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:19,538
Whichever you prefer.

13
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:20,706
Just not "Grandma".

Grandma...

15
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:24,668
Uh...

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,129
No, I mean my grandma. Geum-duk.

that this was an orphanage.

Ah, goodness sake.

20
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,847
[clicks tongue]
I told her this wasn't an orphanage.

21
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,100
And why does she call you that?
You're not an orphan.

22
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,686

[Eun-ok] Welcome home, son.

00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,337
Thank you for coming here.

Everything around the house

now that you're here. [chuckles]

33
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,268
Oh, by the way,

34
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,271
Ji-uk, can you keep a secret at all?

35
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:31,318
-I'm pretty good... at keeping promises.
-Mm.

36
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,613
Then, um, can you promise me something?

37
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,490
What is it?

38
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,619
I have a daughter.
Her name is Son Hae-yeong.

39
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,498
[chuckles] She can never know about this,
no matter what.

40
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,333
The fact that you're staying here.

41
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:47,668
Uh...

42
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,963
doesn't she... live with you?

43
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,382
Mm...

44
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,634
If I'm putting you
in a difficult position,

45
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:57,219
-then...
-She probably won't come by.

46
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,933
But still, just in case she does...

47
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,607
you won't let her catch you, right?

48
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:12,276
Yeah.

49
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:14,778
That's a promise, okay?

50
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:17,781

You lived here before?

55
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,092
Yes.

56
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,220
You were my mom's foster kid?

57
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,848
Yes.

58
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,392
Then did you know...

59
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,773
who I was then?

60
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,279
Yes.

61
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,037
I can explain.

[somber music playing]

63
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,336
Get lost.

64
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:15,881
Ma'am.

65
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,384
Get out of here, you disgust me.

66
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,141
-I'm sorry.
-What, are you deaf?

67
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,935
I said get out.

68
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,021
Can't you...

69
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,359
just be mad instead?

70
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,821
If you tell me to get lost...

71
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,031
where do I go then?

72
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,868
Then I'll just leave.

73
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,540
Ma'am, I kept it a secret
because I promised Mom

74
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,668
that I wouldn't tell you...
I mean, tell her daughter...

75
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,420
[sighs]

76
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,423
...that I was her foster child
no matter what.

77
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,135
Back then, I had no idea
I'd somehow end up with you.

78
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,596
I can understand why you're mad at me,
but she must've had her reasons.

79
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,890
[Hae-yeong sighs] "Had her reasons"?

80
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,439
How much of a selfish, evil bitch
must I actually be...

81
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,857
that you'd keep this a secret?

82
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,316
That's not what I meant.

83
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,527
But do you know
who's really the selfish one?

84
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,237
It's Mom.

85
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:22,573
-My mom.
-Ma'am.

86
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,199
I never agreed to any of it.

she should've given to me.

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,708
Throughout my entire childhood,
I must've said it 100 times to her.

90

But she never listened, not even once.

91

92
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,594

94
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,601
Still, I guess Mom didn't regret a thing.

What, she didn't tell you about that?

Mm-mm. In my house,
we don't speak about my dad.

115
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,820
Forget it.

Yeah.

I'm relieved.

121
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,229
That means Mom wasn't living
in this house all alone.

122
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,315
I'm so relieved.

123
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,363
Hae-yeong feels that way too.

124
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,408
She'll just need some time to realize it.

Uh, sir, I'm so sorry...
but can we head back?

127
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,093
[driver] I thought you were going to Paju?

128
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,263
Well, it's too late.

129
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,850
Even if I saw her now...

130
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,728
I don't think
I'll get an answer out of her.

[Ha-jun] Sorry I'm late.
Let me go say hi to our host.

-Okay.

I can BYOB here, right?

142
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,553
No, get out.

143
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,139
Not only am I providing the venue
for this high school reunion,

144
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,100
I'm even donating my talent by cooking.

145
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,477

a few bottles of booze while you're here...

I gotta say this changes things.

-[chuckles]
-Aw, Ha-jun.

149
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,363
Guess you're a pretty big deal

150
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,116
now that you're the whipping boy
to some CEO.

151
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,243
Go sit. I'll fetch some glasses.

152
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,328

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,498

[phone camera clicks]

156
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,547
I actually visited Garam High recently.

157
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,506
With who?

158
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,341
-Nam Ja...
-[friend 3] Oh, that guy?

159
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:52,926
Why that asshole?

160
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,095
No, Nam Ja-yeon.

161
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,098
She was a liberal arts kid,
but she transferred before third year.

162
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,392
-You remember her?
-Nam Ja-yeon?

163
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,269
Who was Ja-yeon again?

164
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,647
She's that girl, right?
Another family took her in?

165
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:08,317
[friend 1] It's not an orphanage.
What's it called again?

166
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,776
The term is foster care.

167
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,653
-Oh, you're right.
-[awkward chuckle]

168
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,239
Hey, now I definitely remember.

169
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,534
You know, years ago, I heard
there was a murder at that foster home.

170
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,286
A what?

171
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,039
Oh, well,
so the culprit's wife had run away,

172
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,291
and his daughter had been living
in that foster home.

173
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,001
The guy came looking for his daughter

174
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,045
and then went crazy
asking where her mom was.

175
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,588
That's Nam Ja-yeon, right?

176
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,631
[friend 1]
And that's why she switched schools.

177
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:32,549
When was that?

178
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,135
During our third year.
I remember it like it was yesterday.

179
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,095

Hey, if it happened then,
that's after she transferred.

181

Anywho, how could she keep living
in the house where her dad killed someone?

182

[friend 1] Tsk... Ah.

183
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,232
So, anyway, bro, is Nam Ja-yeon pretty?

Well, bro...

186

194

Didn't you miss me?

-Because I...

[gentle music playing]

198
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,786
I'm sorry.

199
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,623
Calling to blame you for what happened...

200
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,709
All those horrible things I said to you.

201
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,587
I think I'll regret it
until the day I die.

202
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,464
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,217
Can you forgive me, Ja-yeon?

204
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,301
No.

205
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,720
No, it's all my fault.

206
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,849
I'm the reason Mr. Son is dead.

207
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,352
You're not. That's ridiculous.

208
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,771
You're a victim as well.

209
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,233
I wasn't in my right mind back then.

210
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,152
It didn't matter who...

211
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,821
I was just looking
for someone to blame, okay?

212
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,866
It wasn't your fault.

213
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,452
No, it was.

214
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,455
All of it.

215
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,668

Please forgive me.

220

[Eun-ok] Ja-yeon, listen.

221
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,396
Your old ma, she's not doing well.

222
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,148
What?

223
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,735
I have a disease that makes me forget.

224
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,364
Which means...
all the bad memories will disappear.

225
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,992
Then only the good ones will remain.

226
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:06,661
Ma...

227
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,166
And then, it won't matter anymore.

228
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,003
Nobody will know
that bastard was looking for you, Ja-yeon.

229
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,172
I didn't tell a soul.

233
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,266
that you, Ja-yeon...

234
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,395
would never become

it never happened, right?

239

It never happened.

240
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,124
So just forget about it, all right?

241
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,209
Forget it.

242
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,547

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,577
Lucifer, you too?

358
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,120
I called her 17 times.

359
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,040
I called her 29.

360
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,961
Ugh.

361
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,629
That's way too much!

362
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:33,464
More than ten... No...

363
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,426
even if it was five calls,
it's still creepy.

364
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,177
[dramatic sting]

365
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,054
Get out of here, you disgust me.

366
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,933
[sighs] Want my opinion?
You've reached the end.

367
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:44,934
-It's over for both of you.
-[dramatic sting]

368
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,477
This is our happy ending.

369
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:50,023
Say the words "end" and "ending" again,
and you'll be fired immediately.

370
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,192
The word "creep" is off-limits as well.

371
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,113
[animals snarling effect]

372
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,074
[light background music playing]

373
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,203
[deep inhale]

374
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,581
Lucifer,

375
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,126
what if you tried calling
Team Leader Son's mother?

376
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,711
[Ji-uk] I did, but...

377
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,760
[Gyu-hyun] Well, what if... maybe...

378
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,138
she's gone to where her father's buried?

379
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,726
So the one who died in that incident,

380
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,811
that was Team Leader Son's father?

381
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,397
What incident?

382
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,026
You didn't know?

383
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,988
Oh, I recently went
to a high school reunion

384
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,491
and saw a friend
who lived in that neighborhood.

385
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,534
What kind of incident was it?

386
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:48,289
[sighs] Well, Team Leader Son,
um, her parents...

387
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,042
you know they ran a foster home, right?

388
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,921
A foster kid's dad came
looking for his daughter...

389
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,508
and killed someone.

390
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,844
[pensive music playing]

391
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,180
[Hae-yeong]
<i>Still, I guess Mom didn't regret a thing.</i>

392
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,265
Even though Dad's dead because of her.

393
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:07,600
So how dare she...

394
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,560
[heavy exhale]

395
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,813
How dare she take you in after that?

396
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,648
[deep inhale]

397
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,234
So that's why... [sighs]

398
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:19,821
[sighs]

399
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,702
[gasps] President Bok, you call her.

400
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,455
Well, if you made the call, sir,
Team Leader Son would definitely answer.

401
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,250
Of course, she'd answer it, but...

402
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,127
Mr. President,
if you ask her where she is,

403
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,797
I'll call Ja-yeon for you
and find out if she's blocked your number.

404
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,508
-[sharp inhale]
-[comical music playing]

405
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:48,850
NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT TEAM
TEAM LEADER SON HAE-YEONG

406
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,853
[line ringing]

407
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,818
-[Hae-yeong] <i>This is Son Hae-yeong.</i>
-Oh!

408
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:00,820
<i>Hello?</i>

409
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:03,239
[whispers] Come on, say something to her.

410
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,117
Team Lead... Manager Son...

411
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,410
where are you right now?

412
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,245
[Hae-yeong]
I'm not in the office today, sir.

413
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,913
I took the day off.

414
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,207
[Gyu-hyun]
<i>And where did you go on your day off?</i>

415
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,251
I had some business to tend to
out of town.

416
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,963
{\an8}[whispers] Ask her what town?

417
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,090
{\an8}Where are you right now?

418
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,885
[whispers] What town? Where she is?

419
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,096
The provinces? Whereabouts?

420
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,723
[Hae-yeong] <i>Oh, I'm out in...</i>

421
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,435
Wait, why do you ask?

422
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,523
Because I remembered
all the different breads I got to eat

423
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,608
at your place the other day,

424
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,318
and wondered
which you'd bring back with you.

425
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,115
This region isn't famous for its bread,
but its walnut cookies.

426
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,366
Walnut cookies?

427
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,119
[gasps]

428
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,623
[Gyu-hyun] I'll see you tomorrow then.

429
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:54,749
Don't forget the cookies.

430
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,293
Of course, see you tomorrow, sir.

431
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,505
Is he crazy?

432
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,424
[annoyed groan] Ugh, what a pain!

433
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,678
Okay, awesome.

434
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,932
Now, Lucifer,
you call Ms. Yeon and ask her where...

435
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,518
Drink this. It's really good.

436
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,144

438
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,272
[Gyu-hyun] Lucifer!

439
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,273
Did he...

440
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,150
Secretary Yeo, fire him!

441
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,694
You want me to rehire then fire him again?

442
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:24,779
He doesn't work for you.

443
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,197
[sighs] Shit.

444
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:35,164
[sentimental music playing]

445
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:47,009

446
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,226
[sentimental music continues]

-[knocking on door]
-[soft gasp]

450
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,826
[Ja-yeon] Hui-seong, great timing.

451
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,579
The script for the audio drama is ready.
Want to go over it together?

452
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,208
Actually, that's what I'm here
to talk to you about.

453
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,212
I thought you should know
before I go and tell the company.

454
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,214
[deep inhale]

455
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,758
I'm sorry
but I have to back out of the project.

456
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,344
How come?

457
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,097
Min-ji, the writer...

458
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,850
she and Tae-hyeong broke up 'cause of me.

459
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:37,643
Out of guilt?

460
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,353
Or courtesy?

461
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,149
Besides, my morning sickness
is getting worse.

462
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,943
[light pensive music playing]

463
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:48,446
Then, are you saying...

464
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,826
Mm.

465
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,120
Tae-hyeong and I made the choice together.

466
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,207
I hope you support us.

467
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,646
I'll do all I can
to be there for you and Tae-hyeong.

468
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:33,783
But Hui-seong...

469
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,372
do you... believe?

470
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:42,708
In Tae-hyeong?

471
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,669
I mean in love.

472
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,422
Could anyone ever love me enough...

473
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,467
to look past the bad

474
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,178
and accept my faults?

475
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,141
Even if they did happen to learn...

476
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,686
about what I'm responsible for?

477
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,853
[Hui-seong] Ja-yeon.

478
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,607
Have you heard about
Schrödinger's cat experiment?

479
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,485
That thing in quantum mechanics
about whether...

480
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,988
the cat in the box is alive or dead?

481
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:15,616
Hmm... I know nothing about
quantum mechanics or what have you.

482
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:17,827
But...

483
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,830
what I do know is only someone
who believes that cat is alive

484
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:21,872
would open the box.

485
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,670
You'll only be able
to find someone like that

486
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,588
if you trust
that they're out there, Ja-yeon.

487
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,634
[phone buzzing]

488
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:37,972
Be right back.

489
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,351
HATER

490
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:47,273
[buzzing continues]

491
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,358
-[door closes]
-Yeah, I'm just leaving Ja-yeon's.

492
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:53,321
[soft chuckle] No need to wait.
I can get to the clinic by myself.

493
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,906
Besides, Baby,
what if you run into Hae-yeong?

494
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,409
Well, if I'm getting the crap
beat out of me no matter what,

495
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,411
better sooner rather than later, I guess.

496
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,413
-[door opens]
-[chuckles]

497
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,420
Uh, anyway,
I'll head over to the clinic later.

498
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,421
Mm.

499
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:11,964
See you there.

500
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,970
[ominous music playing]

501
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:35,488
What, you want to break up?

502
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,115
Even though you don't actually know
that it's your kid?

503
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,450
Min-ji...

504
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:40,451
[grunts]

505
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,787
[Producer Yun sighs]

506
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:46,123
That's it, keep going.

507
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,292
I bet you feel like
the white knight swooping in?

508
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:49,460
But don't kid yourself,

509
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,379
you're not doing this
because you love Hui-seong.

510
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:53,547
The only one you're in love with
is Tae-hyeong.

511
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,383
What a responsible guy you're being now.

512
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:58,135
You can hit me and insult me all you want,

513
00:27:58,219 --> 00:27:59,720
but don't psychoanalyze me.

514
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,472
I'll be the one to say how I feel, okay?

515
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,473
[scoffs]

516
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,435
-You've made up your mind?
-Mm.

517
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,645
[Min-ji scoffs]

518
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,522
Of course you're sure right now.

519
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,816
Since you can't see the kid yet.

520
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,235
But what about after they're born?

521
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,319
[disgusted groan]

522
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,155
"They don't really take after me,
do they?"

523
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,824
"No kid of mine would ever do that."

524
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:20,741
Cho Min-ji.

525
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,368
You don't think
that thought will occur to you?

526
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:26,247
I guarantee you there isn't a single man
on earth who wouldn't have that thought.

527
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,040
And by the way, Tae-hyeong...

528
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:34,672
you... have never been that special.

529
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,757
[pensive music playing]

530
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,431

533
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,774
[suspenseful music rising]

534
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,989
[both grunt]

535
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:45,326
Ma'am.

536
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,329
Are you okay?

537
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,831
What?

538
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:52,583
You know about this place?

539
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,711
-Oh, uh...
-Did you come here with Mom too?

540
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,130
[comical music playing]

541
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:00,424
Ow, my head.

542
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,349
If you wanna make a fire,
don't use wet wood.

543
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,934
It just makes a ton of smoke.

544
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:12,853
There's a place
that sells firewood nearby, so...

545
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:14,480
How did you know that I came here?

546
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,152
[sighs] It creeps me out.

547
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,157
I was worried about you.

548
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,327
If you aren't comfortable
with me being here...

549
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,455
then I'll go.

550
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:35,167
[sentimental music playing]

551
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,591
[Hae-yeong] Why is this place like this?

552
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:47,763
I thought she'd at least
have a diary lying around.

553
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,113
[Ji-uk] <i>She said she wanted
to get rid of everything</i>

554
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,990
<i>before she checked into the nursing home.</i>

555
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:09,201
<i>The things in this house have been in use
since her mother was around.</i>

556
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:12,037
So if she left them,
they'd just be a burden.

557
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,166
Why did Mom even come down here...

558
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,420
when she couldn't remember
anything anyway?

559
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,131
She'd been reading this book back then.

560
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:25,551
It said if the elderly move
somewhere they lived 20 years ago,

561
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,177
it slows down aging.

562
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:30,639
Mom thought that by living
in the home she grew up in,

563
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,519
her disease...
its progression might slow down.

564
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:39,148
While she was here,
Mom rewatched the TV shows

565
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,357
from when she was a kid,

566
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,735
and listened to old music too.

567
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,613
When I came to her...

568
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,741
the only reason she took me in

569
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:51,535
is 'cause my grandma asked her to.

570
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,746
And with Grandma...

571
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,373
you could never really tell her no.

572
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:57,958
So she didn't have a choice but to...

573
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:00,085
Does Mom still know who you are?

574
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,926
I'm sure she remembers
her last foster kid,

575
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,679
even if she forgot her own daughter.

576
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,560
I have something to show you.

577
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,915
The room, it should be nice and warm now.

578
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:39,625
Let's head in.

579
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,945
[Ji-uk] <i>Mom, who'd you say this baby was?</i>

580
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,407
[Eun-ok] <i>My little girl, Hae-yeong.</i>

581
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,909
[light pensive music playing]

582
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,619
<i>Hae-yeong.</i>

583
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:16,745
[soft chuckle]

584
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:20,999
I guess Mom liked me best
before I ever learned how to speak.

585
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:30,050
[Ji-uk] <i>Mom, who'd you say this baby was?</i>

586
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,429
[Eun-ok] <i>My little girl, Hae-yeong.</i>

587
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,805
[tapping on phone]

588
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:39,017
[Ji-uk] <i>Mom, who'd you say this baby was?</i>

589
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,354
[Eun-ok] <i>My little girl, Hae-yeong.</i>

590
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,567
[Hui-seong breathes deeply]

591
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,402
[Producer Yun chuckles]

592
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,406
Uh, if you take a look at this screen,

593
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,868
the black part right here
is the amniotic fluid.

594
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,163
[doctor] And the area
that looks white here is the baby.

595
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:03,333
And where my cursor is pointing at,
you can see it moving, right?

596
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,002
[both] Yes.

597
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:08,422
This is the baby's little heart.

598
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,758
Why don't we listen
to the baby's heartbeat?

599
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,092
[machine beeps]

600
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:16,889
-[heart beating]
-[deep breathing]

601
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,852
[both chuckle]

602
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,898
[chuckling]

603
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,400
[Min-ji] <i>Of course you're sure right now.</i>

604
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,110
Since you can't see the kid yet.

605
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,446
But what about after they're born?

606
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,656
[pensive music playing]

607
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,287
Hey, doc, when do we find out
if it's a boy or a girl?

608
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,664
-Oh, babe.
-[all chuckle]

609
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,417
You can confirm
the sex of the baby at 16 weeks.

610
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,629
[doctor] Whether it's a boy
who takes after his dad,

611
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,297
or a girl who takes after her mom.

612
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,300
"They don't really take after me,
do they?"

613
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,093
"No kid of mine would ever do that."

614
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,262
[Min-ji] <i>You don't think
that thought will occur to you?</i>

615
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,640
-[pensive music continues]
-[heart beating continues]

616
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,411
Aw, Hui-seong, you must be tired, hmm?

617
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,622
And thanks to your morning sickness,
you haven't eaten.

618
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,707
It's all right. I'm fine.

619
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,167
Is there anything you're craving? Hmm?

620
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,419
It's okay if you can't eat a lot of it,
I don't care.

621
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:30,712
But you really should eat something.

622
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:31,797
Mm-mm.

623
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,341
I just want to be home already.

624
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,134
Drop me off right over there.

625
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:39,346
Oh, pfft, of course I'm gonna drive you
all the way home, my lady.

626
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:42,140
But you need to go back to the studio
for a session.

627
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:43,225
Mm. Eh, nah...

628
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,853
It would really make me feel better
to see you eat something

629
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,938
before you go home after all that.
[chuckles]

630
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,566
[Hui-seong chuckles softly]

631
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,575
-Baby.
-Hmm?

632
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:00,951
Baby, stop the car.

633
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:03,954
Why? Are you nauseous?

634
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,372
Just stop the car.

635
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,540
[confused grunt]

636
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,253
[tense music playing]

637
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,342
Hui-seong.

638
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,012
Hui-seong!

639
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,724
Hui-seong, you okay?
If you feel like throwing up...

640
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:25,976
Tae-hyeong, are you all right?

641
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:27,686
Me?

642
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,354
What about me?

643
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,154
I mean, are we all right?

644
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:38,864
Why wouldn't we be?

645
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,866
Us having a kid.

646
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:44,202
Are you really okay with our choice?

647
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,290
Hui-seong, what's going on?

648
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,250
I can just tell by looking into your eyes.

649
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,711
You can't hide anything from me.

650
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:54,838
So just be honest.

651
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,215
About?

652
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,800
This child.

653
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:01,470
Do you regret saying this is our baby?

654
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,264
[scoffs]

655
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:07,267
-Hui-seong.
-Do you?

656
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,687
[somber music playing]

657
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:16,652
I've always liked how honest you are.

658
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,905
But if you aren't honest with me now,

659
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,990
you'll just keep on struggling,

660
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,826
and I'll keep walking on eggshells
like I was in the car.

661
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:27,120
So answer me.

662
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:30,999
Did you... regret it?

663
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:43,095
You did.

664
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,138
For just a moment, barely even a second.

665
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:46,723
Even if it was...

666
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,644
that's time you spent regretting it.

667
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:53,313
It was barely a second. I'm only human.

668
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:54,398
Can't you understand that?

669
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,443
Yeah.

670
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:00,696
[sighs]

671
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:04,741
Then you can understand me too.

672
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:08,453
Hui-seong...

673
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,539
Come on, please.

674
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,917
I liked you
because you were always honest.

675
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:21,341
And I loved you
because you always respected what I said.

676
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:25,846
Don't follow me.

677
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,348
[somber music continues]

678
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,878
[Ji-uk] Ma'am.

679
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,505
I'm... coming in.

680
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,689
-Ma'am, when do yo...
-[Hae-yeong] Ji-uk.

681
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,743
Whenever I would go home,
where would you go?

682
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:33,080
I must have visited a few times
while you were there.

683
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,915
Yet you were nowhere to be found.

684
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,253
When Mom knew you were coming,
she'd give me a heads-up.

685
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:42,923
And I'd go to the library or some cafe.

686
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,424
Also...

687
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,885
we have met before.

688
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:48,804
Just once.

689
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,764
We did?

690
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,851
It was the, um,
first anniversary of your dad's death.

691
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,354
[gentle music playing]

692
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,280
[quietly] Oh, that's right.
Mom told me she was coming.

693
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,866
Talk about a close call.

[clears throat]

696
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:30,762
What are you looking at... half-pint?

697
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,062
You won't grow if you start smoking
when you're that young.

698

00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,776
Hey.

701
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:46,862
You got a light?

702
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,116
[smacks lips] Never mind if you don't.

703
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,709
Guess you started smoking young,

704
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,169
half-pint.

00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,299
[Hae-yeong] <i>Wait, half-pint was you?</i>

706
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,009
The guy who shared his lighter.

707
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,887
Ji-uk, that was you?

708
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,016
Why did you have a lighter anyway?

709
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,434
It was Grandma's.

710
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,020
That day, I went to visit her.

711
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:21,813
[soft chuckle]

712
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,774
That was you.

713
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:26,943
Why?

714
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:31,239
[soft chuckle] Mm-mm.

715
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,580
By the way...

716
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,625
right after our wedding was over,

717
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,920
why did you ghost me
without saying anything?

718
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:47,589
Because I...

719
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:50,759
I fell for you.

720
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,053
But then why disappear?

721
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,472
Back then,
I was worried this would happen.

722
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,351
That I wouldn't be able
to keep the promise I made to Mom

723
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,228
when I got fostered.

724
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:08,109
So because of the promise
you made to your grandma,

725
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,320
you never saw your mom
even though you missed her?

726
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,573
And because of the promise
you made to my mother...

727
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,786
you made sure you never fell for me?

728
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:28,880
Ma'am.

729
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:30,924
We should go.

This isn't an ending,
it's a sudden pause in the story,

736
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,873
and it's definitely not happy
for me or you.

Do you know why you're so obsessed
with finding out where Mom is?

Because she's the only person in the world
who's really afraid of you.

Of course.

904
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:24,225
She's just like her mother,

905
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,853

Are you all right?

Yeah.

Are you really sure you're all right?

[sentimental music playing]

I'm okay.

-Yes, I'll be fine.
-Yeah.

[police 1] Let me just ask you
a few quick questions.

956
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,895
This here is the weapon
the culprit brought, right?

957
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:15,813
Yeah.

958
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:17,690
[police 1] What are these then?

-Uh, so, you see...

961

Those are what I used in self-defense.

962
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,698
[police 1] Oh.

963
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,284
I thought the perp brought them with him.

964
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:31,328
Well, here you go then. Thank you.

965
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:34,665

[relieved sigh]

973
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:59,273
[Chang-il] I told you,
I came to see my fucking daughter!

974
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,777
What, so if a dad comes over
to pay his kid a visit, it's trespassing?

975
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,154
Seriously, what the fuck, you guys?

976
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:06,864
Hey, Ja-yeon, tell them!

977
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,365
-Who am I?

-[Chang-il groans]
-[all gasp]

982
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,422
What gives you the right
to call yourself a dad?

983
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:25,925
A dad who beats his own kid
is no dad at all.

984
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,511
No one needs a father like that.

985
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,515
[Chang-il laughing]

986
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,101
[Chang-il] Did you see that?
That bitch hit me just now.

987

Come on.

994
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:52,535
Wait, you knew, Hae-yeong?

995
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:56,413
This whole time, you knew...

996
00:56:58,124 --> 00:56:59,500
who my dad was?

998
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:13,848
I...

999
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:16,016
I don't understand.

1000
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,145
If you knew, then why...

1001
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,233
Because I didn't wanna lose out.

1002
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,199
[Hae-yeong]
<i>When you came to visit me that day...</i>

1003
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:43,085
<i>it felt like it might be the last time</i>

1004
00:57:43,169 --> 00:57:44,837
<i>that I'd get to see you.</i>

1005
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:51,594
Hae-yeong!

[Ja-yeon] Hae-yeong.

1008
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:00,477
It's me, Ja-yeon.

1009
00:58:01,312 --> 00:58:03,397
[Hae-yeong]
<i>Like you'd been through a living hell.</i>

1010
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:06,442
<i>That you were screaming
for me to help you.</i>

1011
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,451
<i>And then an arrogant thought
occurred to me.</i>

1012
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:18,704
<i>That although I couldn't save Dad...</i>

1013
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:22,249
[soft music playing]

1014
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,543
<i>...maybe I could save you.</i>

1015

Nam Ja-yeon?

1016
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:32,885
[Hae-yeong] <i>Because hating you...
I could do that anytime.</i>

1017
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:39,642
<i>But that day might have been
the only chance I got to save your life.</i>

1018
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:43,646
[Hae-yeong] Long time no see.

1019
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:46,315
How you've been doing?

1020
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,616
I didn't want to lose you like my dad.

1021
00:58:59,662 --> 00:59:01,413
[Ja-yeon] I... [shaky breath]

1022
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,375
All this time, I had no idea.

[deep exhale]

1024
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:12,216
[Hae-yeong] But Ja-yeon...

1025
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:15,469
sometimes I regretted it though.

1026
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,681
I thought maybe...

1027
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:22,476
I'd accidently turned your life
into an even greater hell.

1028

[soft chuckle]

1029
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:32,319
[Ja-yeon sobs] You saved my life.

[voice breaking] It's thanks to you
that I'm even still here. [sniffles]

[Ja-yeon] Hae-yeong, I'm so sorry.

1035

Mr. Bok, are you all right?

1036
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:11,442
What do you think? My arm got slashed.

1037
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,486
Still, I got more hits in than he did.

Oh, by the way...

-[hesitates] Oh, uh...
-[comical music playing]

1044
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,635
Uh, you know, Mr. Bok,
you should really go to the hospital.

1045
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:40,304
Seriously, why were they there?
And why so many?

1046

-Ah, you must be in so much pain.
-[groaning]

1047
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,807
Why don't we get that arm stitched up,
so it doesn't scar?

[groaning continues]

1049

Please take him to a hospital. Here.

1061

1062
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:51,959
[pensive music continues]

1063
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:09,017
[sighs] That bastard
completely smashed the door.

1064
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:11,895
And we just installed a new one
not too long ago.

1065
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:17,568
What?

1066
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:19,069
Are you scared?

1067
01:02:19,695 --> 01:02:21,405
[scoffs] Oh, please.

1068
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:25,409
Well then...

1069
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:27,911
should I head upstairs?

1070
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:34,334
What about the front door?

1071
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:36,086
Are you done... with all that?

1072
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,088
Yeah.

1073
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:43,343
Okay, you must be tired as well.

1074
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:44,678
Go on up and head to bed.

1075
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:49,892
How about down here?

1076
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:53,896
Uh, the sofa.

1077
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:55,481
On the sofa there.

1078
01:02:57,566 --> 01:02:59,067
It's more comfy in a bed.

1079
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,655
Uh... could I really?

1080
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:05,908
Your own bed.

1081
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:07,451
Ah.

1082
01:03:08,076 --> 01:03:09,203
Good night.

1083
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:22,633
[Gyu-hyun grunts]

1084
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:32,142
[knocking on door]

1085
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,440
Come in.

1086
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:42,819
Ah, Ms. Nam.

1087
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:44,696
You're still awake?

1088
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:48,200
Is it all right if... I come in?

1089
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,879
My sister, she wanted me to tell you

1090
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:02,714
how grateful she is
for everything you did.

1091
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:03,924
Ah.

1092
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,803
And I barely said a word to you either.

1093
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:14,685
Thank you for saving me.

1094
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,728
Without you, I'd probably be dead.

1095
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,190
Still, because of me, you got hurt.

1096
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:23,485
I'm...

1097
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,280
so, so sorry.

1098
01:04:29,408 --> 01:04:30,492
Ah...

1099
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:31,994
Wait.

1100
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:33,537
Is that all?

1101
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:36,873
What?

1102
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:39,209
Ms. Nam, I thought
you were all about being fair.

1103
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:41,253
You should really repay the favor.

1104
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,880
[comical music playing]

1105
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:44,965
What?

1106
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:47,551
[squeaking effect]

1107
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,056
This is repaying the favor?

1108
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,601
[Gyu-hyun] Fair is fair.
We need to get even.

1109
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:58,020
Since I kept you safe, Ms. Yeon,

1110
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,771
it's only fair
that you keep me safe too...

1111
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:02,858
from my nightmares.

1112
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:04,651
[soft chuckle]

1113
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:06,528
[soft chuckle]

1114
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:09,865
Was...

1115
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:13,285
Was he the reason?

1116
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:15,412
Him and Team Leader Son?

1117
01:05:16,872 --> 01:05:18,957
Why you and I took a little hiatus?

1118
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:25,505
[sighs]

1119
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,758
I wish I'd known sooner.

1120
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,760
[sentimental music playing]

1121
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:31,094
If I had known...

1122
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,556
I wouldn't have pursued you like that.

1123
01:05:37,184 --> 01:05:39,645
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

1124
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,565
Had I known earlier...

1125
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:48,654
I'd have given you my heart...

1126
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:53,617
and done anything I could
to win your love.

1127
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:00,290
[grunts]

1128
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,591
But you and Team Leader Son are sisters.

1129
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:11,760
I can't possibly compete with that.

1130
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:15,263
Still...

1131
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:16,848
I'm going to try.

1132
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:19,893
It'll take all my wealth and power,

1133
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,104
but I'll make sure
Team Leader Son never gets between us...

1134
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:23,271
Gyu-hyun.

1135
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:29,444
You really still... like me?

1136
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:32,989
Knowing what you know?

1137
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:35,242
Yes.

1138
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,704
You understand and accept my faults

1139
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:43,250
even after... everything that happened?

1140
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,418
And love you too.

1141
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,548
Oh, do I love you.

1142
01:06:58,807 --> 01:06:59,683
Meow.

1143
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,601
What?

1144
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:05,272
My heart just needs
to meow sometimes, I guess.

1145
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:09,526
[Gyu-hyun sighs]

1146
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,576
[Gyu-hyun] That must've hurt.

1147
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,131
[soft, bright music playing]

1148

1154
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:06,685
Ji-uk, wake up.

1155

[soft grunt]

1157
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,277
[Ji-uk] What is it?

1158
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:16,903
You need to get up.

1159
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:18,822
Mom passed away.

1160
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,283
What?

1161
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:24,035
I just got a call from the nursing home
saying to come now.

1162
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:26,663
What...

1163
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,082
What did you say?

1164
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,834
That Mom passed away tonight.

1165
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:34,212
-Ma'am...
-Come on, get up.

1166
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,089
Ma'am.

1167
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,716
[Hae-yeong] We need to go see Mom now.

1168
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,050
There isn't any time for this.

1169

Yes?

01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:55,358
My mom's dead.

1174

[sniffles] My mom died...

1175
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,242
and left me behind.
