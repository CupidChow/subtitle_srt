00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,582
Oh... yeah, it's settled now.

179
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,541
[Yi-lin] Mm.

180
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,884
[Woo-jae] <i>Is it possible
that a boss wouldn't know his employee</i>

182
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:21,515
<i>And if he disappeared a few months ago,
that's right after the wedding.</i>

183
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,017
<i>Did they separate as soon as it was over?</i>

184
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,061
<i>And why the rooftop house?</i>

185
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,856
[groans] <i>No idea. Whatever!</i>

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,443
[loud trilling]

00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,739
[Ji-uk] <i>I wondered</i>

188
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,659
<i>how far you would take this charade.</i>

189

00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,997

{\an8}We barely touched,
it was just a peck. A peck.

194
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,003
{\an8}Was that your first kiss?

195
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:55,674
I'm so sorry. I am really sorry.

Son Hae-yeong.

199
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,809
Why'd I say that? Why? [sighs]

I'm not the one who's confusing things.

205
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,285
If he's not gonna lose, then why should I?

206
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,747

I've held this in long enough.

210
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,383
I'm done holding back.

I'm gonna call you bro-in-law for now.

Where are you going?

220
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,293
The toilet.

221
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,670
Are you going outdoors?

222
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:16,838
The bathroom's in here.

223
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,256
Uh, I'm going...

224
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,592
for a trip to the bathhouse.

225
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,135
Eat with us first.

226
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,262
Well, uh,

227
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,640
I go by "first in, first out" rules.

Where're you going?

-What about food?
-I'll eat...

231

He doesn't wanna bathe when he's full.

232
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:38,944
Just eat first.

233
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,196
-It's quite urgent...
-[stomach rumbling]

234
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,572
...for me to bathe, so...

235
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,866
I bought such a good breakfast
for us though.

236
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,536
A won...derful kimchi soup...

238
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:53,416
...and short ribs so... tender,

239
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,127
they'll slide down your throat
without even chewing.

-[awkward chuckle]
-Sound good?

241

Mm-hmm.

242

Yeah. You three enjoy it.

[Hui-seong] Mmm.

254
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,719
Thanks for breakfast.

255
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,724
[Ji-uk slurps] Mmm.

[clears throat]

257
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,562
-Like the kimchi soup?
-Yeah.

258
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,147
The short ribs are good.

259
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,149
-[Hui-seong] Here.
-Thanks very much.

260
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,693
Yeah, you can enjoy all of it,

261

-like you'll enjoy me.
-[coughing]

262
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,368
After breakfast,
we're going to the park to work out.

263
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,703
[Ja-yeon] Wanna join, bro-in-law?

264
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,079
No, uh...

265
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,040
-I...
-Why not?

266
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,544
You don't want a fun workout,
with Son Hae-yeong?

267
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,922
Stop being cute, I'm losing my appetite.

268
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,179
Did the two of you... fight yesterday?

269
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,265
Yesterday? Did something happen
between these two?

270
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,809
-You know...
-Uh?

271
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,270
[suspenseful music rising]

272
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,313
Come on, what?

273
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,690
The two of them kissed on the rooftop!

274
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,820
[comical music playing]

275
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,864
She kissed me actually...

276
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,241
without my consent.

277
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:54,287
You're the one who got my arms like that,
and pulled me in like this!

278
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,706
Whoa, you two kissed!
Are you dating now?

279
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,000
She'll kiss any guy she's not even dating,

280
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,835
as long as Ahn Woo-jae's there.

281
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,171
Look, a kiss and a peck are different,
do you not get it?

282
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,131
What I did was a little peck,

283
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,424
-and you did a...
-[Hui-seong] Cut it out.

284
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,468
You're both being little shits.

285
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,011
-Who's a little shit?
-She's full of shit.

286
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,888
-Gross.
-[utensils clank]

287

[surprised exclaim]

290
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,450
Why are you making the president
come to you?

291
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,285
[furious music playing]

292
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,038
[Ha-jun scoffs]

293
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,625
Are you testing how violent
a developer can get?

294
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:43,670
Uh...

295
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,632
[scoffing]

296
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,720
[Gyu-hyun clears throat]

297
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,018
So tell me, why did you want
to meet me on the weekend?

298
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,688
What, we aren't allowed to meet up
unless there's a reason?

299
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,732
I just wanted to chat with you,

300
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,943
and hear about
how the housewarming was yesterday.

301
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,111
Well, how'd it go?

302
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,654
I had a good time, for sure.

303
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,740
-Mm.
-[comical music playing]

304
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,409
And you saw your friend, the author?

305
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,493
You bet I saw her.

306
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,539
-Is she doing well?
-Yeah, I think so.

307
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,793
-Oh...
-How'd she look, health-wise?

308
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,044
Also, is she going to keep writing?

309
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,130
It's not like she suddenly decided
to end her writing career

310
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,132
or anything, right?
She keeps pretty busy, so...

311
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,842
Oops, I slammed it again.

312
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,636
[Ha-jun exhales in disbelief]

313
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,642
Call her up and ask her yourself
if you're so curious.

314
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,269
She isn't picking up...

315
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,483
She'll be uncomfortable.

316
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,569
A president, and his secretary's friend?

317
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,198

[Ha-jun] Hmm.

321
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,247
You want another latte?

322
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,709
[Ha-jun] Hey, Ja-yeon.

323
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,628
Yeah.

324
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,469
MS. YEON BO-RA

325
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,388
[sighs] Meanwhile,
she won't read my texts.

326
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,269
If you don't call me right this minute,

327
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,104
then Ha-jun's life is going to be in jeo...

[phone buzzing]

329
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,900
Hi, Ms. Yeon! Commenter speaking!

330
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,069
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right.
-Boss, your latte...

[background chatter]

335
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,516
I'm sorry
for the inconvenience I've caused.

336
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,352
I withdrew the lawsuit.

337
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,229
And I'll sign an NDA if you want.

338
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,274
-Ms. Yeon...
-I asked you to meet with me today

339
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,317
'cause I'm worried about Hae-yeo...

340
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,030
-about Team Leader Son getting affected...
-Nam Ja-yeon.

341
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,285
I'm not here to meet
with Nam Ja-yeon, the little sister.

342
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,786
I'm here for Yeon Bo-ra, the author.

343
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,832
To apologize for not only
writing those comments,

344
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,333
but hiding who I really was.

345
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,294
Who do I apologize to,

346
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,546
if this is how you feel now?

347
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:33,882
Can we try meeting again?

348
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,010
I'll accept it.

349
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,054
And you don't have to volunteer
at the orphanage.

350
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,515
I promised to do the hours.
I gave my word.

351
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,226
No, I'd like for things to end here.

00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:03,088
You had nothing to do
with the man he's become, quite frankly.

[comical music playing]

530
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,267
So... are there others I should find?

531
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,520
That's it. I'm sure. Just those two.

532
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:21,690
I'll try persuading Mr. Kim again.

533
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,277
And what about his wife?

534
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,072
-You're referring to Ms. Son Hae-yeong?
-Mm-hmm.

535
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,574
She's got guts,
and she seemed ambitious.

536
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,286
Well, Mr. Bok, that could result in...

537
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,122
a battle of daughters,
not with both of your sons.

538
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,167
That wouldn't be
the worst thing that can happen...

539
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:42,836
if it wakes up the boys.

540
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,600
Welcome home, Ms. Seon.

541
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,270
Mr. Jang.

542
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:03,649
Yes, Ms. Seon.

543
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,318
Your father's anniversary is soon, right?

544
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:07,861
Yes.

545
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,406
I appreciate your remembering.

546
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,827
His loyalty to my father and husband
was unparalleled.

547
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,161
Yes, indeed.

548
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,747
So much so that he wrote
in his will the instruction,

549
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,958
"Stay loyal to CEO Bok.

550
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,127
If he tells you to die, then you die."

[tense music playing]

552
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,005
Yes, and what else?

553
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,051
There was another section, wasn't there?

554
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,431
That if you called,
I'd better jump to my feet,

555
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,182
and wake up, even from the grave.

556
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,437
Well, there's no need
for you to jump to your feet.

557
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,774
You'll just need
to turn your back a little.

558
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,702
[Hae-yeong] I thought you'd go without me.

559
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,537
No, I'm not that petty.

560
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:01,582
What about the door?

561
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,668
Why not open it?

562
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,045
Uh...

563
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,714
[sighs]

564
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:11,592
Oh, forget it.

565
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:14,720
What was that?

566
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,181
I am petty.

[Ji-uk] Is something bothering you?

Mm... you.

Other than me, what is it?

00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:46,502
Okay, newbie.

576
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,296
If I tell you what it is,
you think you'll solve it?

577
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,591
So it's work-related.

578
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,385
Go on and try me. You never know.

579
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,138
The newbie might surprise you
with some good ideas.

580
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,392
Hmm...

581
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:04,895
So our target demographic

582
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:08,440
won't switch companies
unless we can show that our method works.

583
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:10,359
So we need to give a compelling reason

584
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,152
in order for them
to choose Popcorn Playground.

585
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,488
If we show tangible results to consumers,

586
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,281
like academic improvement...

587
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:19,868
Ma'am, we haven't made up yet, right?

Listen, newbie,
I'm problem-solving over here,

and all you're worried about
is us fighting?

Wait, hold on.

596
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,850
Something must've come to mind

597
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,935
when you heard about
the new business plan.

598
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,937
Why did you actually join this company?

599
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,650
You know,
I just wanted the employee discount.

00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,195
Employee discount? Where'd you use it?

602
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,280
An orphanage.

603
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,324
Kids there don't get
as many opportunities,

604
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:00,325
so it'd be nice for them.

605

I'm Team Leader Son Hae-yeong

Today, I'll be presenting
the progress report

00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,298
on Popcorn AI Playground.

610
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,427
With our program,

611
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,096
we can expect children
to gain increased brain activity,

612
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,140
as well as physical fitness
in the long term.

617
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:35,777
[Hae-yeong] One area of focus
is to manage the children's study time,

618
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,946
and help them build good habits,
which will lead to more success in...

[Hae-yeong] Popcorn AI Playground

622
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,588
is gaining traction
as an alternative learning model

623
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,548
since it eases the financial burden

624
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,383
of paying for private education

625
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:01,345
and strengthens
children's motivation to learn.

626
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,638
I'll end the presentation

627
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,140

of our marketing strategy.

this is where we end things?</i>

00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,565
<i>I hope that we never see each other again.</i>

taking something old

and slapping a new label on it?

There was a method I didn't report on,

to be in an orphanage, Mr. President.

652
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,979
We can provide
free services to children, and...

653
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:37,482
by doing that, we access a market

we can pivot to provide equal access

00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,455

to conscious consumers, and...

701
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,320
-Yes.
-So instead of going

702
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:48,947
and looking for something to do,

703
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,574

that thing again

705
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,952
That's my advice to you.

Huh?

707
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,873
-That's a bit...
-[bangs on table]

708
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,875
If you're just gonna do whatever you want,

709
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,043
you shouldn't have gotten married then,
should you?

[Asst. Manager Kim] Now, here,
this shouldn't be how this gets done.

713

-[Gi-un] Okay.

00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:25,400
for TVC's 10th exclusive, female category,
Cha Hui-seong submitting.

718

Oh, just one more time,
can we listen to it again?

724
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:49,633
When this is over, I'm gonna stick to you
like glue for a week straight.

We're not meeting up that week though.

726

You're gonna be with Min-ji
and I'll be with Hyeon-gyu.

729
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:00,560
What about hot springs, the week after?

730
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:02,729
I love that.

731
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,856
Okay, I'll schedule it.

Thank you for your work, Team Leader Son.

Oh! [snaps fingers]

742
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,157
Let's keep the information
about the orphanage confidential,

743
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,034
and take care of this yourself, Ms. Son.

744
00:42:58,118 --> 00:43:00,453
This should be kept from Ji-uk,
as well as...

745
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:04,708
your friend who's like a sister
to you, right? Hmm? Hmm?

746

Let's not share it with them...

750
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,315
Why is this a secret from Mr. Kim Ji-uk?

751
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,607
They're on the same team.

752
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:30,900
For fun.

753
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,571

Lucifer will really enjoy the surprise.

00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,661
Are you jealous, Secretary?

[laughs]

758
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:43,913
It's that...

I think he would do
an excellent job as secretary.

760
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:51,212
You'll do a good job too, Secretary.

761

What the hell is this?

My desire to reconcile, a gesture.

Shut up and drive.

We have an errand.

Where to?

you were going to bury me in a grave.

You're bed shopping?

781
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,792
So what kind of mattress do you like?

782
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,961
Do you like a firm one? Soft one?

783
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:15,130
Are...

784
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,258
we sleeping in the same bed?

785
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:22,053
What? Have you lost your mind?

786
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:23,555
This is about your bed. Yours.

787
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:26,266
-The one you're going to sleep in.
-Ah.

788
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,519
You should've started with that.
I was confused.

789
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:34,649
Okay, so,
what kind of mattress do you like?

790
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,943
On the softer side of things or firmer?

791
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,695
Uh, never thought about it.

792
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,156
I've only slept on ones in small studios...

793
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,492
Or ones that were used.

794
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:46,744
Come on.

-[Ji-uk] Ooh.
-How is it?

799
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,135
This is good, I think.

800
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:03,595
This is comfy.

801
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:05,472
And how 'bout yours?

802
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,851
Uh, I think it's pretty comfortable.

803
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:11,519
Might be a bit short though.

804
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,272
Aww! [chuckles]

805
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,900
So cute. Adorable.

806
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,818
Oh, this must be the kids section.

807
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:20,445
Nice. Oh, bunk beds.

808
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:23,615
Where did he go?

809
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,326
Ji-uk. Ji-uk?

810
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,620
You know,
I wouldn't mind a bed like this either.

[both exhale in relief]

812
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,586
[Ji-uk] Ah, I wish my home was like this.

813
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:38,755
[Ji-uk sighs]

814
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:42,217
[Hae-yeong] When you buy a bed,
you'll use it for a long time.

815
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,135
So get one that's high-quality.

816
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:45,845
Were there any ones that you liked?

817
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:47,889
Yeah, there was.

818
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,017
But it was... kinda out of my budget.

819
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:55,146
I'm earning an entry-level salary,
so I don't make much.

820
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,106
Pick the one you like.

821
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,441
I'll get it for you.

822
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:00,318
No, I can just go with a cheap one.

823
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,402
[Hae-yeong] Ji-uk.

824
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:06,157
I'd like...
for you to sleep in a nice bed,

825
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,993
with a comforter
that's nice and soft to the touch.

[gentle music playing]

827
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:14,624
So that no matter
how hard of a day you've had,

828
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,418
when you get in your bed,
you're so comfortable...

829
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,380
that you wouldn't trade places
with a king.

830
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,967
You are the king of your own domain.

831
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,427
And you're your only subject.

832
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,596
So treat the king well,

833
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,932
make sure
that he stays nice and comfortable.

834
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,142
And then on the other hand,

835
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:35,687
make sure that your subjects don't starve.

836
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,694
Rest your head somewhere nice, Ji-uk.

837
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,202
I'm not...

838
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,038
confused at all.

839
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,458
As much as you dance around the topic,

840
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,211
I can hear you loud and clear.

841
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,465
I also...

842
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,385
I like you as well.

843
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:13,600
This king's territory
has been taken over...

844
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:16,978
by a neighboring country.

845
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,524
You know what happens
when the king's distracted?

846
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,236
Mass starvation
and distress of his subjects.

847
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,365
[Ji-uk] I won't have my subjects starve.

848
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:31,367
-Let's go.
-[soft chuckle]

849

[Hae-yeong] Mm...
could you add avocado to mine?

850
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,166
-Do you like avocado?
-Mm, I like it.

851

-Mm.

855

[Ji-uk] Thank you.

856
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:09,947
Let me be clear.

857
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,367
That wasn't a confession.

858
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:14,619
I know.

859
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,538
This is the one with avocado.

860
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:23,086
I was only feeling grateful to you
for that great marketing idea.
