00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,424
We'll begin the inquiry
into the alleged workplace harassment

3
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:52,470
committed by Team Leader Son Hae-yeong
of the New Business Development Team.

10
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:10,446
The report alleges
that you told Mr. Kim Ji-uk,

11
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,532
the new recruit who joined your team…

12
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:14,658
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Kim Ji-uk.</font></i>

13
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,327
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">You reported me?</font></i>

14
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,871
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">What did I ever do to you?</font></i>

15
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,416
Hello.

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,502
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Did I leave my handprints on your face?</font></i>

17
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,878
Aren't you going to get a job?

18
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,797
You've been a part-timer here for ages.

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,964
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Wasn't that the truth?</font></i>

20
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,007
So annoying!

21
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,967
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">You were indeed annoying.</font></i>

22
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:37,640
This is a prime example
of verbal abuse in the workplace.

23
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:41,143
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">I guess revenge really is
a dish best served cold.</font></i>

24
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,835
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">So this is why you agreed
to the fake marriage.</font></i>

25
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,395
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">You wanted me to get promoted</font></i>

26
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,772
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">and fall from a higher place.</font></i>

27
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,578
Goodbye.

28
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,844
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">That vengeful bastard.</font></i>

29
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,138
-You can't be in here right now.
-Who are you?

30
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,015
I'm Kim Ji-uk,

31
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,059
the new recruit who joined
the New Business Development Team.

32
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:07,563
Then aren't you the victim?

33
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,607
The victim interview
will be carried out later.

34
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,858
Please wait outside.

35
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,278
I'm not a victim.

36
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:18,574
I'm Ms. Son's…

37
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,411
husband.

38
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:26,957
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">You…</font></i>

39
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,627
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">You actually…</font></i>

40
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:52,316
Goodbye.

41
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,368
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">You closed my coffin on me!</font></i>

42
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,328
-Ms. Son!
-Yes?

43
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:07,247
Is what Mr. Kim Ji-uk said true?

44
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,541
Are you two married?

45
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,672
To tell you the truth…

46
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,509
Kim Ji-uk…

47
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,432
is my husband.

48
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:26,976
Oh, dear.

49
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,771
Was HR not aware of this?

50
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,731
-Well…
-This is all

51
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:34,858
my fault.

52
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,485
I applied without Ms. Son's…

53
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,363
I mean, my wife's knowledge
and received an offer,

54
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,740
which was an opportunity
I didn't want to lose.

55
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:44,952
You should've notified HR
when you were assigned to her team!

56
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,287
Did it not occur to you
that it'd be a problem

57
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,540
if a wife had to evaluate
her husband's performance?

58
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,377
Didn't you go on the new recruit OJT,
Ms. Son?

59
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,255
Was that your plan all along?

60
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:59,758
To have your husband
assigned to your own team?

61
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,178
-No.
-I can confirm that.

62
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:06,765
She only took on the mentor role
because of my urgent request that day.

63
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:11,020
Please take a look
at her evaluation of the new recruits.

64
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,734
"Kim Ji-uk showed
a passive attitude throughout."

65
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,403
"He may require
constant supervision from his superior."

66
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,948
"Though he was well-reviewed
by customers at the OJT,

67
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,326
his physical appearance
played a major factor in this,

68
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,912
causing him to display arrogance."

69
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,792
"I'm concerned about whether
he can effectively communicate

70
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,210
and work with his colleagues."

71
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,965
So this is less of workplace harassment

72
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,676
and more of a workplace couple's quarrel.

73
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,221
-To be honest--
-Honey.

74
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,402
Where is she? I want her back!

75
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,196
Hand her over!

76
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,032
How is it any of your business
when I want <i><font face="Arial" color="white">my</font></i> girl back?

77
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,116
Report me then!

78
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,285
Where are you?

79
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,703
Nam Ja-yeon!

80
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,497
Where the hell are you?

81
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,165
Nam Ja-yeon!

00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,340
{\an8}EPISODE 6

83
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:47,866
{\an8}Ms. Yeon.

84
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,828
{\an8}It's me, the hater.

85
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,872
You're not dead?

86
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,335
I'm sorry

87
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,670
for disappointing you.

88
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,677
But why are you here?

89
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,139
Do you remember passing out?

90
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,560
When I took you to the ER,
the doctor said…

91
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,318
What did the doctor tell you?

92
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,447
You passed out and just fell asleep.

93
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,034
You slept for nearly 20 hours
and even snored.

94
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,202
Goodness.

95
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,037
Then you should've woken me up.

96
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,999
How could I when you were so sound asleep?

97
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,458
And I couldn't contact your family.

98
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,170
A hospital ward seemed better
than a hotel room.

99
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,467
Was there no shared room left?

100
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,307
I paid for your hospital bill.

101
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,476
Why?

102
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,854
Are you trying to count this
as your settlement?

103
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,148
That's not it.

104
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:05,319
You seem to be mistaken
by my appearance right now,

105
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,154
but any settlement I offer
would go up to hundreds of--

106
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,489
I'll pay you back. How much was it?

107
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:15,746
-Again, my settlement would--
-How much was it?

108
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,123
It was 1,740,000 won.

109
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,461
-Excuse me?
-1,740,000 won.

110
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,548
Not a bad deal for a VIP room, is it?

111
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,720
It's 1,740,000 won for a night?

112
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,475
So why don't I cover the bill?

113
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,392
No.

114
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:38,852
I'll pay you back.

115
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,773
Be careful!

116
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,194
The glass shards could cost you
a finger or two, you know.

117
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,248
You're a writer.

118
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,417
You can't hurt your hand, can you?

119
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,093
I bought you a new phone.

120
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,930
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">I actually came in to leave this.</font></i>

121
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,771
But then you woke up,
and I got startled and fell to the ground.

122
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,406
-Limited…
-Oh, wait.

123
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:36,535
I guess you'll just assume
that I'm trying to settle with this

124
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:38,620
and not accept it.

125
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:42,708
Fine.

126
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,543
I'll pay you back for that too.

127
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:45,836
How much was it?

128
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,027
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Is your guardian doing better?</font></i>

129
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,487
Is he hurt?

130
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,741
He went to an orthopedist
for his hip and shoulder pain.

131
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,869
If he got hit by the truck,
why didn't he get admitted?

132
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,078
It's not that.

133
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,706
He just had sore muscles
from carrying you to the ER.

134
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,250
He carried me all the way here?

135
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,419
Your boyfriend was so worried.

136
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,754
He's not my boyfriend.

137
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,088
Oh, he's not?

138
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,840
Okay, you're done.

139
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,675
He's really not my boyfriend.

140
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,054
Excuse me, I don't have a boyfriend!

141
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,056
Ma'am!

142
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,103
Excuse me.

143
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:50,817
Thank you for taking me to the hospital.

144
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,113
I'll wire you the money once I'm home.

145
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:59,034
Whether it's a fine or a prison sentence,
I'll accept what the court hands me.

146
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:02,120
But you were admitted because of me,
so please just allow me to--

147
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,413
I'll pay you back.

148
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,708
Goodbye.

149
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,266
The thing is…

150
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,065
Is this enough?

151
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,193
Do you need more?

152
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,320
No.

153
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,534
-I'll wire--
-That too. Got it.

154
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,968
They say your blood test results
come out next week,

155
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,387
so remember to come check.

156
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,390
Also, you should catch up on your sleep.

157
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,058
I'm deeply sorry

158
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,353
for causing you unnecessary stress,

159
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,689
especially when you're so busy.

160
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:43,805
NEW MESSAGES

161
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,645
NEW MESSAGES

162
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,398
NEW MESSAGES RECEIVED

163
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,319
Being an office couple isn't a crime.

164
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,863
We just got the order wrong.

165
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,825
Don't be scared, partner.

166
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,328
Let's hold our heads high and…

167
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,542
What's with that look?

168
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,921
Is this about your evaluation?

169
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,925
I was just worried you'd end up
staying at the headquarters and--

170
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,551
How could you think it was me?

171
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,431
Did you really think I'd report you?

172
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,183
Don't you trust me at all?

173
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:33,522
They said you were the victim,
so I just assumed it was you.

174
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,775
I risked my job to rush in there
to save you from disciplinary action.

175
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,694
Do you understand
what I almost gave up for you?

176
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,322
Your monthly pay?

177
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,453
Don't worry, partner.

178
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,288
They can't fire us over this.

179
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,499
You'll just get reassigned
to another team,

180
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,584
and we just need to pretend
to be married on weekdays.

181
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:55,502
Could we, though?

182
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,921
What if I betray you?

183
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,172
Doesn't it worry you?

184
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,049
Betray me?

185
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,801
I know you'd never do that.

186
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,761
I'm not worried at all.

187
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,805
I trust you, okay?

188
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,690
Trust is earned as much as it's given,
and vice versa.

189
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,149
I've given you a lot of trust

190
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,443
but got nothing in return.

191
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:32,914
Partner!

192
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,587
I'll prove to you how much I trust you.

193
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,463
What are you doing?

194
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,175
You know what a trust fall is, right?

195
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,886
I'd never try this
even with Hui-seong and Ja-yeon,

196
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,305
but I'd do it with you.

197
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,474
This is how much I trust you.

198
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,979
-Here I go.
-Good luck!

199
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,523
I'm going to fall, okay?

200
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,402
Are you there?

201
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,280
Did you leave?

202
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,492
He left.

203
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,664
He really holds a grudge.

204
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,482
Is this a trust fall or a strength test?

205
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,860
It's both.
That's how much I trust you, partner.

206
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,049
I'm sure the news has spread already.

207
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,761
It's enough gossip for people
to shake off their post-lunch drowsiness.

208
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,014
Do you remember what I said?

209
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,017
Keep in mind the four strategies
for a successful work life.

210
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,313
Are you sure about this?

211
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,234
The truth can't beat the power of scandal,

212
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:28,029
but scandal is nothing
in the face of brazen audacity.

213
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:29,531
Trust me.

214
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,164
Are the rumors true?

215
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,167
-Is the new recruit really your--
-Yeah, he's my husband.

216
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,377
Got a problem?

217
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,628
{\an8}<i><font face="Arial" color="white">"So what?"</font></i>

218
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,339
{\an8}<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Calmly ignore what has been said
and defend yourself with a smile.</font></i>

219
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,217
Not only does he work here,
but he's also on your team?

220
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,511
-Are you two crazy?
-We are, Mr. Ahn.

221
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,180
But it's not like
she has two husbands at work.

222
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,598
{\an8}<i><font face="Arial" color="white">"Go screw yourself."</font></i>

223
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,809
{\an8}<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Slay with a perfunctory agreement.</font></i>

224
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,570
{\an8}Ms. Son, the new recruit isn't…

225
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,614
I mean, your husband
isn't staying on our team, is he?

226
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,491
Working with him
would be too uncomfortable.

227
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,036
I guess you two had it easy
before his assignment.

228
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,456
I'll keep that in mind.

229
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,749
{\an8}<i><font face="Arial" color="white">"What do I care?"</font></i>

230
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,334
{\an8}<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Look down
on those who turn their noses up.</font></i>

231
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,344
{\an8}-Girl, what on earth is going--
-Nice to meet you, Ms. Gong.

232
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,888
I've heard a lot about you.

233
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,516
Goodness me.

234
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,310
Nice to meet you.

235
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,936
{\an8}<i><font face="Arial" color="white">"Come again?"</font></i>

236
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,398
{\an8}<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Act clueless with random answers
to play tricks.</font></i>

237
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,946
I have bad news, Ms. Son.

238
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,407
Mr. Bok Gi-un says he's quitting.

239
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,953
So he's the one who reported me?

240
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,039
It never ends with him, does it?

241
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,540
I'll call him.

242
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,501
Thanks for letting me know, Ms. Kwon.

243
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,431
Girl, are you actually dense
or being dense on purpose?

244
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,309
-What do you mean?
-Bok Gi-un, the guy who reported you

245
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,895
Fork Gi-un, the guy who's quitting!

246
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,732
He's obviously a nepo baby!

247
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:28,650
What?

248
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,194
"Bok" Gi-ho.

249
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,238
"Bok" Gyu-hyun.

250
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,199
"Bok" Gi-un.

251
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:41,955
You're right.

252
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,128
DATA BACKUP IN PROGRESS

253
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,842

by my appearance right now,</font></i>

256
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,474
but any settlement Ioffer
would go up to hundreds of--

257
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,184
What is this, poetry?

258
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,269
Did his attorney write this?

259
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,730
He has to be an unemployed rich kid.

260
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,069
SINIL BANK

261
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,780
Okay, 3,287,000 won.

262
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,080
-I'm heading to work.
-Gyu-hyun.

263
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:29,961
Yes?

264
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,297
What happened
to the apology letter you sent?

265
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,382
The thing is,

266
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,343
I don't think it'll help me that much.

267
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:38,511
In that case,

268
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,763
what's your plan?

269
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,517
Once I receive the summons
to appear in court,

270
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,561
-I'll attend as the defendant--
-Bok Gyu-hyun!

271
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,732
Do you really think your father
had that memorandum notarized

272
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,609
just to spur you to action?

273
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,485
Don't you realize the threat

274
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,030
it could pose to your position
in a worst-case scenario?

275
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,573
"Worst-case scenario"?

276
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,330
You just stay put.

277
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,290
I'll handle this.

278
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,375
What are you going to do?

279
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,502
She's standing in my son's way,

280
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,006
so I'll stand in the way
of her precious work.

281
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,260
I'm going to shut down
the production of her audio drama.

282
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,514
It's such a shame
because she was very excited about it.

283
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,017
But you enjoy reading
Ms. Yeon Bo-ra's works.

284
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,518
I did.

285
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,563
Before she sued my son, that is.

286
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,695
Nothing matters more to me

287
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,114
than you.

288
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,452
I'll be content so long as
you secure the chairman position.

<i><font face="Arial" color="white">But under one condition.</font></i>

296
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:12,689
Look at me.

297
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,149
How do I look?

298
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,484
You look pretty.

299
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,696
That's not what I was asking.

300
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,531
I'm asking how I look emotionally.

301
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,657
Do I look angry?

302
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,827
-You look intimidating.
-Really?

303
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,999
I even drew my eyebrows straight
to look less intimidating.

304
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,751
Imagine if the person
who you reported for workplace harassment

305
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,795
showed up at your house.

306
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,130
Wouldn't you be scared?

307
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:41,759
You'd still look intimidating
with angel wings on your back.

308
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:43,678
You're right.

309
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,096
What do I do?

310
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:47,765
Wait a minute.

311
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:50,852
Are you scared?

312
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:53,771
Am I scared?

313
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,440
Do I look scared?

314
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:56,899
That's even better.

315
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,902
Did you really have to come…

316
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,821
Mom!

317
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,115
-Mom!
-Come on!

318
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,576
You just stay inside!

319
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,746
Don't worry, I'll tell her off for you!

320
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,915
-But it's all been settled.
-As if!

321
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,960
-How are you so strong?
-Come on!

322
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,420
-Hello, ma'am.
-Goodness.

323
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,629
Hi, Ji-uk.

324
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,216
Gi-un says you're a married man.

325
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,801
You should've told me.

326
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,553
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

327
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,139
Gi-un.

328
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,935
Are you mad at me, Gi-un?

329
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:36,189
-I'm sorry I didn't tell you, okay?
-Back off.

330
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,858
Who are you? Do I know you?

331
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,569
Come on, I was so touched
that you were looking out for me.

332
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:42,862
Jeez.

333
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,530
Who is that, Mom?

334
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:45,782
I don't know him.

335
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,284
-I brought you something.
-Back off!

336
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,161
-Look!
-Go away.

337
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,204
Are you Ji-uk's wife?

338
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:56,793
Hello, I'm Son Hae-yeong, the team leader
of the New Business Development Team.

339
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,712
This whole misunderstanding

340
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:03,674
seems to have upset Mr. Bok Gi-un enough
for him to consider quitting his job,

341
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,260
so I wanted to talk to him.
Please excuse my unannounced visit.

342
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:07,929
Oh please, there's no need to apologize.

343
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,722
It's my son who caused you trouble.

344
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,224
Please bear with him.

345
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,852
My son's a little dense,
but he has a good heart.

346
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,022
He really seems to like Ji-uk.

347
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,734
He's invited him over
several times already to eat.

348
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:24,362
Oh, right.

349
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:28,032
He's mentioned your kindness,
and I really appreciate it.

350
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,828
But you must not cook for him often.

351
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,704
He said he barely has home-cooked meals.

352
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,707
You should cook him hearty breakfasts
no matter how busy you are.

353
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,335
He needs to eat
to have the energy to work.

354
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,261
Anyway, I'll make sure
that my son goes to work,

355
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,929
so don't worry about it.

356
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,514
Thank you, ma'am.

357
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,100
I'll let them know back at the office.

358
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:55,351
-Mom!
-Thank you.

359
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,604
Ji-uk brought us expensive meat!

360
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:02,400
That boy has a good heart
and a good appetite!

361
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,110
I wonder who he takes after.

362
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,778
-Do we have wine?
-Goodness.

363
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,865
-You really shouldn't have, Ji-uk.
-I know, right?

364
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,534
Don't tell Dad.

365
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,497
Any meal you have at home
is a home-cooked meal.

366
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,207
It doesn't have to be cooked for you.

367
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,043
And I work hard too, you know?

368
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:22,837
Why should I cook you breakfast

369
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,047
when even I skip breakfast?

370
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,887
You don't have breakfast?

371
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:36,392
You should've told me

372
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,394
Bok Gi-un is a close friend of yours.

373
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,980
I got scared for no reason.

374
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,690
Did you have to be?

375
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,111
Is it because the first-year dropout rate
factors into your performance evaluation?

376
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:50,698
Well, that's part of it.

377
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,326
But didn't you know?

378
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,578
Bok Gi-un's a nepo baby.

379
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,831
Bok Gi-un and Bok Gi-ho.

380
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,084
They share the last name
and even a syllable of their first name.

381
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,587
I doubt it.

382
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,049
He says the Boks come from several clans--

383
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,425
Of course he'd say that.

384
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,677
I heard the owner's entourage

385
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:15,348
requested the list of applicants
at every step of recruitment.

386
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,099
What could that mean?

387
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,394
It means they kept an eye out

388
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,271
for none other than Bok Gi-un.

389
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,609
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">You were only hired on merit.</font></i>

390
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:30,947
I heard no strings were pulled
to ensure your recruitment.

391
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:33,824
"I heard"?

392
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,330
So you heard that?

393
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,292
You haven't eaten all day, have you?

394
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,419
Let's get something to eat.

395
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:50,591
I just want to go home and rest.
What about you?

396
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,009
Are you tired?

397
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,136
Then you should go home. I'll be fine.

398
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,137
Okay.

399
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,393
Ma'am.

400
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,563
We'll be fine as long as
I get reassigned to another team,

401
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:05,773
so don't worry too much.

402
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,944
I won't have breakfast at work
or make any mistakes,

403
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,321
and I'll dress nicely.

404
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,826
I'll make sure you don't
suffer any losses because of me.

405
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,456
I look forward to seeing
how well you dress to work.

406
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:24,709
Well then,

407
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,796
let's meet as a couple tomorrow.

408
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,028
Ring.

409
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:54,989
His wedding ring!

410
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:00,995
The day just won't end.

411
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,665
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">The ring you rented three months ago?</font></i>

412
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:06,834
Yes, I'd like to rent it again.

413
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,004
-Your name is?
-Son Hae-yeong.

414
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,381
But someone else returned it.

415
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,674
Ms. Son Hae-yeong.

416
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,927
I'm sorry, but that ring…

417
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:18,804
Is it unavailable?

418
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,515
The person who returned it purchased it.

419
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,392
Why?

420
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,937
He had no reason

421
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,689
or the need to buy it,

422
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:29,982
let alone the means, I believe.

423
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,026
I'm afraid I don't know, ma'am.

424
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,476
Jeez, you startled me!

425
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,814
What are you doing here?

426
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:11,941
You didn't even call.

427
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,902
Misfortune doesn't call before arriving.

428
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,238
Neither does it
come through the front door.

429
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,532
You seem to use only one room.

430
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:21,450
It's only superstition,

431
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,412
but empty rooms
tend to attract misfortune.

432
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,205
Since misfortune's already here,

433
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,040
I'd say that may be true.

434
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,292
Take your time with your drink.

435
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,336
I need to leave now
to comply with your threat

436
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,547
by getting to work on time
and working hard.

437
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,800
When…

438
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,136
did you get married?

439
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,897
I have to admit that it hurt my pride
to find out I made a slip.

440
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:56,485
I told you that you'd be better suited
for a different line of work.

441
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,029
Why are you living apart

442
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,740
so soon into your marriage?

443
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:03,534
Are you divorced?

444
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:10,166
I could get rid of her if you'd like.

445
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:16,755
Don't cross the line.

446
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:18,382
She's my wife.

447
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:20,801
This is good.

448
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,848
Those who have more to lose
are always more cooperative.

449
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,560
This concludes my questioning.

450
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,104
Is it Chairman Bok Gi-ho?

451
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,360
Is your client
and the man behind these threats

452
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,946
Chairman Bok Gi-ho?

453
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:46,035
No.

454
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,581
But why did you think so?

455
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,583
You asked the wrong question.

456
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,376
What you should ask instead

457
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:58,756
is whether I believe you.

458
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:03,886
This concludes the questioning on my part.

459
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:37,002
I've gotten a read on the situation.

460
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,087
Yes, sir.

461
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,672
But…

462
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,217
Mr. Kim has begun to suspect you,
Chairman Bok.

463
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,555
-Isn't that her? No way.
-I can't believe it.

464
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,140
Look at how brazen she is
now that her secret's out.

465
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,685
-Can you believe her?
-She's quite something.

466
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,228
-Is it true?
-Jeez.

467
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,437
Hey, girl.

468
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,898
-Hi, Ms. Gong.
-Why didn't you come in with your husband?

469
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,443
He had to make a stop
at the convenience store.

470
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,238
Actually, he's right there.

471
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,285
Oh, I meant me.

472
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,995
I had to stop by the store.

473
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:15,332
You should come in together
since it's all open now.

474
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,084
You're right.

475
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:35,686
Oh, this?

476
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:37,730
I rented it from the store.

477
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:39,815
I thought I might need it.

478
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,278
Is something wrong?

479
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:46,572
By any chance,

480
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,659
do you feel like
you're being followed or watched?

481
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:51,785
I do.

482
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,454
When and where?

483
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,998
Just now, at work.

484
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,546
Let's come in together starting next week.

485
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,131
People think it's weird.

486
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,009
Right.

487
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,470
Then I'll meet you one stop before--

488
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,722
You think we won't run into
someone from work there?

489
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:13,223
Just come to my place.

490
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,560
-Every morning?
-No.

491
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:17,811
Every dawn.

492
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,787
Here comes our celebrity.

493
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,498
You were the talk of the town online,
you know.

494
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,961
Thank you for yesterday, Ms. Kwon.

495
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:44,880
Thanks to you,

496
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,716
I had a nice chat with our cohort members
and rekindled our friendship.

497
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,678
That's enough.

498
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,429
I'm exhausted today.

499
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,057
I thought you would've had a great time
after your confession.

500
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,226
With your husband, I mean.

501
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,437
By that, are you asking…

502
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:04,108
Are you asking if we had sex last night,

503
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:05,651
Mr. Ahn?

504
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,613
Jeez. Do you have to be so blunt about it?

505
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:13,909
Just let it go in one ear
and out the other, Ms. Son.

506
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,495
-Ms. Kwon.
-It's not that

507
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,622
I'm trying to take his side.

508
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,417
This is just tradition, I guess.

509
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,794
-"Tradition"?
-Yes.

510
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,379
Have you heard of newlywed peeping?

511
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,924
People used to poke a hole to peep at
the new couple on their wedding night.

512
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:33,095
It seems the tradition
is still alive and kicking.

513
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,681
I didn't like it either,

514
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,767
but you two will also
get a taste of it soon enough.

515
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,986
You may feel awkward and uncomfortable,

516
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,779
but it's the same for us.

517
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,991
I ask you to bear with us
until Mr. Kim Ji-uk is reassigned.

518
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:56,493
Now, good morning.

519
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,245
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

520
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,913
I apologize for causing a stir.

521
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:02,082
I look forward to working with you.

522
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,634
You know the team's vibe
depends on you, right?

523
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:16,764
You better do well

524
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,600
both at work and at home.

525
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,027
I know Ji-uk quite well,
and I'm confident he'll do well.

526
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,906
He's a great man.

527
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:54,593
-Congratulations, Ms. Son!
-Hello.

528
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:58,013
I heard the new recruit is your husband.

529
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,723
You must've saved up a lot.

530
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:01,934
Good on you for reeling in a younger man.

531
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,352
How great!

532
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,938
Being with someone
of a different age is great.

533
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,233
You two are emotionally
and physically balanced, aren't you?

534
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,068
You should have kids soon.

535
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,820
You're not getting any younger.

536
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,780
You're trying, aren't you?

537
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,740
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

538
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:33,048
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Does marriage somehow turn
one's sex life into a public affair?</font></i>

539
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,554
I've been asked if I'm having sex
and if I'm using birth control.

540
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,639
That's because they aren't having sex.

541
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:44,518
If your body's on fire, you don't care
if someone else's house is burning.

542
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,526
Even real married people
don't wear their rings as often as you do.

543
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,027
Aren't you tired of it?

544
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,905
It's thrilling and new every time.

545
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,407
I love how pretty it is.

546
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:03,829
Ja-yeon.

547
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:05,998
Come on.

548
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,501
By the way,

549
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:13,088
isn't it rare for men to buy rings?

550
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,717
It is, except for commitment rings.

551
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:22,431
Of all the rings, why did my partner buy
the ring he wore on our fake wedding?

552
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,766
Partner?
Are you talking about your fake husband?

553
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,852
-He bought a ring?
-Yeah.

554
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,270
How do you know?

555
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:30,272
Did you see him? Where did you two meet?

556
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,778
We met by chance at the jewelry store.

557
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:38,655
I see.

558
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:40,616
Well, I guess he really liked the ring.

559
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,911
But that can't be enough of a reason.

560
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,830
That thing costs a pretty penny,
and he lives in a <i><font face="Arial" color="white">gosiwon</font></i>.

561
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,957
I'll tell you what you want to hear.

562
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,460
He actually loves you

563
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:53,837
and wants to be reminded of you
by wearing the ring.

564
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,506
That seems likely, doesn't it?

565
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:58,508
She thinks I'm serious.

566
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,261
He should've told me.

567
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,805
-Come on, Ja-yeon.
-These rings are meaningless.

568
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,602
But why would he disappear without a word
if he loves you?

569
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:11,647
Exactly. It doesn't make sense.

570
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,441
Why did he buy it then?

571
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,527
Piecing everything together,

572
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,988
he simply liked it
and considered it a commitment ring.

573
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,284
I bet he has a girlfriend.

574
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:27,829
He had to get a ring anyway,
so he got the one he had tried and liked.

575
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,165
A girlfriend?

576
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,851
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Did he get a proper job
because he has a girlfriend?</font></i>

577
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,271
You forgave him?

578
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,693
You said you wouldn't settle or forgive.

579
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,111
You wanted him to face the law.

580
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,612
I have a feeling

581
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:03,782
that the hater was born rich
or even filthy rich.

582
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,243
You made the right choice.

583
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,662
Make that settlement
look like the jackpot.

584
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:10,580
Let money heal you.

585
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:12,541
I already rejected his offer.

586
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,043
I didn't want him to buy his way out
and not learn any lesson.

587
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,336
Seeking revenge outside the law?

588
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:17,921
I'll find you a hitman.

589
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,589
The orphanage Mom used to volunteer at--

590
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,426
-Do you want him stabbed or shot?
-Just take the money!

591
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,885
One shot to the left, one to the right.

592
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,513
Are you two okay?

593
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,432
Bang.

594
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,396
HANBYEOL ORPHANAGE

595
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:47,784
What brings you here?

596
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,247
Why would someone like me be here?

597
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,374
It's obvious.

598
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:57,919
I see.

599
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,546
What is it?

600
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:01,757
Community service.

601
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,302
-He's a criminal.
-I see.

602
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,016
Let me know if I can buy anything for--

603
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,559
It's laundry day today.

604
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:14,895
So, washing machines?

605
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,188
How many do you need?

606
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:18,815
I'd say

607
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:20,317
about ten.

608
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:30,702
You need to pre-wash these, okay?

609
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:35,832
Use your hands to squeeze the stains out.

610
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,961
Fortunately, there's not too much.
Thank you for your help.

611
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:41,797
Ma'am.

612
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:45,550
Do you know
what the other volunteers are doing?

613
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:48,053
They're volunteering as teachers

614
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,180
and helping the kids with their studies.

615
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:54,142
Just a moment, ma'am.

616
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:59,523
I actually know a thing or two
about education.

617
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,360
I'm afraid work that requires
interaction with the children

618
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,696
is reserved for long-term volunteers.

619
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,157
How long is long-term?

620
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,493
Well, the girl is from this orphanage.

621
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:12,619
And the boy…

622
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,163
Well, he's a man with a job now.

623
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,918
Ji-uk started coming here with his mom
since he was in high school.

624
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,545
-This looks great.
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">-It's been seven or eight years.</font></i>

625
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,547
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">That long?</font></i>

626
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,384
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Ji-uk is an angel.</font></i>

627
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:32,722
You call this a grade?

628
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,100
This is trash.

629
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,643
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">Bring me the trash can!</font></i>

630
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,270
"An angel"?

631
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,023
Or was it Lucifer?

632
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,235
Squeeze out the stains, all right?

633
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,414
You take one away here,

634
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,958
so the answer would be this one
out of these.

635
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:01,793
Got it?

636
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,344
Excuse me.

637
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:14,347
Could you watch the kids, Yu-na?

638
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,388
Isn't it right to save a person first?

639
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:58,266
It makes more sense to save
what's clean from getting dirty.

640
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:02,145
What about me?
Am I dirtier than poop-stained clothes?

641
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:04,064
These become clean when washed.

642
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,485
Hey, Lucifer.

643
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:09,819
Lucifer!

644
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,573
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

645
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:21,373
Mr. Volunteer.

646
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,752
Give them a good shake first, okay?

647
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,337
Like this.

648
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:31,383
Why are you helping anyway?
I'm dirty, aren't I?

649
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,261
So we can hang these up quickly
while the sun's still up.

650
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,389
Why not use a dryer?

651
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:39,391
This is so inefficient.

652
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:41,851
Are they worried about the electric bill?

653
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,439
We do use dryers,
but the sun's too bright to waste today.

654
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,693
They say the children's clothes and sheets

655
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,361
should smell like sunlight.

656
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:54,698
Says who?
Fabric softeners smell a lot nicer.

657
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,700
The director said so.

658
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:02,455
Children with parents grow up
remembering their parents' scents,

659
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,500
but the children here can't.

660
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:10,046
She hopes the smell of sunlight
can be the scent

661
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:13,133
they can reminisce about once they leave.

662
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,933
-Also--
-What now?

663
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:23,226
I'm doing as I'm told.

664
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,647
I've never once thought you were dirty.

665
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,693
I have no right to think so.

666
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,362
"No right"?

667
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,948
Did you also do something wrong, Lucifer?

668
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,370
I exist, for one.

669
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,711
But there's still a chance
to become clean.

670
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,173
Come this way.

671
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:57,927
Here.

672
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:03,308
Shake it.

673
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,623
Your existence?

674
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,504
Excuse me?

675
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,839
Oh, right.

676
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:45,392
Let's hang it up.

677
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,519
Could you take my picture later?

678
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,146
Your mugshot?

679
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,315
No, a shot for proof.

680
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:04,494
What's that?

681
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:06,538
Fried chicken.

682
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,873
I want fried chicken.

683
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:10,750
That sounds good.

684
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:13,962
Here are some boiled eggs
that taste like fried chicken!

685
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,549
I wish this would turn into a chicken.

686
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,314
What is it? Why are you smiling?

687
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:34,566
It's the hater.

688
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:37,652
He sent me a picture of himself
to prove his community service.

689
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,821
Give it to me. I want to see his face.

690
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:42,949
FILE EXPIRED

691
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:43,992
What's this?

692
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,785
It says it expired. I can't see it.

693
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:47,871
Oh, I see.

694
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,747
So this is what secret share is.

695
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:52,375
You can't screenshot the photo,
and it expires.

696
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,669
He has to spend
his entire day on his phone.

697
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,588
How else would he know
something like that?

698
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,757
If only he cared about your feelings
as much as his privacy.

699
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:01,926
Curse that bastard.

700
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,725
I should've sent her this one.

701
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,935
I look so much better here.

702
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:13,813
-Bye.
-Take care.

703
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:14,898
Thank you.

704
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:21,112
Secretary Kim.

705
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,241
Do I know him?

706
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,291
"How would your secretary know

707
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,460
what you don't?"

708
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:38,963
Come on.

709
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,549
I could swear I'd seen him before.

710
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,384
Where have I seen him?

711
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:46,930
Wait.

712
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:49,057
Bok Gyu-hyun?

713
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,477
Oh, my gosh. It really is you!

714
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,488
Am I right?

715
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,282
You're Gyu-hyun, right?
Gi-ho and Jeong-a's son.

716
00:47:06,783 --> 00:47:07,784
No, I'm not.

717
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,118
Yeah, you are.

718
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:13,039
I'm Eom So-hye,
the director of the Chaeum Art Gallery.

719
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,379
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you,
Director Eom.

720
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:22,298
It's quite dark,
and I didn't expect to see you here.

721
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:24,300
What brings you here?

722
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:27,011
Isn't it obvious
why people like us would be here?

723
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:29,514
It's not like we'd be here

724
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,475
to do community service
for our crimes, am I right?

725
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:34,811
Of course.

726
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,938
I'm here for positive press.

727
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,065
My husband Mu-san
is headed to prison again.

728
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:40,900
-Again?
-Yeah.

729
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:42,151
Oh, right.

730
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:46,155
I've been elected the president of RWFCC,

731
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,826
the Righteous Wives
of Financial Criminals Committee.

732
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:51,202
In short, RWFCC.

733
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:54,789
Congratulations, Director…

734
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,499
I mean, President Eom.

735
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,835
Thank you. Why are you here?

736
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:00,795
Positive press.

737
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,881
It's a must for people like us,
which is why we're so busy.

738
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,425
-All right, bye.
-Goodbye.

739
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,017
Goodness, who's this precious guest?

740
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:16,853
You wanted to go to work together.

741
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,730
No, I mean that.

742
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:23,151
Is this your car?

743
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,779
It's not mine, but I'm allowed to use it.

744
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,116
Get in.

745
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:39,292
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">I bet he has a girlfriend.</font></i>

746
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,837
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">He had to get a ring anyway,
so he got the one he had tried and liked.</font></i>

747
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,759
Do you have a girlfriend?

748
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,428
No.

749
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:52,472
Any flings?

750
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:01,230
I don't have a girlfriend or even a fling,

751
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:03,524
but I do have someone special.

752
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:05,068
You do?

753
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:12,033
It's you.

754
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,579
My wife.

755
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:19,624
We're…

756
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,418
a married couple on weekdays, remember?

757
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:45,692
Have you had breakfast?

758
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,860
There's a triangle <i><font face="Arial" color="white">gimbap</font></i> in the back.

759
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,700
Sit up, will you? You'll turn into a cow
if you eat while lying down.

760
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:57,537
Ma'am.

761
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:58,788
Moo.

762
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,860
You're not a kid anymore.

763
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,460
Thanks for the food.

764
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:29,462
I haven't had this in a while.

765
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,881
Why do you skip breakfast?

766
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:34,509
You used to buy <i><font face="Arial" color="white">gimbap</font></i>
from the convenience store all the time.

767
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:35,968
They're always out these days.

768
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:38,930
And I only like
the mustard mayonnaise and tuna one.

769
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:40,890
That's the most popular one.

770
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:43,142
Since when?

771
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:46,187
I could always get one
when you used to work…

772
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,284
Why did you buy that ring?

773
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:05,122
I went back to rent it again, so I know.

774
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,335
Oh, did you?

775
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:16,592
That's why I asked you

776
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:18,427
if you had a girlfriend.

777
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,055
I really don't.

778
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,599
If I did,
I wouldn't be doing this with you.

779
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:25,101
Then why did you buy it?

780
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,021
Is this also something you can't tell me?

781
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:34,277
Well, the thing is…

782
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,242
This is Son Hae-yeong.

783
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:44,245
I see.

784
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:45,788
Excuse me?

785
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:52,378
KKULBEE EDUCATION

786
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,881
Morning, Secretary Yeo.
I hope you didn't have a good weekend.

787
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:56,757
Unfortunately, I had a great one.

788
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:58,217
The PR team called

789
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:00,344
and they want you at the hotel
for a press conference.

790
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:02,763
A press conference? For what?

791
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,849
Apparently, it's to publicize
Kkulbee's good works.

792
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:06,684
Basically, corporate PR.

793
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,020
I absolutely hate corporate PR work.

794
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,396
I told them I wouldn't…

795
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,108
Why? What is it, sir?

796
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:15,484
I went to an orphanage

797
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:17,862
over the weekend.

798
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,197
Yes, you went to pay for your sins!

799
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:23,159
And I met Director Eom
of Chaeum Art Gallery there.

800
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:26,287
I guess she told my dad
that I went to volunteer.

801
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,956
Then you'll have positive articles
written about you.

802
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,166
You should attend then.

803
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:32,209
My name can't be in the headlines!

804
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:35,421
Don't tell me you actually
have a conscience.

805
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:37,089
The articles would show my face.

806
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,343
Then Ms. Yeon will find out
her hater is the CEO of Kkulbee!

807
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:43,387
Get the car ready. Now!

808
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,807
I need to go before you
to get the car ready!

809
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:48,476
This is ridiculous.

810
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:50,269
I'm Kkulbee's CEO.

811
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,939
How could they set up a press conference
without letting me know?

812
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,484
Don't hold me back.
I'm going to give them an earful.

813
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:58,152
Where is it? Is this it?

814
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:01,113
Dad!

815
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,076
Oh, my goodness, Mr. Bok.

816
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,452
Hello, sir.

817
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,121
Hello, sir.

818
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:10,581
What?

819
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,086
The volunteer…

820
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,756
He's our CEO.

821
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:22,885
Oh, Mr. Bok.

822
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,221
It's nice to meet you.

823
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:28,307
I'm Kim Ji-uk,
a new recruit with the 23rd cohort.

824
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:32,103
He's also my husband, sir.

825
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:34,063
Your husband?

826
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:37,608
This is the couple
that stirred the online forum.

827
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,652
The team leader and the new recruit.

828
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,405
Why are you two here?

829
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,658
We received a call from the PR team.

830
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:48,869
Kkulbee is sponsoring
a child abuse prevention campaign,

831
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:52,707
and they wanted us
to talk about the incident at the OJT.

832
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:55,501
Right, I heard about it
from Attorney Kang.

833
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:59,005
I'm sorry I was too busy
to recognize your act of bravery.

834
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:01,090
Not at all, sir.

835
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:04,218
You're the true hero for agreeing
to let the legal team take on the case.

836
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:07,138
I would like to thank you sincerely.

837
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,768
Anyway, I hear Chairman Bok
is going to be present.

838
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:14,437
Mr. Bok Gyu-hyun.

839
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:19,775
Where's Chairman Bok, Mr. Jang?

840
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:24,030
He'll arrive with Ms. Seon
after the press conference.

841
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:25,281
My mother is coming too?

842
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:29,326
She commends the brave employees
who made the company proud

843
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,538
and wishes to meet them in person.

844
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:34,790
I see.

00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:14,455
RECORDING 12

847
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,915
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">I've gotten a read on the situation.</font></i>

848
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:19,126
<i><font face="Arial" color="white">But Mr. Kim has begun to suspect you,

I shall proceed with the operation.</font></i>

850
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:24,840
"Operation"?

851
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:28,219
And Ms. Son will be included, sir.

852
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:39,647
Ma'am.

853
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,651
I have something to tell you.

854
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:45,027
Right now?

855
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,279
Yes, right now.

856
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:51,117
Is it about the ring?

857
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:54,954
Well…

858
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,832
Am I part of the reason

859
00:56:58,916 --> 00:56:59,834
why you bought the ring?

860
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:03,629
What if you are?

861
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,092
Listen, Ji-uk.

862
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:12,179
I'm about to promote a campaign
at a press conference

863
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:13,806
as a representative of my company

864
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:16,267
and share a meal
with the chairman and the CEO.

865
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:18,769
Do you know what this means to me?

866
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:21,772
It's an opportunity.

867
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,150
One that I'll regret forever if I blow it.

868
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:30,531
So if you feel hesitant to say it

869
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:32,408
and if it isn't a big deal,

870
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:34,702
just don't tell me.

871
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:42,877
Right now, I want to go full steam ahead.

872
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,129
I don't want

873
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,756
any regrets.

{\an8}GOOD EDUCATION BY A GOOD COMPANY,
OFFICE COUPLE SAVES CHILD FROM ABUSE

877
00:58:43,354 --> 00:58:44,813
This really doesn't feel right.

878
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:45,940
Let's just go.

879
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,484
Why do you feel so uncomfortable
about a meal with Chairman Bok?

880
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:51,070
Just think of him as my doting uncle.

881
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:53,572
Maybe you could do that,
but to me, he's the top boss.

882
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:55,532
Someone ordinary workers don't ever meet.

883
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:59,203
Exactly. It'd be nice
to leave a good impression.

884
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:01,497
You're a man of ambition, aren't you?

885
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,873
That's why I picked you.

886
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:05,626
You picked me?

887
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:08,337
Like I'm some toy to play with?

888
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:10,881
You know that's not what I meant.

889
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:15,761
Fine, then. Let's just leave
if you're really that uncomfortable.

890
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:28,816
We can't just go
when the owner's family is all there.

891
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:33,153
Exactly.

892
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,043
Have a seat.

893
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,258
Mr. Kim Ji-uk.

894
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:00,973
Hey, Lucifer.

895
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:04,351
Are you nervous?
How about a glass of wine?

896
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:05,853
Actually…

897
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:08,647
Can't hold your drink, can you?

898
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:11,942
Not really.
I've never had wine before either.

899
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:13,485
My apologies.

900
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:15,487
No need. I can't drink either.

901
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:18,407
Whatever type of alcohol it is,
I'm done after one sip.

902
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:20,576
I take after my father.

903
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:27,541
Chairman Bok and Ms. Seon have arrived.

904
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,921
-Welcome.
-Hello.

905
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:33,964
Hello.

906
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:35,507
Hello.

907
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:38,927
Have a seat.

908
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,304
You're here, Yi-lin.

909
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:41,597
Yes, sir.

910
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,515
-This is my--
-This isn't a formal event.

911
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:47,227
I just wanted to treat you to a meal
when I heard about your heroic feat.

912
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:49,646
Team Leader Son Hae-yeong,

913
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:53,108
I hear you're as brave
as you're competent.

914
01:00:55,194 --> 01:00:57,071
Thank you for the kind words, sir.

915
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,241
And you must be Mr. Kim Ji-uk.

916
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:06,372
It's a pleasure.

917
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:24,723
Ms. Son,

918
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:27,726
may I ask how old you are?

919
01:01:31,647 --> 01:01:33,732
I'm 33, sir.

920
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:37,361
And your parents?

921
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:39,863
My father passed away,

922
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:43,742
and my mother is at a nursing home
due to her illness.

923
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:47,579
Oh, dear. How unfortunate
that your father passed away so early.

924
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:51,291
How did he…

925
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:54,878
It was an accident, sir.

926
01:01:57,798 --> 01:01:59,174
It was such a sudden tragedy

927
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:01,844
that must've hurt her deeply.

928
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:06,140
I apologize for bringing
the matter up, Ms. Son.

929
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:08,225
It is all right, ma'am.

930
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,144
How do you know that?

931
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:14,022
Well, Ms. Son was my junior in college.

932
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,568
My seniors helped me a lot back then.

933
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:20,028
I had no siblings
and was still young then,

934
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:21,071
so I needed guidance.

935
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:24,074
What about your mother?

936
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:26,702
Is she suffering from a genetic disease?

937
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:28,954
-Chairman Bok.
-Honey.

938
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:36,962
When I visited my in-laws,

939
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:40,048
my father-in-law asked me
why I decided to marry his son.

940
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:43,093
-So I said--
-Right, I should ask that.

941
01:02:44,178 --> 01:02:46,638
What drew you to Mr. Kim?

942
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:50,058
He's younger, and I heard
he worked at a convenience store.

943
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:55,689
It must've been
love at first sight at the store.

944
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:57,900
Ms. Son cares about looks, sir.

945
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,196
You should thank your parents

946
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,573
for passing on such good genes.

947
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:09,578
What drew you to Ms. Son, Mr. Kim?

948
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,415
She's quick-witted
and good at judging people,

949
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:15,209
so she may come off cold.

950
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:17,336
Why don't you be more honest

951
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,630
and say that I'm calculating
because I hate losing out?

952
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,341
That's not what I said.

953
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,431
I don't know my father.

954
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:34,102
According to my grandmother,

955
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:39,149
he was an asshole
who wouldn't even claim his child.

956
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:48,742
My birth itself ruined my mother's life
and deeply hurt my grandmother.

957
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:51,703
I was always afraid

958
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:57,167
that I might ruin someone's life again.

959
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:00,295
That's why

960
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:03,423
I was drawn
to Ms. Son's calculating nature.

961
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:08,595
She's someone
who avoids suffering losses at all costs,

962
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,681
and yet she chose me.

963
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:13,976
It made me think…

964
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:17,813
that I could be someone

965
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,233
who doesn't ruin
the life of someone dear to me.

966
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,652
So I wasn't afraid

967
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,363
or hesitant…

968
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,033
to love Ms. Son.

969
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:45,507
How dull.
No one else seems to be drinking.

970
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,676
I know Chairman Bok
and Gyu-hyun can't drink.

971
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,013
Then drink with my husband, ma'am.

972
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:52,639
He's a heavyweight.

973
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,144
Is that true?

974
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:00,063
Yes, I love drinking.

975
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,316

977
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,861
I can handle my drink too, ma'am.

978
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:13,785
So except for Father, Mr. Kim, and I,

979
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:15,579
you all are heavy drinkers?

980
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:17,539
Do you not drink either?

981
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,000
I do, sir.

982
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:21,960
I can hold my alcohol.

983
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,911
