You're here as Nam Ja-yeon's guardian.

Ma'am, please make a report.

47

That her foster mom
can't care for her kids,

48
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,046
and disqualify her.

[teacher scoffs] You should be
disqualified as a human, huh?

50
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,344
Your mother is in the hospital

You don't mean writing, right?

Even back at home,
all she does is write stories.

59
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,614
[teacher] Exactly.

60
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,115
Coming from a poor family like hers,

61
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,576
she needs to study,
not write silly stories.

Could you just be more encouraging of her?

[Hae-yeong] If she does well,
you get to brag about it.

80

And if she fails, it's her own fault.

A handful of times...

180
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,929
with my unit in the military.

181
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,015
With your... unit?

182
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,309
Some of them have nowhere to go
when they're on leave.

183
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,351
Oh.

184
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,313
So then, uh... it was somewhere to crash.

185
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,482
Well, you've never been to one
for another reason?

186
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,775
What are you asking me?

187
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,821
Oh, just... I feel like I owe it to you

188
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,950
as someone who, let's say,
has been around the block.

189
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,994
Maybe I could share...

190
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,955
the things I've learned with a rookie?

191
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,042

192
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,085
[cat meows effect]

193
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,795
Was it not enough for you?

194
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:30,589
What?

195
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,925
The kiss.

196
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,596
[Producer Yun] Okay, groom,
you may kiss the bride now.

197
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,182
[guests chuckling, exclaiming]

198
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,351
-[male guest] Kiss!
-[whispers] I told you to take this out!

199
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,352
-Go on. Kiss.
-I already said

200
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,478
-that I didn't wanna do this part.
-Guests, keep clapping,

201
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,688
-the bride and groom need encouragement!
-[guests chuckling]

202
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,690
And to the happy couple,
if you hear clapping,

203
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,858
then keep on kissing.

204
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,527
-[Producer Yun] Okay, honored guests...
-Uh...

205
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,572
-...a round of applause for the newlyweds!
-[guests cheering, applauding]

206
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:04,164
[Producer Yun] All right,
bride and groom, kiss now!

207
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,510
Not some little peck on the cheek.

208
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,970
Oh, we need a real kiss.
You all need to clap louder.

209
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,807
Everyone, clap!
Let me hear some real applause.

210
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,809
-[guests cheering, applauding]
-[Producer Yun] Clap!

211
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,395
Okay, groom, you're going
straight for her lips, all right?

212
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,898
-[camera shutter clicking]
-[guests chanting] Kiss her now!

213

[pensive music playing]

221
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,292
I need to get back home.

222
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,044
My son is going to visit.

223
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:53,213
-[aide] Ma'am, just a moment...
-Oh, Mom, Mom!

224
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,965
-[aide] Please, ma'am, just come sit down
-[Hae-yeong's mother] My son...

-[Hae-yeong] Mom!
-Please let me go!

226
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,302
We can wrap this up here.

227
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,304
[guests murmuring]

228
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,973
[Hae-yeong] Come on, Mom.
It's okay. I've got her.

229
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,269
[pensive music continues]

230
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,856
[scoffs] "Not enough"?

231
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,526
Hey, you know,
it's like when you watch a sports game.

232
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,570
It's no fun...

233
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,488
unless both teams are...

234
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,116
are evenly matched.

235

[sensual music playing]

236
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,677
It's my first time at a hotel,

237
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,680
it's not my first time doing other things.

238

[music stops]

242
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,376
Why...

243
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,337
are your eyes open?

244
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,260
[sensual music continues]

245
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,600
What? You've never kissed
with your eyes open?

246
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,936
Am I right?
Is that the way you were taught to kiss?

247
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,103
Kiss with eyes closed?

248
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,985
[grunts] Just go shower.

249
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,403
There's a lot to get done.

250
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:41,947
Like what?

251
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,866
The one thing a couple wants,
done on their wedding night.

252
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,119
To add up all the cash.

253
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,580
You're good at counting money, right?

254
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,499
[soft chuckle]

255
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,918
Yeah.

258
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,099
Nice job, Hae-yeong.

259
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,102
No, really, well done, girl.

260
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:16,022
[muffled exhale]
You were practically a Buddha just now.

261
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,024
[muffled deep breath]

262
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,985
I didn't let my desire rule me.

263
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,195
[deep breath] Wow!

264
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,698
[sighs]

265

"'Why is that?
Is there a reason I should hold back?'

266
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,582
Asked Ha-jun as his gaze
traveled down Yeon-seo's body.

267
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,459
'I see reasons I shouldn't.
They're all over your body.'

268
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,213
Ha-jun's lips dove straight for..."

269
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,132
{\an8}Yeon Bo-ra's the writer.

270
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,385
{\an8}Online, she's quite a well-known author.

271
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,763
[Gyu-hyun] That drama that did well,
<i>What's Wrong with President Kim?,</i>

272
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,223
was based on one of her novels.

273
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,769
And the sequel, <i>Work Proposal,</i>
got a whopping 100 million views.

274
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,524
I read one of her recent interviews,
and she sounds quite determined.

275
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,235
{\an8}She'll end her life if she gets found out.

276
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,322
{\an8}Apparently, her objective
is to write a book so raunchy

277
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,033
{\an8}that readers would have no choice
but to take it with them to the grave.

278
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:08,950
{\an8}[retches]

279
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,703
Dear God.

280
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,581
To think someone is out in the world
with that objective.

281
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:15,790
Does it make sense?

282
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,959
No, it doesn't make a lick of sense.

283
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,879
With how this book is going,
they need to take a break, or...

284
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,922
What... are you talking about?

285
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,258
[sharp inhale] Ah, you don't get it.

286
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,553
And the male lead is called Ha-jun...

287
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,263
Ha-jun?

288
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,557
That's why I was especially offended.

289
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,685
'Cause I was reminded of you, Ha-jun.

291
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,607
You make me read a novel
with an explicit sex scene,

292
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,610
then tell me... you were thinking of me?

293
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,113
Was not! Don't phrase it like that.

294
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,615
You're making it sound weird.

295
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,826
I hope you have a good defense for this.

296
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,162
Unless you want there to be
a scandal in the press.

I... I... No, I've never had one thought

298
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,292
that you could sue me for in any way.

299
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,169
Not for a second, not even a single one!

300
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,838
That's not something
the guilty side determines.

301
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,299
The degree to which instances of bullying

302
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:09,427
and the abuse of power
run rampant in the workplace drives me...

303
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:10,720
[Gyu-hyun] It was my mom!

314

So... you admitted yourself
because of what your mom reads?

No, that's not why.

316
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,809

how people can write negative comments

to cause a... breakdown?

with your mother.

In my place,

328
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,596
could you say, "Mother, I won't allow you

329
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,348
to read these lurid novels
with sex scenes in such explicit detail"?

with the safe combination.

353

You're a little suspicious.

you clam up or change the subject.

Here's what I mean.

359
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,604
I don't know who your Canada person is,

360

I don't know anything about you at all.

363
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,827
But you don't need to tell me
all those things.

364
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,371
I believe trust is formed

Don't worry, I can...

619

[groans] Kitty, that little shit...

[cell phone buzzing]

887
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,895
I haven't had a glimpse of this cat
or that damn guy.

888
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,188
[Hui-seong] The cat's still here?

889
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:56,898
You know you agreed to a week.

890
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,359
I have to find her first
to get her outta here.

891
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,236
-[cell phone buzzing]
-[Hae-yeong] She's hidden away.

892
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,570
I can't find her anywhere.

893
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:05,156
She eats, poops, sheds, and breaks things

894
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,616
while I'm not around, then poof!

895
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,118
She's the devil.

896
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:11,246
Kitty is not a cat.

897
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:13,248
[Hui-seong] Try not feeding her.

898
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,166
Once she's starving, she'll show or go.

899
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,973
What about the cashier?
Still not in touch?

900
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,935
[sighs] What's up with that doofus?

901
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:37,772
We had a nice breakfast at the hotel,
we were on good terms at the airport.

902
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,566
So why totally ghost me?

903
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:41,025
Why won't he answer me then?

904
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:42,193
[cat meows]

905
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,196
She only meows when I talk about Ji-uk.

906
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:46,781
Does she understand?

907
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:50,577
So come clean.

908
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,036
You all had sex!

909
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:53,830
[cat shrieks effect]

910
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:55,290
I told you, no.

911
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,125
Makes no sense.

912
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,503
The only reason to ghost
after spending a night together

913
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,255
is because they don't want
to get tied down!

914
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:05,425
Okay. Let's say that we had.

915
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,510
Why would he even be the one to ghost?

916
00:48:07,594 --> 00:48:09,596
Sure, there's men
who've never slept with me,

917
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:10,930
but no one's ever done it just once.

918
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,515
I mean, they've always come back for more.

919
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,601
And all the men
who haven't slept with you...

920
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,811
had their reasons. What about them?

921
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,564
-You're outta touch. [groans]
-[footsteps]

922

[comical music playing]

924
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,116
Oh, Ja-yeon, you look like...

925
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,162
A rich girl?

926
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:37,248
Did you not buy a sense of style too?

927
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:41,127
[Hui-seong] Ja-yeon,
you may have on luxury brands,

928
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,671
but you're letting them wear you,
and it makes you a walking ad.

929
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,798
-It's a bit much.
-What's the occasion?

930
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:46,758
[sharp inhale]

931
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,301
Just...

932
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:51,137
going on a walk.

933
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,472
[sighs, groans]

934
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:54,557
On another note,

935
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,769
what is... the producer doing?

936
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:58,811
Tae-hyeong?

937
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:01,522
{\an8}-Right now, he...
-Messaging some girl, I'm sure.

938
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,274

940
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:06,778
[sighs]

941
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:10,031
What's so fun about
texting your boyfriend of ten years?

942
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:13,576
If you have time for that,
go see him and flirt in person!

943
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,870
Instead, you're hogging up the sofa.

944
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,039
[comical music playing]

945
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:20,708
Bye for now.

949
00:49:42,313 --> 00:49:43,481
Here we go.

-[car door slams]
-[flies buzzing effect]

953
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,080
[Gyu-hyun] It still shows, doesn't it?

954
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,332
My innate poise, class, and refinement.

955
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:04,043
You look like a... a fallen man.
The kind who trolls online.

956
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:07,422
It's giving "unemployed,
loser, man-child". Good.

957
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:08,506
[sighs]

958
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:11,759
Do I... really need to go do this?

959
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,720
The CEO was clear.

960
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:17,390
If this ends up in the papers,
you won't be his son or the president.

961
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:20,518
-[both sigh]
-President.

962
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:23,646
{\an8}Your pride, your ego, self-worth.

963
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:24,856
{\an8}Drop all those now!

964
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,358
Today, you focus on only one thing.

965
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:29,944
President Bok Gyu-hyun! CEO Bok Gyu-hyun!

966
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,738
[resolute music playing]

967
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:32,697
Yeo Ha-jun!

968
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:35,908
Say you were... jobless and sad.
Get down and beg.

969
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:37,994
Think of your future. You got that?

970
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:39,579
[Gyu-hyun] Hmm!

971
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:44,417
[sighs] Then ready to practice
your heartfelt and sincere apology?

972
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,461
[Ha-jun] Yeah.

973
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:50,339
[blows air]

974
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:51,424
You know why you're here, right?

975
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,552
-I'm sorry.
-Writing hateful comments online?

976
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:55,845
Nothing better to do, huh?

977
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,558
-I'm very sorry.
-Oh, Mr. High-And-Mighty here!

978
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,435
No remorse yet, punk?

-[siren wailing]
-Hey, get this guy booked, huh?

980
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:06,689
Could you please forgive me?

981
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,150
-[cat meows effect]
-Good boy.

982
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,694
Call me when it's all over.

983
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:14,614

[Gyu-hyun] Secretary...

985

Secretary. Hey!

986
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:19,827
[grunts] No!

00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:34,801
-That right?
-Yes.

993
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,762
And your handle... "LUCK YOU"?

994
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:41,015
Oh... your last name means "luck".

995
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,226
Correct.

996
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,895
You could use some luck about now.

997
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:49,357
[detective]
I'll have you confirm your comments.

998
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,234
Read them, out loud.

999
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,110
I-I...?

1000
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:55,488
Should I sully my mouth with those?

1001
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,323
You wrote them, you read them.

more harshly than defamation?

Yes.

1089

I was a little disappointed
the ceremony got cut short,

1090
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:11,285
and that I wasn't able to, um...
see you onstage.

1091

Sorry for that. It was a personal matter.

The commenter
left something behind for you.

1109
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:24,817
Hey, you should've told me what happened.

1110
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,652
Why didn't you let us in on it?

1111
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,573
I thought you'd worry about me.

1112
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:31,699
Birdbrain!

1113
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:33,742
And why did you run away?

1114
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:35,536
He's the one in the wrong here.

Dressed up like you are,

1116
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,457
why not just give him a swift kick
between the legs?

1117
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,378
Honestly, that's what I wanted.

1118
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,465
But then when I actually saw him,
I got scared.

1119
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:53,554
Was he scary? Like a tough guy?

1120
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:57,308
Normal, he was a normal man.

1121
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:01,353
He asked a person
who fell over if they were all right,

1122
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,982
he retrieved their cell phone,

1123
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:09,028
and left it with the police
for safekeeping.

1124
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,072
He was a normal person.

1125
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:16,702
And normal people like him are the ones
who write hateful things online.

1126
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:23,292
That's... why I was scared.
