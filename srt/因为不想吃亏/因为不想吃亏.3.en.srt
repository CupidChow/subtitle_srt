instead of cleaning up a man,
just rearrange your furniture.

You put all that work
into transforming a man,

118
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,754
and he'll just dump you for some
younger girl the first chance he gets.

than a blessing.

Is that why you tried to show him up
with your beautiful face?

179
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,108
Pretty lame, huh?
I was being a loser, I'll admit it.

180
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,359
Don't say that.

181
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,778
Ahn Woo-jae was never as good-looking
as you are.

182
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,281
And besides,
you've got limitless potential.

183
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,116
You win, hands down!

184
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,121
By the way, you and he broke up
not too long ago, right?

185
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,373
It seemed like he was already married.

186
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,834
Apparently, he and his wife
had been dating for over a year.

187
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,003
A year? Wow. So...

188
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,423
[Ji-uk] Oh.

189
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,425
I'm sorry,
that was dumb of me to bring up.

190
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,927
No. I was the dumb one.

191
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,555
He tricked me for six whole months.

192
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,934
Anyway, though,

193
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,854
you surprisingly know
a lot about me already.

194
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,150
Where I live, who my friends are,
even the people I've dated.

195
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,236
That's why you shouldn't talk
so loudly in public.

196
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,196
I end up overhearing things
even when I don't want to.

197
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,657
Do you think store cashiers
are silent NPCs or something?

198
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,784
I blathered on
about all those personal details?

199
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,912
Wait, even so,
how are you able to remember all that?

200
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,080
[Ji-uk] I just do, okay?

201
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,166
All the things you say,
all the things you do,

202
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,418
everything.

203
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,337
[pensive music playing]

204
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,258
I'm a computer.

206

[scoffs]

207
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,764
[Hae-yeong] In any case,

208
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,016
it's nice to be on the same side
as you, rabid dog.

209
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,476
For a change.

210
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,144
-It's reassuring.
-On the same side?

211
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,355
We're on the same team, you know?
You're gonna be my husband.

212
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,439
Huh?

213
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,568
[chuckles] Once the wedding's over
and done with, that's it, we're through.

214
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,904
[cutely]
Aw, is my hubby feeling embarrassed?

215
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:55,822
Hmm...

216
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,034
[scoffs] Really?

217
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,084
I've been wanting to repay Hae-yeong
for how sweet she's been.

218
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,795
[Woo-jae] <i>They've known each other
since they were kids?</i>

219
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,922
<i>How long have they been together then?</i>

220
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,883
I'm so glad I got the chance today
to help her out.

221
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,135
[Woo-jae] <i>Is that the reason
she broke up with me?</i>

222
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,221
<i>So she could start dating him?</i>

223
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,890
That being said,
her fiancÃ© has such a great body,

224
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,183
he'd look good in anything.

225
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,393
That little shit.

226
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,688
Did you just call me a little shit?

227
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,315
Huh?

228
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,401
Oh, no. [chuckles nervously]

229
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,403
I didn't mean you, Yi-lin.

230
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:35,737
You were jealous, huh?

231
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:38,782
Jealous?

232
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,785
Did you not like me picking out
another man's tuxedo

233
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,328
and telling him how good he looked?

234
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,455
Oh... [chuckles]

235
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,790
Yeah, I was a little annoyed.

236
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,251
I went too far, I know.

237
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,961
I was just so happy.

238
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,254
Ah, yeah.

239
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,215
Hae-yeong's husband-to-be,
he sure is a handsome guy.

240
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,216
[Woo-jae chuckles softly]

241
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,844
That's not it though.

242
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,263
Something else was bothering me
about it all.

243
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,557
You and Hae-yeong.

244
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,226
[curious music playing]

245
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:10,897
Hae-yeong is super smart, attractive,
and has an incredible personality.

246
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,942
She totally seems like she'd be your type.

247
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,403
-Mm-hmm.
-Wait, Hae-yeong?

248
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,114
What are you saying?
I don't know what you're talking about.

249
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,160
Well, I'm glad. That's good.

255
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:41,970
AND SOFT FLESH COLLIDING

256
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,680

ONE WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR

{\an8}THAT HIS GIRTHY INSTRUMENT

264
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,154
HAD BULGED UP NOTICEABLY

265
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,323
AND MADE ITS PRESENCE KNOWN

-You reading something?

-What book is it?
-[Jeong-a] Huh? Oh...

Sweetie, you're gonna be late.

271
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,547
Um, well, please recommend
any good books later.

272
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:18,924
Then I'll be off.

273
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,634
Hold on.

274
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,512
I heard you're creating
a task force for a contest

275
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,846
that will report directly to you?

276
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,973
-That's right, Mother.
-Careful, son.

277
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,936
My warning about keeping women,
especially the single ones,

278

at arm's length...

279
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,688
It still holds, okay?

280
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,236
Speaking of, there's something
I need to tell you in regards to that.

281
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,322
Mother,

282
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,700
I've never disobeyed you,
nor have I had any problems with women.

283
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,578
In fact, I've never even had
a proper relationship.

[sighs]

285
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:55,001

simply because they're unmarried

[sighs bitterly]

Even with all the wealth I possess...

290
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,096
I was called that my entire life,
all because I married the wrong man.

291
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,722
Have I not suffered enough?

292
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,641
Am I doomed to see my son
repeat the same mistakes?

293
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,226
Mother, please! I'd...

294
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,811
I trust you, sweetheart.

295
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:14,896
But, Gyu-hyun...

Bok Gi-ho's blood
also runs through your veins.

irresponsible, and impulsive bastard.

I promise to keep my word
if it'll put you more at ease, Mother.

If not for my sake, then do it for yours.

Your father is only forgiving
when it comes to his own faults.

304
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,551
He'd never be understanding with his son.

305
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,636
You need to be cautious at all times

You never know.

00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,484
He may try and find a hidden alternative.

00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,208
And these are the wedding invitations.
Here you are.

351
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,376
Here you go.

352
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,962
[chuckles] Mmm.

353
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,756
I should attend
to give you a wedding gift.

354
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,634
Oh, uh,
that's not necessary, President Bok.

355
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,512
Kkulbee Education really takes care
of its married employees.

356
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,680
We have the best benefits in the industry.

357
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,974
So all the benefits
the company provides at the wedding...

358
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,060
I already consider that
to be your wedding gift, Mr. President.

359
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,938
[comical music playing]

360
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,691
[elevator dings]

361
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,238
Congratulations, Hae-yeong,
on your wedding.

362
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,365
Thank you, Mr. President.

363
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,079
[sighs]

364
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,332
Eat, eat, eat!

365
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,008
Mmm!

366
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,718
It's really good! Not too sweet.

367
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,678
-[Secretary Yeo] Mmm!
-[sighs in disbelief]

368
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,054
But, um,

369
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,224
doesn't handing out wedding invites during
working hours count as slacking off?

370
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,687
Listen, Yeo,
I welcome the time our employees

371
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,940
spend not working due to their wedding,
pregnancy, childbirth, or raising kids!

372
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,027
Our company's rival isn't Genie Education
or Giga Study, but...

373
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,153
Korea's low birth rate.

374
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,323
Because the national birth rate is equal
to Kkulbee Education's growth rate!

375
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,908
If lots of people get married,
have children,

376
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,409
and get excited about giving said children

377
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,161
the best preschool
and private education.

378
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,788
You'll become even wealthier,
Mr. President.

379
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,122
Now you're getting it.

380
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:02,957
[door shuts]

381
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,002
Marriage, pregnancy, birth, childcare?

382
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,378
He should try it.

383
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,839
-[Secretary Yeo grunts]
-Secretary Yeo.

384
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:11,549
Mr. President?

385
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,427
Hae-yeong's wedding...
go for me, will you?

386
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,595
I want to give her a wedding present.

387
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,473
A president keeps his promise
even if it was made in jest.

388
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,808
[scoffs]

389
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,060
I should go? Why?

390
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,479
Are you saying I should attend?
And make her more nervous?

391
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,773
[comical music playing]

392
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,443
[sighs] He makes the joke
and I'm the one...

393
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,533
[exhales in relief]

394
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,330
GROOM KIM JI-UK
BRIDE SON HAE-YEONG

395
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,085
KIM JI-UK AND SON HAE-YEONG

396
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,920
-Please come.
-[employee 1] Congratulations.

397
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,004
[employee 2]
Are you really getting married?

398
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,549
-Finally, right?
-[employee 3] I'm so happy for you!

399
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,925
[employee 2] I'll be there.

400
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,635
-Great, and take lots of pictures!
-[employee 2] Okay.

401
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,054
-And stay for lunch. The food's great.
-[employee 2] Congratulations!

402
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,265
[happy music playing]

403
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,684
[sighs]

404
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,478
[chuckles softly]

405
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:08,815
KIM JI-UK AND SON HAE-YEONG

406
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,358
WE CORDIALLY INVITE YOU
TO OUR WEDDING...

407
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,485
[employee 4]
Hey, have you tried the cookies?

408
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,070
Hey, everyone, so sorry I'm late.

409
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,864
Not at all, we were early, so...

410
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,282
[asst. manager]
The materials are all prepped for you.

411
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,367
-Oh, thank you.
-By the way, girl,

412
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,245
I know you've been super busy
with all your wedding preparations,

413
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,997
but you forgot the most important thing.

414
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,623
Wait, what?

415
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,585
-I thought I looked over everything.
-Not the meeting material.

416
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,171
There isn't a single picture
of the groom anywhere, babe!

417
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:33,381
Not even on the e-invites.

418
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,384
I heard your groom
was really good-looking too.

419
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,720
[muffled chuckle]
Oh, I might've let it slip.

420
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,388
[Ms. Gong] Are you telling me
that even Yi-lin

421
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,181
gets to see your groom's face,
but I don't?

422
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,267
-I'm hurt, girl.
-[laughs nervously]

423
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,643
I don't want to spoil anything.

424
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,228
-It's the highlight of the wedding.
-[employees] Oh!

425
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,272
Oh, wow,
look how she's not even denying it.

426
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,565
[Yi-lin] Aww.

427
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,318
By the way, Hae-yeong,
did he give you a proposal?

428
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:54,819
"Proposal"?

429
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,863
[comical music playing]

430
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,075
-[Hae-yeong] <i>How about you?</i>
-[Ji-uk] <i>What?</i>

431
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,162
That's what I'm asking you.
Will you be my groom?

432
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,915
Huh?

433
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,416
I need a groom, all right?

434
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:10,752
Oh, of course!

435
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,630
I'm getting married
because I got a proposal!

436
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,506
[Asst. Manager Lee] My husband
only proposed after we'd set the date.

437
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,050
I kind of had to force him.

438
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,344
Me too, that's how I was proposed to.

439
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:20,845
Uh, what?

440
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,681
Oh, see, I hate that.
If you're going to propose,

441
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,016
you've gotta do it right!

442
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,602
Proposing just because you feel obligated,

443
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,355
or that someone asked you to,
or because of the wedding date,

444
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,315
then you're celebrating your marriage
more than a real proposal.

445
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,983
-[Ms. Gong] Totally.
-[Asst. Manager Lee] You're so right.

446
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,778
Hey, uh, you're not wearing a ring.

447
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,196
[curious music playing]

448
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,742
Don't you need a ring
to have a proper proposal?

449
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,119
Quit it.

450
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,704
[Woo-jae] Come on, I'm right.

451
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,583
[chuckles cheekily]

452
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,336
Oh, girl, you're makin' me curious!

453
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,589
How'd your man manage to get a "yes"
out of you, without even a ring?

454
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,632
Uh...

455
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,342
well, his proposal, it...

456
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,386
[Woo-jae] Maybe you proposed to him?

457
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,428
You're the one who's in a rush.

458
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,389
[all laugh]

459
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,063
You'll just have to wait to find out.

460
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,815
[Hae-yeong]
It wouldn't be much fun if I spoiled it.

461
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,066
Wait a second, girl!

462
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,693
You're making a video, right?

463
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,111
[Ms. Gong]
Like the one at Woo-jae's wedding.

464
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,823
For all those who are curious,
please make sure to come to the wedding.

465
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,992
-Now let's get this meeting going.
-[all] All right.

466
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,578
[whimsical music playing]

467
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,502
-[grunts] Let's go.
-Ready?

468
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,130
Give up. Why do you bother studying?

469
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,548
Why do you always blame me for...

470
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,300
Just go. Move.

471
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,803
[student 1] Why's she here every day?

472
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:44,971
Does she live here?

473
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,773
[Ji-uk] You going home?

474
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,817
Because of you, all the customers
who were going to eat here

475
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,152
just leave the store.

476
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,945
[assertive sting]

477
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,618
What are you watching?

478
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,412
{\an8}PUMPKIN MARKET
PROPOSAL

479
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,705
Props for proposals?

480
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,165
Someone you know proposing?

481
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,583
-[Hae-yeong] Mm-hmm.
-Who is it?

482
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,625
You.

483
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:17,170
[humorous music playing]

484
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,423
Wha... What did you say I'm doing?

485
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,092
You need to propose to me
if we're getting married.

486
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,430
Hold on now. Wait a minute.
[sighs]

487
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,142
Okay, first, we've both already agreed
to do the wedding.

488
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,729
Second, it was you, ma'am, not me,
who wanted to do all this to begin with.

489
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,314
And third,
what's the point of me proposing?

490
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,857
Have you been to a wedding recently?

491
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,860
A wedding is a special occasion.

492
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:44,072
{\an8}And it takes a lot of work,
getting ready for it, my time,

493
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,114
{\an8}and my hard-earned money.

494
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,200
{\an8}And whether we like it or not,

495
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,827
{\an8}I get forced to learn
about the couple's dating history.

496
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,331
{\an8}'Cause all the guest
have to sit down, shut up,

497
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,374
{\an8}and watch this super long video
the couple made.

498
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,418
-So what?
-You and I need to make one.

499
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,630
About our lives,
our first date, our history.

500
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:03,925
[chuckles in disbelief]

501
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,135
You'll do it, right?
Since we are on the same side.

502
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,680
[Ji-uk] Get out, get out!
What are you doing? Get out!

503
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,475
Hey! It doesn't even
have to be in a fancy hotel.

504
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,519
Or involve diamonds in a designer purse!

505
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,813
Just blow up a few balloons,
light some candles,

506
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,982
just get down on one knee and propose.
Not even two. It's not that hard.

507
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,068
The fact that you're asking me
to do it in the first place

508
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,986
proves you need a psych evaluation,
not a proposal!

509
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,531
Not only is it a fake wedding,
none of this was even my idea,

510
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,032
so why would I do
anything like that? Get out!

511
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,951
That's why I said
I'd set everything up for you!

512
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,285
Just show up and say the line.

513
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,411
Get down on one knee,

514
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,080
and say four little words,
"Will you marry me?"

515
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,290
Okay, so what you're suggesting
is that I propose with props

516
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:37,792
that were already used by another couple?

517
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,502

What trash?

520
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,133
Pumpkin Market has good stuff!

521
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,801
These things have only been used once.

522
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,010
They're basically all new!

523
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,679
You'd be crazy to use that stuff twice!

524
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,055
Crazy? Oh my...

525
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,269
You... you need to do this...

526
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,478
You have to.

527
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,813
If you don't, we can't get married!

528
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,189
That works out even better. So we won't!

529
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,983
Let's not do it. Get out.

530
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,985

what about Kitty?

534
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,619

We don't have a kid...

You're so smart, aren't you?

550

You want a treat? Wait here.

551

00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:39,557
Good enough?

596
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,101
So the theme of these pictures is what?

597
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,104
Something along the lines
of "Look how Hae-yeong is in love

598
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,397
is with her cameraman fiancÃ©"?

599
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:50,651
Wow, look at my expression.
It changes so quick.

600
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,237
-Whoa.
-But the Hae-yeong in these photos...

601
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,114

Uh, how do I say this?

Your eyes are dead.

604
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,327
Ugh, what do I do then?

605
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,911
I don't have any proposal footage

606
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,039
so I was going to use them as photos
taken during dates instead.

607
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,376
Do you by any chance
have any pictures taken by your exes?

608
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,086
I'm sure she deleted them.

609
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,839
No, I didn't.

610
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,591
Why not?
They're embarrassing.

611
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,886
If a woman forgets what's embarrassed her,

612
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,095
she has no future.

613
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,139
Then create a video out of those pictures!

614
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,849
[Ja-yeon] I'm sure you look like
you're in love in those.

615
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,476
You'll look younger,
but just say they've been edited.

616
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,061
[Hae-yeong] And what if he shows up?

617
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,563
What if the ex who took those pictures
shows up to my wedding?

-What?

[Hui-seong] The groom's fake too,

623
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,868
so why not have a stand-in
for the proposal?

624
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,081
Hey, hon,
the three of us may be super close,

625
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,416
but there are things you share
and there are things you shouldn't.

00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,045

700
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:22,876
Surprise!

701
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,087
Wait, but, how...
Where did you get all these?

702
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:26,839
You said there weren't anymore.

703
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,133
I called other stores
and the company that makes them

704
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,802
to see if they had any
still left in stock.

705
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:32,720
I got them all for you.

706
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,557
You did what?

707
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:38,767
All of them?

708
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,477
It's 'cause they're your favorite.

709
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,981
Because I want to see you smile.

710
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:48,110
So, um...

711
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,198
what's your answer?

712
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,119
-Huh?
-If you say yes to me,

713
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,581
you can have the last Pang Pang Jellies

Hmm...

716
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,214
So, are you ready to pay, ma'am?

717
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,434
Mm-hmm.

718
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:31,195
Put this on my card.
I'll pay for them, okay?

719
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,989
It's fine. I'm doing this wedding now
out of necessity too.

720
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,199
[Ji-uk] Uh...

721
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:36,450
Out of necessity?

722
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:38,494
Why?

723
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,667
Oh, keeping secrets from me, huh?

724
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,753
I don't have any secrets from you.

725
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:54,676
Someone keeps calling me,
they're in Canada, and they...

726
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,970
want me to move.

727
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:59,431
I keep saying no, but they don't care.

728
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,475
[mellow music playing]

729
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,101
So I thought if I told them
I was getting married

730
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:04,561
and starting a family,

731
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,189
they'd stop contacting me for good.

732
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:10,567
Ah, you too?

733
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,613
Is this person married too?

734
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,742
Is it someone you loved?

735
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:20,327
This Canadian who won't stop.

736
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,497
Um...

737
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,876
I don't remember.
It's been so long.

738
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,802
I rented a wedding ring for you.
Wanna try it on?

739
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,053
To check the ring size?

740
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,773
-[Hae-yeong] Does it fit?
-[Ji-uk] Perfectly.

741
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,152
Ma'am, what about your ring though?

742
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,238
I bought mine, obviously.

743
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,740
I thought you were trying
not to spend money.

744
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,827
Well, even after the wedding's over,

745
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,454
I'm still gonna have to keep showing up
to work with my ring on.

746
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:07,916
I felt like such a waste of money,
but I had no choice but to buy it, so...

747
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,627
Are you sure you're not gonna regret this?

748
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,463
This is your last chance to back out.

749
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,467
I might, yeah.

750
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,388
If you and I get fake married

751
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,640
and I don't win the company contest.

752
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,142

00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:26,518
Oh, right.

[Hae-yeong breathes deeply]

755
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,899
That's why I'm going to win first place
in the company contest,

756
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,067
and then I'll get promoted
to that task force,

757
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,862
climb the corporate ladder
and become the youngest exec in Korea!

758
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,113
And then what?

759
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,532
[sighs] Change it all from within.

760
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,911
The practice of excluding
single women from promotions,

761
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,079
and only providing good benefits
to employees who are married!

762
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,332
Hey, don't eat those!

763
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,250
I'm planning on taking these
to an orphanage.

764
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,546
All right, look.

765
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,132
I'm only saying yes to this proposal
because it's a fake one, okay?

766
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,426
Don't do this when it's actually someone
you want to marry for real.

767
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,347
Who was the one
who suggested secondhand props?

768
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,432
At least I can say

769
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,936
I did my best to prepare for it
and it came from a heartfelt place.

770
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,523
I'll stay clear of women
who only want proposal

with a fancy hotel and designer purse.

772
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:18,320
In the meantime, if you get a proposal
with used props, say no.

773
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,283
So I guess we'll just need
to avoid each other then. All right?

should be more involved anyway.

00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,573
[foster child 2]
Auntie, it's me, Dong-seok.

873
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:56,866
Yang Dong-seok.

874
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,120
I gained a lot of weight, didn't I?

875
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,289
Do you recognize me, Auntie?

876
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:04,541
Ah...

877
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,252
[tearfully]
I should've visited you much earlier.

878
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,047
[Hui-seong] <i>Now I understand.</i>

879
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,883
<i>Now I see what Hae-yeong wanted to do.</i>

880
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:17,095
[Ja-yeon]
<i>This whole thing isn't a fake wedding...</i>

881
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,515
<i>it's Mom's first funeral, isn't it?</i>

882
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,728
[Producer Yun]
Now, look this way! Right here.

883
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:29,024
[camera shutter clicking]

884
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:31,568
BRIDE'S GUESTS

885
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,280
Hey!

886
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,532
[Hui-seong] The wedding ceremony
of Mr. Kim Ji-uk and Ms. Son Hae-yeong

887
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,159
will begin in just a moment.

888
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,120
In the meantime, we ask that guests
please take their seats

889
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,538
on either side of the wedding hall.

890
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,752
Uh, sorry, could you check on my fiancÃ©?

891
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,253
I can't since I don't have
my phone with me.

892
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:52,047
-Ah! Yeah. Give me one moment.
-Oh, thanks!

893
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:57,093
[bride] Wait. Slow down, Dad.

894
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:58,678
You're walking too fast for me.

895
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:00,138
[bride's father] Right.

896
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:02,849
[bride] I don't understand.
Why are you more nervous than I am?

897
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:04,851
Turn to me.

898
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,770
-You look good.
-Yeah, I clean up nice.

899
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,522
[mellow music playing]

900
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,497
[Hae-yeong] I'm not coming home.

901
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,791
I'll be a foster kid too
and move to another home.

902
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:28,792
Hey...

903
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,544
Foster kids are only placed in care
'cause of abuse,

904
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:33,380
their parents' death
or if they go to prison.

905
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:42,889
She, uh, wanted to stop too.

906
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,266
She did. But then she met Ja-yeon.

907
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,103
That girl was in
such a terrible situation that...

908
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,020
Dad,

909
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:51,147
can I tell you
what I hate the most about it?

910
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:53,691
I'm an only child,
but I've never actually felt like one.

911
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,568
I'm just another kid
that lives in a family

912
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:57,821
with a ton of children but no siblings.

913
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,156
All of them
were temporary brothers and sisters.

914
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,784
Ah, I understand why you feel hurt.

915
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,036
I never thought of it that way.

916
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,871
I asked Mom if we could try living...

917
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,834
with just the three of us for once,
you know, you, Mom, and me.

918
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,919
Mom doesn't care
about what her own daughter wants,

919
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:15,338
so why does she care so much
about what other people are dealing with?

920
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,675
There isn't even much time left
for me to live with you and Mom.

921
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:19,676
Huh?

922
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:21,636
W-wait, what?

923
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,721
Why isn't there much time left?

924
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:26,224
'Cause once I'm in college,
I'm gonna study abroad.

925
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:29,144
Then I'll get hired out of school,
move out, and get married soon after.

926
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,063
You know, I'm basically all grown up, Dad.

927
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,155
Understood.

928
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,532
As you wish, Hae-yeong.

929
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:44,742
Let's live as a family.

930
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:48,288
Just the three of us.
You, me, and your mother.

931
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,208
-You're lying.
-Don't say that.

932
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,794
I don't believe you.

933
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,754
-Come on, trust me.
-Nope.

934
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,423
-Look, I'm not kidding.
-[scoffs]

935
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,425
You're full of it.

936
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,093
Why don't you believe me?

937
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:04,137
[Hae-yeong] <i>Oh, Dad,</i>

938
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,931
<i>I should've just trusted you back then.</i>

939
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,851
<i>If I had,</i>

940
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:13,313
<i>I know you definitely
would've kept your promise.</i>

941
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:21,362
Oh! [gasps]

942
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,405
[sighs]

943
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,118
[Hae-yeong] <i>I regret it, Dad.</i>

944
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,829
<i>I regret it so much.</i>

945
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:31,331
[footsteps approaching]

946
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,049
[Hae-yeong sniffles]

947
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,384
I thought you took off.

948
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,930
Nervous?

949
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:50,016
Not really.

950
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:54,270
[Ji-uk] I'm shaking like a leaf.

951
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:55,855
So hold on tight.

952
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,275
[sentimental music playing]

953
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,030
[Hui-seong]
And now, the stars of the show,

954
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:06,533
the bride and groom
will make their way down the aisle.

955
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:09,827
Everyone, please join me
in giving a round of applause

956
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:10,828
for the happy couple.

957
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:13,248
[sentimental music continues]

958
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,046
[guests cheering, applauding]

959
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:22,715
[guests whoop]

960
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:24,551
[guests cheering]

961
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,803
[applause]

962
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:31,849
[guests chatter in awe]

963
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:37,522
[guests whoop]

964
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:40,942
[guest 1] Congrats!

965
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,278
[guest 2] All right!

966
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,363
[guests cheering]

967
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,161
[Hae-yeong] <i>And you, Mom.</i>

968
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:55,790
<i>Do you regret it too?</i>

969
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,586
<i>That Dad died because you were too kind,</i>

970
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,088
<i>because you never thought
about what I wanted,</i>

971
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,549
<i>because you never granted my wish.</i>

972
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:07,468
<i>I wonder...</i>

973
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,054
<i>do you regret it too?</i>

974
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,266
[guests cheering, applauding]

975
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:16,853
[sentimental music continues]

976
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,153
-[guest 3] Congratulations!
-[guest 4] Yes!

977
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,823
[guests chatter]

978
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,138
[sentimental music fades out]

979
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:56,517
Sis, when's it gonna be you up there?

980
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:01,314
The only reason I caught it
was that no one else was around.

981
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,650
Tae-hyeong looked surprised,
don't you think?

982
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:07,111
Isn't seeing your girlfriend of ten years
catch the bouquet a way to...

983
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,906
pressure him without pressuring him?

984
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:12,450
Hmm?

985
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,369
Whew. Good work, you two.

986
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,412
[Ja-yeon] You must be tired
after taking all those photos.

987
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:19,082
Oh, I only took them
because Hui-seong told me to.

988
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,084
But I'm no pro,
so Hae-yeong might not even like them.

989
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,002
It would've been fine
even if your lens cap was on.

990
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:25,713
[Ja-yeon] Um...

991
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,882
Oh, did you eat yet?

992
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,635
Hae-yeong gave me her card
so that the three of us could go out,

993
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,845
but... I think I'll leave you two alone.

994
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:35,682
Oh, that's too bad.
I have somewhere to be after this.

995
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:36,599
Mm?

996
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:38,434
[Ja-yeon] Why aren't you going on
a date with Hui-seong?

997
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:41,104
It's such a waste for her to go home
after she got her hair and makeup done.

998
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,189
Ah, today's not the only day
she's beautiful.

999
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,607
My Hui-seong is always...

1000
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:46,150
I'll walk him out, okay?

1001
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:47,360
Come on.

1002
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:48,820
[Producer Yun] See you around.

1003
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:50,947
Okay, Hui-seong.

1004
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:53,700
Bye, Producer Yun, till next time.

1005
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:58,246
[sighs in exasperation]

1006
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,671
You should've rearranged your schedule
on a day like today.

1007
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,047
Ja-yeon's gonna get suspicious.

1008
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,717
My bad, the writer and I
wanted to edit the script.

1009
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:13,052
Ah...

1010
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,346
editing the script, are you?

1011
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:17,598
[sighs]

1012
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,309
Should I just cancel last minute?

1013
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:22,979
My Hui-seong is looking way too sexy

1014
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,814
for me to leave her like this.

1015
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:26,733
You don't mean any of that.

1016
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:28,234
Oh, come on!

1017
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,153
I really want to stay with you.
Seriously, I mean that.

1018
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:35,742
You say you mean that,
but your eyes tell a different story.

1019
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,994
[both laugh]

1020
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,245
Maybe it's because I'm tired.

1021
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:42,123
You can't trick me.
We've been together ten years.

1022
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,253
Okay. I'll call you later.

1023
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:51,591
-Drive safe, all right?
-Mm-hmm.

1024
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:08,274
[man] Uh, is it still possible
to drop off a gift?

1025
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,109
Yeah, is it for the bride or...

1026
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,695
[gentle music playing]

1027
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:20,620
Oh...

1028
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:22,038
Are you...

1029
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,459
Uh, hey there...

1030
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:27,877
Ha-jun.

1031
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,880
So it is you, Ja-yeon!

1032
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:32,924
[delightful music playing]

1033
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,555
[heart beating]

1034
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,270
THE SOUND OF HEAVY BREATHING

1035
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:47,522
AND SOFT FLESH COLLIDING

1036
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,690
WAS NOT QUITE WHAT
ONE WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR

1037
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,442
IN THE CAFETERIA REFRIGERATOR...

1038
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,569
"WHAT CHANGES?"
"THE MEALS ARE TOO SPICY AND HOT..."

1039
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:54,779
"HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS, THEN?"

1040
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,280
SHE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND
THAT HIS GIRTHY INSTRUMENT...

1041
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:58,366
[sensual violin music playing]

1042
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,136
Wow, it's been so long.

1043
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,722
We haven't seen each other

or debuted as an author.

"Writing contest"?

1052
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:44,412
Uh, I remember
you used to work so hard on your writing.

1053
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,581

1054
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:49,500

Still writing beautiful stories for kids?

Huh? Wait, you're on your way there?
