just needed a pet name for her

instead of cleaning up a man,
just rearrange your furniture.

You put all that work
into transforming a man,

118
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,754
and he'll just dump you for some
younger girl the first chance he gets.

Is that why you tried to show him up
with your beautiful face?

179
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,108
Pretty lame, huh?
I was being a loser, I'll admit it.

180
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,359
Don't say that.

181
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,778
Ahn Woo-jae was never as good-looking
as you are.

182
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,281
And besides,
you've got limitless potential.

183
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,116
You win, hands down!

184
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,121
By the way, you and he broke up
not too long ago, right?

185
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,373
It seemed like he was already married.

186
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,834
Apparently, he and his wife
had been dating for over a year.

187
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,003
A year? Wow. So...

188
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,423
[Ji-uk] Oh.

189
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,425
I'm sorry,
that was dumb of me to bring up.

190
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,927
No. I was the dumb one.

191
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,555
He tricked me for six whole months.

192
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,934
Anyway, though,

193
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,854
you surprisingly know
a lot about me already.

194
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,150
Where I live, who my friends are,
even the people I've dated.

195
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,236
That's why you shouldn't talk
so loudly in public.

196
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,196
I end up overhearing things
even when I don't want to.

197
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,657
Do you think store cashiers
are silent NPCs or something?

198
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,784
I blathered on
about all those personal details?

199
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,912
Wait, even so,
how are you able to remember all that?

200
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,080
[Ji-uk] I just do, okay?

201
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,166
All the things you say,
all the things you do,

202
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,418
everything.

203
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,337
[pensive music playing]

204
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,258
I'm a computer.

[scoffs]

207
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,764
[Hae-yeong] In any case,

208
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,016
it's nice to be on the same side
as you, rabid dog.

209
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,476
For a change.

210
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,144
-It's reassuring.
-On the same side?

211
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,355
We're on the same team, you know?
You're gonna be my husband.

212
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,439
Huh?

213
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,568
[chuckles] Once the wedding's over
and done with, that's it, we're through.

214
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,904
[cutely]
Aw, is my hubby feeling embarrassed?

215
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:55,822
Hmm...

216
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,034
[scoffs] Really?

217
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,084
I've been wanting to repay Hae-yeong
for how sweet she's been.

218
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,795
[Woo-jae] <i>They've known each other
since they were kids?</i>

219
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,922
<i>How long have they been together then?</i>

220
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,883
I'm so glad I got the chance today
to help her out.

221
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,135
[Woo-jae] <i>Is that the reason
she broke up with me?</i>

222
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,221
<i>So she could start dating him?</i>

223
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,890
That being said,
her fiancé has such a great body,

224
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,183
he'd look good in anything.

225
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,393
That little shit.

226
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,688
Did you just call me a little shit?

227
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,315
Huh?

228
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,401
Oh, no. [chuckles nervously]

229
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,403
I didn't mean you, Yi-lin.

230
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:35,737
You were jealous, huh?

231
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:38,782
Jealous?

232
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,785
Did you not like me picking out
another man's tuxedo

233
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,328
and telling him how good he looked?

234
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,455
Oh... [chuckles]

235
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:46,790
Yeah, I was a little annoyed.

236
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,251
I went too far, I know.

237
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,961
I was just so happy.

238
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,254
Ah, yeah.

239
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,215
Hae-yeong's husband-to-be,
he sure is a handsome guy.

240
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,216
[Woo-jae chuckles softly]

241
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,844
That's not it though.

242
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,263
Something else was bothering me
about it all.

243
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,557
You and Hae-yeong.

244
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,226
[curious music playing]

245
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:10,897
Hae-yeong is super smart, attractive,
and has an incredible personality.

246
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,942
She totally seems like she'd be your type.

247
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,403
-Mm-hmm.
-Wait, Hae-yeong?

248
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,114
What are you saying?
I don't know what you're talking about.

249
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,160
Well, I'm glad. That's good.

255

AND SOFT FLESH COLLIDING

256
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,680
WAS NOT QUITE WHAT
ONE WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR

{\an8}THAT HIS GIRTHY INSTRUMENT

264
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,154
HAD BULGED UP NOTICEABLY

265
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,323
AND MADE ITS PRESENCE KNOWN

[Jeong-a moaning]

00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:06,912

-You reading something?

-What book is it?
-[Jeong-a] Huh? Oh...

Sweetie, you're gonna be late.

271
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,547
Um, well, please recommend
any good books later.

272
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:18,924
Then I'll be off.

273
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,634
Hold on.

274
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,512
I heard you're creating
a task force for a contest

275
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,846
that will report directly to you?

276
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,973
-That's right, Mother.
-Careful, son.

277
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,936
My warning about keeping women,
especially the single ones,

278

at arm's length...

279
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,688
It still holds, okay?

280
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,236
Speaking of, there's something
I need to tell you in regards to that.

281
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,322
Mother,

282
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,700
I've never disobeyed you,
nor have I had any problems with women.

283
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,578
In fact, I've never even had
a proper relationship.

[sighs]

285
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:55,001

simply because they're unmarried

Even with all the wealth I possess...

290
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,096
I was called that my entire life,
all because I married the wrong man.

291

Have I not suffered enough?

292
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,641
Am I doomed to see my son
repeat the same mistakes?

293
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,226
Mother, please! I'd...

294
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,811
I trust you, sweetheart.

295
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:14,896
But, Gyu-hyun...

Bok Gi-ho's blood
also runs through your veins.

irresponsible, and impulsive bastard.

I promise to keep my word
if it'll put you more at ease, Mother.

If not for my sake, then do it for yours.

00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,716
Your father is only forgiving
when it comes to his own faults.

304
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,551
He'd never be understanding with his son.

305
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,636
You need to be cautious at all times

You never know.

00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,484
He may try and find a hidden alternative.

00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,208
And these are the wedding invitations.
Here you are.

351
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,376
Here you go.

352
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,962
[chuckles] Mmm.

353
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,756
I should attend
to give you a wedding gift.

354
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,634
Oh, uh,
that's not necessary, President Bok.

355
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,512
Kkulbee Education really takes care
of its married employees.

356
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,680
We have the best benefits in the industry.

357
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,974
So all the benefits
the company provides at the wedding...

358
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,060
I already consider that
to be your wedding gift, Mr. President.

359
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,938
[comical music playing]

360
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,691
[elevator dings]

361
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,238
Congratulations, Hae-yeong,
on your wedding.

362
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,365
Thank you, Mr. President.

363
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,079
[sighs]

364
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,332
Eat, eat, eat!

365
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,008
Mmm!

366
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,718
It's really good! Not too sweet.

367
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,678
-[Secretary Yeo] Mmm!
-[sighs in disbelief]

368
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,054
But, um,

369
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,224
doesn't handing out wedding invites during
working hours count as slacking off?

370
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,687
Listen, Yeo,
I welcome the time our employees

371
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,940
spend not working due to their wedding,
pregnancy, childbirth, or raising kids!

372
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,027
Our company's rival isn't Genie Education
or Giga Study, but...

373
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,153
Korea's low birth rate.

374
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,323
Because the national birth rate is equal
to Kkulbee Education's growth rate!

375
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,908
If lots of people get married,
have children,

376
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,409
and get excited about giving said children

377
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,161
the best preschool
and private education.

378
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,788
You'll become even wealthier,
Mr. President.

379
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,122
Now you're getting it.

380
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:02,957
[door shuts]

381
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,002
Marriage, pregnancy, birth, childcare?

382
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,378
He should try it.

383
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,839
-[Secretary Yeo grunts]
-Secretary Yeo.

384
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:11,549
Mr. President?

385
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,427
Hae-yeong's wedding...
go for me, will you?

386
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,595
I want to give her a wedding present.

387
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,473
A president keeps his promise
even if it was made in jest.

388
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,808
[scoffs]

389
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,060
I should go? Why?

390
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,479
Are you saying I should attend?
And make her more nervous?

391
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,773
[comical music playing]

392
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,443
[sighs] He makes the joke
and I'm the one...

393
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,533
[exhales in relief]

394
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,330
GROOM KIM JI-UK
BRIDE SON HAE-YEONG

395
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,085
KIM JI-UK AND SON HAE-YEONG

396
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,920
-Please come.
-[employee 1] Congratulations.

397
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,004
[employee 2]
Are you really getting married?

398
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,549
-Finally, right?
-[employee 3] I'm so happy for you!

399
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,925
[employee 2] I'll be there.

400
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,635
-Great, and take lots of pictures!
-[employee 2] Okay.

401
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,054
-And stay for lunch. The food's great.
-[employee 2] Congratulations!

402
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,265
[happy music playing]

403
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,684
[sighs]

404
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,478
[chuckles softly]

405
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:08,815
KIM JI-UK AND SON HAE-YEONG

406
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,358
WE CORDIALLY INVITE YOU
TO OUR WEDDING...

407
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,485
[employee 4]
Hey, have you tried the cookies?

408
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,070
Hey, everyone, so sorry I'm late.

409
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,864
Not at all, we were early, so...

410
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,282
[asst. manager]
The materials are all prepped for you.

411
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,367
-Oh, thank you.
-By the way, girl,

412
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,245
I know you've been super busy
with all your wedding preparations,

413
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,997
but you forgot the most important thing.

414
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,623
Wait, what?

415
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,585
-I thought I looked over everything.
-Not the meeting material.

416
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,171
There isn't a single picture
of the groom anywhere, babe!

417
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:33,381
Not even on the e-invites.

418
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,384
I heard your groom
was really good-looking too.

419
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,720
[muffled chuckle]
Oh, I might've let it slip.

420
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,388
[Ms. Gong] Are you telling me
that even Yi-lin

421
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,181
gets to see your groom's face,
but I don't?

422
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,267
-I'm hurt, girl.
-[laughs nervously]

423
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,643
I don't want to spoil anything.

424
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,228
-It's the highlight of the wedding.
-[employees] Oh!

425
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,272
Oh, wow,
look how she's not even denying it.

426
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,565
[Yi-lin] Aww.

427
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,318
By the way, Hae-yeong,
did he give you a proposal?

428
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:54,819
"Proposal"?

429
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,863
[comical music playing]

430
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,075
-[Hae-yeong] <i>How about you?</i>
-[Ji-uk] <i>What?</i>

431
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,162
That's what I'm asking you.
Will you be my groom?

432
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,915
Huh?

433
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,416
I need a groom, all right?

434
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:10,752
Oh, of course!

435
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,630
I'm getting married
because I got a proposal!

436
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,506
[Asst. Manager Lee] My husband
only proposed after we'd set the date.

437
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,050
I kind of had to force him.

438
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,344
Me too, that's how I was proposed to.

439
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:20,845
Uh, what?

440
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,681
Oh, see, I hate that.
If you're going to propose,

441
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,016
you've gotta do it right!

442
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,602
Proposing just because you feel obligated,

443
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,355
or that someone asked you to,
or because of the wedding date,

444
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,315
then you're celebrating your marriage
more than a real proposal.

445
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,983
-[Ms. Gong] Totally.
-[Asst. Manager Lee] You're so right.

446
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,778
Hey, uh, you're not wearing a ring.

447
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,196
[curious music playing]

448
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,742
Don't you need a ring
to have a proper proposal?

449
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,119
Quit it.

450
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,704
[Woo-jae] Come on, I'm right.

451
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,583
[chuckles cheekily]

452
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,336
Oh, girl, you're makin' me curious!

453
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,589
How'd your man manage to get a "yes"
out of you, without even a ring?

454
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,632
Uh...

455
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,342
well, his proposal, it...

456
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,386
[Woo-jae] Maybe you proposed to him?

457
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,428
You're the one who's in a rush.

458
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,389
[all laugh]

459
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,063
You'll just have to wait to find out.

460
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,815
[Hae-yeong]
It wouldn't be much fun if I spoiled it.

461
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,066
Wait a second, girl!

462
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,693
You're making a video, right?

463
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,111
[Ms. Gong]
Like the one at Woo-jae's wedding.

464
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,823
For all those who are curious,
please make sure to come to the wedding.

465
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,992
-Now let's get this meeting going.
-[all] All right.

466
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,578
[whimsical music playing]

467
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:34,502
-[grunts] Let's go.
-Ready?

468
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,130
Give up. Why do you bother studying?

469
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,548
Why do you always blame me for...

470
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,300
Just go. Move.

471
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,803
[student 1] Why's she here every day?

472
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:44,971
Does she live here?

473
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,773
[Ji-uk] You going home?

474
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,817
Because of you, all the customers
who were going to eat here

475
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,152
just leave the store.

476
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,945
[assertive sting]

477
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,618
What are you watching?

478
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:09,412
{\an8}PUMPKIN MARKET
PROPOSAL

479
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,705
Props for proposals?

480
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,165
Someone you know proposing?

481
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,583
-[Hae-yeong] Mm-hmm.
-Who is it?

482
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,625
You.

483
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:17,170
[humorous music playing]

484
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,423
Wha... What did you say I'm doing?

485
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,092
You need to propose to me
if we're getting married.

486
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,430
Hold on now. Wait a minute.
[sighs]

487
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,142
Okay, first, we've both already agreed
to do the wedding.

488
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:34,729
Second, it was you, ma'am, not me,
who wanted to do all this to begin with.

489
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,314
And third,
what's the point of me proposing?

490
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,857
Have you been to a wedding recently?

491
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,860
A wedding is a special occasion.

492
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:44,072
{\an8}And it takes a lot of work,
getting ready for it, my time,

493
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,114
{\an8}and my hard-earned money.

494
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,200
{\an8}And whether we like it or not,

495
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,827
{\an8}I get forced to learn
about the couple's dating history.

496
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,331
{\an8}'Cause all the guest
have to sit down, shut up,

497
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,374
{\an8}and watch this super long video
the couple made.

498
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,418
-So what?
-You and I need to make one.

499
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,630
About our lives,
our first date, our history.

500
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:03,925
[chuckles in disbelief]

501
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,135
You'll do it, right?
Since we are on the same side.

502
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,680
[Ji-uk] Get out, get out!
What are you doing? Get out!

503
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:12,475
Hey! It doesn't even
have to be in a fancy hotel.

504
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,519
Or involve diamonds in a designer purse!

505
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,813
Just blow up a few balloons,
light some candles,

506
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,982
just get down on one knee and propose.
Not even two. It's not that hard.

507
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,068
The fact that you're asking me
to do it in the first place

508
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,986
proves you need a psych evaluation,
not a proposal!

509
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,531
Not only is it a fake wedding,
none of this was even my idea,

510
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,032
so why would I do
anything like that? Get out!

511
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,951
That's why I said
I'd set everything up for you!

512
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,285
Just show up and say the line.

513
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,411
Get down on one knee,

514
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:34,080
and say four little words,
"Will you marry me?"

515
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,290
Okay, so what you're suggesting
is that I propose with props

516
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:37,792
that were already used by another couple?

517
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,502

What trash?

520
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,133
Pumpkin Market has good stuff!

521
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,801
These things have only been used once.

522
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,010
They're basically all new!

523
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,679
You'd be crazy to use that stuff twice!

524
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,055
Crazy? Oh my...

525

You... you need to do this...

526
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,478
You have to.

527
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,813
If you don't, we can't get married!

528
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,189
That works out even better. So we won't!

529
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,983
Let's not do it. Get out.

530
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,985

what about Kitty?

We don't have a kid...

You're so smart, aren't you?

550

You want a treat? Wait here.

551

00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:39,557
Good enough?

596
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,101
So the theme of these pictures is what?

597
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,104
Something along the lines
of "Look how Hae-yeong is in love

598
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:46,397
is with her cameraman fiancé"?

599
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:50,651
Wow, look at my expression.
It changes so quick.

600
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,237
-Whoa.
-But the Hae-yeong in these photos...

601
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,114

Uh, how do I say this?

Your eyes are dead.

604
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,327
Ugh, what do I do then?

605
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,911
I don't have any proposal footage

606
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,039
so I was going to use them as photos
taken during dates instead.

607
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,376
Do you by any chance
have any pictures taken by your exes?

608
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,086
I'm sure she deleted them.

609
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,839
No, I didn't.

610
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,591
Why not?
They're embarrassing.

611
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,886
If a woman forgets what's embarrassed her,

612
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,095
she has no future.

613
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,139
Then create a video out of those pictures!

614
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,849
[Ja-yeon] I'm sure you look like
you're in love in those.

615
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,476
You'll look younger,
but just say they've been edited.

616
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,061
[Hae-yeong] And what if he shows up?

617
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,563
What if the ex who took those pictures
shows up to my wedding?

618
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,482

-What?

[Hui-seong] The groom's fake too,

623
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,868
so why not have a stand-in
for the proposal?

624
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,081
Hey, hon,
the three of us may be super close,

625
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,416
but there are things you share
and there are things you shouldn't.

00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,045

700
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:22,876
Surprise!

701
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,087
Wait, but, how...
Where did you get all these?

702
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:26,839
You said there weren't anymore.

703
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,133
I called other stores
and the company that makes them

704
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:31,802
to see if they had any
still left in stock.

705
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:32,720
I got them all for you.

706
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,557
You did what?

707
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:38,767
All of them?

708
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,477
It's 'cause they're your favorite.

709
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,981
Because I want to see you smile.

710
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:48,110
So, um...

711
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,198
what's your answer?

712
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,119
-Huh?
-If you say yes to me,

713
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,581
you can have the last Pang Pang Jellies

Hmm...

716
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:09,214
So, are you ready to pay, ma'am?

717
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,434
Mm-hmm.

718
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:31,195
Put this on my card.
I'll pay for them, okay?

719
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,989
It's fine. I'm doing this wedding now
out of necessity too.

720
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,199
[Ji-uk] Uh...

721
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:36,450
Out of necessity?

722
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:38,494
Why?

723
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,667
Oh, keeping secrets from me, huh?

724
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,753
I don't have any secrets from you.

725
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:54,676
Someone keeps calling me,
they're in Canada, and they...

726
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,970
want me to move.

727
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:59,431
I keep saying no, but they don't care.

728
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,475
[mellow music playing]

729
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,101
So I thought if I told them
I was getting married

730
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:04,561
and starting a family,

731
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,189
they'd stop contacting me for good.

732
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:10,567
Ah, you too?

733
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:14,613
Is this person married too?

734
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,742
Is it someone you loved?

735
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:20,327
This Canadian who won't stop.

736
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,497
Um...

737
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,876
I don't remember.
It's been so long.

738
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,802
I rented a wedding ring for you.
Wanna try it on?

739
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,053
To check the ring size?

740
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,773
-[Hae-yeong] Does it fit?
-[Ji-uk] Perfectly.

741
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,152
Ma'am, what about your ring though?

742
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,238
I bought mine, obviously.

743
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,740
I thought you were trying
not to spend money.

744
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,827
Well, even after the wedding's over,

745
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,454
I'm still gonna have to keep showing up
to work with my ring on.

746
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:07,916
I felt like such a waste of money,
but I had no choice but to buy it, so...

747
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,627
Are you sure you're not gonna regret this?

748
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,463
This is your last chance to back out.

749
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,467
I might, yeah.

750
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,388
If you and I get fake married

751
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:23,640
and I don't win the company contest.

752
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,142

753
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:26,518
Oh, right.

[Hae-yeong breathes deeply]

755
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,899
That's why I'm going to win first place
in the company contest,

756
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,067
and then I'll get promoted
to that task force,

757
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,862
climb the corporate ladder
and become the youngest exec in Korea!

758
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,113
And then what?

759
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,532
[sighs] Change it all from within.

760
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,911
The practice of excluding
single women from promotions,

761
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,079
and only providing good benefits
to employees who are married!

762
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,332
Hey, don't eat those!

763
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,250
I'm planning on taking these
to an orphanage.

764
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,546
All right, look.

765
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,132
I'm only saying yes to this proposal
because it's a fake one, okay?

766
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,426
Don't do this when it's actually someone
you want to marry for real.

767
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,347
Who was the one
who suggested secondhand props?

768
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,432
At least I can say

769
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,936
I did my best to prepare for it
and it came from a heartfelt place.

770
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,523
I'll stay clear of women
who only want proposal

with a fancy hotel and designer purse.

772
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:18,320
In the meantime, if you get a proposal
with used props, say no.

773
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,283
So I guess we'll just need
to avoid each other then. All right?

I will.

All the guests who are coming are mine.

should be more involved anyway.

to remember the groom.

00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,573
[foster child 2]
Auntie, it's me, Dong-seok.

873
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:56,866
Yang Dong-seok.

874
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,120
I gained a lot of weight, didn't I?

875
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,289
Do you recognize me, Auntie?

876
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:04,541
Ah...

877
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,252
[tearfully]
I should've visited you much earlier.

878
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,047
[Hui-seong] <i>Now I understand.</i>

879
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,883
<i>Now I see what Hae-yeong wanted to do.</i>

880
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:17,095
[Ja-yeon]
<i>This whole thing isn't a fake wedding...</i>

881
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,515
<i>it's Mom's first funeral, isn't it?</i>

882
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,728
[Producer Yun]
Now, look this way! Right here.

883
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:29,024
[camera shutter clicking]

884
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:31,568
BRIDE'S GUESTS

885
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,280
Hey!

886
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,532
[Hui-seong] The wedding ceremony
of Mr. Kim Ji-uk and Ms. Son Hae-yeong

887
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,159
will begin in just a moment.

888
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:42,120
In the meantime, we ask that guests
please take their seats

889
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,538
on either side of the wedding hall.

890
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,752
Uh, sorry, could you check on my fiancé?

891
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,253
I can't since I don't have
my phone with me.

892
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:52,047
-Ah! Yeah. Give me one moment.
-Oh, thanks!

893
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:57,093
[bride] Wait. Slow down, Dad.

894
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:58,678
You're walking too fast for me.

895
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:00,138
[bride's father] Right.

896
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:02,849
[bride] I don't understand.
Why are you more nervous than I am?

897
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:04,851
Turn to me.

898
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,770
-You look good.
-Yeah, I clean up nice.

899
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,522
[mellow music playing]

900
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:25,497
[Hae-yeong] I'm not coming home.

901
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,791
I'll be a foster kid too
and move to another home.

902
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:28,792
Hey...

903
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,544
Foster kids are only placed in care
'cause of abuse,

904
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:33,380
their parents' death
or if they go to prison.

905
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:42,889
She, uh, wanted to stop too.

906
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,266
She did. But then she met Ja-yeon.

907
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,103
That girl was in
such a terrible situation that...

908
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,020
Dad,

909
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:51,147
can I tell you
what I hate the most about it?

910
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:53,691
I'm an only child,
but I've never actually felt like one.

911
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,568
I'm just another kid
that lives in a family

912
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:57,821
with a ton of children but no siblings.

913
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,156
All of them
were temporary brothers and sisters.

914
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,784
Ah, I understand why you feel hurt.

915
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,036
I never thought of it that way.

916
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,871
I asked Mom if we could try living...

917
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,834
with just the three of us for once,
you know, you, Mom, and me.

918
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:12,919
Mom doesn't care
about what her own daughter wants,

919
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:15,338
so why does she care so much
about what other people are dealing with?

920
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,675
There isn't even much time left
for me to live with you and Mom.

921
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:19,676
Huh?

922
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:21,636
W-wait, what?

923
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,721
Why isn't there much time left?

924
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:26,224
'Cause once I'm in college,
I'm gonna study abroad.

925
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:29,144
Then I'll get hired out of school,
move out, and get married soon after.

926
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,063
You know, I'm basically all grown up, Dad.

927
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,155
Understood.

928
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,532
As you wish, Hae-yeong.

929
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:44,742
Let's live as a family.

930
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:48,288
Just the three of us.
You, me, and your mother.

931
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,208
-You're lying.
-Don't say that.

932
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,794
I don't believe you.

933
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,754
-Come on, trust me.
-Nope.

934
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,423
-Look, I'm not kidding.
-[scoffs]

935
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,425
You're full of it.

936
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,093
Why don't you believe me?

937
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:04,137
[Hae-yeong] <i>Oh, Dad,</i>

938
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,931
<i>I should've just trusted you back then.</i>

939
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,851
<i>If I had,</i>

940
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:13,313
<i>I know you definitely
would've kept your promise.</i>

941
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:21,362
Oh! [gasps]

942
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,405
[sighs]

943
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,118
[Hae-yeong] <i>I regret it, Dad.</i>

944
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,829
<i>I regret it so much.</i>

945
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:31,331
[footsteps approaching]

946
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,049
[Hae-yeong sniffles]

947
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,384
I thought you took off.

948
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,930
Nervous?

949
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:50,016
Not really.

950
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:54,270
[Ji-uk] I'm shaking like a leaf.

951
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:55,855
So hold on tight.

952
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,275
[sentimental music playing]

953
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,030
[Hui-seong]
And now, the stars of the show,

954
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:06,533
the bride and groom
will make their way down the aisle.

955
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:09,827
Everyone, please join me
in giving a round of applause

956
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:10,828
for the happy couple.

957
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:13,248
[sentimental music continues]

958
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,046
[guests cheering, applauding]

959
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:22,715
[guests whoop]

960
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:24,551
[guests cheering]

961
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,803
[applause]

962
00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:31,849
[guests chatter in awe]

963
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:37,522
[guests whoop]

964
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:40,942
[guest 1] Congrats!

965
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:43,278
[guest 2] All right!

966
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,363
[guests cheering]

967
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,161
[Hae-yeong] <i>And you, Mom.</i>

968
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:55,790
<i>Do you regret it too?</i>

969
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,586
<i>That Dad died because you were too kind,</i>

970
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:02,088
<i>because you never thought
about what I wanted,</i>

971
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,549
<i>because you never granted my wish.</i>

972
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:07,468
<i>I wonder...</i>

973
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,054
<i>do you regret it too?</i>

974
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,266
[guests cheering, applauding]

975
00:48:14,851 --> 00:48:16,853
[sentimental music continues]

976
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,153
-[guest 3] Congratulations!
-[guest 4] Yes!

977
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,823
[guests chatter]

978
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,138
[sentimental music fades out]

979
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:56,517
Sis, when's it gonna be you up there?

980
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:01,314
The only reason I caught it
was that no one else was around.

981
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,650
Tae-hyeong looked surprised,
don't you think?

982
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:07,111
Isn't seeing your girlfriend of ten years
catch the bouquet a way to...

983
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,906
pressure him without pressuring him?

984
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:12,450
Hmm?

985
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,369
Whew. Good work, you two.

986
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,412
[Ja-yeon] You must be tired
after taking all those photos.

987
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:19,082
Oh, I only took them
because Hui-seong told me to.

988
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,084
But I'm no pro,
so Hae-yeong might not even like them.

989
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,002
It would've been fine
even if your lens cap was on.

990
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:25,713
[Ja-yeon] Um...

991
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,882
Oh, did you eat yet?

992
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,635
Hae-yeong gave me her card
so that the three of us could go out,

993
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,845
but... I think I'll leave you two alone.

994
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:35,682
Oh, that's too bad.
I have somewhere to be after this.

995
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:36,599
Mm?

996
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:38,434
[Ja-yeon] Why aren't you going on
a date with Hui-seong?

997
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:41,104
It's such a waste for her to go home
after she got her hair and makeup done.

998
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,189
Ah, today's not the only day
she's beautiful.

999
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:44,607
My Hui-seong is always...

1000
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:46,150
I'll walk him out, okay?

1001
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:47,360
Come on.

1002
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:48,820
[Producer Yun] See you around.

1003
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:50,947
Okay, Hui-seong.

1004
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:53,700
Bye, Producer Yun, till next time.

1005
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:58,246
[sighs in exasperation]

1006
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,671
You should've rearranged your schedule
on a day like today.

1007
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,047
Ja-yeon's gonna get suspicious.

1008
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,717
My bad, the writer and I
wanted to edit the script.

1009
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:13,052
Ah...

1010
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,346
editing the script, are you?

1011
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:17,598
[sighs]

1012
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,309
Should I just cancel last minute?

1013
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:22,979
My Hui-seong is looking way too sexy

1014
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,814
for me to leave her like this.

1015
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:26,733
You don't mean any of that.

1016
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:28,234
Oh, come on!

1017
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,153
I really want to stay with you.
Seriously, I mean that.

1018
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:35,742
You say you mean that,
but your eyes tell a different story.

1019
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,994
[both laugh]

1020
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,245
Maybe it's because I'm tired.

1021
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:42,123
You can't trick me.
We've been together ten years.

1022
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,253
Okay. I'll call you later.

1023
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:51,591
-Drive safe, all right?
-Mm-hmm.

1024
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:08,274
[man] Uh, is it still possible
to drop off a gift?

1025
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,109
Yeah, is it for the bride or...

1026
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,695
[gentle music playing]

1027
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:20,620
Oh...

1028
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:22,038
Are you...

1029
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,459
Uh, hey there...

1030
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:27,877
Ha-jun.

1031
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,880
So it is you, Ja-yeon!

1032
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:32,924
[delightful music playing]

1033
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,555
[heart beating]

1034
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,270
THE SOUND OF HEAVY BREATHING

1035
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:47,522
AND SOFT FLESH COLLIDING

1036
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,690
WAS NOT QUITE WHAT
ONE WOULD EXPECT TO HEAR

1037
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,442
IN THE CAFETERIA REFRIGERATOR...

1038
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,569
"WHAT CHANGES?"
"THE MEALS ARE TOO SPICY AND HOT..."

1039
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:54,779
"HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS, THEN?"

1040
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,280
SHE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND
THAT HIS GIRTHY INSTRUMENT...

1041
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:58,366
[sensual violin music playing]

1042
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,136
Wow, it's been so long.

1043
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,722
We haven't seen each other

or debuted as an author.

"Writing contest"?

1052
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:44,412
Uh, I remember
you used to work so hard on your writing.

1053
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,581

1054
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:49,500

Still writing beautiful stories for kids?

Huh? Wait, you're on your way there?
