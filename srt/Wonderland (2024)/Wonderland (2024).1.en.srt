1
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,036
If we could meet again,

2
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,540
there's so much I want to say.

3
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,751
I miss my mom.

4
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,796
I didn't miss her all that much before.

5
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,466
Now that I'm close to death,
I keep thinking about the lost ones.

6
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,510
The person I want this service for is…

7
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,596
I want to see both my parents

8
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,100
living comfortably together
in a beautiful place.

9
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,186
I had so many places I wanted to visit,

10
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,272
but I couldn't in my lifetime, so…

11
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,653
A somewhat warmer version of my friend.

12
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,574
That's the person I used to know
and would like to see.

13
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,994
I wanted us to meet in a dream, at least,
but it never happened.

14
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:45,665
- My last memory of him was so upsetting.
- How have you been? Did you have fun?

15
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:55,902
WONDERLAND

16
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,372
- Her daycare's year-end party.
- Daycare's year-end party?

17
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,207
- Yes.
- Your Korean is good.

18
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,043
Just a little!

19
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,158
BAI LI

20
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,499
Mom, I arrived.

21
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,214
What's with that look? What's wrong?

22
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,342
Look how nice it is here!

23
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,595
Where's Jia?

24
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,016
Jia, Mommy's calling.

25
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,185
Jia?

26
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,230
- Jia.
- Jia!

27
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,314
Come here.

28
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,692
Come look at this.

29
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,822
- There you are!
- It's Mommy.

30
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,825
Ta-da!

31
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,160
See that?

32
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,664
Why is my baby so sad?

33
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,167
Because I haven't called you
in a long time?

34
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,422
Do you know where Mommy is right now?

35
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,634
Take a look. See what I'm touching.

36
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,803
What is this?

37
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,057
It's a camel! See?

38
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,310
I hope it doesn't bite me!

39
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,270
Its hair is so soft.

40
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,231
Here, take it.

41
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,903
Mommy works here now.

42
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:14,243
I'll find something interesting every day
and show it to you, okay?

43
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,376
Jung-in, did you sleep well?

44
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,335
TAE-JU

45
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,253
Time to get up.

46
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,005
Need more sleep?

47
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,134
You have five more minutes if you shower
and 20 more if you just wash your hair.

48
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,721
The train arrives at 42 past the hour.
What's your call?

49
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,307
What if I just wash my hair
and brush my teeth?

50
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,977
That will give you
15 more minutes of sleep.

51
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,689
But I'm afraid you just lost
30 seconds with me.

52
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,776
You love Barcelona. Aren't you going?

53
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,319
Of course I am.

54
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,488
I'm going.

55
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,156
Yes, you are.

56
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,992
I'm going.

57
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,251
Jung-in.

58
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,336
The train just left!

59
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,880
- You have to leave right now!
- It left?

60
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,799
Yes, you need to go. Hurry!

61
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,175
Just kidding!

62
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,516
I'm gonna kill you.

63
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,519
Works every time!

64
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,355
Get up. Time to get ready.

65
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,609
The weather is clear today in Barcelona.

66
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,403
Temperature, 16 degrees Celsius.
Humidity level, 58%.

67
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:17,366
Flight time, 12 hours 40 minutes.
Estimated arrival time, 6:40 p.m.

68
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,244
It'll be cold when you get there,

69
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,579
so take a jacket.

70
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,414
- Jung-in, your eye drops.
- Right!

71
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,585
And your vitamins too.

72
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,548
Bye now!

73
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,884
- Wake me up earlier tomorrow!
- Jung-in!

74
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,034
Are you free this weekend?

75
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,663
Would you like to go to the movies?

76
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:06,999
Just a moment.

77
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,421
Hi, Jung-in.

78
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,507
Do we have any plans for this weekend?

79
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,926
Nope. Why do you ask?

80
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,512
Can I go watch a movie?

81
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,681
Sure, go ahead.

82
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,767
- What time are you going?
- What time are we going?

83
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,853
Is 5:00 okay?

84
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,563
He says 5:00.

85
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,774
Want me to get the tickets?
What movie is it?

86
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,775
What movie?

87
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,904
It's my boyfriend.

88
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,615
Never mind. You should go with him.

89
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,160
It's okay. He's far away.

90
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,122
- Want to say hi?
- Hi!

91
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,873
Hi there.

92
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,419
I'll go watch the movie, then.

93
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,671
- Okay.
- Bye.

94
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,172
- Have fun.
- Bye!

95
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,556
Are we not going?

96
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,526
Here it goes!

97
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,577
So good!

98
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,911
Wanna see something cool?

99
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:26,871
Sure.

100
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,377
I've seen it.

101
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,295
Not impressed.

102
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,755
Something else.

103
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,676
Look.

104
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,892
- Isn't it cool?
- It's pretty cool!

105
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,477
- Jung-in.
- Yeah?

106
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,312
- I'll send it to you. Catch.
- Okay!

107
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,107
Tap!

108
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,610
I caught it?

109
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,490
Send it back!

110
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,407
Give it a rest.

111
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,825
Fine.

112
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,871
Hey, the northern lights.

113
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,458
Remember when we went to see those?

114
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,802
Sing a song.

115
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,970
A song?

116
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,014
Yeah, sing for me.

117
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,808
Right now?

118
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,725
Yeah.

119
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,560
Go on.

120
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,400
Here I go. Don't laugh.

121
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,904
Jung-in

122
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,324
Gu-gu-gu-gu

123
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,410
Oh, my love

124
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:54,041
Oh, my dear love

125
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,878
Though

126
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:02,466
The distance keeps us apart

127
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:07,054
You always make me smile

128
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:13,894
My love for you will never change

129
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,859
Hold my hand

130
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:24,864
Let's fly high up into the sky

131
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,535
Close your eyes

132
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,454
Smile for me

133
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,457
Hold me tight

134
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,045
The stars are shining down on us

135
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,131
Let's dance away

136
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,018
Just like this

137
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,397
Forever

138
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:06,572
Oh, my love

139
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,702
Oh, my dear love

140
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:19,084
Though the distance keeps us apart

141
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,714
I will always protect you

142
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:29,803
My love for you will never change

143
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:59,124
My love for you will never change

144
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:07,549
Oh, my love

145
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,810
"…to take arms against a sea of troubles,
and by opposing end them?"

146
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:02,730
"Indeed."

147
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,693
"Where love is great…"

148
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,947
"Where little fears grow great…"

149
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,951
What are you doing?

150
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,413
I'm working right now.

151
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,624
Keep it up.

152
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,713
It's easier to memorize this way.

153
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,258
Let's continue, Jin-gu.

154
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,804
"…to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune, or to take arms--"

155
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,972
No, stop.

156
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,141
Don't spin. Just…

157
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,935
This won't do. Forget the dialogue.

158
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,776
All right.

159
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,237
I'll take a look.

160
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,575
Then we'll connect you now.

161
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,503
Grandma!

162
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,504
Hi, Grandma!

163
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,421
JIN-GU

164
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,631
How are you?

165
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,260
It's so nice here. Thank you.

166
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,516
Why are you crying?

167
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,560
It's amazing here. I'll show you.

168
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,895
How awesome is this?

169
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,356
This is London!

170
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,733
Oh, right. Grandma.

171
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,444
I've been enjoying the kimchi you sent me.

172
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,362
Thanks.

173
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,446
Kimchi?

174
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,032
And I have more good news.

175
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,035
I'm playing in Hamlet next month.
You know, the play.

176
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,496
Hamlet? Are you Hamlet?

177
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,249
No. I'm in Hamlet,
but I'm not playing Hamlet.

178
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,959
I don't have lines yet.

179
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,629
Jin-gu, what are you wearing?

180
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,881
Don't you have anything else?

181
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,466
What's wrong with this?

182
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,719
I'll call you later. Let's stay in touch.

183
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,471
Bye!

184
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,480
How can I send him clothes?

185
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,653
Well, if you press on the menu here,

186
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,239
the items will show up.

187
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,095
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.

188
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,014
Sweetie, what are you up to?

189
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,183
Wait, what are you eating?

190
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,100
MOM

191
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,978
I caught you! Noodles again?
Is that jajangmyeon?

192
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,062
Will you stop it?

193
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,983
Hey, I told you you need to eat meat.

194
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,110
Protein is so important.

195
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,446
Mom, I told you not to peek into my phone.

196
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,948
Look at you. You've lost even more weight.

197
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,909
Don't give up on life!

198
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,036
What do you mean?
I'm not giving up on life.

199
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,746
You are. You're not dating anyone.

200
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,874
- Mom.
- Yeah?

201
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,292
I'm seeing someone.

202
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,710
Yeah, right!

203
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,212
I really am!

204
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,963
So leave me alone.

205
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:15,881
Are you serious?

206
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,716
- Honey!
- Yeah?

207
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,468
Hae-ri's got a new boyfriend!

208
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,762
What? A boyfriend?

209
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,513
- Who is it? Bring him home.
- Dad!

210
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,350
- She's right. Bring him home!
- You're lying, aren't you?

211
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,268
Seriously, I'm not lying!

212
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,312
Hello.

213
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,440
Who's that guy?
Are you with your boyfriend right now?

214
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,608
She must be serious.

215
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,402
Guys, I need to finish my lunch
and get back to work.

216
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,114
And please stay out of my private life.
All right? Bye.

217
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,617
- Hey, Hae-ri!
- Sweetie!

218
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,410
What was that?

219
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,412
What?

220
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,957
They will get the wrong idea.

221
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:52,960
Is that a problem?

222
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,128
Are you into me?

223
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,756
What?

224
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,092
Don't be. You'll end up getting hurt.

225
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,265
What are you on about?

226
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,356
So, what does he do?

227
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,525
I wish he were a poet like your dad.

228
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,693
Oh please!

229
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,946
I'm busy now, so I'll call you back.
Goodbye.

230
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:24,199
Hey, ask him over.
Let's have dinner together.

231
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,411
- Hae-ri.
- Yeah?

232
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,622
Do you need me to be your fake boyfriend?

233
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:31,957
What?

234
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,793
It seems exhausting to deal with them.

235
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,129
It's not exhausting.

236
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,507
You look exhausted. I'll do it for you.

237
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,887
This is your idea.

238
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,473
Okay.

239
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,058
Good luck.

240
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,615
This kid…

241
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,660
- Hae-ri.
- Yeah?

242
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,581
Yeah, that's me.

243
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,001
Do I look that different now?

244
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,922
You could say
I'm the history of Wonderland itself.

245
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,426
I thought you knew, but I guess not.

246
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,095
I had no idea.

247
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,270
Hello, I'm Kim Hyun-soo.

248
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,611
- Thanks, honey.
- Sure.

249
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,489
So, tell me about your family.

250
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,658
I have a mother and a brother.

251
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,246
My father left us when I was young.

252
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,335
So he was an independent man.

253
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,214
Yes.

254
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,010
Do you happen to like… poetry?

255
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,596
Poetry?

256
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,557
Sure! Yes, I love poems.

257
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,892
What poems?

258
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,229
Your poems.

259
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,071
"I gaze at the sky."

260
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:31,743
"Counting one, two, three, four."

261
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,079
"Cats walk by."

262
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,249
"A smile breaks."

263
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,336
"I take my leave."

264
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,466
How embarrassing!

265
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,137
- Shall we raise our glasses?
- Yes.

266
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,848
Allow me to pour you a glass…

267
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,600
I was just joking.

268
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,894
Here's to you.

269
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,187
Thank you.

270
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,027
He seemed like a good guy.

271
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,779
- Yeah, he's cute.
- Okay.

272
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,866
Isn't our baby girl beautiful?

273
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,286
Of course she is. She takes after me.

274
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:18,748
What are you talking about?
She takes after me!

275
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,254
Let's call it a night. I'm tired.
You should turn in too.

276
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,882
Yes, all right. Good night.

277
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,676
You too, Mom and Dad. Dream of me.

278
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,636
Yes. Sleep tight.

279
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,057
Dream of me…

280
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,359
Do you know what I'm looking for
in the desert?

281
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:33,114
Long, long ago,
there was the Tree of Life.

282
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:38,078
But one day, a monster jealous of humans

283
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:43,416
uprooted the tree
and threw it into the ocean.

284
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:48,505
After a very long time,
the ocean became a desert.

285
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:54,678
That desert is where I am right now.
This used to be a vast ocean.

286
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,182
Do you want to be an archaeologist?

287
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,183
Yes!

288
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,813
What do you think you need
to be an archaeologist?

289
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,483
I don't know.

290
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,152
You have to be strong.

291
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,824
Only with strength can you walk
those very, very long roads

292
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,911
and meet those very, very ancient people.

293
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,832
And how does one become strong?

294
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:24,749
I know.

295
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,544
- Eat well, sleep well, and exercise a lot.
- Here it is!

296
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,340
Come on here!

297
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,926
Sorry. I'll call you back.

298
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,512
Okay.

299
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,906
Jia, what is it?

300
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,910
Mommy, for my birthday next week--

301
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,079
I'm busy now. I'll call you back.

302
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:03,997
Mommy--

303
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,641
Jia, I'm sorry.

304
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,768
I hung up too quickly.

305
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,648
It's okay. You always do that.

306
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,232
Do I?

307
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,819
Yeah, you're always busy.

308
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,405
I'm sorry, darling.

309
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,659
I won't ever hang up on you again.

310
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,371
If you want to talk to Mom,
call me anytime.

311
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,464
Tae-ju.

312
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,808
Did you sleep well?

313
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,327
I've aged a bit.

314
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,496
Because of you.

315
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,683
It's a miracle he woke up,

316
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,853
but the brain damage
will cause him cognitive dissonance.

317
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:59,148
He may struggle to adjust to daily life
or to perform simple tasks,

318
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,068
so don't be alarmed
and try to act natural.

319
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,953
TAE-JU

320
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,837
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DISCONTINUE THE SERVICE?

321
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,988
Take a seat. You must be hungry.

322
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,785
Isn't it nice to be home?

323
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,374
What should I make for you?

324
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,306
It tastes so bad.

325
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,060
So bad…

326
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,982
that I'd like another bowl.

327
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,530
Think you're funny?

328
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,740
No more for you.

329
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:20,873
Eat as much as you want.

330
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:22,917
Okay.

331
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,840
- I can't hear you.
- Love you, Tae-ju!

332
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,676
It's been so long
since we last went to that schoolyard.

333
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,016
Do you think
that kite might still be there?

334
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,600
No way.

335
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,607
There's so much I wanted to do with you.

336
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,610
Jung-in did a good job on my hair.

337
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,446
Tae-ju did my hair today too.

338
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,614
That's why it's such a mess.

339
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,783
This is nice.

340
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,710
Let's go on lots of trips
after you get well.

341
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,897
Jung-in.

342
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,749
I thought it was time for you
to go to work.

343
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,590
It's nice to be able to touch you.

344
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,302
I'm gonna keep doing it.

345
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,112
- Going okay?
- Yeah.

346
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,704
Let's invite our friends over later.

347
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,129
Want me to try it?

348
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,214
No, I'll try it again.

349
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,176
Tae-ju! Wait.

350
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:40,847
Isn't it hot?

351
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,476
It's hot.

352
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:51,983
Are you okay?

353
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,319
Sorry.

354
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,124
Hello. Welcome to Wonderland.

355
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,969
Let's see.

356
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,431
I want heaven to look like Hawaii.

357
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,851
Put me someplace like that, please.

358
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,603
Yes, we'll do that.

359
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,316
Can I start the service now?

360
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,943
I want to hear all about it.

361
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,904
We're sorry.

362
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,699
To start, you must be legally dead
or in a deathlike situation.

363
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,869
Is that so? That's a bummer.

364
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,954
I wanted to see it.

365
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,332
Seeing yourself like that

366
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,376
can cause disruption
that can lead to system failure.

367
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,546
What if I pretend not to be myself?

368
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,590
No, we're sorry.

369
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,925
How about this?

370
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,802
Can I attend my own funeral?

371
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,804
Dad, that's a bit…

372
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,349
Why not? It will be fun.

373
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,309
People do request that sometimes,

374
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,395
but we can't have you knowing
that you passed away.

375
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,149
So we will have to reset the system
after the funeral.

376
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:17,693
Sounds good.

377
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:24,533
If we are going to do this anyway,
why not make me look younger?

378
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,828
You were very handsome.

379
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,750
- You have couples' packages too?
- Yes, we do.

380
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,085
Forget it!

381
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,295
We've seen enough of each other.

382
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,757
I'm not going with him.
I don't want that. No way.

383
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,802
Jeez.

384
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,711
- What is it?
- Well…

385
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,840
Don't these two look exactly the same?

386
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:21,757
Yeah.

387
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,634
They look alike.

388
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,386
Who is it?

389
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,015
My mom.

390
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,725
Whatever. Don't lie!

391
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,476
I'm serious.

392
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,148
Look here.

393
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,233
Hey!

394
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,750
Hello?

395
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,835
- Bro.
- Hey.

396
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,588
Um…

397
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,425
Do you remember Dad's face?

398
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,260
Why?

399
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,180
I think I might have found him.

400
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,021
- What did he say?
- Jesus.

401
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,606
He's not my dad.

402
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,483
How do you know? Did you ask?

403
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,151
My brother said it's not him.

404
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,653
Mom has type O blood.
He has type B. I have type A.

405
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,405
So my dad can't have type A blood.

406
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:30,117
But you and your brother
could have different dads.

407
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,081
Why do you think you have the same dad?

408
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,126
- That's true.
- Right?

409
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,504
What's going on here, then?

410
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,299
Just ask him directly.

411
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,717
No.

412
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,635
Why not?

413
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,888
Are you always so interested
in others' lives?

414
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,225
It's our job to be interested
in other people's lives.

415
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,727
Forget about it.

416
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,521
I'm hungry. I want jjamppong.

417
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,481
Have jajangmyeon.

418
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,399
I don't want to.

419
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,818
Just have it.
This place makes the best jajangmyeon.

420
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,321
We had jajangmyeon last time.
I want jjamppong.

421
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,866
Fine. Excuse me.

422
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:12,868
Yes.

423
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,834
Jin-gu's grandma?

424
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,795
Do you work here?

425
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,464
It hasn't been long.

426
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,260
Did you quit your other job?

427
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,430
No, I work at both places.

428
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,890
But aren't you tired?

429
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,559
It's all right.

430
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,727
What can I get you?

431
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,564
Jajangmyeon for me and jjamppong for him.

432
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,233
No, I'll have the jajangmyeon too.

433
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,278
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

434
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,824
MONTHLY PURCHASE

435
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,284
She's bought so much.

436
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,203
Now he'll keep asking for more.

437
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:02,418
So, I bought Jin-gu a new car,

438
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,337
but he says he doesn't really like it.

439
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,050
Could you please take a look at his car?

440
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,762
It looks like a fine car to me.

441
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,226
Jin-gu.

442
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,937
What now? I'm busy. Make it quick.

443
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,690
Do you like the car?

444
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,984
No. It's weird.

445
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:28,986
Isn't it nice?

446
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,699
It's not nice.
So tacky. I'm not driving this car.

447
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,784
Well, then…

448
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,913
- Should I get you a new car?
- Yeah, whatever.

449
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,165
I'm busy. I have a rehearsal. Bye.

450
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,667
You're performing?

451
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,713
I told you I'd be on stage soon.

452
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,967
Does that mean I'll be able to watch too?

453
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,677
No. Are you kidding me?

454
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,430
Right, of course.

455
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,349
In that case,

456
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,102
send me some pictures instead, okay?

457
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,730
Yeah, okay. Maybe.

458
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,693
Grandma, I need a piano for my rehearsals.

459
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,572
Okay. A piano…

460
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:14,990
Bye now.

461
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,117
All right. Bye.

462
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:22,957
Do you think
I should get him a bigger car?

463
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,879
We can exchange it for a different car
at no extra charge.

464
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,842
The fried dumplings are on me, then.

465
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,973
How wonderful! Thank you so much.

466
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,981
Was he always one to act this way?

467
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,527
All these purchases
are going to spoil him.

468
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,665
Hello.

469
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,084
I brought…

470
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:32,985
Kim!

471
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,739
- Yun-cheol!
- Yes, Dad?

472
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:37,906
Kim's here.

473
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:39,783
Hello.

474
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,202
This was his last wish.

475
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,203
I see.

476
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,081
- Are you doing well?
- Very well!

477
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,916
- You should join me.
- Not yet.

478
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,251
This way.

479
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,253
- You've lost more hair.
- No, I haven't!

480
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,797
Hey, you!

481
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,926
I didn't think you'd show up.

482
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,137
Yong-sik…

483
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,180
Good to see you.

484
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,390
You still owe me five million won.

485
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,186
Right. I'll pay you back.

486
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,321
Thank you for coming.

487
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,577
So…

488
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,126
No, never mind.

489
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,045
Thank you again.

490
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:45,849
Hi.

491
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,852
I'm Kim Hyun-soo
of Wonderland Travel Agency.

492
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,271
Yes, I know.

493
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,233
I just called to check in on you.
Are you enjoying your stay?

494
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,485
I love it here!

495
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,736
Okay, so…

496
00:44:58,946 --> 00:44:59,780
Well…

497
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,620
Go ahead.

498
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,122
I…

499
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,714
Goodbye, then.

500
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:18,882
Sure.

501
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,719
Okay. Bye!

502
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,221
Sir.

503
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,640
Would you…

504
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,394
Would you like to play a game?

505
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,611
Two sets to zero.

506
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,575
You have incredible stamina.

507
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,008
Jia fell asleep.

508
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,926
Call back tomorrow.

509
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,430
Don't hang up. Let's talk.

510
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,725
I know it's hard for you.

511
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,103
Here I am, doing whatever I want,

512
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,606
and I never could've done it without you.

513
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,650
Thanks, Mom.

514
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,529
I want to bring home some things for you,

515
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,866
but there's nothing here you would like.

516
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,117
How about this?

517
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,455
Pretty, huh? Nice color too.

518
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,791
Maybe I should buy a few more
for your friends.

519
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,708
How's that?

520
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,795
Be sure to tell them you got them from me.

521
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,967
I don't need it. Don't buy it.

522
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,471
Is it too flashy?

523
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,348
Then how about--

524
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,273
Hello.

525
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,278
I want to ask
if I can stop using the service.

526
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,030
No.

527
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,449
It just feels strange.

528
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,245
I'm going to tell her kid the truth.

529
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:58,292
So please cancel the service
after this month.

530
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,379
All right. I understand.

531
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,550
Please do that. Thank you.

532
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,546
Sung-joon.

533
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,173
Sung-joon!

534
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,350
Sung-joon!

535
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:25,856
Where were you?

536
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,233
Bai Li seemed unstable,
so I was checking up on her.

537
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,153
Why did you call me?

538
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,822
Bai Li's service will end soon,
so I wanted to talk.

539
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,982
- Jung-in?
- Hi, what's up?

540
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,652
Tae-ju came to see me.

541
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,698
He said he wanted to work, but I think…

542
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,158
Tae-ju?

543
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,411
- It's fine.
- What?

544
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:50,417
Tae-ju went there
because he just wanted to see you.

545
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,211
No, it wasn't like that. He said--

546
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,504
That's all it is.

547
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,175
I see.

548
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,510
Okay, then. Get some rest.

549
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,179
Okay. Bye.

550
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,515
TAE-JU

551
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:25,202
The person you called is unavailable.
Please leave a--

552
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,713
Where did I put it?

553
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:05,742
Welcome to Wonderland.

554
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:09,454
TAE-JU

555
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,124
Jung-in?

556
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,043
You don't look well.

557
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,587
Are you sick?

558
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,173
Where are the fever reducers?

559
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,969
You put them on the top shelf
in the bathroom cabinet.

560
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,930
Look for the orange bottle in the back.

561
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,560
Jung-in, is it bad?

562
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,063
I'm okay. Thanks.

563
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,346
Hi! Hello!

564
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,266
- Cheers!
- Happy birthday!

565
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,317
Tae-ju.

566
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:22,527
Tae-ju!

567
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,655
Hey, Jung-in.

568
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,248
Jung-in,
I met one of our colleagues today.

569
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,252
He said he'd help me find a job.

570
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,088
I think it will work out!

571
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,507
Sure.

572
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,886
But who are these people?

573
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:54,184
They're good people. They're performers.

574
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:55,727
Who are they?

575
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,021
I met them earlier at the park.

576
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,775
You wanted to have people over
and have fun.

577
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:03,943
Tae-ju.

578
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,905
This isn't you.

579
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:09,699
Really?

580
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,994
This isn't me?

581
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,455
I see.

582
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,666
Have a drink with us.

583
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,169
- No, thanks.
- Come on, have a drink!

584
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:26,591
Have a drink!

585
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,560
TAE-JU

586
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,355
Jung-in, how are you feeling?

587
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:27,026
You're sick. You shouldn't be outside.

588
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,570
Hey.

589
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,530
Where are you?

590
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,823
Where do you think?

591
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,950
I'm in space.

592
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:35,869
Want me to show you?

593
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,080
That's why I'm asking.

594
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,499
Why are you in space?

595
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,713
Why aren't you back yet?

596
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,467
You know I can't go.

597
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:52,969
I wish I could.

598
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,389
Come back now.

599
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,599
Why aren't you coming?

600
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,059
Okay. I'll be right there.

601
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,811
Won't be long.

602
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,316
You fool.

603
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:07,817
I'm not a fool.

604
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,486
You're a fool.

605
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,155
A fool in love…

606
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,074
with me.

607
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,245
Hey! I see a smile! You smiled!

608
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,749
Yes, I smiled.

609
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,334
Don't get sick.

610
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,711
You should get back inside.

611
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,896
Remember Kara the fish?

612
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:45,980
Yup.

613
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,649
Ta-da!

614
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:50,026
Mommy did it!

615
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,903
I finally found Kara the fish.

616
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,989
I wanted to show you before anyone else.

617
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:59,035
Soon, I'll find the Tree of Life too.

618
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,829
Then I can come home.

619
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,709
Can't you just come home now?

620
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,548
Jia, let's eat.

621
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,841
Jia.

622
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,510
It's time to hang up.

623
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,304
No.

624
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,684
Your food is getting cold.

625
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,019
Come on. You're a good girl.

626
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:25,979
No.

627
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,023
Mommy is working now.

628
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,276
You can call her when she's done working.

629
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,320
No, I want to go to Mommy.

630
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,116
I'll bring you here when you're older.

631
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,035
What are you telling her?

632
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,704
I'm hanging up.

633
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:44,497
- Mom--
- She needs to eat.

634
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,333
Let's eat.

635
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,461
I want to go to Mommy.

636
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,046
You can't.

637
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,382
Mommy is busy.

638
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:57,802
She's not busy. We talk every day.

639
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,179
Still, you can't.

640
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,347
Why not?

641
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,186
Let's go to Grandma's house together.

642
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:11,983
Your cousins are there. You'll be happy.

643
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,069
No, I want to go to Mommy!

644
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:16,904
I said you can't!

645
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:19,907
Give me that.

646
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,910
I told you already.
You can't go to your mom.

647
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:26,247
If you keep this up,
I won't let you call her anymore!

648
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,418
I'll go to Mommy!

649
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,226
Mom, what are you doing?

650
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:49,562
Mom?

651
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,148
Mom?

652
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,233
Are you listening?

653
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,986
Let me see you.

654
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,575
What's wrong? Why are you upset?

655
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:06,329
Why did you say those things to her?

656
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,331
You said you'd bring her there.

657
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,041
That's nonsense!

658
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,709
That's not what I meant.

659
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,462
I said that to stop Jia
from wanting to come here.

660
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,256
We are going back home.

661
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,634
What do you mean?

662
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,803
She only just started kindergarten.

663
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:24,305
She's starting to make friends now too.

664
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,100
It won't be good for her
to leave so suddenly.

665
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,518
Our relatives are there.

666
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:29,936
She will have her cousins.

667
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,480
We have no one here!

668
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:34,315
What do you mean "no one"?

669
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,567
I'm here.

670
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:39,904
Just wait until I get back.

671
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:40,988
Just wait?

672
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,366
Until you get back?

673
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,285
How can you possibly come back?

674
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,172
Tae-ju isn't sleeping.

675
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:46,262
He goes out and wanders around at night.

676
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:52,852
Sometimes, he just sits
on the bed for hours.

677
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,939
He seems like a different person.

678
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,943
I can't figure out what he's thinking.

679
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,073
What's the biggest change
you've seen in him?

680
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,621
I'm not sure.

681
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,128
Tae-ju is making a big effort too.

682
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,464
I'm sure he'll get better soon.

683
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,050
Okay.

684
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:27,637
You look a bit anxious.

685
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:29,931
Are you doing okay?

686
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,141
Yes.

687
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:37,939
Eat before you go.

688
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:41,734
I'm fine.

689
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:45,822
But they are done.
Have them before you go.

690
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:47,657
I'm late.

691
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,158
Why didn't you wake me?

692
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,786
You still have time.

693
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:52,703
I'm late.

694
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,249
Check-in takes longer these days.

695
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,584
Sorry. See you.

696
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:43,045
MISSED CALL

697
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,309
What's wrong with you?

698
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,394
What?

699
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:00,688
You went through my things.

700
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,732
I didn't.

701
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,650
Yes, you did.

702
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,281
Are you hiding something from me?

703
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:16,662
Why are you mean to me?

704
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,249
How am I mean to you?

705
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,584
You were mean to me.

706
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:31,969
Okay. I'm sorry.

707
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,934
No, I'm sorry.

708
01:05:57,161 --> 01:06:02,208
TAE-JU

709
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:03,793
Jung-in!

710
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:06,796
You're walking right now, aren't you?
I see you from here.

711
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,966
You're on your way to work,
thinking of me.

712
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:17,890
Today, the Earth you're on looks
especially blue and bright.

713
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,142
What do you think?

714
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:26,190
I saw it yesterday.

715
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:28,901
Hey.

716
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:32,071
Today's Earth is not the same
as yesterday's Earth.

717
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,573
I'll show you tomorrow's Earth too.

718
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:38,494
Have a good day at work. Take care.

719
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,154
- You can't go in.
- I need to go in.

720
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,072
I can't let you.

721
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,574
- Someone's in there. Let me go.
- Please wait outside.

722
01:07:58,657 --> 01:07:59,950
I said someone's in there!

723
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,704
The fire started right after he went out.

724
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,082
Isn't that strange?

725
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,418
No. Not at all.

726
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,840
You know Park Tae-ju well, don't you?

727
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:17,593
Yes, so?

728
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,930
Did anything seem off about him recently?

729
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:31,023
No. He's been doing great.

730
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,782
Again, Tae-ju didn't do it.

731
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:42,493
All right.

732
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,082
You should've been more careful.

733
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,708
It wasn't me.

734
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:53,546
Were you cooking?

735
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:00,636
I didn't do anything.

736
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,139
Really?

737
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:08,310
Then how did the fire break out?

738
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:10,563
Jung-in.

739
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,414
Where do we sleep tonight?

740
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,586
Should we go on a trip?

741
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:36,380
I have a flight tomorrow.

742
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:37,923
To Barcelona.

743
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,092
That's great.

744
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,012
You love Barcelona.

745
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,851
What's so great about anything?

746
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:50,853
Damn it!

747
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:32,436
Grandma, I'm busy right now.

748
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:35,814
What the… Who are you?

749
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:40,653
My name is Seo Hae-ri.
I'm a service manager at Wonderland.

750
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:42,446
Yes, and?

751
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:45,032
I have something to tell you
about your grandmother.

752
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,784
What is it?

753
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:48,994
She hasn't been answering my calls.

754
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,830
She better send me
that new ski suit I asked for.

755
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,459
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

756
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,046
What? Just tell me already.

757
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:02,925
Your grandmother passed away.

758
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:07,263
I'm sorry.

759
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:13,102
She collapsed on her way to work
in the morning.

760
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,604
The service will be deactivated.

761
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:20,985
You and your grandmother's records
will be stored until a new request arises.

762
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:26,365
I hope both of you find happiness.

763
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:10,284
Excuse me. Where is Gate 55?

764
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:14,955
Do you see that?
Turn right there, and you'll see it.

765
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,790
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

766
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:26,842
Jia!

767
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,844
Jia!

768
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:34,808
Jia!

769
01:12:35,392 --> 01:12:36,935
Excuse me!

770
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:38,354
Jia!

771
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,773
Excuse me!

772
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,317
I've lost my granddaughter.

773
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,319
Can you please help me?

774
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,254
Mom.

775
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:05,964
Where is Jia?

776
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,342
Jia's disappeared!

777
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:11,887
She's disappeared?

778
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,641
How did that happen?

779
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:20,979
Don't worry. I'm sure she's fine.
Did you tell the police?

780
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,732
Did they make an announcement?

781
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:26,568
What is she wearing today?

782
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,237
What time did you get there?

783
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,823
I told you not to take her
against her will.

784
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:34,159
What did the police say?
Why aren't you saying anything?

785
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,078
Mom!

786
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:38,205
- Mom!
- Bai Li!

787
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,167
I am not your mom!

788
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:53,345
YOUR SERVICE HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED

789
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:08,360
Jung-in.

790
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,904
- Hello.
- Hello.

791
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,198
I'm coming with you.

792
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,163
Tae-ju, come here.

793
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:28,714
Let's eat good food
and take lots of pictures.

794
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:31,717
Jung-in. We'll head inside first.

795
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,051
Yes, I'll be right there.

796
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:38,724
We can't go on a trip right now.

797
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:42,936
You're still quite unwell, Tae-ju.

798
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,022
I'm perfectly fine.

799
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:48,984
No, you're not fine.

800
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:51,361
Let's talk when I get back.

801
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:53,405
Let's talk now.

802
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,990
I need to go.

803
01:14:55,073 --> 01:14:56,283
Are you avoiding me?

804
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,076
I'm not avoiding you.

805
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:12,257
Why aren't you taking it?

806
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:21,433
Who is it?

807
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:25,521
Jung-in.

808
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:39,451
You take it.

809
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:47,918
TAE-JU

810
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:55,551
Jung-in, have a safe flight--

811
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:57,970
Who are you?

812
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:07,563
Hello?

813
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,231
- Hello?
- Sorry.

814
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,241
I just missed you so much.

815
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:25,914
Okay. Let's go together.

816
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,167
I'll tell you all about it there.

817
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,376
Sir, please remain seated.

818
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,128
We'll be taking off soon. Please.

819
01:17:15,922 --> 01:17:16,757
Tae-ju!

820
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:29,394
Have a safe trip.

821
01:18:07,974 --> 01:18:09,226
Mommy.

822
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,606
I found you!

823
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:21,279
I found you, Mommy.

824
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,534
Jia.

825
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:29,329
I had the scariest dream.

826
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,791
I was in the desert, and I lost you.

827
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,376
Are you going to cry?

828
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:35,711
You can cry. I'm here.

829
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:37,796
I'm going to hide now.

830
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,256
Here I go.

831
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:46,680
Jia!

832
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,813
Mommy, I found you!

833
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:02,863
Try to find me, Mommy.

834
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:04,322
Jia?

835
01:19:07,033 --> 01:19:08,368
Mommy!

836
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:10,996
Jia!

837
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:13,206
Jia!

838
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,171
Jia!

839
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:40,233
The person you called is unavailable.
Please leave a--

840
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,708
The person you called is unavailable.

841
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:39,751
MOM

842
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:34,240
I'll check and call you back.

843
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:36,576
Bai Li is activated again.

844
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,453
- How?
- I don't know.

845
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:40,872
Deactivating her doesn't work.

846
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:43,500
She's approaching the operating system.

847
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,465
Put up a firewall
so she can't approach it.

848
01:22:50,548 --> 01:22:51,800
- Okay.
- Sung-joon.

849
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,134
Sung-joon!

850
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:21,306
Jia.

851
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:25,310
Mommy is coming.

852
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,530
Bai Li breached the firewall
and is on the other side.

853
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:44,741
I think we need to delete all of her data.

854
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:46,201
I'll do it now.

855
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:55,210
What if her family wants her back?

856
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:57,045
Then we will make her again.

857
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,674
If you make her again,
she will never be the same.

858
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,221
What do you mean by that?

859
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:09,641
My mom and dad.

860
01:27:12,977 --> 01:27:15,146
I had to delete and remake them too.

861
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,523
Something you believe is real

862
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,401
can become fake in an instant.

863
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,488
It takes less than a second.

864
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:26,676
Is something wrong?

865
01:28:34,225 --> 01:28:35,310
This isn't good.

866
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,108
The system is shutting down.

867
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:46,404
Why hasn't her data been erased?

868
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:47,488
Bai Li.

869
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,782
I think she wants something.

870
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:50,867
What do you mean?

871
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:53,077
Something's different.

872
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,871
Of course it is. There's an error.

873
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:58,875
I don't think this is an error.
Open the network for her.

874
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:00,251
What are you thinking?

875
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:03,087
Let's open it.

876
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:11,763
Fine.

877
01:29:14,098 --> 01:29:16,309
I can't say no to you
when you look at me like that.

878
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,061
Hello?

879
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:03,147
Hello?

880
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:05,650
Yes? What did you say?

881
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:07,944
- What was that?
- What's she saying?

882
01:30:08,027 --> 01:30:08,945
Hello?

883
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:49,026
Hello. Welcome to Wonderland.

884
01:30:49,652 --> 01:30:52,155
Our service is experiencing
technical difficulties.

885
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:55,116
We apologize for interrupting your call.

886
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,335
Where were you trying to go?

887
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:49,754
To my mom.

888
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:52,757
To your mom?

889
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:54,258
Yes.

890
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:57,345
By yourself?

891
01:31:58,763 --> 01:31:59,597
Yes.

892
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:04,268
You're very brave.

893
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:13,694
Did you really get a call from my mom?

894
01:32:18,407 --> 01:32:19,242
Yeah.

895
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:22,119
She said she was on her way here.

896
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,541
She asked that you wait for her, Jia.

897
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:30,836
Mommy wants me to wait for her?

898
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:33,005
Yeah.

899
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:37,969
Jia!

900
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:40,555
Jia!

901
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:46,602
Jia!

902
01:32:53,609 --> 01:32:54,860
Thank you.

903
01:32:54,944 --> 01:32:55,945
Jia!

904
01:32:56,779 --> 01:32:58,030
Jia!

905
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:01,534
I was worried sick!

906
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:04,829
Thank you.

907
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:08,291
Jia, say thank you.

908
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:09,959
Thank you.

909
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:21,429
Jia, let's go now.

910
01:33:25,224 --> 01:33:28,644
Mommy told me to wait here.

911
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:33,441
Call Mommy for me.

912
01:33:34,358 --> 01:33:38,279
Mommy can't answer the phone.
I'll explain later.

913
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:41,699
Then I'm not going.

914
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:11,937
BAI LI

915
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:13,648
Mommy!

916
01:34:14,398 --> 01:34:15,566
Where are you?

917
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:19,236
I'm

918
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:22,657
at the airport.

919
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:23,741
Really?

920
01:34:24,408 --> 01:34:25,826
Where are you?

921
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,873
I can't see you.

922
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,005
Mommy.

923
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:45,846
Mommy, where are you?

924
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,015
I don't see you.

925
01:34:56,982 --> 01:34:58,067
Mommy.

926
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:03,280
Mommy is dead.

927
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:31,225
Still,

928
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:37,606
can you read me three stories
before I go to bed every night?

929
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:48,951
Yes. Of course.

930
01:35:50,161 --> 01:35:51,537
Did you say three?

931
01:35:52,121 --> 01:35:54,415
I'll read you six stories.

932
01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:55,916
What do you say?

933
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:01,172
Jia.

934
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:07,762
You're all grown up.
You're a big girl now, aren't you?

935
01:36:08,387 --> 01:36:12,850
I know you'll do well on your own.
And how will you do that?

936
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:17,938
Eat well, sleep well, and exercise a lot.

937
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:21,692
Good girl.

938
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:26,614
Put Grandma on the phone.

939
01:36:36,999 --> 01:36:38,125
Mom.

940
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:42,254
I'm doing great here.

941
01:36:47,968 --> 01:36:49,303
I owe you so much.

942
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,475
I'll repay you in my next life.

943
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:02,149
In my next life, I'll be your mom.
You can be my daughter.

944
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,151
I'll take care of you.

945
01:37:04,902 --> 01:37:06,904
I'll be really good to you.

946
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:11,742
My girl.

947
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:16,914
Mom.

948
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:20,084
Take good care of yourself.

949
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:24,255
Eat well, sleep well, and exercise a lot.

950
01:37:26,757 --> 01:37:29,593
Baby, I miss you so much.

951
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:36,600
Come on, we'll talk again tonight.

952
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:38,352
Stop crying now.

953
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:45,442
Mom, you've grown more gray hair.

954
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:49,947
You should get your hair dyed.

955
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:55,411
Actually, I should be there
to do it for you.

956
01:37:59,456 --> 01:38:00,791
It's okay.

957
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,632
I'm off to work now. Bye!

958
01:39:22,414 --> 01:39:23,624
We're back online now.

959
01:39:24,124 --> 01:39:24,959
Yeah.

960
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:27,962
You were right.

961
01:39:29,296 --> 01:39:30,130
Thanks.

962
01:39:31,131 --> 01:39:31,966
Sure.

963
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:36,887
But what do you think happened?

964
01:39:52,361 --> 01:39:53,904
Hello, Ms. Gu Jung-in.

965
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:56,240
Yes. Hello.

966
01:39:57,825 --> 01:40:00,160
I want to stop using your service now.

967
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:03,163
Have you encountered any issues?

968
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:04,248
No.

969
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:06,750
He woke up.

970
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:07,751
Sorry?

971
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,294
Tae-ju.

972
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:12,089
He came back.

973
01:40:13,215 --> 01:40:14,758
I see.

974
01:40:16,927 --> 01:40:18,095
Congratulations.

975
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:22,349
Then… I'll discontinue
the service for you.

976
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:24,018
Thank you.

977
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:29,106
I have one last favor to ask.

978
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:40,409
Why did you send me to space?

979
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:49,626
It was the furthest place
I could think of.

980
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:53,130
That's where I felt like you were.

981
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:11,648
I should go.

982
01:41:37,716 --> 01:41:39,426
- It's stuck.
- What did you do?

983
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:40,427
What do we do?

984
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:43,931
What a fool.

985
01:41:44,014 --> 01:41:46,934
- It's stuck.
- The kite is stuck.

986
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:52,564
Are you going to climb it?

987
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:56,902
I can't do it!

988
01:41:57,444 --> 01:41:58,612
Don't do that!

989
01:41:59,738 --> 01:42:00,739
Careful!

990
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:03,408
- I love you, Tae-ju.
- I can't hear you.

991
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:04,743
Love you, Tae-ju!

992
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:05,828
I can't hear you!

993
01:42:06,411 --> 01:42:08,664
I'm good at riding a bike now.

994
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:10,874
Keep at it when I'm not here.

995
01:42:12,334 --> 01:42:14,670
No, we should ride together!

996
01:42:14,753 --> 01:42:16,588
- Keep riding without me, okay?
- Come on!

997
01:42:17,089 --> 01:42:19,842
Take care of yourself. Don't get sick!

998
01:42:19,925 --> 01:42:21,260
No!

999
01:44:06,531 --> 01:44:07,407
Jung-in.

1000
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,078
I'm coming home now.

1001
01:44:29,846 --> 01:44:32,307
YOUR SERVICE HAS BEEN DEACTIVATED

1002
01:45:31,074 --> 01:45:32,075
Yes, just like you.

1003
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:34,703
You understand me.

1004
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:38,457
I do.

1005
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:46,381
You speak Chinese.

1006
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:48,759
I do.

1007
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:38,725
WONDERLAND

1008
01:47:16,346 --> 01:47:18,849
Why is your office building
so complicated?

1009
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:20,684
I'm so confused now.

1010
01:47:21,601 --> 01:47:23,770
- Mom!
- Hi, son!

1011
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:27,107
My Kkomi!

1012
01:47:27,732 --> 01:47:30,318
So adorable! Kkomi?

1013
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:32,904
Kkomi. Yes, that's it!

1014
01:47:34,531 --> 01:47:37,951
Should I transfer Kkomi to your company?

1015
01:47:38,034 --> 01:47:40,704
Nah, that company is better for pets.

1016
01:47:40,787 --> 01:47:41,830
Okay.

1017
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:43,707
Bye, Kkomi!

1018
01:47:46,585 --> 01:47:49,421
Hello, sir. How have you been?

1019
01:47:49,504 --> 01:47:52,007
I had a nice dinner
with the coupon you sent me.

1020
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:53,842
That's good to hear.

1021
01:47:53,925 --> 01:47:55,677
Do reach out from time to time.

1022
01:47:56,178 --> 01:47:58,597
We employees get coupons regularly,
you see.

1023
01:47:58,680 --> 01:47:59,764
Will do. Thank you.

1024
01:48:01,391 --> 01:48:04,394
Sir, I want to introduce you to my mom.

1025
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:09,900
Gil-soon!

1026
01:48:10,525 --> 01:48:11,651
Yong-sik?

1027
01:48:11,735 --> 01:48:13,737
That's right. It's me, Yong-sik!

1028
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:15,906
- What's going on here?
- It's been so long!

1029
01:48:17,657 --> 01:48:19,826
Mom, he's using the Wonderland service.

1030
01:48:20,535 --> 01:48:21,995
He passed away recently.

1031
01:48:22,621 --> 01:48:25,832
My goodness, Gil-soon.
You haven't changed at all.

1032
01:48:27,667 --> 01:48:28,960
I see.

1033
01:48:29,586 --> 01:48:32,255
So, how have you been all this time?

1034
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:34,674
How long has it been?

1035
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:37,427
My God, it's so nice to see you!

1036
01:48:39,262 --> 01:48:40,847
I'm sorry, Yong-sik.

1037
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:42,933
What?

1038
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,310
For leaving you without saying a word.

1039
01:48:48,855 --> 01:48:49,898
Did you?

1040
01:48:50,398 --> 01:48:51,274
Yes.

1041
01:48:54,444 --> 01:48:56,196
You can make it up to me, then.

1042
01:48:57,364 --> 01:48:59,366
We should talk sometimes.

1043
01:48:59,449 --> 01:49:00,867
Yes, for sure!

1044
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:02,661
Take care now.

1045
01:49:02,744 --> 01:49:04,955
Gil-soon. If I could have your number--

1046
01:49:16,967 --> 01:49:17,884
Sweetheart.
