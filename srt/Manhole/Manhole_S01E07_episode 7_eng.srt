1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,650
Clink!

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:06,840
   
   

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,040
Jeong Ae. What do you like so much about Oppa Dal Soo?

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,230
Oh and when you're zeroing your shot, you have to...

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,270
He's chic and acts like he doesn't care.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,710
He seems like a fool, but he makes sharp observations.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,670
Although sometimes it seems like he has no interest in me,

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,050
there are times when he's so good to me that it makes my heart flutter.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,230
He's completely my type.

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,550
He's completely the bad boy type. Get a hold of yourself.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,490
Anyway, what's your ideal type?

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,990
I'll match you up with a guy that you'd like.

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,710
- Soo Jin. What kind of guy do you like? 
 - Me?

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,820
They feed you, give you a place to sleep, give you clothes to wear...

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,200
I...

16
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,400
Rather than a calculating man, a sincere and kind man?

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,890
More than anything, it would be nice if he is athletic.

18
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,300
What about you, Jin Sook?

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,980
Me?

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,030
For me...

21
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,280
Someone who doesn't show off in front of me but takes care of me from the back.

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,490
And... Someone whose presence alone gives me strength.

23
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,920
Okay. I got it.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,370
But for some reason, why do I feel like you're both talking about someone I know?

25
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,110
He's definitely close to us.

26
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,730
   

27
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:59,600


28
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,830
Pil...

29
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,960
Pil.

30
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,250
Pil! Pil!

31
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,460
Wake up! Hm?

32
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,610
What? What? Who is it?

33
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,440
Did  you sleep well?

34
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,420
Soo Jin.

35
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,260
Come out quickly. I prepared breakfast.

36
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,710
What do you mean breakfast?

37
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,830
Yeah. There's stir-fried spicy pork and japchae (glass noodles). All the things you like.

38
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,180
So come out quickly. Got it?

39
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,420
What? What the heck?

40
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,610
Why is she suddenly cosplaying as my wife?

41
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,980
Wait.

42
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,290
There's no way that Soo Jin would make breakfast at my house.

43
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,270
In order for this to be possible...

44
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,830
Perhaps...

45
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,020
Did I marry Soo Jin?!

46
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,430
Really? Re- Wait, wait.

47
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,450
Really?

48
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,160
Woah! Hey, manhole! You always messed up my life,

49
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,370
but in the end, you made this huge event happen!

50
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,960
Can I believe this? I think this is a dream.

51
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,750
W-Wait... Then that means we're newlyweds...

52
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,990
O-Okay, change my clothes first. Change first.

53
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,350
 The moment I've wanted for so long... 

54
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,590
 A perfect breakfast, a beautiful wife... 

55
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,820
 Looks like there are no cute kids yet. 

56
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,930
 - That's a relief.  
- Oh, you came.

57
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,330
 I can't ruin my only day of married life with child care. 

58
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,670
Soo Jin... Did you make all of this? For me?

59
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,600
Not all of it, but...

60
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,560
Well then. Should I try some of the food that my Soo Jin made?

61
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,820
You can't! Wash your hands first.

62
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,360
Let me eat a fried shrimp first.

63
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,090
- You can't. Go wash up.
- No.

64
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,870
I want to eat your food quickly.

65
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,430
- You can't. Go, go quickly.
- Hey, Soo Jin.

66
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,910
Gosh, obsessed with being clean.

67
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,310
Father!

68
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,860
Are you still hungover?

69
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,550
Father, what are you doing here?

70
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,960
How is someone sitting on the toilet supposed to answer that question?

71
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,570
F-Father, this is our newlywed home...

72
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:41,860
In the bathroom, whether you poo or act stupid, do just one of them.

73
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,570
Hey, Pil. Soo Jin made this much food in order to feed you.

74
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,950
Aigoo, what in the world. Look at this japchae (glass noodles).

75
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,560
Soo Jin, you have such a pretty face, yet you can cook so well, too.

76
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,610
I can't guarantee the taste.

77
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,140
Hurry up and eat, Pil.

78
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,760
- Soo Jin. Are we... not married? 
 - Huh?

79
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,940
I'm asking if we're married.

80
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,580
What is he talking about?

81
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,120
It seems like he's still hungover.

82
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,390
Let's eat.

83
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,960
Ah, is today my birthday?

84
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,160
Okay, sure. Let's say today is your birthday. It's your birthday.

85
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,320
Soo Jin made delicious stir-fried spicy pork.

86
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,660
Here, eat. Open wide.

87
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,580
Good job.

88
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,890
Son, eat.

89
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,320
It's a lettuce wrap made by your father with love.

90
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,080
A-Ah, Father, I'm alright.

91
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,480
Then should Mom wrap it for you? Mom will.

92
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,890
Here, open wide.

93
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,390
Mom, Mom. It's fine.

94
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,490
- Mom's. 
- Eat mine too.

95
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,980
- Open.
- Ahh...

96
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,390
- Try this.
- Open.

97
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,500
- Why don't you try Mom's?
- Eat this one. 
- It's okay.

98
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,180
Ah, really! What's wrong with you all?

99
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,270
Why are Father and Mother acting like that?

100
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,640
And why would Soo Jin make breakfast for me if we're not even married?

101
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,390
I'm going crazy. What is going on?

102
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,620
Was our neighborhood this pretty?

103
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,570
Oh, wait. What is this?

104
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,360
Why do I feel so dirty? I've never felt this way before.

105
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,040
Pil.

106
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,180
Hyung.

107
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,060
- Are you okay? 
 - Hyung, I feel so weird.

108
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,290
The people I've known aren't acting like themselves,

109
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,470
and our neighborhood is so unfamiliar.

110
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,060
Am I crazy?

111
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,950
Yeah, I'm sure you don't want to accept reality.

112
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,720
But time really does go by fast.

113
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,070
I can't believe it's already the end.

114
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,610
Wait. Hyung.

115
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,280
What are you talking about? The end?

116
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,470
How can I say that with my own mouth?

117
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,720
You know it better than I do.

118
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,700
I... Do I possibly have a terminal illness?

119
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,890
Why do you keep saying things like that?

120
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,920
It makes me sad.

121
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,360
I'll see you later.

122
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,960
What the heck?

123
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,130
Do I have a terminal illness?

124
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,820
Is that why everyone's being so good to me?

125
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,150
Aish!! That wretched manhole!

126
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,800
I... will destroy it right now.

127
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,180
Hey, Bong Pil! Aren't you going to eat? Hey!

128
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:24,080
 Pil is a strange child. His eyes look at me, 

129
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,970
  but I don't know where his heart lies. 

130
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,250
 Although he's always nearby, it feels like he is far away. 

131
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,740
 That's why I'm continuously both happy and sad 

132
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,370
 when I look at Pil. 

133
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,890
   

134
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,180
What the heck is this?

135
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,790
I just woke up from being in a vegetative state, but now I have a terminal illness.

136
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,390
You... Why are you doing this to me?!

137
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,800
 Don't forget me. 

138
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,260
 You'll die by my hands. 

139
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,810
Soo Jin told me not to forget her.

140
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,060
But it seems like she can't remember at all.

141
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,800
Hey! Why do you reset everything that I've done to the point that it's useless, huh?

142
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,650
Tell me. What am I supposed to do now?

143
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,270
Since you're the one that brought me here,

144
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,720
you should know.

145
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,900
What are you doing here?

146
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,940
What are you doing? If you saw, carry it.

147
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,700
Hey. You don't know when I'm going to die,

148
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,820
yet you still want to tell me to carry this heavy bag?

149
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,180
But you're still alive though.

150
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,050
Carry that and follow me.

151
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,450
I shouldn't be doing this right now, for goodness sake.

152
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,280
Hurry up!

153
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,660
Give me that too.

154
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,040
Hey you, how many times do I have to tell you that the order is chicken, chicken, green onion, green onion, chicken, chicken?

155
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,220
It's not like this. Do it over. Yeah, like that.

156
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,520
Even if I died, you would still be selling these kebob sticks in front of my funeral, right?

157
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,360
Yeah, although that really depends on how many people are there.

158
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,340
Aren't the people that are coming to your funeral pretty much all decided?

159
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,560
Your personal connections are obvious after all.

160
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,000
You're really giving me goosebumps.

161
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,410
Hey! You're the one who definitely said that.

162
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,890
You said that you want to decorate your final moments  beautifully with the food truck.

163
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,160
I'm just agreeing with what you said, so shut up and help me put these kebobs onto the stick.

164
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,640
If you don't want to see blood due to this stick.

165
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,750
It's already unfair to die at this age.

166
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,280
So there is no way that I dreamt of such thing.

167
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,570
I, Bong Pil, didn't live a dull life like that.

168
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,460
You haven't sobered up yet, huh?

169
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,290
Why are you constantly singing about dying while I'm preparing for the grand opening of my business?

170
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,090
Terminal illness?! Being dramatic is an illness too, you know.

171
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,330
Are you doing this on purpose to lose affection for me?

172
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,170
Is that why you're treating me so cruelly like this?

173
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,790
Didn't I say in the 100 years of life you'll live, two years will go by quickly?

174
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,630
I told you that I will write you tons of letters, too.

175
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,010
Pil, just endure through two years well.

176
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,080
What's with this whole thing about two years and letters, huh?

177
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,860
Hey, what's the date today?

178
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,870
The 11th. Why?

179
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,750
What year?

180
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,370
2012! Gosh! You should ask real questions.

181
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:50,360
September 11, 2012.

182
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:57,010
Hey, hey! This is the day before I join the military!

183
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,830
 Cheers! 

184
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,090
 Punk. Thanks for helping me with my business today. 

185
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,380
 Hey, how come Soo Jin isn't coming? 

186
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,620
 Soo Jin probably isn't in the mood to come here today. 

187
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,300
 She went alone to go take pictures for the contest entry but got soaked in the rain. 

188
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,210
 And her camera broke too, so she is in  a terrible mood right now. 

189
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,820
 Her chance of entering the contest completely went down the drain. 

190
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,550
 That's right. Soo Jin went alone to go take photos for the contest today. 

191
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:30,780
- Hey! You're wasting it!
  - I can't believe I have to lose a once in a lifetime chance to confess and instead sell these kebobs. 

192
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,340
What's with that expression of yours? That expression looks like you haven't been able to go to the bathroom and feel extremely unfair about it.

193
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,960
 I can't spend my last day before enlistment so meaninglessly. 

194
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,540
Hey... Hey, I think I smelled one too many of these kebobs.

195
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,200
Suddenly, I'm getting a signal from my intestines. I feel like it's going to come out right now.

196
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,880
You dirty bastard. Don't show what you don't need to show in front of my kebobs. Hurry up and go. Then come back in a jiffy.

197
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,220
Oh, alright.

198
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,060
Hey, the bathroom is here, so where are you going?

199
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,240
- Hey, from what it feels like, it's for sure going to clog. 
 - Hey, man!

200
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,990
- Don't you think I should take care of this at home? 
- Yeah, hurry and come back. Hold it in well.

201
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:18,080
Hey, hold it in well! After your dirty business, hurry up and come back, okay?!

202
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,900
Today will be last time to see him act like a fool.

203
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,160
 Alright, let's think of this as my last opportunity. 

204
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,170
 Pouring in all of the earnest feelings of a man who's about to join the army, 

205
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,910
 I'll try confessing to Soo Jin. 

206
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,570
Wow, Jin Sook is so amazing.

207
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,390
She got the grand prize for coming up with an original menu called Bong Pil Kebob.

208
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,430
But don't you think the name sounds too simple and familiar?

209
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,080
I guess she failed to come up with a name because she was coming up with a good flavor in order to win.

210
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,160
Hey, but what the heck is Bong Pil Kebob?

211
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,840
Who cares about the name?

212
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,740
She got first place in the contest, got support, and  established her business as a young entrepreneur. That's what's important.

213
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,080
If I knew this was going happen then I should've applied for the contest, too.

214
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,690
If I were in that situation, I would've used Oppa Dal Soo's name on it.

215
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,720
My name comes with a high royalty payment.

216
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,570
Royalty, my butt.

217
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,790
Whether it's Dal Soo or Bong Pil, it doesn't matter since they both sound so darn tacky.

218
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,490
Goo Gil is the worst among them.

219
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,800
- Hi! 
  - Hey, Soo Jin!

220
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,320
- Yo! 
- Oh, Sook... Now that you're in front of your truck, you do seem like a CEO.

221
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,020
Do I? Do I look nice in this?

222
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,360
This is your grand opening day and to celebrate that, I will take a picture for you.

223
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,700
- Family members, let's gather up! 
- Okay, come here, come here.

224
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,440
It's a historical moment for Ms. Yoon Jin Sook, the godmother to-be  of the food industry.

225
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,160
Take a good one, okay?

226
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,170
- Look here.
 - Ready, right?

227
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,180
I'm going to only take it once, okay?

228
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,420
One. Two, three.

229
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,990
Yeah.

230
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,280
You'll be coming with us too, right, Soo Jin?

231
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,860
- Sorry, I don't think I can make it today. 
 - Why not?

232
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,210
The contest is coming up soon, so I have to go take some pictures.

233
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:14,080
Sorry, Sook. But you can call me up anytime you need a part-timer.

234
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,090
I will. Don't worry about it. Take some good pictures and come back.

235
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:22,760
- Sorry.
 - By the way, did you make up your mind to make a living by being a photographer, Soo Jin? I envy you.

236
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,240
Why would you envy me? To be honest with you, there really isn't a job out there for photography.

237
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,880
That's why you should forget about photography and go get a job that gives you a regular paycheck.

238
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,760
Wow... In a narrow space as an artist, you have to struggle

239
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,110
to find something profound, and to justify that profession this simply... That's talent, too.

240
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,390
Right?

241
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,740
Jin Sook, how come Pil isn't here? Isn't he helping you with your business?

242
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,940
Oh yeah, that's right. I wonder if he fell into the toilet after how much he drank yesterday.

243
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,730
 The person you're calling is unable to answer... 

244
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,050
This bastard isn't answering my call.

245
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:03,660
He was the one who told me that he'll say goodbye to this world without holding any grudges, with this food truck at his side in his last moments.

246
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,260
He changed his mind in just one day.

247
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,940
Seok Tae buddy, you try it.

248
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,300
But he won't answer my call though. That guy.

249
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,410
Fine.

250
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,760
Hold up.

251
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,300
Hey, where are you now?

252
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,510
Soo Jin, are you with all of our friends right now?

253
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,260
We're in front of Sook's food truck right now.

254
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,170
Everyone's waiting for you. Why aren't you here yet?

255
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,310
Soo Jin, it's going to be raining a lot today. So don't go out to take pictures.

256
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,850
If you do, then you'll end up soaking wet and even your camera is going to get ruined, too.

257
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,850
What are you talking about? The weather is clear and sunny right now.

258
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,130
Anyway, come quickly. I have to get going now, so I'll hang up.

259
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,760
Hold on a minute. Where are you going to go to take your photos?

260
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,570
Oh, yeah?

261
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,240
Alright, then. Let's hang up for now.

262
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,870
Who was that? Was that Pil?

263
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:03,690
Yeah. I think he's still not sober yet. He keeps on saying nothing but weird things to me.

264
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,790
Is Pil going to come here?

265
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,200
He didn't say anything like that but he probably will.

266
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,240
Sorry Sook, but I have to get to work now.

267
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,520
No, it's okay. Today is not the only day, so go and take some great pictures.

268
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,980
Come up with a great masterpiece, my friend.

269
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,640
- I will. I'm leaving now. Sorry. 
  - Alright, bye.

270
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,110
- Bye. 
- Fight on! 
- Be safe.

271
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,150
Jin Sook, we're going to be opening late if we keep waiting for Pil. Let's just get going.

272
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:34,320
He's right. And if he calls, we can tell him to come over to that location, you know.

273
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,760
- Alright, let's go!
 - Let's go! Fight on!

274
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,050
Soo Jin.

275
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,420
Hey, what are you doing here?

276
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,530
I'm here to be your assistant as you're taking photos.

277
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,660
Didn't you say that you were going to help Sook with her food truck business today?

278
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,500
I did say that. But I couldn't get myself to waste my time selling kebabs today.

279
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,300
What are you talking about? Sook is really counting on you.

280
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,970
Sook is waiting. You should go.

281
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,680
There are the others. Oh and...

282
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,970
Besides, I have something to tell you today too.

283
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,150
Something to say?

284
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,860
What is it?

285
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,850
Let's take our time talking about it. We have a lot of time today.

286
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,460
Let's  go in for now.

287
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:52,040
It's so nice out here. There are many good places to take pictures as well.

288
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,590
By the way, you left like that without even eating anything earlier.

289
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,680
I put so much effort into making you a table full of food because you will be joining the military.

290
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,920
My stomach wasn't feeling very well earlier. I'm so sorry about that.

291
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,720
Later, when I go back home, I will eat it all without leaving anything out.

292
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,960
Soo Jin, you can use me however you want.

293
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,170
I will do anything that you ask of me.

294
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,190
What in the world? You are acting so mature before you leave for the military.

295
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,700
But if you win the contest, then it's a little bit because of me.

296
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,570
So once I'm in the military, you have to go visit me a lot, okay?

297
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,850
What do you mean "go visit"?

298
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,250
It's nothing really.

299
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,700
Wow, that's so pretty.  Hold on, let me go take a photo and come back.

300
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,530
Hey, Soo Jin!

301
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,920
Sorry, Jin Sook.

302
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,130
Forgive me who chose love over friendship.

303
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,990
♫  My feelings for you  ♫

304
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,170
♫  That I hid from you for so long might be all right  ♫

305
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,160
Soo Jin, I'll take your bag.

306
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,990
Thanks.

307
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,630
Pil, hold on.

308
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,330
Pil.

309
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,210
Soo Jin, do you want some water?

310
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,420
♫  Don't avoid it and show me your heart  ♫

311
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,560
I'm taking it. One, two, three.

312
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,460
♫  I hope that you will fall into my heart  ♫

313
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,420
♫  Woo~ Look at me  ♫

314
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,970
♫  Woo~ Love me.   ♫

315
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,520
You scared me. 
♫  Only you  ♫

316
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,420
♫  If the growing love is the same as my heart  ♫

317
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,530
♫  Woo~ Tell me  ♫

318
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:06,280
♫  Woo~ That you love me. Just like that  ♫

319
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,350
Want to try?

320
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:15,160
♫  If the growing love is the same as my heart  ♫

321
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,130
Ah! Oh my!

322
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,930
♫  It might be a little awkward  ♫

323
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:27,490
♫  Honestly, I probably lack a lot  ♫

324
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:31,780
♫  But I will make you smile always. Show me now  ♫

325
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:40,440
♫  I hope that it's not a misunderstanding on my end  ♫

326
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,900
♫  Woo~ Look at me  ♫

327
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,390
One, two, three.

328
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,920
♫  Woo~ Love me. Only you  ♫

329
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,590
♫  If the growing love is the same as my heart  ♫

330
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,660
Hey, I bet it's done now.

331
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,380
- Welcome. 
- Two?

332
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,750
Is it because it won first place in the contest?

333
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,030
It's really delicious.

334
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,740
If it wasn't for the name, it would've been tastier.

335
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,120
I think it tastes better because Jin Sook doesn't know we're eating them.

336
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,200
This is already our fourth one, right?

337
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,070
Aren't you guys going to get up?!

338
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,170
You came to help, but all you're doing is stuffing yourselves.

339
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,280
Is this a free cafeteria? How many have you eaten?

340
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,550
Okay, okay. Well since we got paid in kebabs, shall we slowly start moving?

341
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,490
Okay, we should row when the water comes in.

342
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,980
We will go round up a lot customers, so cook a lot of kebabs.

343
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,480
Oh, then, I'll go east.

344
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,140
Oppa, I'm going too!

345
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,400
Ah, these people. They're sticking to each other even here.

346
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,770
Hey! Wait up!

347
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,120
Seriously. They're covering all the bases.

348
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,100
Bring a lot of customers!

349
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,110
Ugh, I can't trust anyone.

350
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,170
Hey. How many times do I have to tell you to put it in this way?

351
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,650
- Give it here.
- Why can't I do it?

352
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,370
I think you shine the brightest when you're dozing off in the study hall.

353
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,990
I'll do it. Rest. Drink some water.

354
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,690
It looks like we've run out of water, should I go get some?

355
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,900
It's too heavy; you can't lift it. Rest. I'll do it.

356
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,630
Hey. I'm strong too.

357
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:25,020
How can you be strong when your wrists are this thin?

358
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:29,680
I'll be back. Just sit and rest. Don't work.

359
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,680
Pil is the one who is good at using his strength. Where did this rascal go?

360
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:46,290
Soo Jin. Throw in a coin and wish for something, too.

361
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,420
I heard that your wish won't come true if you do it at just any fountain.

362
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,550
Well you don't lose anything from making a wish.

363
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:58,710
Who knows if this is the very fountain that grants wishes?

364
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,330
There we go.

365
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,430
♫  Since love came and knocked on my heart  ♫

366
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:14,550
 Although I've liked this woman for 23 years, I haven't been able to confess. 

367
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,660
 Please allow me to confess today. 

368
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,110
 If I fail to do so today, 

369
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,860
 I will throw myself into this fountain and take my life. 

370
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,780
 I heard that guys confess before they enlist into the military, so maybe... 

371
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,310
 Is he planning on confessing? 

372
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:42,000
♫  My heart is pounding, smiling broadly I whisper to myself  ♫

373
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,160
♫  You are the so-called feeling. You are the small tremor  ♫

374
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,370
 If Pil is thinking of confessing to me today, 

375
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,920
 at least today, please... please let him succeed. 

376
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,810
♫  Because you are the feeling that is love, this tremor is good  ♫

377
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,090
 Hey, Kang Soo Jin! 

378
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,770
 I... You... 

379
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,550
♫  Because you are the love that is always beside me, it's good  ♫

380
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:16,730
 You... You... 

381
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,790
 What? 

382
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:25,560
 I... li— I lik— 

383
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,900
 Aish, really. I'm going crazy. 

384
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,400
 Hey, Kang Soo Jin! I... You... 

385
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,450
 You. You. Where are you going? Hey. Hey! 

386
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,970
♫  My heart which is on the tip of my tongue confesses to you always  ♫

387
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:51,870
♫  My heart is pounding, smiling broadly I whisper to myself  ♫

388
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,250
♫  I must have fallen in love  ♫

389
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:01,250
♫  Because I love you, only you can be seen  ♫

390
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:08,330
♫  Even today, I'm falling more for you  ♫

391
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,510
 So? What is it that  you have to say? 

392
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,660
 Huh? 

393
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:30,410
 I... I... you... 

394
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,990
 I lik— 

395
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,930
 Lik— Like... L-Lik— 

396
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,940
 I said I l-l-lik— 

397
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,320
 Why can't I say it? 

398
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,320
 Idiot. 

399
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,840
What did you wish for?

400
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,940
It's a secret.

401
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:16,170
But... don't you feel like it's a waste to spend your last day before enlisting with me?

402
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:21,360
I like it. Why? How do you feel?

403
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,130
Well. I don't particularly like or dislike it.

404
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,870
Hey. You won't be able to see me tomorrow.

405
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,340
Don't you have any regrets like

406
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,960
"I should've been good to him while he was here"?

407
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,900
I don't know. I don't really know about that.

408
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:50,510
When I'm with you, my worries, my concerns... I don't have those things.

409
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:57,370
Recently, it's been really hard because I have been worrying about getting a job.

410
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,230
But I haven't thought about that stuff at all right now.

411
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:03,250
Hey. I don't know anything else, but you don't have to worry about getting a job.

412
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,800
- Huh?
- I have a bit of a future-seeing ability.

413
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,060
Later, you will have a shiny, grand studio of your own.

414
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:16,140
And you'll have so many customers that you'll lose sleep because you're so busy. So don't worry.

415
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,730
Just hearing that makes me happy.

416
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:30,480
But Pil, didn't you say you have something to tell me earlier?

417
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,780
Ah, right. That?

418
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,590
Tell me. What is it?

419
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:52,700
Sure, I'll tell you now.

420
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,750
I don't want to regret it anymore.

421
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:04,150
Soo Jin. I...

422
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,960
Huh? What to do? The camera.

423
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,070
Hey, hey. Give me the camera.

424
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,680
- Oh my!
- Ah!

425
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,340
What to do?

426
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,470
Wait a second.

427
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,330
Hey, how did you know it would rain?

428
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:31,210
I told you. I have a bit of a future-seeing ability.

429
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:35,450
Hey. You didn't bring one for yourself? You're getting soaked.

430
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:40,570
I don't need it, so wear it well so that you don't get wet.

431
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:55,590
Pil. That thing you want to tell me. You need to tell me all of it today.

432
00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:01,800
If you can't say it now, you have to tell me sometime today.

433
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:08,740
Okay, sure. I promise.

434
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,710
Hey. You got all wet.

435
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,990
Hey, Jin Sook. What are you doing here?

436
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,910
Hey. Isn't that Pil and Soo Jin?

437
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:41,570
- What are they doing there?
- Don't go.

438
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,700
Pil didn't answer my call because he was planning to meet up with Soo Jin.

439
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,420
So don't go.

440
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,670
Not even accepting the umbrella. The lonely love is crying outside, in front of the door.

441
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,560
Whose sadness became the falling rain?

442
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,770
The raindrops that come to make you wet even if you avoid it.

443
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,170
So wonderful. What's the title of that?

444
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,660
It's Becoming an Umbrella by Lee Hye In.

445
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,410
Isn't Lee Hye In a nun? What kind of nun writes poetry?

446
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,090
Don't make things up just because you think Jeong Ae doesn't know anything, okay?!

447
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,990
At any rate, you and your low IQ.

448
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,420
Lee Hye In isn't a nun! She's a singer!

449
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,300
Isn't that right, Oppa?

450
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,130
The rain should stop. Let's go. Jin Sook will be waiting for us.

451
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,610
Let me go with you.

452
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,290
Are you guys filming a movie?

453
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,660
Don't mind him and let's go.

454
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,740
Life is like a movie. Shall we take a walk slowly?

455
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,720
So freaking cold.

456
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,410
Whether it rains or snows, I bet you still train if you're in the military, right?

457
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:23,980
In the summer, you get heat rashes, and in the winter, you get frostbites.

458
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,700
You can't eat whenever you want nor can you sleep whenever you'd like.

459
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,270
Pil will have a hard time.

460
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:34,580
Don't worry. Pil's an athlete, so he has a good basic stamina.

461
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,420
Hey, Pil is good at reacting quickly, but he doesn't have good endurance.

462
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,670
So that's why he's switched from long distance running to short distance.

463
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:46,780
Hey, there is so much you know about Pil.

464
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,350
I know, right?

465
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,850
He is so darn useless so why do I know so much about him?

466
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,640
   

467
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,450
I guess it was just a rain shower.

468
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:18,500
Jin Sook, I think your feelings right now are like rain showers, too.

469
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,150
When Pil goes to the military, then you won't see him for a while.

470
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:26,980
And when you don't see him, then your feelings for him will  take care of themselves.

471
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,110
It's because you're not looking on purpose.

472
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,140
But there are so many good men around you who are better than Pil—

473
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,330
They're not rain showers.

474
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,670
It's been a long time.

475
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,970
A very long time.

476
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,810
 Oh, Grandma. 

477
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,220
 That grandma is here again. 

478
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,280
 That grandma must be a bum or something. Whenever I'm holding paper, she's always asking for all of it. 

479
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,200
 Would she be asking for money next? 

480
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,060
 Oh my, you should hide your wallet. 

481
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,080
 Grandma! 

482
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,280
 This is why you should have waited until I came. Why are you struggling like this alone? 

483
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,270
 I thought you weren't coming, so I was going to leave. 

484
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,130
 It's because I was gathering up waste products from our small theater. 

485
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,010
 Sorry, Grandma, I will be here on time next time around. 

486
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,000
 Oh no, it's okay. 

487
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,420
 - Tie it tightly. 
- Tight? 

488
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,660
Why are you telling me that?

489
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,380
Because I know how difficult it is to like someone who isn't even looking at me.

490
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,680
I'm telling you not to do that.

491
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,730
Pil, drink this warm coffee.

492
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,910
Thanks.

493
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,770
So warm.

494
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,610
I feel like I can live now that I have this warm drink in my body.

495
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:26,290
You fool. If you were going to pack a raincoat, you should have packed two.

496
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,090
Why did you just pack one for me?

497
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:31,890
I went to purchase raincoats at the store but they only had one left.

498
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,950
I will be fi—

499
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,130
Hey, you are going to catch a cold at this rate.

500
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,930
Let me go get a towel for you. Wait for me.

501
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,800
H-hey!

502
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:52,120
 Pil. That thing you want to tell me. You need to tell me all of it today. 

503
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,990
This is driving me nuts.

504
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,040
This is really nerve-wracking.

505
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:28,640
Soo Jin, I don't think I'll be able to say this to you while looking at your face,

506
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,770
so I'm leaving a video for you.

507
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:39,300
When I go into the military tomorrow, I won't be able to see you for two years.

508
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,650
So I can't postpone this any longer.

509
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,920
Soo Jin.

510
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,630
Weirdly in front of you, I act like I'm not feeling cold even though I am,

511
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,370
like I'm not sick even though I am,

512
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,410
like I'm not tired even though I am. It just happens that way.

513
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:09,010
I think I have forgotten how to be honest with you since I've been living like this for over twenty years.

514
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:18,810
But I want to be honest with you for the first time in twenty-three years.

515
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:23,390
I ... like you.

516
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,380
I never got to confess to you properly.

517
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,620
 I have to pee. 

518
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,830
But please remember this.

519
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:41,760
I want to tell you that there are precious memories that are not recorded in the diary and in the photos.

520
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:48,800
Your past and my future are connected.

521
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,710
It might be difficult right now but I'm able to run today

522
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,800
because there is a future together with you.

523
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,810
I'm always looking out for you by your side, and I'm grateful.

524
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:15,970
Please remember me who will be looking after you by your side throughout all eternity.

525
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:23,830
I don't know if you feel the same way as I do right now.

526
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:28,190
Even two years from now, I will be the same without any change at all.

527
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:35,110
I... like you a lot.

528
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:40,810
No... I love you.

529
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,770
Hey, Pil!

530
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,440
- Here, a towel.
  - Oh, thanks.

531
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,400
Hurry up and wipe yourself.

532
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,230
Are you okay?

533
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,650
Yeah, I'm fine.

534
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,560
I wonder how Sook is doing with her food truck.

535
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,170
I couldn't help all day. I feel bad.

536
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,150
Don't worry, I will apologize to her for you.

537
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,920
I told you that you should at least be a help to her.

538
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:22,980
Soo Jin, you have to make sure to take your camera later, okay?

539
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,660
Camera?

540
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,700
Why all of a sudden? Did it break?

541
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,150
Well, I... This camera...

542
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:35,900
No, never mind. I'll tell you later since telling you now won't do much.

543
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,430
What the? You're being so insipid.

544
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,910
Hey, we'll be late to the farewell party, so let's go.

545
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,900
Oh, okay.

546
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,870
Hurry up and come!

547
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,620
- Hot! 
- Go slowly. You'll spill the coffee.

548
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,470
Hurry up and come!

549
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,720
Isn't that the pharmacist punk?

550
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,650
Hurry up and come!

551
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,990
Or maybe not?

552
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,600
Cheers!

553
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:23,260
♫  The short hair that has become awkward  ♫

554
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,200
Who requested this song by the way?

555
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,360
Me! It was me, Jeong Ae! My last gift to you.

556
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,650
What do you think? Do you like it, Pil?

557
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:37,070
Hurry up and tell them to turn it off now. Just hearing the intro makes me tear up.

558
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:41,830
I knew that was going to happen so I brought you a surprise that'll stop your tears.

559
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,300
- Here, take it. 
 - What is this?

560
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,480
Your two years of military life will be very comfortable if you post this picture up on your locker area.

561
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,680
I'm sure all your senior members of the military will adore you as well.

562
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,980
♫  Telling you not to wait was  ♫

563
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,180
I also brought pictures, too.

564
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,630
It's a photo album of all of our memories.

565
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,980
When you get lonely or depressed there, you can look at it.

566
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,660
There are many fun pictures.

567
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:11,200
Hey, thanks... I will keep it well.

568
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,810
Hey.

569
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,160
It's 100% cotton underwear. I heard you won't get a heat rash when you wear that.

570
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,850
How in the world did you even know my size?

571
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,290
You're such a pervert.

572
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,140
One look and it's so darn obvious.

573
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,440
Thanks.

574
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,310
I wasn't going to give you this.

575
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:32,520
This is the jacket that has been with me during my time at the military.

576
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,220
Catch!

577
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,300
When you're on the night shift, make sure to layer up and wear it.

578
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,730
Winter is a very cold season.

579
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,970
You just keep it, Hyung.

580
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:43,340
My little brother, please take it. It's not an expensive item.

581
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,590
It's straight from my heart.

582
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,570
Pil, you see...

583
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:52,880
The thing that's drearier than the coldness that pierces your skin is losing your sensitivity.

584
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,000
So here. Stake.

585
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,430
Read it carefully.

586
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:03,810
Okay. While I'm in the military, I hope you all come to realize how precious I am.

587
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,960
Hey, Jin Sook, let's drink.

588
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,020
I didn't see you at all today. Where did you go?

589
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,150
My intestines must have gotten twisted from yesterday. I lived in the bathroom all day.

590
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:21,190
Maybe it's stress before my enlistment?

591
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,320
What about you, Soo Jin? Did you take nice pictures?

592
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,130
Huh? Oh, yeah.

593
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,690
Show us some pictures.

594
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,250
I'll see if you'll win the contest or not.

595
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,930
My specialty is in beauty, you know?

596
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,230
Yeah. I want to see them too. Show us the pictures, Soo Jin.

597
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,610
- No, that is—
- Hey, hey.

598
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:42,090
Do you know enough about photography to see if it'll win with one look?

599
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,270
Look at them later when she wins the competition.

600
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:47,510
Yeah, I'll choose the good ones and show them to you later.

601
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:49,150
Sure.

602
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,690
Anyway, at this time, should we play the truth game?

603
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,840
Yeah, let's do it. It sounds like fun.

604
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,120
Well, there might be someone who likes another person here

605
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,320
but is too scared to say so.

606
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:14,470
Hey. What do you mean truth game?

607
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:18,690
Play one of those games recklessly, and it can make several people's lives uncomfortable.

608
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,510
Friendships will fly away in one blow. We can't.

609
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:25,730
Don't do it. D-Don't do it. Just drink alcohol.

610
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,640
Cheers, cheers!

611
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,720
 You're the only one leaving for the army in our nation, right? 

612
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,750
 It must be hard making such an effort to make a big deal out of this in lieu of your character. 

613
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,730
 I can't go to the military like this. 

614
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,930
 There's something I haven't done yet. 

615
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,270
 Anyway, for you, there are more things you haven't done than things you have done. 

616
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:55,250
 Just forget it and leave. 

617
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:03,710
 Jin Sook. If I ask Soo Jin to just wait two years for me, 

618
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,860
 she'd tell me I'm crazy, right? 

619
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,700
 I haven't even confessed to Soo Jin yet. 

620
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,770
 I need to tell her before I enlist in the army. 

621
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:24,250
 Saying I... like... you. Why can't I say just those few words? 

622
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:34,570
 You're right. I can't say those words either. 

623
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,890
 To you. 

624
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:50,790
Today is almost over. When is Pil going to tell me?

625
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:55,160
Hey, Kang!

626
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,840
Didn't you leave first? When did you leave?

627
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,110
I went to the bathroom for a little bit.

628
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:08,790
We're separating early today.

629
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:10,700
You're right.

630
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:17,040
Should we go to a cafe just the two of us? It's been so long.

631
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,600
Should we?

632
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:26,390
It's been awhile since I sat outside drinking coffee with you.

633
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:32,560
It's always too loud with the whole family. It's nice since we're on a date.

634
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,730
You're right. It's nice.

635
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,240
The fresh air is nice too.

636
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,270
What kinds of pictures did you take today?

637
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:53,490
Huh? Oh, just some things... here and there.

638
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,460
Anyway, Pil is really leaving tomorrow.

639
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:06,560
After that punk leaves, our neighborhood will be really quiet.

640
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,840
You're right. That loud rascal.

641
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,950
- Soo Jin.
- Huh?

642
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,130
Nothing.

643
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:29,090
What is it? It seems like you have something to say.

644
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,810
You set the mood and everything.

645
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,200
There's nothing like that.

646
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,730
I just looked at my best friend's face.

647
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,550
That's not it. You have something to say. What is it?

648
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,660
You're pretty.

649
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:54,230
- Mom— 
-  Kang Soo Jin! Where are  you?! 

650
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,210
 Do you know what time it is? Come home quickly! 

651
00:47:56,210 --> 00:48:00,420
Mom. I'm in front of the house. I'm coming, okay. Bye.

652
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,880
I'm in trouble. Hey, I have to go home. My mom is mad. Let's go.

653
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,550
You go home first.

654
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,150
- Huh?
- I'm going to leave a little later.

655
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:10,220
- Will you be okay?
- Yeah.

656
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,090
Then I'm going first. Call me.

657
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,950
- Sorry, sorry.
- Be careful getting home!

658
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:42,050
 Pil, this rascal. Is he going to leave without telling me until the end? 

659
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,580
Yeah, Pil.

660
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,430
I see that your lights are on, so you must be home.

661
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,430
We should've gone together, why did you go alone?

662
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,480
I looked for you earlier a lot in front of the bar.

663
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,420
I was tired so I came home first.

664
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:10,550
Today... The thing I wanted to tell you.

665
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:13,800
I left a message for you in the camera. Check it.

666
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,020
Camera?

667
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,380
Oh, okay.

668
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:33,500
What to do? I think I left my camera there. I'm crazy, really.

669
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:40,690
♫  Why did I do that? At that time, I didn't know what love was  ♫

670
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,560
♫  I didn't know that was love  ♫

671
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,290
Excuse me, I'm sorry. I was drinking over there earlier, and I think I left my camera behind.

672
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:49,290
Did you see it?

673
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:52,220
I don't know. I didn't see it.

674
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:56,790
Not even as a lost item? It could have been found in the bathroom or some place else.

675
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:59,540
No, there wasn't a camera.

676
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,220
Ah, okay.

677
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,630
 I think I left it here though. 

678
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,280
What is this?

679
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:39,300
 This is really nerve-wracking. 

680
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:46,500
 Soo Jin, I don't think I'll be able to say this to you while looking at your face, 

681
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,570
 so I'm leaving a video for you. 

682
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,860
 I... like you a lot.  

683
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:11,410
 No... I love you. 

684
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,880
 Pil! 

685
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,880
   

686
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:48,490
She should've seen the video by now, so why is there no reply?

687
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:52,760
Does this perhaps mean that she's rejecting me? No, that can't be.

688
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,730
I've confessed to her after 23 years. I can't let this fade away like bubbles.

689
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:03,980
Soo Jin! Kang Soo Jin! Are you in your room right now?

690
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,890
What the heck? Is she not home?

691
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:13,320
There's no time.

692
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,350
Where could she have gone?

693
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:26,860
Where did this girl go so late at night?

694
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,890
Jin Sook!

695
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:42,100
Even if you can use your face as a weapon, you shouldn't wander around recklessly.

696
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,560
Don't you know how scary the world is these days?

697
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,250
Then why are you outside?

698
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:51,200
I wanted to talk to Soo Jin, but she isn't home.

699
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,750
Where did this girl go alone at this time?

700
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,350
Did you come to see Soo Jin too?

701
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,220
No.

702
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,470
I came to see you.

703
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,910
Jin Sook! Have you come to see this oppa because he's leaving for the army?

704
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:12,160
Because your heart felt so uneasy?

705
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,220
It's okay, this oppa will come back safely no matter what.

706
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,070
Pil.

707
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:23,030
What am I to you?

708
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,970
Your question is very deep.

709
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:39,130
Of course you're a friend to me. A very comfortable friend.

710
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,650
I hate that you feel so comfortable around me.

711
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:47,840
I wish you wouldn't feel comfortable around me.

712
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:56,190
All of a sudden, I feel like I'll actually feel uncomfortable.

713
00:53:56,190 --> 00:54:00,270
What? What? What is it exactly?

714
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,060
Pil.

715
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,910
I... you...

716
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,220
Hold on a moment.

717
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:15,330
Hello? Soo Jin, where are you?

718
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:19,710
Oh okay. Don't go anywhere and wait there for me.

719
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:24,280
Sorry. Jin Sook, let's talk next time, okay?

720
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,110
Hey— Hey!

721
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:56,140
Did she see my confession video?

722
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:58,850
But then why does she have that kind of expression?

723
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:08,720
Well for now, act like nothing happened. Act natural.

724
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:18,730
Soo Jin. Hey, where did you go at this hour?

725
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:26,820
Huh? Oh... I went to the pub we were at earlier.

726
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,930
Why there?

727
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:39,090
Actually... I thought I left my camera there.

728
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,270
But when I went there to check, it wasn't there.

729
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:52,300
Then, you didn't see the video I left you?

730
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,760
Yeah. I'm sorry.

731
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,990
No... that's not the problem.

732
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:03,060
Your important photos were in there. What do we do?

733
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,190
You probably didn't get to back up your photos for the contest.

734
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:12,950
Right now, the video you left me is more important than those photos.

735
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,180
Huh?

736
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:24,690
What did you say in the video you left me?

737
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,910
That's right... I'll just tell you directly.

738
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,140
Soo Jin, I...

739
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,440
I...

740
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,490
Just a second.

741
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:05,180
Soo Jin, I... you know, I...

742
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,740
I like you, Pil.

743
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,430
Huh?

744
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,640
Soo Jin.

745
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:20,400
What about you?

746
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,710
How do you feel about me?

747
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,860
 Yes. Now I can say it. 

748
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:38,330
 No. I must say it. 

749
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:43,670
Yes. Soo Jin, I also like—

750
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,470
I didn't finish what I was saying.

751
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:56,860
I... One second. Please just give me a second!

752
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,480
Pil? Pil!

753
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:16,890
Hey, Pil! What the?

754
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:21,450
What happened? Hey, Pil!

755
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:53,960
♫  In case you are serious  ♫

756
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:02,740
♫  I wanted to ask you again  ♫

757
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,290
 I will be able to tell you one day 

758
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:09,560
 how much I like you. 

759
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,020
♫  Which hasn't opened up  ♫

760
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:17,010
♫  Although I'm scared and it's growing  ♫

761
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:22,040
♫  Everything will open up to you  ♫

762
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,360
♫  Now both the pain  ♫

763
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,200
 In the end, I didn't hear Pil's confession. 

764
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,880
 I want to hear Pil's confession not because I doubt his feelings 

765
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,090
 but because I want to be certain of them. 

766
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:39,230
♫  Everything which has distressed my heart  ♫

767
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:42,500
♫  I want to entrust to you  ♫

768
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,520
 Pil, who will come back in two years, will probably change a lot. 

769
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,870
 And perhaps, I might change more. 

770
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:59,150
 At that time, what will we look like and what will we talk about? 

771
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:03,940
♫  Like a fool  ♫

772
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,760
Excuse me.

773
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,450
Are you perhaps the owner of this camera?

774
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:34,700


775
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,960
    
 Top colleges that others want to go to but can't... 

776
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,530
 Why don't you want to go? 

777
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,820
 That... 

778
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:02,310
 What is this? 

779
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:05,830
 Hey, I won a lottery. 

780
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:10,550
 I heard that you have to spend this kind of money quickly, but there's nowhere for me to spend it. 

781
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,120
 Forget it. Take it away. 

782
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:17,450
 Let me walk around proudly saying I have a friend who went to a prestigious college. 

783
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:24,230
 Just think of it as getting a scholarship. 

784
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,320
 Hey, I'm not just giving this to you. 

785
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:35,820
 If by any chance I become unemployed, give me  ₩10,000 or ₩20,000 as an allowance. 

786
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,750
 I think I'm not cut out to make it in this life. 

787
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:46,880
 But if you ignore me because I become unemployed, I'm going to kill you. 

788
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:58,470
 You punk! You're already a senior! 

789
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:03,090
 During this important time, you pretend to be a college student to get a part-time job? 

790
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,420
 How can you do that? 

791
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,460
 If you used the strength to work at a moving center to run around the field, 

792
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,890
 you would have caught up to Usain Bolt! 

793
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:12,700
 Hey, Bong Pil, tell me truthfully. 

794
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,160
 Where were you going to spend the money you earned? 

795
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,790
 There was something I need the money for. 

796
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:19,380
 To buy brand-name sneakers? 

797
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,910
 To buy fashionable jackets? To buy those kinds of things to wear? 

798
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:25,030
 - Is it because of those things?
 - No. 

799
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:28,600
 No? What do you mean no? It's written all over your face. Is it really not? 

800
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,980
 It really isn't. 

801
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:34,240
 Perhaps... did your father lose his job? 

802
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,550
 Teacher, you're really curious. 

803
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:40,700
 Of course I'm curious. Tell me truthfully, like a man. 

804
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:44,930
 I won't tell anyone. Just tell me. 

805
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:50,860
 That... is a secret. 

806
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:53,570
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

807
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:56,510
♫  I think of it throughout the day  ♫

808
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:59,490
♫  I've fallen in love  ♫

809
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:03,090
♫  I want you. Stay with me.  ♫

810
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:05,840
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

811
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,410
   

812
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:12,930
 You're really cruel. Do you really have to act like that with him in front of me? 

813
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:14,820
 Why do I have to care about what you think? 

814
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:18,220
 When you found the camera, didn't you see the video in it? 

815
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:19,590
 Marry me. 

816
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:23,860
 Besides you, no one else would erase it, punk. 

817
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,370
 Since when did you give up your feelings for me? 

818
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:31,560
 The closer you come to me, the more difficult it is for me. 

819
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,100
 I can't lose Soo Jin to that punk. 

820
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,700
♫  Beautiful, it will be a perfect moment  ♫
