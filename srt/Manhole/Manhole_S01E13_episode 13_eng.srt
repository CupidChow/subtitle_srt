1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960


2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,750
What's going on?

3
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,960
Yeah, Hyung.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,780
Hey, Pil. T-t-there's someone beating a person here.

5
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,790
An assault?

6
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,640
Yeah.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,920
Where are you?

8
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,840
T-this is... the alley behind the supermarket.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,740
Pil, wait a second.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,060
Oh my stomach.

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,740
A-are you okay? Oh. Okay, okay.

12
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,740
Oh no, look at your face.

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,340
Who are you?

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,420
You bastard!

15
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,110
Hello? Hyung. Hyung Goo Gil!

16
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,190
 Hyung, can you hear me? 

17
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,480
Hyung! Hyung Goo Gil!

18
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,760
 Hello? Hyung, can you hear me? Hyung. Hyung Goo Gil! 

19
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,430
 Hyung, just wait there for a bit. 

20
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,670
 Nothing has happened to you, right? Hyung, you're okay, right? 

21
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,880
 Hyung, just wait a little bit. I'll be right there. 

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,450
 Hello? Hyung, can you hear me? 

23
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,700
 Hyung, I'm almost there. Just wait a little while longer for me. 

24
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,860
 - Hyung. Hyung Goo Gil.  
 - Bong Pil?

25
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,460
 Nothing has happened to you, right? Hyung, you're okay, right? 

26
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,530
What the heck? Why is it him out of all people?

27
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,010
Hyung! Goo Gil!

28
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,690
Hyung! Goo Gil, wake up! Goo Gil!

29
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,730
What happened to you?

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,430
Hello, this is 119, right? There's a person here who's passed out.

31
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,710
Yes, this Haeyo-dong 14th Street, the alley behind the super market. Please hurry.

32
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,200
   

33
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,290
 How much did you know about Jae Hyeon before you married him? 

34
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,820
 What do you mean out of the blue? 

35
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,090
 I was wondering if you knew him well enough before you married him. 

36
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,270
 I don't know if Jae Hyeon is a good person or not. 

37
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,860
 On the outside, he treats you well, but I'm positive there's something you're not aware of. 

38
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,290
Jae Hyeon.

39
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,780
- You're home late today. 
- Yeah, I am.

40
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,390
But what's with all that sweat?

41
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,840
I ran home since I needed the exercise anyway.

42
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,910
Hey.

43
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,510
What?! Goo Gil?!

44
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,080
Okay, I understand.

45
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,370
Did something happen?

46
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,630
What should I do, Jae Hyeon?

47
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,000
- Goo Gil got hurt from a violent assault and is hospitalized right now.
 - What?

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,410
I think I might have to go to the hospital right now.

49
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,190
- Let's hurry up and go over there. 
- Let's do that.

50
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,180
Hello, it's me. I transported the victim straight over to the hospital from the crime scene.

51
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,620
The victim is here with me right now and I will call you as soon as we figure out his condition.

52
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,550
Okay.

53
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,130
We finished with the first aid for now.

54
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,900
Thank you.

55
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,730
Hyung!

56
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,720
Oppa!

57
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,860
What happened?

58
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,410
Goo Gil went through a violent assault.

59
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,090
He called me because he witnessed an assault,

60
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,190
but I think he was assaulted at the same time.

61
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,310
How is he right now?

62
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,570
He is not conscious just yet, but I don't think the injuries are that bad.

63
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,520
Oppa. Oppa Goo Gil.

64
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,560
Oppa. Oppa Goo Gil.

65
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,330
Oppa Goo Gil!

66
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,920
Are you awake now?

67
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Where is this place?

68
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,110
It's the hospital.

69
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,100
Pil brought you over here as soon as he discovered you unconscious.

70
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,720
Are you okay, Hyung?

71
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,050
Yeah, I'm fine.

72
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,760
- I'm going to get up...
 -  No, don't.

73
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,210
Hyung, just stay and don't move.

74
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,000
You need to go through more tests.

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,140
Your poor face...

76
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,770
If there's something like that going on, you should have avoided it. Why did you intervene?

77
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,320
How can I just go when someone is getting beat up?

78
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,890
Hyung, can you possibly remember anything about the criminal?

79
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,680
Did you get to see his face?

80
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,730
I didn't get a chance to.

81
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,930
It all just happened so fast.

82
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,610
Hey guys!

83
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,230
Soo Jin!

84
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,520
Are you okay, Oppa?

85
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,180
You didn't have to come all the way over here just for this.

86
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,840
How can I sit still when I heard that you're injured?

87
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,800
Oh, you're here too, Jae Hyeon.

88
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,580
It's only natural for me to come. I was very worried about you.

89
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,350
Thank you so much for coming by.

90
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,500
I'm glad that your injury isn't so bad.

91
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,970
By the way, were you able to catch the criminal?

92
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,030
No, we have not.

93
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:24,360
Hyung, I will catch him no matter what, so don't worry.

94
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,870
Hey guys, I better go out to the crime scene.

95
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,070
I'm sure the patrol team has arrived there by now.

96
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,250
Please take care of Hyung Goo Gil for me.

97
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,560
Pil, be careful.

98
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,090
- Bye.
 - Be safe.

99
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,460
What the heck is going on here?

100
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,370
- What happened? 
- I don't exactly know either.

101
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,260
Move over, move over.

102
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,720
How's the victim?

103
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,240
He's not injured too badly. I saw him gain consciousness before I came over here.

104
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,380
Did you get any evidence?

105
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,740
Not at all. Very neat and tidy.

106
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,690
Very crafty and slick guy.

107
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,530
I think we should go check out that CCTV.

108
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,060
Hold it.

109
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,030
This one is suspicious.

110
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:55,390
Yes. Besides the victims, the only one who went into the alley around the time of the crime is this person.

111
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,600
- Zoom in closer. 
 - Okay.

112
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,320
Has a slim figure and about 180cm tall...

113
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,530
He completely covered up his face.

114
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,340
It would have been great if we could get something a little more certain than this.

115
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,770
Alright, when the day breaks, let's go back to the crime scene.

116
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,610
Yes, Sir.

117
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,830
He covered up his whole face just by wearing a mask.

118
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,000
 Another violent assault occurred in the middle of Seoul. 

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,620
 Last night on a street of Eunha-gu, the culprit assaulted a passerby, Mr. Park, for no reason. 

120
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,260
 He ran away after assaulting another citizen, Mr. Yang, who witnessed the incident. 

121
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,040
 The police are investigating now. 

122
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,470
 The police secured the image of the primary suspect from a CCTV 

123
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,590
 and have released it to the public as nationally wanted criminal. 

124
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,520
What are you watching so absentmindedly?

125
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,300
Jae Hyeon, Goo Gil's incident is on TV right now.

126
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,320
- It looks like the criminal was caught on CCTV. 
  - The culprit has a slim figure and is about 180cm tall. 

127
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,380
 He had on a black hat and a black mask  at the time of the crime. 

128
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,400
- Let's have breakfast. 
  - The police are investigating what seems to be a consecutive... 

129
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,530
Okay. Wait a second!

130
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,500
Jae Hyeon, what's wrong with your neck? Did you get hurt?

131
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,820
No, I just got a little scratch from shaving.

132
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,230
It looks so painful. Let me put some ointment on you.

133
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,340
I'm fine. I will do it.

134
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,900
- Huh? 
- Let's eat.

135
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,310
Okay, but you will get a scar though.

136
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,740
Pil said that he will be investigating that case from last night.

137
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,190
Did he figure anything out yet?

138
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,380
Well, I'm not sure since I didn't call him to ask about it.

139
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,480
I'll ask him when I see him next time.

140
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,990
Jae Hyeon, I will put some clothes out for you, so you go ahead and eat first.

141
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,620
Okay.

142
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,070
We were able to secure footage from a CCTV.

143
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,200
Did he look like this?

144
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,770
I'm not so sure. I hardly remember anything.

145
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,180
He's so out of it right now. Please hurry up and catch the criminal for us.

146
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,860
Hello. Excuse me, I was wondering if I could ask you something.

147
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,730
There was a violent assault incident that happened over there last night.

148
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,750
We are looking for a person. Have you seen a man who looks like this?

149
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,630
Not sure.

150
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,850
Alright, thank you very much.

151
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,230
- Have you waited for while? I am coming back from the hospital, so...
 - No.

152
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,200
- How are you feeling? 
 - Not good.

153
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,580
Do you remember if the culprit looked like this?

154
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,220
I'm not sure. I was too busy getting beat up, so I have no idea.

155
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,000
What?! Goo Gil went through a violent assault?!

156
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,070
Yeah, it was all over the news.

157
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,770
So that's what that news was about?

158
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,450
Oh my, is Goo Gil okay by the way?

159
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,200
He is hospitalized right now.

160
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,140
Luckily he wasn't badly injured, but I was so shocked.

161
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,430
My my, such a chaotic world.

162
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,550
What kind of crazy guy is going around committing such a crime?!

163
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,350
I know. You and Dad should not roam around at night either.

164
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,020
You guys should be the one to be careful.

165
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,650
Tell your husband to lock up his pharmacy early and come home.

166
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:41,310
How can you feel safe when so many grown men are being beaten up like that?

167
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,870
I know. I actually told him come home early already.

168
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,730
By the way, you and your husband are doing well without any problems, right?

169
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,770
Of course we are. There's nothing problematic.

170
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,230
You should be good to your husband.

171
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,350
I looked around all over the place and realized that there are no sons-in-law like Jae Hyeon.

172
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,880
Okay.

173
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:13,890
This is newly made mustard leaf kimchi and spicy seasoned fish jerky that Jae Hyeon likes. Take it with you when you go.

174
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,890
Awesome! Thanks, Mom.

175
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,290
I should give some to Oppa Goo Gil too on my way home.

176
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,530
You should.

177
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,970
I think the juice truck is closed for today.

178
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,270
I wonder what happened?

179
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,730
- Please call and find out for me.
 - Okay.

180
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,900
Hello there, you're not opening up the juice truck today?

181
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,720
I want to order more drinks for today's meeting.

182
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,270
Oh, is that right? Alright, I understand.  Okay, bye.

183
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,850
- What did she say?
 - She's closing up shop for today.

184
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,850
I wonder if there's something going on.

185
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,650
It's good to be sick.

186
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,410
You're feeding me like this because of it. I wonder if I should be continue to be sick.

187
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,300
Don't talk nonsense and just eat up. Say, ah.

188
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,530
I want more meat. Meat, meat.

189
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,370
Here, say ah.

190
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,630
Oh, you were eating?

191
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,560
Soo Jin is here!

192
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,230
- Are you alright? 
- I'm fine.

193
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,720
My mom gave me some side dishes to take home, but I brought them here so I can share them with you.

194
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,690
I've been taking care of all the side dishes though. But  I still thank you, Soo Jin.

195
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,100
You're working so hard.

196
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,370
Your assault incident is all over the news now.

197
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,650
Yeah, I saw it too. Don't you think I'm going to become a famous person now at this rate?

198
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,650
In your dreams!

199
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,080
Stop butting into other people's problems from now on! You are not even good at fighting.

200
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,090
- I told you that I wasn't in a good condition that night. 
- Jeong Ae, smack him some more.

201
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,900
Ow, that hurts! That hurts, that hurts!

202
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,520
Oh, Pil is here.

203
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,730
- Soo Jin, you're here too. 
- Yeah.

204
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,960
Pil, have you found out anything about the criminal yet?

205
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,000
No, nothing yet. I met with all of the victims

206
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,930
but they all say that they didn't get to see the face of the culprit either. There's no lead.

207
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:37,030
By the way, I wanted to tell you something when you got here.

208
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,140
I remembered this one thing when I became conscious.

209
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,440
What is that?

210
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,550
I think there was a scar on the wrist of the criminal.

211
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,860
- A scar?
 - Yep.

212
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,300
It wasn't a little one either. The scar looked quite large.

213
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,720
- Jeong Ae, please give me a pen and a notepad. 
- Oh, okay.

214
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,660
Pil, take a look at this.

215
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:08,130
Like this, on the wrist. It was long.

216
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,670
Yeah. It was a scar that looked like this.

217
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,890
That's right. It was him.

218
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,330
What are you talking about?

219
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,930
It's nothing really, but I remember seeing some guy

220
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,520
with this kind of scar on the wrist a while ago.

221
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,820
- Who's that? 
-  What kind of guy was he?

222
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,240
I saw him assaulting someone that time as well. But I couldn't catch him in the end.

223
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,680
I feel like he's probably the same criminal from last time.

224
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,630
Man, you should've caught him then. What kind of punk is committing this kind of act anyway?

225
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,550
I bet he is a crazy sociopath.

226
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:01,400
First of all, I think I should report this to headquarters, so they can use this as a reference for the investigation.

227
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,050
Alright, let's make sure to catch that bastard.

228
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,990
I want to see what that punk's face even looks like.

229
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,780
Pil, please help us.

230
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,480
Soo Jin, I will take you home since you have a load to carry.

231
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,100
- I'm okay. 
 - It looks heavy though.

232
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,690
No, it's fine. It's not heavy at all.

233
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,890
We are friends so we should be able to do each other a favor like this.

234
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,300
As long as you have bad feelings for Jae Hyeon,

235
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,240
I don't think I can treat you the same way like before.

236
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,960
I think we need to take some time off from each other. I'm off now.

237
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,920
Hey...

238
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:05,710
 Jae Hyeon... 

239
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,690
 You know how I change when I get really angry, don't you? 

240
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,410
 If you meet with Soo Jin one more time, 

241
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,340
 I'm not going just let you be, so you better straighten up your act. 

242
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,810
If I can't have him,

243
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,650
then no one can.

244
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,910
Jae Hyeon also has a scar on his wrist.

245
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,620
I feel uneasy for no reason.

246
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,340
Alright, fine.

247
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,590
Hello.

248
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,870
Hello, it's me Yeong Joo. Shall we go have some tea together?

249
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,230
Thank you.

250
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,650
The weather is so nice today.

251
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,920
It would've been great if you and I both went somewhere to go take photos on a day like this.

252
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,480
I know, right? Let's go and do that next time.

253
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,050
By the way, the scarf you're wearing is very pretty.

254
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,000
Where did you get it from?

255
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,330
Someone gave it to me as a gift.

256
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,080
Who? Your boyfriend?

257
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,820
Yes.

258
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:57,020
Your boyfriend is super sensible. You must be happy.

259
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,670
Happy?

260
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,400
Someone else took him away from me at the end of the day.

261
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,640
We dated each other for a long time.

262
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,210
He married another woman at the end of the day.

263
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,690
Oh my, that's so horrible.

264
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,090
I bet it is difficult for you.

265
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:24,920
Of course it is. I still love him a lot.

266
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,190
Cheer up please. I'm sure you'll meet someone way better, Yeong Joo.

267
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,560
I don't want another person.

268
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,570
It has to be him and nobody else.

269
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:51,810
Soo Jin, if there were a woman that loves your husband way more than you do,

270
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,950
would you be able to let him go to that  person?

271
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,830
What do you mean? That makes no sense at all.

272
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,900
Why doesn't it make sense, huh?

273
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,080
Since Jae Hyeon was originally my man,

274
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,160
you should give him back to me now!

275
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:20,170
If it weren't for you, I would be next to Jae Hyeon right now.

276
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,610
You stole my place, did you know that?!

277
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,910
You ... who are you?

278
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,610
Me?

279
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:40,230
I'm in a loving relationship with Jae Hyeon.

280
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:46,130
I'm warning you. You won't be able to live with Jae Hyeon for long.

281
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:52,230
The only person who can handle Jae Hyeon is me.

282
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,920
You're crazy.

283
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,470
You're crazy.

284
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,440
I don't have anything to say, so I'll get up first.

285
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,090
Did you know that Jae Hyeon

286
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,210
has a criminal record for assault and a history of psychiatric treatment?

287
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,580
Look at that. You can't even handle that.

288
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,110
I don't believe you.

289
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,330
I don't believe it at all.

290
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,790
Get a hold of yourself.

291
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,530
Get it together.

292
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,900
She's a crazy woman.

293
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,880
There's no need to listen to her.

294
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,070
   

295
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,670
This became troublesome.

296
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,080
Hello, is this the travel agency?

297
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,800
I'm planning on going on a vacation to England.

298
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,490
Yes.

299
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,450
 By the way, who is this woman? 

300
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,500
 Oh, it's her! She's the lady who found your cell phone. 

301
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,410
 I met her coincidentally while I was taking photos in the neighborhood yesterday. 

302
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,960
 - Really?
- She's pretty, right? 

303
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,080
It's not true.

304
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,810
It's not.

305
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,190
I'm home.

306
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,690
Oh, you're here?

307
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,380
Did something happen? You seem upset.

308
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,540
Why? Is it because your friend was hurt?

309
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,210
It's nothing.

310
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,940
But Jae Hyeon...

311
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,140
You know that woman who found your phone that time in the neighborhood?

312
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,940
Do you know her?

313
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,270
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

314
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,420
I met Park Yeong Joo today.

315
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:37,050
According to her, you two have dated for a long time.

316
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,760
Is that true?

317
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,220
Yeah.

318
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,140
Then when you were looking at the photos,

319
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,730
why did you ask about her as if you didn't know her?

320
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,380
Because I didn't want you to know about her.

321
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:08,840
After I saw those photos, I knew that Yeong Joo was intentionally meeting you.

322
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,320
So I went to tell her  to stop.

323
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,820
But I guess she didn't listen to me in the end.

324
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,860
I mean...

325
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,790
Jae Hyeon, you're already married, so why is that girl doing this?

326
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:27,480
If you met Yeong Joo, you should know, but she has a mental problem.

327
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,710
After we broke up, she kept following me around.

328
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,160
She was obsessed with me and kept watching me.

329
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,760
I don't know how long I suffered because of Yeong Joo.

330
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,330
I even considered taking legal actions,

331
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:45,830
but I couldn't go to that extent to someone whom I dated.

332
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:55,050
Jae Hyeon. If something like that had happened, you should've told me.

333
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,080
Do you know how surprised I was today?

334
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,660
I'm sorry, Soo Jin.

335
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,570
It's my fault.

336
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:15,420
If she's someone with  a mental problem, you couldn't have done anything.

337
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,880
You must've been really surprised.

338
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:29,790
I will make sure that woman doesn't come near you in the future.

339
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,630
Okay.

340
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,250
You be careful too, Jae Hyeon.

341
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,460
Okay.

342
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,950
Hello.

343
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:52,500
Seok Tae. Do you remember that manhole we blocked up near Rest Park?

344
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,680
Yes, why?

345
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,140
Is no one managing that area? There was a complaint that came in saying that the cement was all broken.

346
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,850
What?!

347
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,640
Wow, Bong Pil. He really isn't in his right mind!

348
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,040
How did he—

349
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,340
Wow, where did he get this?

350
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,150
Where's Bong Pil? Come here,  come here. This bastard. He's dead.

351
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,710
A scar on his wrist?

352
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:26,170
According to the victim, there was a long scar on the perpetrator's wrist. It looked like this.

353
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,080
Couldn't this become a lead?

354
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,110
But how can you find the culprit with just a scar?

355
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,130
It's not like we can check everyone's wrist.

356
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,500
We can only confirm when a suspect is found.

357
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,950
It's better than nothing.

358
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,350
We can find past assault case culprits and see if any of them have a scar on their wrist.

359
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,070
Take this to the detective in charge for now.

360
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,380
Okay, I understand.

361
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,330
By the way, how's your friend?

362
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:55,310
Ah, he's still in the hospital, but fortunately, his recovery is fast.

363
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,930
That really is a relief.

364
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,990
You might be feeling angry because this happened to someone you know,

365
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,160
but leave this case to the detective in charge

366
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,950
and just focus on your own work.

367
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,280
Okay.

368
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,930
Hey, Bong Pil! You did that to the manhole, right?

369
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,420
What? Who is that person?

370
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,570
Ah, it's nothing. I'll take care of it.

371
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,110
Hey, let's talk outside.

372
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,340
Yeah, come here.

373
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,560
Come outside. Let's talk.

374
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,210
Hey, are you really crazy? Why did you do that?

375
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,470
Were you going to open the manhole again so you could time travel? Huh?

376
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:31,320
Hey, if I were joking, would I have done that?

377
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,300
You didn't listen to me even when I pleaded, so I had to do something!

378
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,790
Hey, are you into some new religion or something? Like a manhole-god or something?

379
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,080
You seem like a lunatic these days!

380
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,950
I can fully understand that  you don't believe me.

381
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,960
But knowing that you would call me crazy, for me to ask you for a favor like that,

382
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,690
how desperate must have I been to do that?

383
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,050
Sure. If what  you're saying is the truth,

384
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,120
then why are you trying to time travel? Why?

385
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,900
Because I'm not happy.

386
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,750
This isn't the present that I chose.

387
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,040
Over here, there isn't anything I can change even if I try, Seok Tae.

388
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:24,730
Hey. Since you're suddenly too serious,

389
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,710
did you think I would believe you?

390
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,230
I'm warning you, really. If you do something like that again,

391
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,330
I'll make you take off your police uniform  (lose your job) ! Understand?

392
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,120
Get it together!

393
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:58,380
I should iron these. The pants— Huh?

394
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,180
What is this?

395
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,680
   

396
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,710
Jae Hyeon. This was inside your suit pocket.

397
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,720
Why do you have plane tickets to England?

398
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,930
I was going to keep it a secret, but I guess you found out.

399
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,520
It's almost our wedding anniversary.

400
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,800
You said that you wanted to take pictures in England, so I got these as a present.

401
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,730
Jae Hyeon.

402
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,960
I'll close the pharmacy for about a week, and let's go on a trip together.

403
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,730
Okay, I got it.

404
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,510
I'm excited just thinking about it.

405
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,220
Oh right, what happened with Goo Gil?

406
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,900
Ah, he's getting discharged from the hospital today.

407
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,330
Did they find any leads on who the perpetrator is yet?

408
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,250
I don't think so.

409
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,730
It's a violent assault, so would he be caught so easily?

410
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,850
You're right.

411
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,030
Oh right, there's some homework we have to do before we leave for England.

412
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,030
What is it?

413
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:08,890
As so it happens, it's Mother-in-law's birthday while we're in England.

414
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,700
Let's go meet with your mother today and go get a gift for her together.

415
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,670
A gift? We don't have to do that. I can just give her lots of cash instead.

416
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:22,390
But cash seems so insincere, so  let's go together.

417
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,340
Alright, okay.

418
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,800
- Let me go get changed first. 
- Okay.

419
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,990
Look at you.

420
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,030
I told you that you should stay at the hospital a bit longer.

421
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:45,460
Gosh, it's not like I'm dying. Besides, I need to keep my shop open.

422
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,290
You're so uselessly sincere. It's not like you're earning a lot.

423
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,300
   

424
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,110
Hello.

425
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,850
Oh, I can't take any delivery orders  today either.

426
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:06,520
Hello? Yes. No, no, no. Of course we can deliver.

427
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,430
Pardon?

428
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,400
Forty cups just like last time?

429
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,410
Of course, that's possible. Yes, we'll deliver it to you promptly.

430
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,910
Thank you very much. Yes, bye now.

431
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:22,760
I'm really okay now, so you should go open up your truck today.

432
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,800
If you do your business like this, you'll lose all your customers.

433
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,530
What good is running a business right now?

434
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,400
- Listen to what I say!
 - Knock it off.

435
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,750
I'm really fine, so go and come back.

436
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,230
Okay then.

437
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,710
I will come right back after the delivery,

438
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,300
so until I come back, rest and make sure to not work too hard, okay?

439
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,870
- Okay. 
 - I'll be back.

440
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,500
Director, it's time for the staff meeting.

441
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,470
And  I ordered  the drinks from that juice truck like last time.

442
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,180
You did well. Please take care of that for me in the future too.

443
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,830
Yes, sir.

444
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:08,230
Oh yeah, did you find out why the juice truck wasn't open yesterday?

445
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:13,900
Oh that is... You remember the gentleman who came with Miss Hong last time?

446
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,530
- You mean, Goo Gil? 
- Yes, that's right.

447
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,790
It seems like he got into an accident or something.

448
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,720
Accident?! What kind?

449
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,890
I was told that he was hospitalized because he was violently assaulted at night.

450
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,570
What did you say?!

451
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,630
The staff meeting will be held soon. Where are you going?

452
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,930
I'm going to be gone for a bit, so please make up a good excuse for me.

453
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,260
Pardon? Director! Dir-

454
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,250
Director! Sir! Director!

455
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,280
Hold it, hold it please! I'm telling you, you can't go.

456
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,100
- I'm not going to take long. I'll be right back. 
 - You're driving me crazy, sir!

457
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,920
- Secretary Kim! 
 - Hello, juice delivery is here. Where should I deliver it to...?

458
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,880
Director...

459
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,170
- Oppa. 
 - Jeong Ae.

460
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,600
Could it be that...

461
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:06,010
the director who ordered our juice was... was it this gentleman here?

462
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,010
Well that is...

463
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,420
You see...

464
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,110
Jeong Ae, let's talk for a minute.

465
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:21,770
About what? You ordered juice from my truck secretly because you pity me?

466
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,000
I wanted to help you even if it's like this.

467
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,260
That's why. You pitied me.

468
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,660
Am I a bum? Am I so pitiful as to get sympathy from you?

469
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,120
Is that why you did that?

470
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,430
I'll go now. I don't want to see your face ever again, Oppa.

471
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,960
Let's talk this out.

472
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,920
You left our town like that, and I couldn't even get a hold of you.

473
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,500
You didn't even show your face anywhere. So why are you acting like you're all worried now?!

474
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,800
It's because I am worried.

475
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,830
You're working really hard to make it happen with your juice truck, and I heard Goo Gil was injured.

476
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,510
So why wouldn't I worry?!

477
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,730
Whether I work at my juice truck and whether Goo Gil gets injured or not,

478
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:58,370
what's the use of you doing all this now?!

479
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,640
Hello, Madam.

480
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,540
Oh, you were here.

481
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,130
Mother, what are you doing here?

482
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,470
I came here so I can have lunch with my son, which I haven't done in a while.

483
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,910
But where are you headed when the staff meeting is about to start?

484
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:16,160
- No. Mother, shall we go now? Let's go. 
- Okay.

485
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,060
♫  Before a trip with you, which I dreamed  ♫

486
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,570
♫  The story we wanted to make together  ♫

487
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,420
♫  Under the bright sunlight, open your eyes  ♫

488
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,770
♫  The morning we wanted to spend together  ♫

489
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,410
That bastard.

490
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,310
♫  Follow a distant road (follow)  ♫

491
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,430
♫  The memories will soon be filled (memories)  ♫

492
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:55,020
♫  Just smile secretly in your imagination, yeah  ♫

493
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,220
♫  You and I sit facing each other  ♫

494
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,890
♫  There's still one thing to whisper  ♫

495
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,400
 It looks heavy though. 

496
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,930
 No, it's fine. It's not heavy at all. 

497
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,490
 As long as you have bad feelings for Jae Hyeon,  

498
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,260
  I don't think I can treat you the same way like before. 

499
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,130
 I think we need to take some time off from each other. I'm off now. 

500
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:24,180
Soo Jin, how come you and I are becoming further and further apart?

501
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,300
- Salute! 
 - Officer Bong.

502
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,990
There's a wanted poster for the assault criminal. Let's pass it around nearby markets and other places.

503
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,990
Okay.

504
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,560
   

505
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,270
You can pick whatever you like, Mother.

506
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:55,100
My my, we are living in luxury because of you, Son-in-law Park.

507
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,880
I think Soo Jin chose a perfect husband, Honey-

508
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,700
Honey, do it quietly without making any sounds.

509
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,500
Honey, sit and try it out, too. It feels like all my exhaustion is going away.

510
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,800
Yeah, Mom, have a seat and try it too.

511
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,650
Should I now?

512
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,790
Now...

513
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:31,040
Oh, Mom, it even plays music.

514
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,630
That's what I'm saying. Listening to music and getting a massage at the same time is a perfect way to heal yourself.

515
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,230
Thanks.

516
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,830
Thank you, Son-in-law. I will use the massage chair very well.

517
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:49,100
You're welcome. I will give you something better for your next birthday.

518
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,360
Oh my, how can you do better than you are already doing now?

519
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,220
Even now, you are doing so much more than I really deserve.

520
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,840
Oh yeah, we decided to go to England a few days from now.

521
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,570
Huh? Why go to England all of a sudden?

522
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,930
Jae Hyeon prepared a trip to England as an anniversary gift.

523
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:09,310
Oh my,  my Soo Jin is a lucky girl indeed.

524
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:13,090
My son-in-law is working so hard but will have nothing left at this rate.

525
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:17,540
I'm making money so I can spend it on my family. So you don't have to say that.

526
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,020
I think I have to go back to the pharmacy since I left it closed for too long.

527
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,730
You do that now.

528
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,830
You stay here for a bit longer, okay?

529
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,170
Okay, I will see you at home.

530
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,430
- Work hard, Son-in-law.
 - Yes.

531
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:42,070
- Eat up. 
- I will.

532
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,410
Oh my, your husband forgot to take his phone with him. What do we do?

533
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,170
Oh my!

534
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,240
It's okay. I can take it to the pharmacy and give it to him on my way home.

535
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,860
- Okay then. 
- Please eat up.

536
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,060
What brings you here?

537
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,660
We are distributing these wanted posters for the assault case.

538
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,130
I see. I hope you catch the culprit quickly. This is a big problem.

539
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,650
You can give it to me for now and I will post it up here.

540
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:33,450
 It looks like a broken ornament. 

541
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,890
Is this your key chain?

542
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,970
Yes it is. Why do you ask?

543
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:40,140
It's broken.

544
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,500
At the tunnel where an assault occurred,

545
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,990
we found a piece that looks very similar to this key chain.

546
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:53,800
The tunnel is a pathway that I use to go to and fro from the pharmacy, so I guess it could be dropped there.

547
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,570
Plus, it's been a long time since this broke.

548
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,570
 I think there was a scar on the wrist of the criminal. 

549
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,460
Excuse me!

550
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,520
May I see your wrist?

551
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,830
Why do you ask about my wrist all of a sudden?

552
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,950
I have something to verify.

553
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,600
By any chance, are you suspecting that I'm the culprit?

554
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,460
All kinds of different circumstances are making me feel suspicious of you.

555
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:28,770
I know that you have ill feelings for me because of Soo Jin,

556
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:32,030
but you shouldn't be suspicious of someone because of personal reasons.

557
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,520
You wish that I was the criminal, right?

558
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,700
Then you can have Soo Jin all to yourself.

559
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,100
What?

560
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:47,710
If you think that I'm the criminal, why don't you try to catch me?

561
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,390
What did you say just now?

562
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,470
I said you can try to catch me if you can.

563
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:04,130
Hey, it was you, wasn't it? You did that. Didn't you, punk?!

564
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,070
You freaking bastard! Tell it to me straight!

565
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:17,050
You did it, didn't you?! You're the one who beat up Goo Gil, aren't you?!

566
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:26,500
Why did you do that?! Why did you do that, you bastard?!

567
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,630
Why did you do that?

568
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,350
Why did you do that, you bastard?!

569
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:42,590
- Gosh, what's going on? 
- Hello, is this the police station? We're at the pharmacy right now.

570
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:46,590
There is a cop in there, who's beating up the pharmacist right now.

571
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,330
Please hurry up. It's an emergency.

572
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,050
Report him.

573
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,050
Hey! What are you doing?! Stop it!

574
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,310
Are you okay, Jae Hyeon?!

575
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:08,530
Hey Bong Pil, why the heck did you hit Jae Hyeon?

576
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,210
What's the reason?!

577
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:17,050
It looks like Pil has a deep misunderstanding about me.

578
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:23,310
The piece of an ornament from a keychain that was discovered at the crime scene happened to be the same as mine.

579
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,290
So it looks like he thinks I'm the culprit because of it.

580
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,820
What?

581
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,280
Hey, you crazy?! Are you out of your mind?!

582
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,990
How can you accuse someone as a criminal with such a thing?!  Are you really a cop?

583
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:38,980
Soo Jin, you can't trust this punk.

584
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,410
I'm telling you, this punk is a really dangerous man.

585
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:48,690
Pil, I don't think I can see you anymore. I mean, I don't want to see you ever again.

586
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:51,530
Starting from today, we are strangers.

587
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,390
I no longer have a friend like you.

588
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,710
Get out. Won't you get out?!

589
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,630
Are you okay?

590
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,630
Officer Bong!

591
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:22,560
I got a report earlier saying that a cop was having a fight with an ordinary citizen in the pharmacy.

592
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,340
Was it you?

593
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,250
Yes.

594
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:30,320
Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing this for?!

595
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,610
Why did you do that?

596
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,870
What was it that made a cop beat an ordinary citizen in broad day light, huh!?

597
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:45,020
- Officer Choi,  you know the assault incident? He is the culprit.
 - What?

598
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,980
You know the piece we gathered at the crime scene? That came off of that punk's keychain.

599
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,220
Hey, Officer Bong! Are you a prosecutor or a crime squad investigator or what?!

600
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,610
Let's say that he is the criminal as you say.

601
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:58,470
Is it okay for you to beat the crap out of the criminal like that?!

602
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:03,060
If he officially reports this as an offense then you'll have to reap the consequences, do you know that?!

603
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,180
Do you really want to be let go of your job as a cop now?

604
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,180
Once you get off work today, go over there and beg for forgiveness no matter what you do. You got that?

605
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,160
I can never do that.

606
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,720
Hey, Officer Bong!

607
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,750
It looks so painful.

608
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,860
Does it hurt?

609
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,530
I'm sorry, Jae Hyeon.

610
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,830
I had no idea that Pil's feelings toward you were that bad.

611
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,150
You have nothing to be sorry about.

612
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:48,480
But Jae Hyeon... are you going to report Pil to the police by any chance?

613
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:53,880
I mean, I know that Pil was wrong,

614
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,700
but I think it may be too much if we make him get punished.

615
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,680
How can you say such a thing when I got beat up by that punk like this?!

616
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,640
It hasn't been long since Pil became a cop,

617
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,010
and with this incident, he could get fired for it.

618
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:18,490
Pil studied really hard to become a cop so I feel bad for him too.

619
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:23,930
Jae Hyeon, let's forgive him just this once.

620
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:30,640
But I will promise you that I won't hurt your feelings because of Pil, okay?

621
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,510
Jae Hyeon.

622
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,040
Al-alright. Let me go wash up.

623
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,870
Okay.

624
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,480
But I wonder why he wanted to see my wrist.

625
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:26,280
Why is everything being tangled up?

626
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:35,220
♫  In case you are serious  ♫

627
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,790
   

628
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:44,170
♫  I wanted to ask you again  ♫

629
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:52,530
♫  Because it comforts my heart  ♫

630
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:55,920
 Soo Jin, I'm trying my best not to be suspicious of him. 

631
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,490
 But why does it continously feel like he's a bad person? 

632
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:02,840
♫  Everything will open up to you  ♫

633
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:09,420
I don't know about other things, but I'm so worried about you.

634
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,610
I feel like I'm going crazy because I worry about you so much.

635
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,710
Oh, what brings you here, Mom?

636
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,590
I bought a box of fruit, but I brought you some because we have too many.

637
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,630
If we leave it at home, they'll end up just rotting.

638
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,330
- Oranges!
 - It's very fresh.

639
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,100
You're here.

640
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,730
You didn't go to work yet?

641
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,350
- I was just about to leave. 
 - Alright now.

642
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,810
- Have fun while you're here.
 - I will.

643
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:51,240
Hey, what's wrong with your husband's face?

644
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,870
Oh, it's nothing.

645
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:56,060
What do you mean it's nothing?

646
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,420
Could it be that he went through that same violent assault case that has been going around in this neighborhood these days?!

647
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,570
Oh no, it's nothing like that, Mom.

648
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:04,350
Just don't say it's nothing. Tell me already!

649
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:09,400
Who made my darling precious son-in-law's face like that?! Who is it?!

650
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,830
Oh my, what brings you here?

651
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:14,300
This little punk.

652
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,770
Honey!

653
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:18,450
- Where is Pil? 
 - Why are you looking for him?

654
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:22,510
I can't believe this. Can a cop beat people up for no good reason?

655
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:26,890
Pil beat up my son-in-law, and his face is all messed up because of him!

656
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,100
Pardon?

657
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,740
I need to see Pil right away!

658
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,770
Oh my...

659
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,770
Hey, Bong Pil! Hurry up and come out now!

660
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,960
I think there's a misunderstanding. I think you should calm down for now.

661
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,550
Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding?

662
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:42,420
You two know very well that Pil has been getting into my son-in-law's business in every step of the way!

663
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,480
I don't understand what he has against my Soo Jin to bother her like this for all his life!

664
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,640
How much longer is he going to be doing this to her?!

665
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,030
Hey Bong Pil, you get up now.

666
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:14,090
You beat up Soo Jin's husband, didn't you?

667
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:17,650
Why did you hit him? There must be a reason.

668
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:20,280
Tell me everything now.

669
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,610
I have nothing to tell you.

670
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:24,280
Of course you would have nothing to say even if you had ten mouths!

671
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,180
You are still not over Soo Jin yet,

672
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,060
so you used violence against Soo Jin's husband for no good reason, right?!

673
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,480
Is this really because of Soo Jin?

674
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,240
I'm  sorry but I really don't want to say anything right now.

675
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,450
Just please leave me alone.

676
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:42,150
Honey, I can't live because of him.

677
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:45,230
Why are you living this way, huh?!

678
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,600
Let's get out for now.

679
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,160
Seriously, this is so...

680
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:01,740
What?! Pil hit Jae Hyeon?!

681
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,340
That's right. So Soo Jin is not going to see Pil from now on.

682
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,260
Why the heck did he do that for? What did Jae Hyeon do so wrong anyway?

683
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,990
Pil accused Jae Hyeon as the assault criminal.

684
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:15,230
Huh?! What kind of proof does he have anyway?

685
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,990
There was this ornament on Jae Hyeon's keychain,

686
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:21,160
and the broken piece to that was discovered at the crime scene.

687
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,590
But still, how can he be suspicious of Jae Hyeon like that though? That's a bit much.

688
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,430
He basically didn't like Jae Hyeon to begin with,

689
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,380
and I guess he thought this was a perfect chance.

690
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:31,280
He is not even in the right mind these days.

691
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,420
He talks about how he time travels by using the manhole and stuff.

692
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,140
What kind of bullshit talk is that? What do you mean time travel?

693
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,410
Oh! Hey! Bong Pil!

694
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:42,600
Hey, where are you going?  You come over here.

695
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,620
Hey, can you even call yourself a human being?

696
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,740
How could you be suspicious of Jae Hyeon and assault him too?

697
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,190
That's right. How did you become a cop when you don't know how to recognize a good person?

698
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,920
Jae Hyeon seems like a nice guy.

699
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,940
Yeah dude, I think you crossed the line this time.

700
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,240
Are you the incarnation of jealousy or what?

701
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,740
Even still, this isn't right, man.

702
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,430
It's nothing like that at all. Why are you acting like this when none of you know anything at all?

703
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,940
Everyone except you knows that Jae Hyeon is a good person.

704
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,680
That's right.  Soo Jin told Jae Hyeon that they shouldn't report you.

705
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,670
And he agreed to it. If that were me, I would've reported you right away.

706
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:18,570
You should be thankful to Jae Hyeon, and you should really reflect on what you did deeply. Got it?

707
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,630
Look at him! Where is he going now?

708
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:25,020
There's a saying that a person that farts has a temper. My goodness.

709
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,280
I am truly sorry that our patrol officer was so rude and disrespectful to you.

710
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,480
I will sincerely apologize to you on his behalf.

711
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:35,910
No, that's fine. I will try to understand.

712
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:41,030
Officer Bong was wrong so he will get disciplined within our department.

713
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:44,550
But could you give him some leniency?

714
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:48,740
He is a young man who has his whole life ahead of him, but he did that because of one single mistake.

715
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,530
Okay, I'll let this one go. It's not like he's a complete stranger either.

716
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:59,490
You're handsome, and you're so forgiving too. I'm so thankful.

717
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,230
Then, farewell. Work hard.

718
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:07,120
Yes. Oh, wait. Take some drinks.

719
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,920
Aiyoo, you don't have—

720
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,960
Then, I'll just take one.

721
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,960
Thank you. Thank you so much.

722
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:25,970
That's right. Why did you mess with me?

723
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,050
I just came back from meeting Park Jae Hyeon.

724
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:45,870
Fortunately, he agreed not to report it, so it looks like you can avoid the worst punishment.

725
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:50,660
Just know that you're lucky that you met a good person.

726
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:55,610
Even so, we can't forgive a case where the police officer assaulted a citizen.

727
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:59,960
You'll be suspended from work for a month. Just know that.

728
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:35,540
No... If someone's angry, they can do that.

729
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:38,380
It's nothing.

730
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,970
Sorry, excuse me.

731
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:55,030
Go first, I'll follow soon.

732
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,630
Yes.

733
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,580
Soo Jin.

734
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,050
Let's talk.

735
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:11,160
Let me go. I told you not to associate with me.

736
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,900
I heard that you asked Jae Hyeon not to report me.

737
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,880
Don't misunderstand. It's not because I like you.

738
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,090
Why did you do it? You should've let him report me.

739
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,880
You probably resent and hate me too right now.

740
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,090
I thought of your parents, who were so proud that  you passed  your civil service exam.

741
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,700
That's why I stopped Jae Hyeon.

742
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,540
If it weren't for your parents, I would've reported you myself.

743
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,900
Like I told you yesterday, I don't regard you as a friend anymore.

744
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,780
My kindness to you ends here.

745
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:53,200
♫  Unconsciously I will be hanging around you  ♫

746
00:55:54,060 --> 00:56:02,770
♫  With you, I guess I was too young then  ♫

747
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:10,360
♫  If you, if only you  ♫

748
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:16,120
There's no one who believes me.

749
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,990
And Soo Jin hates me more and more.

750
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:24,830
♫  How would it feel&nbsp;if I hugged you  ♫

751
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:27,200
It gets worse and worse each day.

752
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,250
♫  You and I  ♫

753
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:44,280
Hey. What do I have to do for you to take me away from this hell?

754
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,430
What do I have to do...

755
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,540
What are you doing here again?

756
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,560
Are you getting off work now?

757
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,760
You're not trying to break this manhole again, are you?

758
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,250
Don't worry. Today I don't even have the arm strength to do it.

759
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,640
Don't disturb Soo Jin, who's living a good life.

760
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,460
Don't create problems in their family, and just get it together.

761
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:32,550
Okay. Everyone says I'm the bad guy.

762
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:37,350
Would I have done that to someone who did nothing wrong?

763
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:40,920
I don't know. Doesn't matter. You were the wrongdoer this time. Anyone can see that.

764
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:47,230
So go to Jae Hyeon and apologize to him. And go apologize to Soo Jin as well.

765
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:53,290
I know you can't forget Soo Jin,

766
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:57,560
but if you really think of Soo Jin, you can't do this, Pil.

767
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:06,890
If it's for Soo Jin's happiness, you should just let her go now.

768
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,580
Welcome.

769
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:40,610
Your face looks bad.

770
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:46,900
I know. How are you, Goo Gil? Your wounds have recovered a lot.

771
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:51,960
For me... I naturally  have very good endurance for getting beaten...

772
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,650
- Please give me an ointment to prevent scars from wounds. 
 - Okay.

773
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:01,220
You were upset because of Pil, right?

774
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:06,220
That kid did a lot of weird things ever since he was young.

775
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:10,310
Either way, thank you for agreeing to settle like this.

776
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:14,030
Don't mention it. He's Soo Jin's friend.

777
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:28,090
- What's the matter?
- Oh, it's nothing.

778
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,300
- How much is it? 
 - It's ₩5000.

779
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:35,200
₩5000... Here you go.

780
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:39,340
- I'll see you next time.
- Goodbye.

781
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,430
It's definitely the scar I saw that day.

782
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,470
No way.

783
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:01,410
It's not.

784
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:04,990
It's not. Ow, my back.

785
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:07,820
Should I pack more long-sleeved tops?

786
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:14,380
You're here? Good timing. Where's your suitcase?

787
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,920
I'm packing for the trip, but I couldn't find your suitcase.

788
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,560
Oh, that? I left it in the trunk of my car. I'll go get it.

789
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,610
No, I'll go get it. You go in and shower.

790
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:27,320
- Car keys.
- Thanks.

791
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:58,180
Here it is.

792
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:03,560
What is this?

793
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:27,390
 He had on a black hat and a black mask at the time of the crime. 

794
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:32,580
 Since Jae Hyeon was originally my man, you should give him back to me now! 

795
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:38,530
 Did you know that Jae Hyeon has a criminal record for assault and a history of psychiatric treatment? 

796
01:01:54,180 --> 01:02:00,000
It's not. It can't be.

797
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:05,360
It's not Jae Hyeon.

798
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:27,810


799
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:36,500
♫  With you, I guess I was too young then  ♫

800
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:43,080
♫  If you, if only you  ♫

801
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,520
   

802
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:50,110
 Please hurry up and come over here. I have something to tell you. 

803
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:52,990
 Soo Jin got into a hit-and-run accident.  

804
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:55,020
 Save Soo Jin! 

805
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:59,890
 I won't be able to live if something bad happens to Soo Jin. So please open this manhole for me.  

806
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:04,150
 I told you that nothing would ever happen to you, yet... 

807
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:07,990
 Do you not remember anything about the accident? 

808
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:12,560
 I will bring it and shove it in front of your face for you, so you just wait.
