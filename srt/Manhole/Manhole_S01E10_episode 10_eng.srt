1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,210
   

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:19,710


3
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,980
Nice weather!

4
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,520
They must be hungry.

5
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,150
For you too.

6
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,950
Here you go.

7
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,390
What are you doing? Are you watering the plants?

8
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,260
Let's eat. Eat first then continue.

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,580
Yum.

10
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,620
You're probably  about to gain some weight. You really eat well these days.

11
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,620
Food has been tasting like honey ever since we moved  to this place.

12
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,280
My sleep has been sweet like honey, too.

13
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,620
This place must have good feng shui.

14
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,780
Honey-like feng shui! Honey-like food, honey-like sleep, honey-like feng shui.

15
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,220
I hope you can receive all of this good  energy so that you can become rich.

16
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,760
What's so good about being rich? The more you have to protect, the  more unhappy you'll be.

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,740
I just  want to be happy by living a simple life like this.

18
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,210
Why? If you have money, you can buy nice clothes, travel abroad, and live in a nice house, too.

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,720
I'll show you that you can be happy without having a lot of money.

20
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,870
Say, ah.

21
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,170
Don't worry. I will make enough money so you can live happily.

22
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,890
Then you'll have to make as much as you can, okay?

23
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,260
Okay.

24
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,550
I wonder if Jin Sook is doing okay.

25
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,280
She's the type of girl that will somehow survive and return even if you put her in the middle of a desert.

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,850
She's so good at adapting wherever she goes.

27
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,290
She'll live a good life. That Jin Sook.

28
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:26,660
   

29
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,380
Is there a mosquito here?

30
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,770
So itchy.

31
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,960
Fee--

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,130
I can't feel anything.

33
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,170
Are you awake?

34
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,160
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,230
Hey, why are youâ€” why are you in my room?

36
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,790
I came in the morning.

37
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,190
What's wrong? Are you scared that I might jump on you?

38
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,090
What is she saying?!

39
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,900
Hey, why are there so many mosquitoes in this room?!

40
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,850
Did you get a mosquito bite? Let me put some medicine on you.

41
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,190
Let me see.

42
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,380
Wait, wait. Don't come.

43
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,520
- I'm fine! No, just go over there!
- Let me see.

44
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,560
What's with him?

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,090
Hey! Seriously!

46
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,950
What's with the commotion?

47
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,990
In my room, in my room... There is...

48
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,670
What about your room?

49
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,690
Mom, in my room, there's Jin Sook. She's in my room.

50
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,820
I was worried there  for a second. She probably couldn't wait to see her groom's face so she must have went up.

51
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,620
Huh? Groom?!

52
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,610
Good morning, Mother and Father!

53
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,500
Hello, our darling Jin Sook is here.

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,080
Did you go upstairs because you wanted to see Pil so much?

55
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,390
If you're going to be like that, you guys should just live together.

56
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,110
But how can I do that when we're not even married yet?

57
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,200
Hey... m-marriage?

58
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Hey punk, go up and get changed so we can eat!

59
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,100
 I'll be getting married to Jin Sook now? 

60
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,870
Let me go to the bathroom real quick.

61
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,200
   

62
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,400
Yes, this is a dream. I'm dreaming while I'm time traveling.

63
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,520
But if this is a dream that I can't seem to wake up from despite the cold shower...

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,900
No, no, no...

65
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,950
This kind of dreams exists, too. Of course, they do.

66
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,850
Pil, hurry up and come out! Everyone is waiting on you!

67
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,220
How in the world did I end up in this situation where I'm about to get married to Jin Sook?

68
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,960
Damn, this manhole. This manhole!

69
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,630
My lunch time is almost over so I should hurry up and eat to head back to the post office.

70
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,930
Let's eat.

71
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,920
Hey, try to eat everything here, okay?

72
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,710
Your mom worked so hard to make all this for you, so have a grateful heart.

73
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,420
Jin Sook, try this soybean soup. I don't know if I seasoned it right though.

74
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,390
Shall I try it, now?

75
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,230
Mother, this is so good that you'll be able to sell it in New York! Thumbs up! Double thumbs up!

76
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,590
She's such a sweetheart. This girl is such a blessing to us.

77
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,390
Jin Sook, eat a lot. You eat all the good stuff here, okay?

78
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,670
Our Pil is finally fulfilling his duty as a son in the latter years of our lives.

79
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,330
I was disappointed that I didn't have a daughter, but we have a wonderful girl as a daughter-in-law. I'm so touched by this.

80
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,320
I will take good care of both of you for the rest of my life.

81
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,700
Okay, okay.

82
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,250
Have some. Hurry.

83
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,190
Say, ah. Say, ah.

84
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,740
- Huh? Why are you working by yourself? Where did Dal Soo go?
 - To the bathhouse.

85
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,370
That guy needs to take a bath. He is actually dirtier than you think.

86
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,440
Why do you care?!

87
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,590
What about your shop?! You don't have any customers?

88
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,180
I left one of the part-timers in charge and came. I need to take a break from time to time, too.

89
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,750
Why do you always take your breaks here?! Is this a rest stop on a freeway?

90
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,900
Might as well read that. It's the new volume you've been waiting for.

91
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,170
Read and leave soon.

92
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,860
I'm reading as an excuse to see you. Why else would this be...

93
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,460
What?

94
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,510
Oh, nothing.

95
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,770
Thanks. I will enjoy the read before I go.

96
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,790
Hi!

97
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,790
Oh, You're here too Oppa Goo Gil. Where's Oppa Dal Soo?

98
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,390
Dal Soo went to the bathhouse. Is this a neighborhood rest area?

99
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,170
Why is everyone gathering here for?

100
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,500
I'm here to return the DVDs. Should I just keep them?

101
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,570
No!

102
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,710
It's because all of our customers here are nothing but freeloaders!

103
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,400
Is this the public library or what?

104
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,460
You said to me that I was treating it like a rest stop. Now you're saying that it's a public library.

105
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,040
Such freeloaders.

106
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,060
Huh? Were you always into this kind of stuff?

107
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,870
England in Love?

108
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,660
No, I just watched them because the movies are set where I'm going to go study abroad.

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,660
I envy you so much. I wish I can go study abroad.

110
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,430
Let's go then. Let's go together.

111
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,150
Are you crazy?

112
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,890
You both are going to come to Sook's wedding photo shoot, right?

113
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,970
- Of course.
 - Of course we're going.

114
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,100
I'm going to go see Jin Sook in her wedding dress.

115
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,860
Okay, see you later then.

116
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,750
Bye!

117
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,800
I wonder if Pil will be happy.

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,690
What do you mean?

119
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,640
Men's first love lasts forever, you know.

120
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,520
I'm wondering if that marriage will be happy when he's leaving Soo Jin behind.

121
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,840
Pil only looked out for Soo Jin all his life. Like me.

122
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,380
Stop saying nonsense!

123
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,210
You going to die if you say useless things to Pil and mess everything up, got it?!

124
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,200
Soo Jin won't feel completely comfortable about this either.

125
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,950
Shut the hell up! Quickly read and quickly leave.

126
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,400
Alright.

127
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,060
- Hello, Sunbae.
 - You're here.

128
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,630
- Hello.
 - Hello.

129
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,860
How's your preparation for studying abroad coming along?

130
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,120
Just so-so.

131
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,210
You said it was England, right? I heard that the art schools there are quite famous.

132
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:49,230
I feel disappointed that I won't be seeing you for a few years, Soo Jin.

133
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,200
Maybe I should tag along with you.

134
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,120
Pardon?

135
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,350
We should be able to see each other if it's meant to be.

136
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,770
You're leaving so soon that you won't be able to see your friend's wedding before you go.

137
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,690
The neighborhood is flooding with news because of their wedding.

138
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,920
I know. It's a shame but my departure date happened to be set up that way.

139
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,060
I guess it can't be helped.

140
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,700
I'm sorry but I have to go to the studying abroad center right now.

141
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,900
Well then. CEO, I'm off now.

142
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,050
Okay!

143
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,180
You are making a lot of effort

144
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,780
but that blue bird is flying away.

145
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,760
I should've cut off those wings earlier. I guess I was one step too late.

146
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,380
Cut off her wings?

147
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,490
You are saying some scary stuff there.

148
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,260
I'm just saying, nothing more. I just feel that disappointed about it that's all.

149
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,500
- Thanks for the drink.
 - My pleasure.

150
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,130
Since I received an acceptance letter, I should get the visa soon, right?

151
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,230
Of course. Generally it's really hard to get into an art school, but since you prepared yourself so well,

152
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,970
all you have left to do is to be on that plane.

153
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,660
Oh, that's right!  Have you looked into your living quarters near the school yet?

154
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,100
No, not yet.

155
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,530
I can help you find a place near school.

156
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,870
If you can, that would be so great.

157
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,920
There are some  home stays that are affiliated with us, so I will contact them for you.

158
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,730
- Please take good care of it. 
- Of course.

159
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,250
- I will call you.
 - Go safely. Okay.

160
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,100
   

161
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,010
Excuse  me. Can I ask you a question?

162
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,710
Which school is that woman going to?

163
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,060
Why are you asking...

164
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,650
I overheard a bit of your conversation. I'm looking for art schools too.

165
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,380
Ah, I see.

166
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,920
- Should we have a more detailed discussion in the consultation room then?
- Sure.

167
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,010
Please come this way.

168
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,540
This would be too hot, right?

169
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,950
Oh, this one...

170
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,490
This doesn't match well with your face.

171
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,580
Would this one be good?

172
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,200
- Jin Sook. 
 - Yes?

173
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,160
How did we become like this?

174
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,090
What are you talking about?

175
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:21,830
Well, how did we end up at this point of getting married?

176
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,810
Why? Do you regret it?

177
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,740
Uh, what do you mean regret? It's just...

178
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,520
It seems like a dream, that's why.

179
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,550
It's not a dream.

180
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,890
Hey. Wear this one.

181
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,670
Pink goes well with you, too. If you try, you look very handsome.

182
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,960
But where are we going?

183
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,240
We have a lot of things to do today. Get dressed quickly.

184
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,930
I'm going to change too.

185
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,370
Okay. Let's not hurt Jin Sook.

186
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,140
But isn't pink a bit too much, Jin Sook?

187
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,490
Hey.

188
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,060
The weather is nice, isn't it?

189
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,250
Uh huh. It's nice.

190
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,730
The weather is so nice.

191
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,950
Seok Tae, why aren't you eating?

192
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,750
I feel like I'm chewing sand.

193
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,330
You generally eat even sand well.

194
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,630
Seok Tae, how old are you?

195
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,060
What about my age?

196
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,680
I have a sister-in-law. She is very pretty.

197
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,860
I'd introduce you two if your ages were similar.

198
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,230
I only have one heart,

199
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,410
and it's already invested in someone.

200
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,220
â™«  My feelings for you  â™«

201
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,640
What are you doing?

202
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,850
â™«  That I hid from you for so long might be all right  â™«

203
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,160
Pil.

204
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,100
â™«  It must not be a one-sided love  â™«

205
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,090
â™«  Tell me that you want me  â™«

206
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,580
- I like this one.
- Then let's get it.

207
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,760
Look at this.
â™«  For you, I can do anything  â™«

208
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,280
Aw, it's so cute.
â™«  Don't avoid it and show me your heart  â™«

209
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,430
What is this? 
 â™«  I hope that you will fall into my heart  â™«

210
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,780
It's a clay pitcher made in Denmark.
 â™«  I hope that you will fall into my heart  â™«

211
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,890
It's pretty.
 â™«  I hope that you will fall into my heart  â™«

212
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,700
â™«  Woo~ Look at me  â™«

213
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,810
â™«  Woo~ Love me. Only you  â™«

214
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,960
Are you tired?
 â™«  Woo~ Love me. Only you  â™«

215
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,500
No. It's fun.
 â™«  Woo~ Love me. Only you  â™«

216
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,520
If you're tired, let's go after resting.
â™«  Are the one who makes me smile  â™«

217
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,090
Let's just go home now.
â™«  Woo~ Tell me  â™«

218
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,800
We have a lot left to do.
â™«  Woo~ That you love me. Just like that  â™«

219
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,700
â™«  Woo~ That you love me. Just like that  â™«

220
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:40,870
â™«  If the growing love is the same as my heart  â™«

221
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,370
Excuse me, are we allowed to use this?

222
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,010
  
  

223
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,190
Here you go.

224
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,860
Hey, you should ask the guy to do things like this.

225
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,480
Then you should've done it before I ordered.

226
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,290
I'm sorry. I have a lot of thoughts today.

227
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,400
But why did you order beer? Why are we day drinking?

228
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,430
It's coffee. Isn't it cool?

229
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,200
It's good.

230
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:50,690
Hey. Why are you spilling it all like a child?

231
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,630
What? Why are you looking at me like that? It makes me embarrassed.

232
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,700
I'm sorry for a lot of things. I'm not much of a help to you.

233
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:14,310
It's okay. I know that dragging men around to prepare marriage-related items is a mean thing to do.

234
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,600
Well, today wasn't bad.

235
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,390
Oh right, Pil. What present should we give to Soo Jin for her study abroad?

236
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,740
Soo Jin's present...

237
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,340
Huh?

238
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,920
Soo Jin is studying abroad?

239
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,040
What? It sounds like you just heard it today.

240
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,020
- She'll have a hard time abroad.
-  Studying abroad? 

241
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,970
 What is going on? 

242
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:43,990
Is she studying abroad alone?

243
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,220
- Of course.
- What about that pharmacist?

244
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,560
Jae Hyeon?

245
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,790
It seems like Jae Hyeon is interested in Soo Jin,

246
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,370
but it doesn't seem like Soo Jin is at all.

247
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,150
I thought that the two of them would look good together.

248
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,790
Hey, looking good together, my foot!

249
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,270
Why are you overreacting?

250
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,820
Never mind. Never mind.

251
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,300
Are you two coming back from somewhere?

252
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,580
Jae Hyeon.  We just came back from marriage-related shopping.

253
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,430
Wow. I'm jealous.

254
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,580
I sincerely congratulate you on your wedding.

255
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,010
Thank you.
   

256
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,130
Hey, Pil.

257
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:38,110
You have to thank him for his congratulations. Why are you staring off into space?

258
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,290
- Oh.
- No, it's alright.

259
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,780
Then we'll get going.

260
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,930
Yes, goodbye.

261
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,130
Let's go.

262
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,770
I guess I don't have to worry about that bastard anymore.

263
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,350
Hey. Why did we come to the studio?

264
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,440
Soo Jin said that she would take our wedding photos as our wedding present.

265
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,470
So she rented the studio out.

266
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,400
What's wrong with you today? Do you have memory loss?

267
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,420
Yo, are the groom and bride here?

268
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,700
Yo.

269
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,860
Look at you. Even the couple shirts.

270
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,600
You do cheesy things better than I expected, Bong Pil.

271
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,060
But why is this kid so frozen?

272
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,880
He must be nervous.

273
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,110
I guess so.

274
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,850
- Okay. The dress is all set up, so let's start with the makeup. Come inside.
- Okay.

275
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,400
Hey, we're here.

276
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,560
What the heck? Why did you come?

277
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,920
Hey, this is an important moment in history. I had to call all of them.

278
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,540
I heard you were digging the grave of youth, so I came.

279
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,190
Farewell.

280
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,660
I will crawl back out of the grave, so don't worry.

281
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,090
Aiyoo. I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would wear a wedding dress after Jin Sook.

282
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,580
Jeong Ae. I can get married right away today.

283
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,370
Don't get in the way, and just stay in the corner. I have to be photogenic today.

284
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,460
Here, let's get ready. Go!

285
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,300
- Go, go.
- Get ready.

286
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,070
Unni, you have to pay special attention to my friend.

287
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,970
Make sure her shading and highlight are especially well done.

288
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,260
The photos have to come out stunning. Okay?

289
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,650
I got it. Let's make this happen.

290
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,460
Then can you focus on my dark circles?

291
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,400
I was super tired today because I went shopping for our marriage.

292
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,690
Aigoo, you're going overboard.

293
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,000
Although your body is tired, isn't it fun shopping for marriage stuff with Bong Pil?

294
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,970
I have that kind of fantasy for my wedding.

295
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,900
I did too, but you try dragging a dead body around. I tasted death today.

296
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,190
I have to look and decide by myself. Pil is no help.

297
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,130
You're right. Bong Pil has no idea what a woman's heart is like.

298
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,190
He's not interested in those things either.

299
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,590
- Hey. Is your preparation to go abroad going well?
- Yeah.

300
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,070
I got the plane ticket. All I need to do is leave.

301
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,090
You should stay a little longer, make sure to come, then leave.

302
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,590
Hey, what can I do when the schedule came out that way?

303
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,590
This wench is going to bother me about this her whole life.

304
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,230
It's because I'm upset!

305
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,770
I'm sorry, really.

306
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,310
Hey. I'll be setting up outside.

307
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,050
- Unni, I request this of you.
- Okay.

308
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,060
Hey!

309
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,900
Give that to me.

310
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,400
Oh, okay.

311
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,880
You've never tied a bow tie in your life.

312
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,690
Look this way.

313
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,090
Hey!

314
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,260
Even if Sook opens up not her third but her 100th juice truck,

315
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,770
a man should never have a woman support him,

316
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,190
You'll be more confident as man if you are able to hold your own.

317
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,920
Don't give Sook a hard time, got it?

318
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,070
I heard that you're leaving to go study abroad.

319
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,170
When are you leaving?

320
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,020
Did you forget already? A week from now.

321
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,710
 I sincerely congratulate you on your wedding.
  

322
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,460
Are you leaving by yourself?

323
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,830
Who else would I be going with?

324
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,340
Why?

325
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,890
Never mind.

326
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,940
Sorry that I won't be able to go to your wedding.

327
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,530
But I will gift a good amount of money for your wedding so don't be so disappointed, okay?

328
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,300
It's done.

329
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,100
â™«  In case you are serious  â™«

330
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,750
Soo Jin.

331
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,350
 I am experiencing a lot of unexplainable things everyday, 

332
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,700
 but there is one thing that I'm able to explain. 

333
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,410
 It's the fact that we both like each other. 

334
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:40,870
 Don't give up on me yet since I haven't given up yet either. 

335
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,430
 We'll soon see each other again with our different selves. We will. 

336
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,820
â™«  Everything will open up to you  â™«

337
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,200
â™«  Now both the pain  â™«

338
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,800
â™«  And all the wounds  â™«

339
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,990
Hey...

340
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,460
Sook might be waiting for you.

341
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,700
Yeah.

342
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,070
â™«  Everything which has distressed my heart  â™«

343
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:12,860
â™«  I want to entrust to you  â™«

344
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,870
A huge congratulations on your marriage.

345
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,270
You and Sook both look good together.

346
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,650
Bong Pil, you look great dressed up like this.

347
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,560
â™«  Like a fool  â™«

348
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,940
 Soo Jin. 

349
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,600
Where did Jeong Ae go?

350
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,210
She's not outside either.

351
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,430
If she's not outside, she must be inside somewhere.

352
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,650
Huh? Why would Jeong Ae be inside?

353
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,420
I don't know.

354
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,330
Ta-da!

355
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,700
How do I look?

356
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,720
Wow.

357
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,040
So radiant.

358
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,120
Oh, you're blinding me!

359
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,880
Oh, I'm going blind now!

360
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,480
This is the newest model here.  Doesn't it totally look good on me? Hurry up and take a photo of me now.

361
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,990
- Okay, let's take a picture. 
- Okay, okay.

362
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,960
- Wait a second. 
- Move over.

363
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,300
- Gosh, wait. Wait. Jeong Ae, look over here.
- Right over here. Look right in front of the camera.

364
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,230
- Jeong Ae, this way. 
- Hey.

365
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,100
Over here. Look at me now.

366
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,790
- Right in front of the camera here please. 
- Smile for me please.

367
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,050
- Move away for a second.
 - Let's take one together.

368
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,530
- Let's also take a selfie too. Ah, it came out well. 
- We all should take one now.

369
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,240
Okay, one, two.

370
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,160
Yeah, that came out great.

371
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,010
 Soo Jin. 

372
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,520
Why are you being nervous like it's your first marri- Right, it's your first time.

373
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,070
Hey, Soo Jin! Doesn't he not look like the Bong Pil we know?

374
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,050
This is what I call a beautiful transformation.

375
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,390
I'm doing all kinds of things now.

376
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,220
- Hey, you'll do well. Don't be nervous. 
- Of course. It's your first time. Yeah.

377
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,260
- Let's practice smiling now. Don't nervous, alright. 
- Smile. Yes.

378
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,660
Ta-da!

379
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,590
Wow. Wow!

380
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,930
Are you sure you're the Sook that drinks soju by the bottle?!

381
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,680
I oppose of this marriage.

382
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,610
I think Jin Sook is too good for this marriage.

383
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,220
Go call the cops now. We have to stop this marriage!

384
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:47,210
She doesn't look as good as me, but don't you guys still think that she's super pretty?

385
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,320
- Soo Jin, look at  Jin Sook. Doesn't she look awesome?
 - Wow.

386
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,960
- I was already pretty you know.
 - My darling Sook, you're so beautiful.

387
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,370
Hey Bong Pil, you should say something too.

388
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,700
Why are you guys being like this all of a sudden?

389
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,320
Jin Sook was already pretty. You didn't know that?

390
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,430
You didn't know that?

391
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,090
- What the?
 - What's with him?

392
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,830
Alright, let's get started.

393
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,970
Alright! The bride and the groom, enter!

394
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,530
â™«  You came gently to me.  â™«

395
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,720
Okay...

396
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,570
Ms. Bride, smile brightly and get into the groom's embrace.

397
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:25,500
Mr. Groom, smile brightly. I'm going to take it now.

398
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,460
Hey Bong Pil, a little bit more.

399
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,630
- Yeah, a little bit more.
 - Okay, I'm going to take it now.

400
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,460
One, two, three.

401
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,580
- I said to smile a little bit more! 
- Why is he like that?

402
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,960
Okay, I'm going to take it.

403
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,360
One, two, three.

404
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,820
Soo Jin, don't you have to do it this way?

405
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,350
Okay, let's get up.

406
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,140
Get up? Alright,  let's get up.

407
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,640
Get up, man!

408
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,560
Now, face each other.

409
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,960
Now, pose well. Okay!

410
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,650
Okay, a little bit more.

411
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,160
One, two, three.

412
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,430
Does this guy have a camera-phobia or what? Pil, be a little bit more daring!

413
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,330
Like this kind of pose here. I'm telling you to do something like this.

414
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,160
- Take a picture. A picture.
 - Hold, it right there.

415
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,490
Should we do something like that too? Let's try it.

416
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,360
Let's take one that's a little more reserved.

417
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,590
Okay, let's do that. We can do a more reserved one.

418
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,760
Okay, I'm going to take it now.

419
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,550
Hey, you guys should at least kiss! Kiss!

420
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:37,140
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss!

421
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,900
A man is supposed to take the lead and do the kissing. So hurry up and get to it!

422
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,340
Forget about it. Why is kissing necessary?

423
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,230
Bong Pil, this is a must for a wedding photo, so get to it now.

424
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,830
I told you, it's okay.

425
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:52,960
Why are you acting so expensive today? I'll do it.

426
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,270
Hey, hold up for a second.

427
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,380
It's that...

428
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,090
It's just...

429
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,480
It's not that.

430
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,630
It's because it's a bit embarrassing to do that in front of all these people.

431
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,100
I guess Bong Pil is embarrassed in front of us.

432
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,030
How are you going to handle your first night at this rate?

433
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,040
â™«  It's uselessly pretending not to know  â™«

434
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,470
Let's take the picture already. This is way better than kissing, right?

435
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,100
Yep. Let's take it now.

436
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,140
Alright, I'm going to take it for real now.

437
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,010
Going now.

438
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,020
Very pretty!

439
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:49,530
â™«  I uselessly pretended  â™«

440
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:56,180
â™«  It wasn't a heart which loved you  â™«

441
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:04,190
â™«  I love you. The words for you which were said to you  â™«

442
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:09,170
â™«  The words which I expressed sincerely  â™«

443
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,480
Snap out of it, Kang Soo Jin.

444
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,340
It's a good thing.

445
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,890
And it's something to congratulate.

446
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,700
All you have to do is

447
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,540
wish them happiness.

448
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:39,320
â™«  Saying it surreptitiously to you  â™«

449
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,580
You're tired because of the photo shoot, right?

450
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,350
But they came out so pretty.

451
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,700
- Really?
 - Yep.

452
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,890
I'll go get some water. Rest here.

453
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,500
Thanks, Jeong Ae.

454
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,250
â™«  While whispering in my heart both today and tomorrow  â™«

455
00:29:53,250 --> 00:30:02,660
â™«  Will my heart be discovered loving you  â™«

456
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:09,290
â™«  I pretended not to know  â™«

457
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:16,560
â™«  Love you, love you for you  â™«

458
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:28,710
â™«  Love you, love you for you  â™«

459
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,930
   

460
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,540
Open up the lid please.

461
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:50,090
Go inside and check the status of the inside.

462
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,530
Further inside please.

463
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:57,230
- Try to focus on the most inner part of it, please.
 - Okay.

464
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,200
   

465
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,480
What a shame.

466
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,180
If we had more time, I would've tried on all those wedding dresses in there.

467
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,930
What's wrong?

468
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:29,700
Jeong Ae, should we go somewhere and drink a cup of coffee?

469
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,060
That's a waste of money.

470
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,420
We're almost at your store, so why would you go to a cafe? Let's drink at your store.

471
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,100
Let's go, okay? Let's hurry up and go. Hurry, okay?

472
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,200
- Why?!
 - Young Master!

473
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,160
You should've at least called before coming.

474
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,000
If I called, would we have been able to meet?

475
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,200
You saw how I live, so please leave.

476
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,660
I will stop by the house this weekend, so we can talk then.

477
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,100
Young lady, it might be rude to say this on our first meeting, but you're very pretty.

478
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,870
Thank you.

479
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:30,370
I didn't educate my son very well, so he must be a lot of trouble for you, too.

480
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:37,030
No, that's not true. Oppa takes really good care of me...

481
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,100
I'm glad that he at least treats you well.

482
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,930
But he is not going to stay here for much longer.

483
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,750
He has to go back home.

484
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:54,480
What do you mean go back? Where would I go when this is my home?

485
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,590
Who is that person?

486
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,890
Madam? She is the young master's mother.

487
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:14,360
Young master...? Dal Soo is a young master?

488
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,530
Yes, he is the chairman's youngest son.

489
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,120
Chair... man?!

490
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:30,710
Young lady, I hate saying this to you but you two aren't meant to be together.

491
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,720
This kind of relationship isn't welcomed in our household.

492
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,210
So just let him go.

493
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,720
Even if you hold onto him, you won't ever be able to have him anyway.

494
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,580
Mother, Jeong Ae has no reason to hear that from you.

495
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,350
Please go back.

496
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,720
We don't need to be welcomed by that household.

497
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,460
Did you say that household?

498
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,020
Yes, I did say that household!

499
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,160
I'm sorry that I barged in like this so suddenly.

500
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,780
But young lady, you should still keep what I told you to heart.

501
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,880
I don't say words that I can't keep since I married a businessman.

502
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,950
Even if you hold onto him, you won't ever be able to have him.

503
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:23,900
I'm sorry to say this, but love alone will never

504
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,090
make it happen.

505
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,200
That surprised you, right?

506
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,470
Are you okay? Don't mind what she said.

507
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,450
Oppa, who are you?

508
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,520
Who could I be?

509
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,600
Of course I am Dal Soo,  the cynical business partner who lives with you.

510
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,240
It's okay. Jeong Ae, it's okay.

511
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,700
Bye, you did such an awesome job today.

512
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,700
You  go home and get some good rest for  today.

513
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,300
We can't since we have one more thing on the schedule for today.

514
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,000
We have to get our marriage license today.

515
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:31,290
Huh? Who gets their marriage license before getting married?!

516
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,060
- Let's make this the last thing we do for today.
 - No way.

517
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:38,360
Wow, I think highly of your driving force. My Sook is working at full speed.

518
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,120
I have to because I have an insecurity issue.

519
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,580
It's that kind of insecurity I feel when I don't completely finish up something.

520
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,220
You guys figure it out on your own. Now, just leave.

521
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,290
Fine, I'm leaving! Soo Jin, thanks for everything today.

522
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,100
No problem. Congratulations.

523
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,530
Hey Pil, you follow me.

524
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:05,630
Alright, let's go register our marriage. Let's do it.

525
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,500
Hey, who the hell are you?!

526
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,320
Didn't we hang out together since middle school?!

527
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,750
I really have no idea who you are supposed to be now.

528
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,920
I'm just Dal Soo. I'm the same Dal Soo that you know.

529
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,720
Oh, your father  is a public servant in a countryside town.

530
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,520
And because of your family situation, you came to Seoul to live on your own. That Dal Soo, right?!

531
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,460
Or the Dal Soo who is the youngest son of  a very, very rich man. Which Dal Soo is it?!

532
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,700
I settled over here because I hate that household, okay?

533
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,140
Goo Gil, let's not do this. It's already complicated for me.

534
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,130
I'm sure it must be.

535
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,850
You must feel complicated when you think about the shock that Jeong Ae received.

536
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:55,850
I bet Jeong Ae probably thought that she could be with the person she loved as long as they liked each other.

537
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,080
But because of you, that dream has been shattered.

538
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,780
It won't happen!

539
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,290
Do you want Jeong Ae to be happy?!

540
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,780
Then you should stay out of it from now on.

541
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,670
Go back to your own home now.

542
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,660
 No matter how much you hold onto him, you won't ever be able to have him. 

543
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,630
 I'm sorry to say this, but love alone will never 

544
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,700
 make it happen. 

545
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,260
You've worked hard.

546
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,000
- Seok Tae, hold on a minute there.
 - Yes.

547
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,070
Why was that one blocked when it wasn't even connected to the sewer system?

548
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:49,580
Well when I opened up the manhole, I saw that it was completely filled with cigarette butts.

549
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,920
- Cigarette butts?
 - Yes. There are so many no-smoking zones these days

550
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,010
so I'm guessing that a lot of people go all the way over there to smoke.

551
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,030
Man, those people.

552
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:03,000
But I think we'll be able to finish up the work by tomorrow if we work hard enough.

553
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,160
We should get rid of all the manholes and sewer tunnels in that neighborhood at this chance.

554
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,990
I heard that the higher ups are happy with how fast the civil complaints are dealt with ever since you came here.

555
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,120
Really?

556
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,250
- Keep up the good work.
 - Thank you.

557
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,320
Keep up the good work.

558
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,310
Hey, what are you two doing here?

559
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,370
Oh, we're here to sign up for our marriage license.

560
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:35,080
Oh, is that right?

561
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,920
Let's go over there. I will help you.

562
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,200
So how's your work as a civil servant? Is it doable?

563
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,960
Oh yeah, it's doable.

564
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,200
That's good. Do your best, man. I'm sure you'll be a real one someday.

565
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,040
What?

566
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,510
Oh, nothing.

567
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,530
   

568
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:59,770
Fill out this paperwork first, and after that, all you need is to be issued a proof that you're family now.

569
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,780
It's over there. Do you want me to go there with you?

570
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,210
It's okay. Thank you, Seok Tae. I'm sure you are busy with your work, so you should get going.

571
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,840
But that's what friends are for. Friends help each other out in need.

572
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,210
Why are you offering to help when this is no big deal?

573
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:20,860
Pil, fill this out while I get all the documents we need.

574
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,390
Oh, okay.

575
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,140
This is nothing.

576
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,470
Alright. Spouse.

577
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:35,340
Full name, Yoon Jin Sook.

578
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,670
In Chinese characters...

579
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,530
Phone number...

580
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:49,430
Birthday... 1990...

581
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,320
What month was it?

582
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,530
Oh, man.

583
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,570
I told you I can do this by myself.

584
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,930
Just wait, I'll do it for you.

585
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,170
The world got better. It's convenient.

586
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,660
I know, right? But for the elders, it's hard.

587
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,680
I'm always here every day, explaining how to use it.

588
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,760
Like you did to me?

589
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,530
Here.

590
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,910
Now, you two are really becoming a family.

591
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,310
Pil treats you well, doesn't he?

592
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,870
We know each other very well... so it's comfortable.

593
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,380
I see.

594
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,230
1990...

595
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,850
Did you finish the form?

596
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,570
Huh...

597
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,440
You filled up only your sections?

598
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,220
T-that is...

599
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,060
No way... You don't know my birthday or my phone number?

600
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,640
I'll write it for you. Give it.

601
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,320
   

602
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,810
   

603
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:58,160
Ah, I can't remember it.

604
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,940
   

605
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:15,850
You really look tired.  Let's go home.

606
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:21,450
Pil.  Let's stop by someplace before going home.

607
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:24,390
There is a place I want to go with you.

608
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,410
Alright.

609
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,640
It's really been a while since I visited our school.

610
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,130
But why did you want to come to school all of a sudden?

611
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:48,420
Pil. Thinking back, I've liked you very much for a long time.

612
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:54,580
At first, I thought it would be nice enough to be by your side as a good friend.

613
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,160
Thinking about it now, I really regret it.

614
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:04,280
"I like you."  I should have told you earlier.

615
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,650
Do you see the school doors over there?

616
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,890
It was in front of those school doors where I first fell in love with you.

617
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:22,020
What did I do in front of the school doors?

618
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,330
Don't you remember?

619
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,190
 Oh, Grandma. 

620
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,900
 That grandma is here again. 

621
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,690
 That grandma must be a bum or something. Whenever I'm holding paper, she's always asking for all of it. 

622
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,170
 Would she be asking for money next? 

623
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,700
 Oh my, you should hide your wallet. 

624
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,820
 Grandma! 

625
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,180
 This is why you should have waited until I came. Why are you struggling like this alone? 

626
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,790
 I thought you weren't coming, so I was going to leave. 

627
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,640
 It's because I was gathering up waste products from our small theater. 

628
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,840
 Sorry, Grandma, I will be here on time next time around. 

629
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,770
 Oh no, it's okay. 

630
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:19,910
It was the first time I felt so thankful to the point of tears to someone.

631
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:27,550
So I decided to be a thankful person to you.

632
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:32,440
Your grandma really likes me, of course.

633
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,490
- Pil. 
 - Yes?

634
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,890
I like you a lot.

635
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:54,410
But I think I have to stop liking you at the place where I started liking you.

636
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,350
Let's not get married.

637
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,310
Jin Sook.

638
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:08,630
My grandma said that

639
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:14,450
a woman needs to find a man who really loves her in order to be happy forever.

640
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:19,250
But... I don't think you meet it.

641
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:29,520
Rather than getting married and then divorced, I think this is better.

642
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,660
Think about divorce. You lose both love and friendship.

643
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,210
We'd lose everything between us, isn't that so?

644
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,120
   

645
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:15,630
It seems that I'm not ready to be a married woman.

646
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,590
But wait and see what a nice man I'll meet.

647
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,700
You'll definitely regret it later.

648
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,350
That you let a woman like me go.

649
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:07,220
â™«  I know.&nbsp;I said perhaps I should let you go  â™«

650
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,690
 Please register this. 

651
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,740
 Wait. 

652
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,190
 Why? 

653
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,900
 I don't think I can do this. 

654
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,300
 What are you saying? What's with you all of a sudden? 

655
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,520
 I have to go. 

656
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,710
â™«  It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.  â™«

657
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,040
â™«  Even if I pretend to be cool  â™«

658
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:33,650
â™«  Unconsciously I will be hanging around you  â™«

659
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,550
 The customer you have called isn't answering your call. This call will be connected to voicemail... 

660
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:48,230
â™«  With you, I guess I was too young then  â™«

661
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:56,910
â™«  If you, if only you  â™«

662
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:05,400
â™«  With&nbsp;you, for me it will be you forever  â™«

663
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,700
â™«  How would it feel  â™«

664
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,450
 This room is so messy. 

665
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:12,880
â™«  If I hugged you  â™«

666
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,700
â™«  You and I  â™«

667
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,470
   

668
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,200
 To Pil. 

669
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,600
 Private Bong Pil, have you been well? 

670
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,450
â™«  I know. For you, it's nothing but a day  â™«

671
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:48,460
â™«  I can't do anything more for you  â™«

672
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:53,670
â™«  Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.  â™«

673
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:59,840
â™«  I see you nodding your head but  â™«

674
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:04,700
â™«  You are just going one and two steps farther away  â™«

675
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:18,110
â™«  With you, I guess I was too young then  â™«

676
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:25,620
â™«  If you, if only you  â™«

677
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:32,780
 Sook, this is the best photo from today. 

678
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:38,600
 Smile like this forever. Friend, I love you. 

679
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,160
â™«  With&nbsp;you  â™«

680
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,200
Jin Sook.

681
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,850
What happened?  You didn't register for your marriage license either.

682
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,240
What are you acting like this?

683
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,000
Seok Tae.

684
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,440
Please just don't say anything and stay by my side today.

685
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,740
â™«  I'm loving you  â™«

686
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:28,080
â™«  With you, for me it will be you forever  â™«

687
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:36,580
â™«  How would it feel when&nbsp;I hugged you  â™«

688
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,350
â™«  You and I  â™«

689
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:52,000
â™«  In case you are serious  â™«

690
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
   

691
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,570
â™«  I wanted to ask you again  â™«

692
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:08,080
â™«  Because it comforts my heart  â™«

693
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,650
â™«  Which hasn't opened up  â™«

694
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:15,660
â™«  Although I'm scared and it's growing  â™«

695
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,010
â™«  Everything will open up to you  â™«

696
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:24,390
 Bong Pil!  Sook with you looks very happy.  

697
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:28,380
 Always make my Sook happy. 

698
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,800
â™«  We can feel each other  â™«

699
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,560
The more I ride the manhole, the more things are twisted.

700
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,740
â™«  Now I know your pain  â™«

701
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:43,080
I don't know what's going on at all anymore.

702
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,350
â™«  When I see your tears flow  â™«

703
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:55,660
    
 â™«  It feels like even my heart is ripping apart  â™«

704
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:00,000
â™«  Now both the pain  â™«

705
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,870
â™«  And all the wounds  â™«

706
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:12,720
â™«  Everything which has distressed my heart  â™«

707
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:20,130
â™«  I want to entrust to you  â™«

708
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:25,290
â™«  Up to now, I've been keeping my heart shut  â™«

709
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:32,790
â™«  I am someone who believed I could live alone  â™«

710
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,410
â™«  Like a fool  â™«

711
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:46,220
 Soo Jin, you be happy too. 

712
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:13,510
   

713
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,020
You should wrap up quickly and leave.

714
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,230
I'm almost done. Go safely.

715
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,400
Okay, bye.

716
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,700
Ah! Your vacation!  Did you decide where to go?

717
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,000
Oh, I'm just going to rest at home.

718
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,050
Wow, being a bachelor is so good!

719
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:35,120
For a married man, staying at home is a job too.

720
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,010
Before leaving for your vacation, let's have a drink.

721
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:39,850
- It sounds good.
- I'll get going.

722
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,100
Welcome.

723
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,150
   

724
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,620
- Excuse me, customer.
- What?

725
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,700
I can't fill a prescription with this.

726
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,550
Go back to the doctor's office and get a prescription.

727
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:08,650
What are you talking about?  This is a prescription!

728
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,660
This is a copy of a prescription.

729
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,810
I brought it the exact way they gave it to me. So don't say any more. Just give the prescription!

730
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:18,640
You shouldn't act like this. It's illegal to fill a prescription without a prescription.

731
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,820
Moreover, this medication is a psychotropic drugâ€”

732
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:25,300
Hey! I'm telling you this is a prescription I just got from the doctor's office, you punk!

733
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,980
I even got medication here a few days ago!

734
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,180
Please let me go.

735
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:42,280
You! I'll get a prescription again from the doctor's office.

736
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,560
See you tomorrow!

737
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,210
Huh?

738
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:41,770
Excuse me!

739
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,090
Hey! What the!

740
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:51,300
What are you doing right now?!

741
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,470
   

742
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,170
This is a big job!

743
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:17,530
It's almost 11 PM, but we can't estimate when we will finish this job.

744
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:20,860
It's just completely blocked! Completely!

745
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,550
 What is this? 

746
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:07,420
 It's not even midnight yet. So what's happening? 

747
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,420
 What's going on? 

748
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,330
   

749
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,860
 Excuse me. 

750
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:27,220
 - This way.
- Yes. 

751
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,720
 This seat. 

752
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,850
 Thank you. 

753
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:24,800
