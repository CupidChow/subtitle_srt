1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,770


2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,660
I'm telling you, it's like that.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,310
Really.

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,470
This juice is pretty good.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,970
But the part-timer there... he has a nice face but is a little weird, don't you think?

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,840
- I agree. He must have had a heatstroke since he seemed off. 
- It was weird.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,770
   

8
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,560
Ahjussi, are you not doing business?

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,680
Ahjussi!

10
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:57,910
Huh? Oh. This is Jin Sook's juice truck.

11
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,550
Ah, jeez. Huh? What is this?

12
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,540
Aren't you going to sell fruit drinks?

13
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,750
If you're not selling, I'm leaving.

14
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,940
N-No... that's not it. We're selling. What can I get you?

15
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,570
Please give me three cups of strawberry banana juice.

16
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,050
Three cups of strawberry banana juice.

17
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,860
Please wait.

18
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,200
Thank you.

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,870
I don't think it's the time for me to be here selling juice.

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,860
Ah, I'm going crazy.

21
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,550
I still haven't confessed properly to Soo Jin.

22
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,760
 I... you know, I... 

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,290
 I like you, Pil. 

24
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,910
 Huh? 

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,260
That's right. Soo Jin definitely said she liked me.

26
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,860
So this time, the situation definitely must have changed.

27
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,270
Ah, right.

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,110
What?

29
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,910
What is this?

30
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,130
Ah! What happened here?

31
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,100
Are you working well?

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,700
Hey! Yoon Jin Sook, what is this?

33
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,250
What do you mean what is it?

34
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,470
I chained the part-time worker up since he's always thinking about escaping instead of working.

35
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,570
Are you crazy? If you are to this extent, you should be getting treated and taking medications.

36
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,670
So why did you make me go crazy?

37
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,800
You're the one who made me this way.

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,570
Ah, seriously.

39
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,270
Honestly, where can you find a boss like me?

40
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,050
I let you go home exactly at the agreed time, and I pay you exactly on the agreed date.

41
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,850
If you've gotten your pay, you should work!

42
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,550
 Why is she getting more aggressive as time passes? 

43
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,180
 Looks like I won't be able to escape easily. 

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,400
Ah! Hey.

45
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,460
Excuse me, Jin Sook, I... I got a signal.

46
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,400
Shouldn't I take care of nature's call?

47
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,520
Take care of it.

48
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,860
Hey! I have to take a dump!

49
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,650
You want to leave so you're finding excuses, aren't you?

50
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,640
Oh right! I almost forgot because of you. I have to go get fruit.

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,760
Don't think about running away. Look after the shop properly!

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,190
Hey, Jin Sook. Jin Sook! Hey!

53
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,240
That spiteful girl.

54
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,840
I'm going crazy! What do I do?

55
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,700
That's it.

56
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,730
The key to the lock.

57
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,950
Gosh...

58
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,390
I'll use this. Now...

59
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,220
Ah! What do I—

60
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,500
Hey there, good looking friends.

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,060
Hey, Pil.

62
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,200
What the?

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,140
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

64
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,630
This...

65
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,610
Ah, Bong Pil, that punk! Seriously!

66
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,830
   

67
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,850
Before I went into the manhole last time, Soo Jin and I had a good atmosphere going.

68
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,850
Things should be fine now.

69
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,710
Soo Jin.

70
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,170
Wow, you look really beautiful today.

71
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,900
Where are you going?

72
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,580
What is it?

73
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,600
Oh, I have something to tell you. Should we find a place to talk?

74
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
I'm a little busy today.

75
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,420
If you have something to say, make it short, say it here, then leave.

76
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,590
Well, it's not something that should be said on the street.

77
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,520
But... did we have a fight?

78
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,060
Is my mood at fault today for this chill air I'm getting?

79
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,010
Jae Hyeon.

80
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,580
Soo Jin, you're already out here.

81
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,040
You came.

82
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,200
Hello.

83
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,650
You must have come during work.

84
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,660
Hey! You're still dating this guy?

85
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,880
Jae Hyeon, let's go.

86
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,770
Okay. See you later.

87
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,010
I'm leaving.

88
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,340
Hey, Soo Jin!

89
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,940
Soo Jin! Hey!

90
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,740
Hey! Why are you getting into this car? Hey, Kang Soo Jin!

91
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,800
Hey!

92
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,080
Hey.

93
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,990
What's going on?

94
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,440
Ah!

95
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,040
I can eat it on my own.

96
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,770
You said your parents are civil servants, right?

97
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,240
But they don't say anything about you not going home for a while like this?

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,210
Don't know. I haven't been home for so long.

99
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,980
They probably forgot that they have a son like me.

100
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,670
Still, when we get married, we should at least say our greetings to them once.

101
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,980
Of course... if I do indeed go through with something called marriage.

102
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,140
Ah, will that be possible in my next life?

103
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,530
The smell of sesame getting cooked is vibrating throughout the neighborhood.

104
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,960
So I was wondering where it was coming from and it was here.

105
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,820
Pink. Pink.

106
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,850
It looks like you've set up a home here.

107
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,840
Don't misunderstand. Jeong Ae had nowhere else to go so I let her stay here for the time being.

108
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,740
- Oppa. 
 - It's not that—

109
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,400
What nonsense are you saying?

110
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,510
Why wouldn't Jeong Ae have a place to go? Her parents and siblings are all alive.

111
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,820
Jeong Ae, does your mother know that you're here?

112
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,450
How is that any of your business? If you tell my mom, I'm going to kill you!

113
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,460
Let's eat.

114
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,980
I've seen something I shouldn't see so I'm hungry too.

115
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,610
Dal Soo, I want food too.

116
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,980
Why would you eat here? Go eat at home!

117
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't offend someone with food like that!

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,720
Hey, why did you come here? You're hungry?

119
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,020
Yes!

120
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,820
Ah, seriously.

121
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,190
What's with the atmosphere here?

122
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,280
Why are you here at this hour? You should be working.

123
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,150
It looks like he escaped again. For me, more than  Prison Break, 

124
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,880
I find the stories about Pil escaping from Jin Sook funnier.

125
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,850
By any chance, is Soo Jin and that pharmacist dude preparing for their wedding?

126
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,210
How many days are left? One month? One week?

127
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,150
What do you mean Soo Jin's getting married?

128
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,220
She's been busy lately because of the opening.

129
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,530
Opening?

130
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,540
Hey, did you come back from some other world?

131
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,760
Today is Soo Jin's studio opening day. Aren't you going too?

132
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,420
Oh. Oh. Is that so?

133
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,170
Right, right. Enjoy your meal.

134
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,940
Bye.

135
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,620
Ah, no wonder Soo Jin was dressed so nicely today.

136
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,170
She's not engaged to the pharmacist yet.

137
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,800
That's right.

138
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,280
Hey, CEO Yoon!

139
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,740
Oh, hey!

140
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,070
You should be busy preparing for your studio's opening. Why did you come here?

141
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,080
I came because I am curious to know if the drinks I ordered for catering are getting prepared well,

142
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,100
and to see your face too.

143
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,940
You'll see me when I go to the studio.

144
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,610
Don't worry about the catering. For you, I even prepared the best fruits.

145
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,360
Thank you.

146
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,530
Hey, how has Pil been doing lately?

147
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:30,420
Forget about it. He skipped out again so I'm working like a dog.

148
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,430
- Have you seen Pil? 
 - Huh?

149
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,070
I haven't seen him.

150
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,380
Where did this punk go?

151
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,690
Just wait until you're caught. This time, it will be a collar.

152
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,590
How have things been with Pil lately?

153
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,130
What do you mean? It's like raising a son.

154
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,320
This rascal skips out and causes trouble everyday.

155
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,810
He's got a long way to go to be a human being.

156
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,600
Hello there.

157
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,660
You came here with Jae Hyeon?

158
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,530
Yeah. We are going to the studio together.

159
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,820
He's so thoughtful. I wonder if there is another Jae Hyeon out there in the world.

160
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,350
Hey, be good to him.

161
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,370
I will. See you in a bit.

162
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,010
Okay, be safe.

163
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Bye.

164
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,160
I can't believe that we got a massage chair sent to our house.

165
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,130
I've been wanting this for a while.

166
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,690
Since you brought such a wonderful son into this world, I am able to live in luxury.

167
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,920
I didn't bring him on my own.

168
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,940
You did more work than I did.

169
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,500
Everything is all set up, so you can use it now.

170
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,510
- Okay.
 - Thank you.

171
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,910
-Yes. 
 - You try sitting on it first, dear.

172
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,060
- You first, honey. 
 - No, dear, you go ahead.

173
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,090
Okay, me first. Oh my gosh, this feels so nice.

174
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,990
Let me see here.

175
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,160
It felt like something just passed me by just now.

176
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,380
How come I don't even have a proper looking suit?

177
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,690
I can't wear anything that looks too ragged over to Soo Jin's studio.

178
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,010
That guy has long legs for no good reason so clothes fit so well on him.

179
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,470
I can't look inferior and small to him.

180
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,550
Oh, right.

181
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:47,010
Jin Sook told me that she's been sending me monthly paychecks.

182
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,320
Did she pay me in cash?

183
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,270
Then there must be my account book laying around somewhere.

184
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,130
Oh yeah, that's right.

185
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,650
Bong Pil, you didn't live a useless life this time around.

186
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,740
You lived diligently here. You lived to your fullest.

187
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,340
   

188
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,790
What the heck? What's wrong with my balance?

189
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,350
How in the world did this large sum of money slip out one shot?

190
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,110
Oh my, oh my, oh my.

191
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,910
Oh my, it feels so good.

192
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,170
I feel like I'm actually at the massage shop.

193
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,750
I feel like all the housekeeping stress is leaving me in one blow.

194
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,080
I feel great to see you having such a good time with it.

195
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,420
I put you through so much because I'm such a lousy husband.

196
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,150
Moving forward, let's live doing all the good things that life can offer.

197
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,050
What do you mean by lousy husband?

198
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,480
All the women in the world would be happy to have a husband like you.

199
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,220
It was a chance of my lifetime to have met a husband like you.

200
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,380
Honey.

201
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,440
Oh my.

202
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,330
Was it you that passed by me earlier?

203
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,570
I have zero balance in my bank account.

204
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,700
Are either of you aware of this situation?

205
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,410
I heard that filial duty nowadays is done through self-service.

206
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,630
What are you talking about?

207
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,970
Could it be that you bought a massage chair... with my money?!

208
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,750
Now I feel like it was worth giving birth to a child.

209
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,200
I really like this chair. I will use it well, my son.

210
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,900
How could you do this?!

211
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,280
This is clearly my paycheck, so what right do you have to use this money?

212
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,290
We gave birth to you, raised you, and fed you.

213
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,220
Yet you're saying that we still don't have the right?

214
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,210
I have to spend money on something today.

215
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,360
Where do you have to spend money?! I bet it all goes to paying for your booze!

216
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,960
Today is the grand opening of Soo Jin's studio, so I need a nice suit to wear for that!

217
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,540
Everyone else will be suited and shod so how can I go like this in these rags?!

218
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,490
If you needed something like that, you should've told me sooner about it.

219
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,980
Follow me.

220
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,240
They say that nice clothes are like a set of wings. Doesn't he look really great?

221
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,350
I know, right? Our son looks so handsome again.

222
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,990
Pil, I think this suit was made just for you.

223
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,640
This suit is thirty years old but it still looks stylish.

224
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,080
They say that fashion comes back around from the past.

225
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,280
I got this suit tailored at the most famous tailor shop called Palbong in Jongro.

226
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,210
I will just go with my own clothes on.

227
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,070
Why? It looks good on you. You should wear this when you go there.

228
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,340
You will probably get a lot of attention today if you wear this.

229
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,370
I don't like that.

230
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,040
Well, yes. Soo Jin's decent boyfriend will be there with her,

231
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,810
so you don't necessarily need to make yourself look good and put on a suit.

232
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:52,980
You should be good to Jin Sook instead of Soo Jin who is already taken.

233
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,220
She is smart and pleasant to be around too.

234
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,370
Do you think that there are many girls like her in this day and age?

235
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,990
And Jin Sook even helps Pil make money, too. She has made him into  a man.

236
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,480
And on top of that, she is so good to Pil.

237
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,220
Pil, you have to marry a girl like that.

238
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,730
How can I marry someone that's seen it all?

239
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,740
I'm off now.

240
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,340
I have no idea why that boy has no taste in women.

241
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,230
Maybe he doesn't have the genes to help him with that...

242
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,360
I bet he would be good at it if he took after me.

243
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,050
Wow, it's so neat and tidy in here.

244
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,180
It's the latest model too! It's totally different from my billiards hall.

245
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,440
Wow, his level is so low. He's bringing the level down.

246
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,910
You guys are here.

247
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,150
Soo Jin! Congratulations on becoming a CEO and opening up your studio!

248
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,240
Thanks!

249
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,210
Congratulations. It feels like you were telling us that you became an assistant only yesterday, yet you're already a CEO.

250
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,450
I feel like I'm dreaming too. I had no idea that this day would come in my life.

251
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,140
I guess a person should just dig one well.

252
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,480
I didn't know that it would end up this well when you were talking about how you wanted to be a photographer.

253
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,040
I also  had no idea that I would open up my own studio as well.

254
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,970
I guess I was lucky.

255
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,000
I guess meeting a good boyfriend is also considered good fortune.

256
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,260
You're definitely benefiting from Jae Hyeon here.

257
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,980
Jae Hyeon, you said that your sunbae was  the  original owner of this studio, right?

258
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,220
Yes, he immigrated to another country so this studio happened to be vacant.

259
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,300
So I asked him to let Soo Jin use the studio.

260
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,250
I remember Soo Jin constantly singing about wanting her own studio.

261
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,690
I guess she was able to make her dreams come true because of her boyfriend at the end of the day.

262
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,430
I guess there is such a thing as destiny for sure.

263
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,720
Jae Hyeon, what do you like about Soo Jin?

264
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,900
- Hey! 
- She is pretty.

265
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,930
Oh my, goodness gracious.

266
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,310
Hey, what are you guys doing?

267
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:48,940
Hey Pil! Did you come by yourself? What about Jin Sook?

268
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,270
Well, I'm sure she'll be here soon.

269
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,220
Wasn't there a catering order for today?

270
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,780
How could Jin Sook carry all the heavy things by herself?!

271
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,980
Seriously, you're too much!

272
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,410
Seok Tae! I will go. Hold up.

273
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,780
Okay.

274
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,440
Hey, Kang Soo Jin!

275
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,180
You're really cruel.

276
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,010
Do you really have to act like that with him in front of me?

277
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,910
Why do you care what I do with Jae Hyeon?

278
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,570
Do I have to care about what you think?

279
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:27,590
You told me that you liked me.

280
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,710
How could you be with him after saying that to me?!

281
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,390
Hey, that's old news. You're so unbelievable.

282
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,070
Didn't we verify each other's feelings back then?

283
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,730
You probably knew about my feelings already.

284
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,600
 Just a second. 

285
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:52,100
 Soo Jin, I...You know, I... 

286
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,920
 I like you, Pil. 

287
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,770
 What about you? 

288
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,820
 How do you feel about me? 

289
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,480
 Yes. Soo Jin, I also like— 

290
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,060
How am I supposed to know how you feel when I never even heard your confession properly?

291
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,760
 Pi!? 

292
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,590
 Pil! 

293
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,250
 Hey, Pil! 

294
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,640
 What the? 

295
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,810
I'm telling you this now, but you're the one who always disappears on me at the most crucial moment.

296
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,260
- But that time, I— 
- Let's stop with this already, Pil!

297
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,100
Come up with the drinks when Sook comes.

298
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,040
That's your job anyway, right?

299
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,180
Hey, Soo Jin.

300
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,630
- Why are you being so cold to me? 
 - How so?

301
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,550
The way you're  acting towards me, the way you're talking to me.

302
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,290
All of it sounds so strange and unfamiliar to me.

303
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,630
Is there something that I did wrong to you by any chance?

304
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,340
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

305
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,240
Hey, Soo Jin!

306
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,610
You can just do that?

307
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,510
No, you have to prepare it first and put it—

308
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,700
Oh, what was that?

309
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,700
What's going on here?

310
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,360
What is this?

311
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,140
-  Soo Jin I'm sure this surprised you a lot.  
 - It's Jae Hyeon.

312
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,060
It's a proposal video.

313
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,830
 - Being by your side as you start a new beginning... 
- Wow.

314
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,330
 you probably have no idea how thankful I am to you for that. 

315
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,980
 I don't know why but I'm thinking about some old memories. 

316
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,690
 When I followed you around because I fell for you at first sight 

317
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,190
 you wouldn't open your heart to  me so I was burning so much inside. 

318
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,960
 You know that you gave me such a hard time back then, don't you? 

319
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,710
 I will give you a chance to redeem yourself if you still feel bad about that. 

320
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,030
Wow, he prepared well.

321
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,250
Jae Hyeon is coming out now.

322
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,290
Wow, so amazing.

323
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,350
Jae Hyeon...

324
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,220
I haven't dated many people in my lifetime,

325
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:23,650
but you were the first person who made me realize it can't be anyone but you.

326
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,320
I know I won't be able to be a masterpiece but I will try really hard to become an authentic and genuine husband to you.

327
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,720
So will you accept this ring?

328
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,600
Wow. I am a man, but I still think he's awesome. If I were a girl, I think I would have fallen for him too, 100 percent.

329
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,350
Soo Jin, what are you doing? You should say yes to the ring.

330
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,750
Yeah, hurry it up.

331
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,250
Soo Jin, please marry me.

332
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,450
Okay.

333
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,500
Wow!

334
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,480
Thanks.

335
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,120
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

336
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,740
- Stop it.
 - Kiss, kiss, kiss!

337
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,030
Stop that.

338
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,480
Thank you.

339
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,990
Ice cream is here.

340
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,730
Dig in.

341
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,200
So delicious.

342
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,260
It's even sweeter coming from a sweet proposal event.

343
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,120
- Do you guys know why proposing is such a sweet thing?
 - Why?

344
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:00,440
It's because if you don't wrap it up with all the  sweetness, it'll be hard for someone to go into that bitter grave of life.

345
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,340
You're so darn philosophical. You're so amazing.

346
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,050
- I bet Jeong Ae will still say he's amazing even if he becomes a bum. 
- Hey.

347
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,140
Eat this ice cream and stop spacing out.

348
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,700
I don't want any.

349
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,340
Do you think he would be in the mood for ice cream right now? Just leave him be.

350
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,420
That punk is such  a player.

351
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,590
He was bewitching Soo Jin with that innocent face of his.

352
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,160
I think he touched her heart instead of bewitching her.

353
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,010
The faster you give up, your pain will lessen greatly.

354
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,070
How could you change a girl's heart when she just got proposed to?

355
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,220
Did I do anything wrong to Soo Jin by any chance?

356
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,770
Why is she treating me so coldly?

357
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,100
If you did happen to do something wrong,

358
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,580
it is probably the fact that, compared to Jae Hyeon, you don't have any good qualities. That's your flaw.

359
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,170
You're right, our Pil is so in the wrong.

360
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,580
I'm being serious here. I wasn't playing around.

361
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,110
The thing that Pil isn't able to go beyond Jae Hyeon

362
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:03,780
isn't looks, connections, or character, but fate.

363
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,620
What are you talking about?

364
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,660
Jae Hyeon was the one who found the camera that Soo Jin lost

365
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,250
so that's not  any normal destiny.

366
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,950
So basically that camera played the role of a cupid between those two.

367
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,010
Wait a minute. Camera?

368
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,440
Are you talking about the camera Soo Jin lost before I entered the military?

369
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,180
Yep, Jae Hyeon found that for her.

370
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,080
There is no way you can do anything about this destiny.

371
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,420
Women are weak when it comes to that fateful kind of meet up.

372
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,440
 Wait a minute... then the confession video message I left for her. 

373
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,030
 She should've seen it. 

374
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,700
Hello.

375
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,500
Ah, yes. Yes, okay.

376
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,650
Oppa, we should get going now.

377
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,060
The regular  customer that owes us money has come to pay for the bill.

378
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,280
I have to finish talking about fatalism here.

379
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,710
Let's hurry up and go.

380
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,670
I'm leaving since I don't believe in fatalism.

381
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,680
Don't overdo it and come to my truck.

382
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,760
Before I fire you.

383
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,660
Hey, wait for me.

384
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,000
When I saw Soo Jin get proposed to earlier,

385
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,940
I was really envious of her.

386
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,740
I wonder when someone will propose to me like that.

387
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:23,190
Nice weather today! Don't you think so?

388
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,950
Oppa, let's have a serious talk.

389
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,030
I'm always serious.

390
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,170
No, stop playing around with words.

391
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,920
Oppa, what are you really going to do?

392
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,410
You do want to marry me, right?

393
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,260
Jeong Ae, we have a wonderful relationship right now.

394
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,850
Marriage isn't necessarily the right answer.

395
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,210
We are still young so it would be nice for us to live a free and comfortable life, don't you think?

396
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,650
Why are you so negative about marriage anyway?

397
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,520
There are a lot of married people who do live happily!

398
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,740
You just don't want to marry me, that's all.

399
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,000
No, it's not that.

400
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,670
I really have no idea what you're thinking about.

401
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,730
What am I to you?

402
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,790
Am I just a girl who cooks and does the laundry for you?!

403
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,580
How could you say that?

404
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,300
You're making me think that way right now!

405
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,570
Honestly, have you ever told me that you like me?!

406
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,720
Not even once!

407
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,840
You never even said it once...

408
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,100
I'm getting tired now, too.

409
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,140
   

410
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,630
♫  Oh my dear, even without saying it, I know  ♫

411
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,590
 Soo Jin, I like you a lot. 

412
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:56,040
 No... I love you. 

413
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:04,610
♫  It's uselessly pretending not to know  ♫

414
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:13,480
♫  To you,&nbsp;I didn't express&nbsp;my feelings  ♫

415
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,020
♫  I uselessly pretended  ♫

416
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,400
 Can't do it. 

417
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:28,150
♫  It wasn't a heart which loved you  ♫

418
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,590
I am definitely sure that I didn't delete Pil's video message that day.

419
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,200
If she got the camera back from Jae Hyeon, she must have seen that video message.

420
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,980
Why didn't Soo Jin get to see it then?

421
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,590
- Hey, Jin Sook.
 - Oh, my!

422
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,160
What are you thinking so hard about?

423
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,790
- Are you going to go study?
 - Yep. I decided to stop by on my way over there.

424
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,960
Hey, what are you doing by yourself?

425
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,130
Pil is not at work again and ran off, right?

426
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:04,150
Oh no! He said he has  something to take care of today, so I let him go early.

427
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,380
Did you? Should I help you then?

428
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,820
No, it's okay. It's not even busy at this hour anyway.

429
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,550
You should go and study hard.

430
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,660
Oh, why isn't this working?

431
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,340
Hey, get out of the way.

432
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,200
- Do you even know just by looking at it? 
  - I do know, okay?

433
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,230
The power isn't on. It seems like the interior part of this is broken.

434
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,200
I won't be able to fix it without proper tools.

435
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,600
I really need to use this though.

436
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,460
Should I fix this and bring it back quickly? I'm very good at fixing these kinds of things.

437
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,860
No, I can just take this to a repair shop.

438
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,000
Hey, you don't have to waste your money when you have me who can fix it.

439
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,960
I will quickly fix this and bring it back to you, okay?

440
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,790
Hey, quit that. You don't have to.

441
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,120
It's okay. Just trust me on this.

442
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,570
- Just wait a little bit. 
- Hey, hey!

443
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,880
What do you want? Why are you here again?

444
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,100
I came here to ask you about something.

445
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,950
If you are here to pick a fight, then just leave.

446
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,900
You know the camera that you lost the day before I left for the military...

447
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,010
I heard that pharmacist guy found it for you.

448
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,230
So?

449
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:24,390
I'm thinking that you saw that video message I left you on there if you got the camera back.

450
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,390
I never saw a video message like that.

451
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,300
What are you talking about? Did the memory of the camera get erased?

452
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,750
If that's the case, all of the photos on there would've been erased too.

453
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,430
But all my photos were still there.

454
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,140
Hey! Hey!

455
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,690
Hey! Does it even make sense that all of your photos were there but not the video message I left you?!

456
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:52,650
I know, right? I looked for it because you told me about that video message but there was no such thing there.

457
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,430
Who knows? Maybe that never existed in the first place.

458
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,830
Hey, what do you mean by that?

459
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,400
So are you saying that I didn't even leave  a confession video message and lied  to you?

460
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,240
I never said it like that.

461
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,620
Pil, I'm really tired today. Can you please leave?

462
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,820
Has it ever crossed your mind that the pharmacist guy deleted it on purpose?

463
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,910
Hey, what are you talking about now?

464
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,920
Jae Hyeon is not that type of person.

465
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,130
How dare you say that when you hardly know him!

466
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,790
Didn't you say he fell for you the moment he laid eyes on you?

467
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:21,300
Then he could've erased it when he picked up the camera.

468
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,020
Now, you're using that tactic of accusing someone?

469
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,820
Should I be honest with you?

470
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:31,610
I think it's more believable that you didn't leave a message in the first place than Jae Hyeon deleting it.

471
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,270
I guess you know him better than me whom you have known for 28 years.

472
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:39,830
I know, right? Why does it feel like I know him better than you whom I have known for 28 years?

473
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,970
I guess this is the limit to our friendship.

474
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,460
Yes! I am still a part-timer at this age,

475
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,460
so it's understandable to want to be with him who has a secure job and can be a help to you instead of me.

476
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,190
Women are all the same. I thought you would be different.

477
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,220
I'm so disappointed in you, Kang Soo Jin.

478
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,050
Are you done talking? If you are then, good bye.

479
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,330
Hey. Hey!

480
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:09,070
Ah, seriously! 
 ♫  I wanted to ask you again  ♫

481
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:15,580
♫  Because it comforts my heart  ♫

482
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:20,020
No way...
♫  Which hasn't opened up  ♫

483
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,020
♫  Although I'm scared and it's growing  ♫

484
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,530
♫  Everything will open up to you  ♫

485
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,530
What's wrong with him all of a sudden?!

486
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,540
Seriously.

487
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,260
What's wrong with me all of a sudden?!

488
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:43,200
♫  We can feel each other  ♫

489
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:50,440
♫  Now I know your pain  ♫

490
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,900
♫  When I see your tears flow  ♫

491
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:03,280
♫  It feels like even my heart is ripping apart  ♫

492
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,850
Pardon me.

493
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,670
Do you have something to say to me?

494
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:25,030
You met Soo Jin for the first time when you found her camera for her, right?

495
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,210
I did, but why do you ask about that all of a sudden?

496
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:32,900
When you found the camera, didn't you see the video in it?

497
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:38,930
I'm not sure because I really didn't check out what was in it, so I don't remember well.

498
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,830
So you don't remember? But you're the one who deleted it.

499
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,770
Didn't you delete it because your intentions were to get to know Soo Jin in the first place?

500
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,200
I have no idea what that video message is all about,

501
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,980
but I gave the camera back to Soo Jin the way it was found originally.

502
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,650
If the video message that you're looking for isn't there,

503
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,240
then maybe someone else deleted it.

504
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,790
If you're done, I'll get going.

505
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:12,760
You think you can fool others with that innocent face of yours,

506
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,230
but you won't be able to fool me.

507
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,310
You're definitely the one who deleted my video message.

508
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:23,180
There's nobody else who would delete that message other than you.

509
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,090
Go ahead and believe that if that's what you want.

510
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:30,620
Because no matter what I say, you're still going to believe whatever you want to believe.

511
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:37,370
I  know that you were there for Soo Jin and that you liked her for a long time.

512
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,390
And so I can fully understand you resenting me and hating me too.

513
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,990
It would be hard for anyone to stop liking someone all at once,

514
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:52,280
but it would be great if you can just bury all your memories as memories for Soo Jin.

515
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,990
Soo Jin just opened up her studio and is trying to live a brand new life.

516
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:04,150
Are you giving credit to yourself in front of me for helping out with opening her studio?

517
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:08,450
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you have an inferiority complex.

518
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:12,820
Either way, I'm going to support Soo Jin with everything she does to the best of my ability.

519
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:18,480
You are Soo Jin's long time friend so I hope that you will support Soo Jin with her new start.

520
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,340
I'm sure that's what Soo Jin wants, too.

521
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,080
Jeong Ae!

522
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,710
What the?

523
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,950
What's wrong? Did something happen?

524
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,010
What's with  your expression?

525
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,610
Mind your own business. It's nothing.

526
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:57,360
How is this not my business when you look so awful?

527
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,380
My heart is beating like crazy right now.

528
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,640
What's wrong?

529
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,670
Did you get into a fight with Dal Soo?

530
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,930
Don't talk about Dal Soo in front of me.

531
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:18,120
Eat this for now. It'll melt in your mouth.

532
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:41,200
Jeong Ae. What do you like about Dal Soo so much?

533
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:46,510
It's just that he always hurts your feelings.

534
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,510
You cook for him, clean for him, and do everything for him!

535
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:55,010
But he doesn't even say a word of thanks to you. He's such a jerk.

536
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:57,220
What do you like about such a punk like that anyway?

537
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,880
How can I explain all that to you?

538
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,480
I have a conscience too.

539
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,210
Let's just eat this. It looks good.

540
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:40,040
Jeong Ae, you should just forget about that Dal Soo punk and come to me.

541
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,830
I will make you happy. Let's get married.

542
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,680
Why am I talking about marriage when we haven't even started going out yet?

543
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,960
Seriously, I'm such an idiot.

544
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:05,010
Jeong Ae, I will always make you smile.

545
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:08,260
Even if you're having a hard time, I'll still make you smile.

546
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:13,010
And I will feed you delicious meat for the rest of your life.

547
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,660
So would you like to date me?

548
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:23,810
Oh, that sounded good.

549
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,830
If I go back home, everything will end up being the same.

550
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,480
Should I just go over to Jin Sook's house and sleep over there so I can make him worry?

551
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,320
Yeah, I think that would be a good idea.

552
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,840
 Where are you? Come by the house for a bit. I have something to tell you. 

553
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,420
What's he going to tell me?

554
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,490
So lucky.

555
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:04,540
I envy whoever that is.

556
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,140
You dropped this.

557
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,840
You dropped this.

558
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,880
I'm trying to tell you that you dropped this.

559
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,290
Oppa, what's going on?

560
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:44,350
Sorry for keeping you around all this time without being able to tell you that I like you.

561
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,540
It's because I'm fearful and I just think a bit too much.

562
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,210
Let's think about marriage slowly, one step at a time.

563
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,450
I'll try my best, too.

564
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,430
♫  Before a trip with you, which I dreamed  ♫

565
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,960
♫  The story we wanted to make together  ♫

566

♫  Under the bright sunlight, open your eyes  ♫

♫  The morning we wanted to spend together  ♫

568
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:11,530
I would like to capture you in the movie of my life.

569
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,680
♫  The memories will soon be filled (memories)  ♫

570
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,490
♫  Just smile secretly in your imagination, yeah  ♫

571
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:21,830
Would you like to be with me?

572
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,650
♫  You and I sit facing each other  ♫

573

♫  There's still one thing to whisper  ♫

574
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,750
♫  Don't worry about anything  ♫

575

♫  Take this hand.  It will go away.  ♫

576
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:39,200
♫  Under heaven in another world  ♫

577
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,970
I wonder if it's too small.

♫  After I sit on a blue park bench  ♫

579

♫  While drinking coffee, I'll lean on you and take a break  ♫

580

Let's go.

583
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,180
Carry this for me.

584
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,080
♫  Somehow I have a good feeling about it  ♫

585
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,820
Let's go.

586
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,400
I guess you came by because you didn't want to get fired, right?

587
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:50,040
Sorry, Jin Sook.

588
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,380
You have no idea, but I've been living the life of a mayfly.

589
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,430
So I'm too busy to sell juice.

590
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,560
You have such colorful excuses.

591
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,690
Seeing that you're dragging in innocent mayfly into this.

592
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:07,870
Jin Sook, should we go have a drink somewhere?

593
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,990
Are you telling me to pay for the booze too in this situation?

594
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,630
You're so shameless.

595
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,540
I know, right? I really hate myself right now, too.

596
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,000
Soo Jin definitely told me that she liked me.

597
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,440
But I wonder how she ended up with another man.

598
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,540
I wonder what the reason is for goodness sake?

599
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:53,700
Seriously? Did Soo Jin tell you that she liked you?

600
00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:00,410
She did. She told me the day before I left for the military.

601
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:05,890
"I like you, Pil." That's what she said to me.

602
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:12,360
Before I left for the military,

603
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:17,340
I recorded a video message on Soo Jin's camera to confess to her.

604
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:22,060
But Soo Jin told me that she's never seen such a thing.

605
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,320
If only she saw my video message confessing to her...

606
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,590
then probably Soo Jin and I would be together by now.

607
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,560
That pharmacist jerk, who picked up that camera,

608
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,210
said that he didn't delete the message.

609
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:41,750
Then who could be the one that deleted it?

610
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:45,060
I have to say that this is the most mysterious thing ever.

611
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,380
Don't you think so?

612
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,770
Let's stop drinking and go home now. You're drunk right now.

613
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:56,470
Because of that stupid camera, that pharmacist punk and Soo Jin are...

614
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:02,510
If I were a girl, I would probably want to date a guy like him who has it all too.

615
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:10,560
What could a part-timer like me do for Soo Jin?

616
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,740
The only thing I did was to steal my parents' digital camera

617
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:19,630
and gave it to her.

618
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,610
   

619
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,380
It's working! It's working!

620
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,100
Hey, what the?

621
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,120
Let's do some studying.

622
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,610
Jin Sook, it's all done.

623
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,280
I'm so thirsty.

624
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,610
Ah, where is this place?

625
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,100
I'm over at Jin Sook's place.

626
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,810
Man, this is killing me.

627
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,470
Jin Sook is going to freak out if she finds out.

628
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,530
This is driving me crazy.

629
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,650
I need some tissues.

630
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:15,180
Wait... Is there any tissue around here?

631
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,430
Wait.

632
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:21,890
How come she doesn't have any tissues around the house?

633
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,450
   

634
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:49,250
    

635
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,840
What the?

636
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,190
These are the letters that I sent to Soo Jin while I was in the military.

637
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,620
Why are these letters here?

638
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,110
Are you awake now? I was going to wake you up anyway.

639
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,780
Hey, Jin Sook.

640
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:17,570
What are all these?

641
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:23,080
Why are the letters that I sent to Soo Jin here at your place?

642
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,830
Hey!

643
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,850
Why are you digging through other people's things?

644
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,300
Hey.

645
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,750
Tell me what's going on here?

646
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:42,740
Did Soo Jin bring them over here so you can look after these for her?

647
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:48,040
No... Soo Jin has never seen these.

648
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,440
What? What are you talking about?

649
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,950
So are you saying that you snatched these letters before it got to her or what?

650
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,510
Yeah.

651
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,750
Are you crazy?

652
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,000
Why did you do this? Why?!

653
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,770
Why did you swipe the letters that were for Soo Jin? Why?

654
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:25,860
It's because I had no other choice but to do that.

655
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,520
 - Hey, Jin Sook. 
 - Hello, Mister. 

656
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,540
 - Where are you going? 
- I'm going over to Soo Jin's place. 

657
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,230
 That's good. 

658
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,900
 Would you deliver these to her? 

659
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,920
 - Okay. 
- Thank you. 

660
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:52,650
    

661
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,270
Hey, Yoon Jin Sook. Are you saying that as an excuse?

662
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:10,930
Pranks should have their limits.

663
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,410
How could you pull a prank like that when you know how I feel about Soo Jin?!

664
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,240
It wasn't a prank.

665
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,140
I meant it.

666
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,510
What?

667
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:24,980
I did that because I like you.

668
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,930
Jin Sook, what's wrong with you all of a sudden?

669
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,920
Why are you joking as if you really mean it?

670
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,580
Why are you taking my sincere feelings as a joke?

671
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:52,710
I'm being serious when I say that I like you. I've liked you ever since high school.

672
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,950
You probably had no idea since all your attention was on Soo Jin.

673
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:05,460
That I was watching you this whole time.

674
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:10,010
   

675
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,970
 Hey, what are you doing over here? 

676
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:32,490
 What the heck? What are you hiding? 

677
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:35,040
 Is it something to eat? Are you hiding it because you want to eat it by yourself? 

678
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,200
 No, it's nothing like that at all. 

679
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:43,200
 Hey, Jin Sook. I have a favor to ask you. 

680
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,980
 I'm going to be dealing with my life's most important event today. 

681
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,270
 But I don't think I can go by myself because I'm so nervous right now. 

682
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,500
 Do you think you can come along with me? 

683
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,880
 What is this about? 

684
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,600
 You don't need to know. Just follow me. 

685
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,790
 Hey, Kang Soo Jin! 

686
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,940
 I... You... 

687
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,320
 - You... 
 - What? 

688
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,550
 I... li— I lik— 

689
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,930
 You... You... 

690
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,320
 So? 

691
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:28,430
 I... you... Lik— Like... L-Lik— 

692
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,720
 Idiot. 

693
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:40,730
As I was watching you who always watched  Soo Jin,

694
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:45,310
I was telling myself that I shouldn't be doing this.  I should just give up.

695
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:50,350
But  my determination would go out the window the moment I saw your face again the next day.

696
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:55,130
Like that, I wiped away my feelings then built it back up again.

697
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:57,120
It's been ten years.

698
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:04,920
I really had no idea

699
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,960
that you had those kinds of feelings for me.

700
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,150
I actually thought that it would be a good thing if you and Soo Jin started to date each other.

701
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:16,460
It's because I thought that was the only way I could give you up.

702
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,840
As I watched you two continue being friends,

703
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,630
I couldn't help but think that you didn't have anyone next to you.

704
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,870
So I couldn't give up hope.

705
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,850
Now that you know how I feel about you,

706
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:38,130
we won't be able to be friends like before anymore.

707
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,370
Hey... Jin Sook.

708
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:42,570
Soo Jin has Jae Hyeon by her side now.

709
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:45,250
So I ask of you to also give me a chance.

710
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,200
Our relationship won't be able to get back to normal in one day, I understand.

711
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,540
But we can at least make an effort and try, right?

712
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,760
Sorry, Jin Sook.

713
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,570
I have nothing to say to you right now.

714
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:05,730
Let's talk again next time.

715
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,170
Hey.

716
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:33,000
Do you just ignore a person even when you see them now?

717
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,140
Did you have a drink?

718
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,140
If you're drunk, then go home.

719
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:44,210
You... Since when did you give up your feelings for me?

720
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,660
Are you acting this way because I didn't reply back to your letters when I was in the military?

721
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:56,720
Yep, that's right. Let's hear your reason while we're at it.

722
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,200
Why didn't you reply to any of my letters back then?

723
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,350
I did write back. But...

724
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:08,890
I think there was an accident during the delivery.

725
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:12,260
And that's why you didn't receive  any of those letters.

726
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:16,540
All of those letters? Do you expect me to believe that right now?

727
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,170
Well, it's just that...

728
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,980
Pil, you don't have to make those useless excuses now.

729
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:25,340
It's all in the past and I've forgotten about it all.

730
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,240
Hey.

731
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,200
What makes this so easy for you?

732
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,950
How can you forget about it so fast?

733
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:40,670
I'm able to vividly remember everything from several years ago as if it just happened yesterday.

734
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:45,930
I can remember all those times I've spent with you so vividly.

735
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:52,830
You don't know how I feel because you didn't see my video message confessing to you?

736
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:55,890
You know that I like you.

737
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:03,060
There is no way that you wouldn't know since I acted so obvious around you.

738
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,820
I never skipped a day for the last 28 years.

739
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:15,140
I have skipped a meal before, but I have never skipped a day of liking you.

740
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:20,230
There were days when I didn't even get any sleep, but there wasn't a day when I didn't think about you.

741
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:23,880
I was lazy with my studies for the past 28 years,

742
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,370
but I was never lazy about my feelings for you, not once.

743
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:33,500
Soo Jin, I like you.

744
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,730
I'm telling you that I like you, you fool.

745
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:42,730
Bong Pil, I don't care if you like me or not.

746
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,790
Because my feelings for you have changed now.

747
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:51,700
It might have been ardent for you for 28 years,

748
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,500
but to me, my present life situations are more important.

749
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:02,470
So, let's please stop this already. Okay?

750
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:30,400
Pil, sorry for treating you so cruelly.

751
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:43,590
But... the closer you come to me,

752
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:50,990
the more difficult it is for me.

753
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,510
It's hard for me.

754
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:09,640
So... please let's stop this already.

755
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:20,230
♫  In case you are serious  ♫

756
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:29,120
♫  I wanted to ask you again  ♫

757
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:35,880
♫  Because it comforts my heart  ♫

758
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,290
♫  Which hasn't opened up  ♫

759
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:43,300

00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:48,870

♫  If we are like each other  ♫

762
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,640
♫  We can feel each other  ♫

763
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:08,540
I wonder if I should just stay here and change Soo Jin's mind instead of going back into that manhole.

764
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,440
No, I can't do that.

765
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,540
If I end up being trapped in this timeline,

766
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:15,230
I will never be able to go back through the manhole.

767
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:23,500
♫  It feels like even my heart is ripping apart  ♫

768

772
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:53,200
♫  Up to now, I've been keeping my heart shut  ♫

773
00:59:53,200 --> 01:00:01,000
♫  I am someone who believed I could live alone  ♫

774
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,520
 I wonder what I have to do in order for me to see Jin Sook as a friend again. 

775
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:13,060
♫  In case you are serious  ♫

776

01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:32,380
♫  Which hasn't opened up  ♫

779
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,250
♫  Although I'm scared and it's growing  ♫

780
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:40,000
♫  Everything will open up to you  ♫

781
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
♫  Now both the pain  ♫

782
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,390
♫  Everything which has distressed my heart  ♫

783
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:53,650
♫  I want to entrust to you  ♫

784
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,990
   
I think I have forgotten. 

785
01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:05,420
 But I want to be honest with you for the first time in twenty-three years. 

786
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:10,680
 I ... like you. 

787
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:18,220
 I like you way more than you can imagine. 

788
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:26,110
 I don't know if you feel the same way as I do right now. 

789
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:30,620
 Even two years from now, I will be the same without any change at all. 

790
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:37,300
 I... like you a lot. 

791
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:43,020
 No... I love you. 

792
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:49,220
I feel bothered by this stupid punk now.

793
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:58,800
