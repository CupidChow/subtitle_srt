1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:10,570


2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,780
Even if I rescue you from danger, you don't remember it at all.

3
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,690
 I... like you a lot. 

4
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,470
 No... I love you. 

5
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,570
 - You know, I... 
 - I like you, Pil. 

6
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,970
We have confirmed each other's feelings many times,

7
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,550
but both my confession and your confession

8
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,720
become something that have never happened.

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,890
That's because every time I go into the manhole and travel in time, the past and present reset themselves.

10
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,010
 You know the camera that you lost the day before I left for the military... 

11
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,130
 I heard that pharmacist guy found it for you. 

12
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,930
 - Are you perhaps the owner of this camera? 
 - So? 

13
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,010
 I'm thinking that you saw that video message I left you on there if you got the camera back. 

14
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,570
 I never saw a video message like that. 

15
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,530
 Jae Hyeon... 

16
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,620
Ironically, because of the things I've done in the past,

17
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,870
you are becoming closer and closer to Jae Hyeon.

18
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,980
 It wasn't a prank. I meant it. 

19
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,490
Rather, the uncomfortable truths don't reset themselves.

20
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,980
 What? 

21
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,530
 I did that because I like you. 

22
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,110
It's true that Jin Sook likes me, after all.

23
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,200
Soo Jin, what should I do now?

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,590
How can I  get you back?

25
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,050
   

26
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,060
What?

27
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,720
What the heck is this?

28
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,740
Where is this place?

29
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,890
Oh...

30
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,000
What's going on here? Am I trapped?

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,950
Hey! Hey, manhole!

32
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,620
Hey, you should open up the lid of this!

33
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,470
Hey!

34
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,290
Huh?

35
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,590
What's that about?

36
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,830
Wow.

37
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,940
My bride looks so beautiful today.

38
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,120
W-What did you say?

39
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,570
The wedding is happening right now?

40
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,410
Hey, hey. No. It can't.

41
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,540
No, Soo Jin!

42
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,630
Hey! Hey, Soo Jin!

43
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,270
Soo Jin, you can't marry him!

44
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,760
No, you can't...

45
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,140
No! This marriage is invalid.

46
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,210
This marriage is invalid!

47
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,600
You scared me.

48
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,890
Hey, be quiet.

49
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,060
Hey, Seok Tae.

50
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,080
What year is this?

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,030
Hey, I've known you all my life but I'm still having a hard time getting used to you.

52
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,260
What do you mean what year is this?! It's 2014.

53
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,930
20..14?!

54
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,700
2014...

55
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,320
If this is 2014, then it hasn't been long since I got discharged from the military.

56
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,770
Then why did I see Soo Jin's wedding all of a sudden?

57
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,490
So, does this mean that Soo Jin's wedding is still going on in the present?

58
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,340
Man, this is driving me crazy.

59
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,890
Hey, Seok Tae.

60
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,320
What's Soo Jin up to these days?

61
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,640
What do you mean what is she doing? She's working as an assistant at that photography studio.

62
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,410
Oh yeah, that's right.

63
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,120
Hey...

64
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,430
What are you doing there anyway?

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,070
By the way, what are you going to get for Jin Sook's birthday?

66
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,810
Jin Sook?

67
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,280
Jin Sook...

68
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,050
 Why are you taking my sincere feelings as a joke? 

69
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:53,090
 I'm being serious when I say that I like you. I've liked you ever since high school. 

70
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,300
There's no way you forgot about Jin Sook's birthday today, right?

71
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,990
Jin Sook, please don't.

72
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,460
What are you talking about? You're being like this because you don't have money again, huh?

73
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,530
A future civil servant who doesn't have any money. Jin Sook will understand that.

74
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,730
Your thought is what will count and that's plenty enough.

75
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:12,300
I have to somehow turn Jin Sook's feeling around no matter what.

76
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,840
That's what I have to do.

77
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,360
Seriously, how am I suppose to face Jin Sook like this?

78
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,420
   

79
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,970
   

80
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,750
So hot!

81
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,870
It's done.

82
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,100
Three years ago?

83
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Why of all times does it have to be now?

84
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,510
It would've been nice if you just sent me back to high school while you're at it.

85
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,960
Then I could've come up with something to do about this.

86
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,370
What am I supposed to do and where am I supposed to start?

87
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,850
Hey, be careful with your steps. Careful now.

88
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,260
What's this fuss about?

89
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,640
Stop!

90
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,410
Ta-da!

91
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,440
Happy birthday, Sook.

92
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,730
Hey. When did you prepare all this?

93
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,120
Gosh, girl. Don't you have a photo shoot to go to today? You're not going to be late?

94
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,610
Look, my friend comes first before my work, okay?

95
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,770
Have I ever skipped making your birthday meal? Have a seat there.

96
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,470
I made all your favorite dishes including buIgogi ( marinated beef )  and  japchae ( glass noodles ).

97
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,710
Kang Soo Jin, thank you so much.

98
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,820
My grandma always worried for me. She was afraid that I'd be celebrating my birthday all alone.

99
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,010
Please tell your grandma not to worry.

100
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,320
I will take care of your birthday meals for the rest of my life.

101
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,330
Let's cancel the "rest of my life" part.

102
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,010
I'm sure when I get a boyfriend, he'll do all this for me too.

103
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,460
Oh, is that right?

104
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,010
Then you should say that after you get yourself a boyfriend.

105
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,940
What's with that reaction, you old lady?

106
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,140
It would be so awesome if the heavens gave me a boyfriend as a birthday present.

107
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,370
You shouldn't look up to the sky for a boyfriend but you should look more closely around you instead.

108
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,100
I wonder if there is a nice guy out there for you?

109
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,070
Hey, eat first!

110
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,460
I will sing you the birthday son—

111
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,500
Thanks for the food.

112
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,470
Why is it that I never get to sing the birthday song each year?

113
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,830
Hey, Kang Soo Jin.

114
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,080
This is so delicious.

115
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,930
You should be a chef instead of a photographer.

116
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,530
Does it taste okay?

117
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:34,770
Alright, I'm going recruit  you to work for me at my shop. Let's write up a contract.

118
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,160
Stop it! You always talk about the same thing everyday.

119
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,220
Why not?! 
     

120
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,210
Oh, why not? It's so good though. Why, why, why?

121
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,530
I told you, I'm okay!

122
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,200
- Even though I made it, I have to say it does taste good.
- You're so shameless.

123
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,700
It tastes so great, so great!

124
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,260
How should I solve the misunderstanding with Soo Jin?

125
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,610
And how should I change Jin Sook's feelings?

126
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,890
   

127
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,640
What should I do about this?

128
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,080
Should I just go over to Jin Sook and ask for it?

129
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,570
No, I shouldn't. Jin Sook might try to confess to me again.

130
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,700
What would I do then?

131
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh, that's right. It's the past right now, huh?

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,580
Then the fact that Jin Sook took the letters could be reset.

133
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,170
Yeah, okay.

134
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,330
Pil!

135
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,170
Hello.

136
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,980
I haven't seen you in a while.

137
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,910
I guess it's because you've been studying, right?

138
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,430
Yes, it's time for me to grow up now.

139
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,460
That's a good idea. They say that when a person matures, they die—

140
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,300
Oh my, what am I talking about?

141
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,930
But why are you so awkward with Soo Jin?

142
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,390
- I thought that maybe you two had a fight. 
 - Pardon?

143
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:07,430
Ever since you came back from the military, Soo Jin's face would freeze up whenever anyone talked about you.

144
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,810
And I could sense that she hates you—

145
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,370
Oh my. What am I saying?

146
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,530
Anyway, be good friends with my Soo Jin. Come over sometime too.

147
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,950
I'll get going.

148
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,340
So Soo Jin is mad at me.

149
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,110
It must be because she didn't receive my reply letters.

150
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,000
First, let's find the letters. There's no other answer but that.

151
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,440
I'm going to take the picture!

152
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,020
Groom, bride, you don't look affectionate! These pictures will exist forever!

153
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,700
Here, I'm taking the picture! Get ready!

154
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,010
That's not it. Wedding pictures should show tenderness.

155
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,590
Put your hand on your bride's waist.

156
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,020
- Sunbae!
- Oh, you're here?

157
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,920
Sit down.

158
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,160
I am the happiest person in the world!

159
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,230
Here! Next is kiss time!

160
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,250
Kiss or a peck?

161
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,870
A little more.

162
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,310
One, two!

163
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,220
Three! Oh my!

164
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,430
Hello.

165
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,200
Oh, hello. Wait a moment.

166
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,590
Groom and bride, let's take a break before we continue. Drink some water.

167
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,310
Thank you!

168
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,300
You are different than usual when you're working.

169
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,270
It's cool.

170
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,120
- I guess you're not working at the pharmacy today.
- Ah—

171
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,430
It's Jae Hyeon's off day today, so I asked him to come along.

172
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,670
I did so he can have some fresh air.

173
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,500
Did I disturb you?

174
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,460
No, none of the sort.

175
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,270
Should we all have a meal together?

176
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,960
That sounds good.

177
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,410
I forgot I had an appointment for lunch.

178
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,680
Pardon?

179
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,010
This became complicated.

180
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,330
Jae Hyeon, it looks like you can eat lunch with Soo Jin.

181
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,720
- Jae Hyeon, I'll request this of you! 
 - Okay.

182
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,520
CEO! C-CEO!

183
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,990
W-Why is the CEO like that? R-Really...

184
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,300
Since it turned out this way, let's eat lunch together.

185
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,080
I brought sandwiches.

186
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,090
The two of us?

187
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,110
Just the two of us...

188
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,520
What should I do?

189
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,070
What the heck? Why isn't it here?

190
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,840
I hid it here.

191
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,820
Ah, that's right. This is the past.

192
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,570
 Trash like you cannot enter. 

193
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,580
Hold on.

194
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,700
That's right.

195
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,710
Jin Sook, I'm sorry. I didn't want to go to this extent, but

196
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,900
I can't help it.

197
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,760
I'll try to be mindful of your privacy.

198
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,700
I'll just look for the letters. Just the letters.

199
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,350
It was here somewhere.

200
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,680
Jin Sook, why do you like someone like me?

201
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,050
- Be calm.
- Hey!

202
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,360
What are you doing here?

203
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,120
Oh.

204
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,730
I thought it was your birthday so I came to make you seaweed soup (tradition on birthdays).

205
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,970
Without the seaweed?

206
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,830
Oh, you're right.

207
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,070
I must've left the seaweed at home.

208
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,980
I'll bring the seaweed.

209
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,170
Hey. Be honest.

210
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,720
Did you come to my house...

211
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,630
You came to steal my secret fund, right?

212
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,970
Hey! Let's not do that, between friends.

213
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,640
Hey, what are you talking about?

214
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,100
I came to make you seaweed soup.

215
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,690
Really?

216
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,330
I don't think so. Let me look.

217
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:53,470
- I said I didn't!
- Look, here! Right here!

218
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,240
Hey. I told you I really didn't.

219
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,150
Anyway, I'm going to go get the seaweed. I'll see you later.

220
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,420
   
   

221
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,770
Father! Ugh, I'm going crazy.

222
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,920
When did you buy this?

223
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,870
Come here. Give it to me.

224
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,870
You're coughing this much, yet you still want to drink this?

225
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,570
Yeah, I do. Give it to me quickly.

226
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,880
I buy you medicine every day. Father, seriously, why are you like this?

227
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,430
You're going to die at this rate!

228
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,000
Die? Who's going to die? I won't die, you punk!

229
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,700
Give it to me quickly.

230
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,320
Father. Let's go to the hospital.

231
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,570
If your body hurts, you have to go to the hospital! You can't drink  alcohol like this!

232
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,180
Hurt? Who's hurting? I'm not hurting at all.

233
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,560
And, even if I'm about to die,

234
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,350
I won't visit that damn hospital!

235
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,840
Why are you trying to open it?

236
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,400
I was just curious to see what you packed.

237
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,510
What the heck?

238
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:12,620
- What's up with you two?
- Where are you wandering around, not opening  your business?

239
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,700
Three customers came and just left.

240
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,140
You lost at least ₩50,000.

241
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,520
How is Ahjussi?

242
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,470
Even though you're not my type, it's a pity to see you lose so much weight day after day.

243
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,940
Are you eating nowadays?

244
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,170
Jeong Ae prepared since this morning so she could give this to you.

245
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,730
Just so you know, I ate cup ramen.

246
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,460
I'm just saying.

247
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,810
Let's eat together today.

248
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,300
There are two.

249
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,130
Is it good?

250
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,340
It's so delicious.

251
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,480
Did you make this all yourself?

252
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,630
While living alone, the only skill that I got better at was cooking.

253
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,830
And since you were going to eat it,

254
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,710
I put in more effort in it.

255
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,620
I haven't been outside in a while, so it's nice.

256
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,530
You're right.

257
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,180
Isn't it frustrating to stay inside the pharmacy every day?

258
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,200
Well, yes.

259
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,710
I should meet people and get some sun,

260
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,800
but the only people I see are sick patients.

261
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,980
I might get depression at this rate.

262
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,630
A pharmacist shouldn't get depression.

263
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,970
What do you usually do on your off-days? The pharmacy closes on some days, right?

264
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:56,400
Well, I usually sleep or meet up with friends.

265
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,310
It's not much fun.

266
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,950
It'd be good if you had some hobbies.

267
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,370
You should watch a movie or exercise.

268
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,080
Coming outside and taking a walk like today is good too.

269
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,170
That's right.

270
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,110
But I can't do that alone.

271
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,890
Will you do it with me, Soo Jin?

272
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,500
- M-Me?
- Yes.

273
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,370
Really?

274
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,620
Oh, my phone. I'll go answer the call.

275
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,290
Hello, manager. Yes, CEO left.

276
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,950
The photoshoot has ended.

277
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,790
I don't know. CEO left first.

278
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,550
I was thinking of having some leisure time like you mentioned earlier.

279
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,130
Can you help me?

280
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,460
Me?

281
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,020
Are you free tonight? I have two tickets to the movies.

282
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,170
Oh, what should I do? Today is my best friend Jin Sook's birthday.

283
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,260
Our friends are throwing her a party. I have to go there.

284
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,990
Ah, your friend who works at the kebobs place?

285
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,320
It must be fun.

286
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,040
Can I go with you?

287
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,800
Pardon?

288
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,720
Man, this is driving me crazy.

289
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,240
I can't tell Jin Sook to give back the letters either.

290
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,960
Then I'll call my friend and see.

291
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,340
- Of course it'd be good to have more people celebrate with her. 
 - Sure.

292
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,330
Ah, those two!

293
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,130
Thank you.

294
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,830
But they seem a bit... awkward. Is it just my feeling?

295
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,310
Thank you.

296
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:15,830
Ah, they're not in a dating relationship yet.

297
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,840
- Give it to me. 
- Thank you.

298
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,390
Soo Jin! Are you done with work?

299
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,340
I went to the studio, and you weren't there.

300
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,430
What's with you? Did you eat something bad?

301
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,740
What do you mean "what" when it comes to us?

302
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,860
You're Bong Pil, right? Nice to meet you. I'm Park Jae Hyeon.

303
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:55,170
I thought you were only selling drugs in a small space, but you must've worked out.

304
00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:00,100
You too. I heard you were just preparing for the civil service exam at the studying room.

305
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,850
Wait. I'll just...

306
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,840
Oh my. Wait.

307
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,900
What are you doing? It's so embarrassing.

308
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,440
Sorry, I'll call you. You should leave first.

309
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,650
- Yes. Call me. 
 - Okay.

310
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,320
Oh man, I should just... he's no big deal.

311
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,080
Aren't you coming back after work? Why were you coming back with that guy?

312
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,850
How is that any of your business? So weird. Seriously.

313
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,910
Hey... Hey, Soo Jin! Kang Soo Jin!

314
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,630
Hey! Hey, Soo Jin!

315
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,670
I know why you're so cold towards me.

316
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,430
But it's a misunderstanding. There's a misunderstanding between us.

317
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,410
What misunderstanding?

318
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:58,300
I know it's because I didn't reply to any of your letters while I was in the military.

319
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,520
But I really did reply. That...

320
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,800
You didn't receive it because of an accident in the mail delivery.

321
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,530
An accident in the mail delivery?

322
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,780
Then are you saying someone took the letters in the middle of the delivery?

323
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,690
Yes, that's right.

324
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,700
Who exactly? Were your letters classified military secrets?

325
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,210
That... I can't tell you right now.

326
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,620
Anyway, I'll get proof of that today, so—

327
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:35,050
Hey. Stop wasting your time on useless things. Hurry and go study.

328
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,010
Hey. Hey, Soo Jin—

329
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,670
I'm seriously going crazy.

330
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,880
Please put the clean chopsticks nicely and neatly.

331
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,780
- Please place the menus nicely, and clean all the corners. 
 - Okay.

332
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,710
Today too, let's do our best!

333
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,480
Oh, right!

334
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,170
Hello, is it headquarters?

335
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:14,170
Please send twice amount of ingredients for Bong Pil kebobs today.

336
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,130
The customers were in an uproar because I ran out of the ingredients yesterday.

337
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,520
Ah, the ingredients for other dishes on the menu are fine.  I only need more ingredients for Bong Pil kebobs.

338
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,700
Yes. Yes, have a good day.

339
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,990
Today too, fighting!

340
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,990
Oh, what's this?

341
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,470
It's not here. Did Jin Sook take it?

342
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,930
He said he was spending the night in the studying room.

343
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,070
Was he always this neat?

344
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,730
His desk is very neat.

345
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,510
His room is a complete mess.

346
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,390
This book is completely new.

347
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,740
You don't even need to sell this as a used book. It can pass off as new.

348
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,400
As expected, becoming a completely new person after coming back from the military was a total lie.

349
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,550
What we learned from here is only despair.  Let's go.

350
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,200
   

351
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,450
But how come even Seok Tae isn't here today?

352
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,740
He used to always be here. Was our Pil a bad influence on him?

353
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,390
Right? I guess you won't be able to face Seok Tae's father.

354
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,140
Give me this one, please.

355
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,500
- How many candles would you like?
 - Twenty-five, please.

356
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,080
Will do.

357
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,530
   

358
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,510
Oh.

359
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,820
Awesome. Awesome.

360
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,770
Jin Sook, Jin Sook, I passed. I passed.

361
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,360
Please give it to me quickly. Quickly.

362
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,470
Oh my. Jin Sook. Finally.

363
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,680
We can't even earn enough for the electricity bill, let alone rent.

364
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,150
What should I do?

365
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,400
Yoon Mi, should we change professions? Should we open a noraebang  (karaoke place) ?

366
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,660
Unni, even if we open a noraebang, it seems it won't last long.

367
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,970
Please, here.

368
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,490
He's here again. The one who doesn't help with our sales.

369
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,240
What are you doing? Give him 500 ml.

370
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,030
Give me a 500 ml.

371
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,830
Excuse me.

372
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,280
What is the address of Miss Mi Ja?

373
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,810
- Why do you ask? 
 - Why?

374
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,560
Just because I'm curious.

375
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,490
I can't sleep when I'm curious.

376
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,870
If you're interested, ask her yourself.

377
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,990
Should I call her?

378
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,230
It's alright.

379
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,000
It's not a bad idea to slowly get to know her...

380
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,340
Unni, Ahjussi is asking where you live.

381
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,200
Tell him earth.

382
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,120
You heard, right?

383
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,370
Is that so?

384
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:21,300
Ultimately... we live at the same address.

385
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:28,540
   

386
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,640
- The Bong Pil kebobs are here. Enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

387
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,300
Wow.

388
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,800
Business is really doing well.

389
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,120
Excuse me, another Bong Pil kebob please.

390
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,380
Yes, just a moment.

391
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,820
Ah, really. Pil still bothers me even as a kebob.

392
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,970
Jin Sook, can we talk for a minute?

393
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,580
What is it?

394
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:35,030
Why did you leave and lock the door when I told you I would make you seaweed soup?

395
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,280
Why are you fussing about seaweed soup when you don't even have seaweed?

396
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,520
And didn't we all say to go to Bongbong Pub today?

397
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,910
You. You, you, you.

398
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,410
It's because you feel bad that you didn't prepare a birthday present for me, right?

399
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,640
No, that's not it. Actually...

400
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,100
I left something at your house earlier.

401
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:02,500
Really? Then, you should have said so from the start.

402
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,510
I'm really sorry about this. I'll quickly go get it.

403
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,410
- Okay. 
 - Work hard.

404
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,600
What's going on? Why is he frequenting my house?

405
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,920
Per chance it's to give me a surprise party for my birthday?

406
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,860
That rascal.

407
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,820
Oh, where could the letters be?

408
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:46,070
Seriously... where are they?

409
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,170
   
   

410
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:48,580
♫ Happy birthday to you.

411
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,040
♫ Happy birthday to you.

412
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,340
Here, a celebratory drink on the house.

413
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,350
- Wow, thank you. 
- Thank you!

414
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:00,380
♫ Happy birthday, dear Jin Sook.

415
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,710
Oppa, but how come Pil isn't coming?

416
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,180
Pil is not good at studying, but he is smart.

417
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:12,390
He always finds the most convenient time and place for his body.

418
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,180
Look.

419
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:18,440
Hey, Bong Pil. How can you show yourself just when we're almost done setting up?

420
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,190
Hyung, Soo Jin isn't here yet?

421
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,590
There she comes.

422
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,530
- This way. 
- Soo Jin, you're here.

423
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:32,270
Oh, you came with the pharmacist.

424
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,390
Wow.

425
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:37,450
Wow. This is amazing.

426
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,660
This is Jeong Ae and that's Oppa Dal Soo.

427
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,290
Hey, even if you want to, don't ruin the birthday party.

428
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,720
It took us half of the day to prepare this.

429
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,930
Hyung, today's the day Jin Sook was born, right?

430
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:53,190
It... probably is. Since it's her birthday.

431
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,120
But on this day, at least one of us will die.

432
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,740
W-What?

433
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,490
Just a moment. One moment.

434
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,190
Okay.

435
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:12,580
I am getting a phone call at this moment, too. I'll be back after the call.

436
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,580
Yes. No, I have a previous appointment.

437
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,660
Yes.

438
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,550
Yes, I will call you back tomorrow.

439
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,340
Okay.

440
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,890
Hey.

441
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,940
What ill-fated relationship do we have that you're bothering me like this?

442
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,210
What do you mean?

443
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:43,240
From carefully observing you as I travelled through time and space,

444
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,500
you are smiling kindly, but I already know that you're closer to a devil.

445
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,270
Pardon?

446
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,390
I'm telling you to distance yourself from Soo Jin.

447
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,440
If you don't want to embarrass yourself at a party.

448
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,910
Do you understand?

449
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,730
Gosh, gosh.

450
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,430
If I'm making everyone uncomfortable, I will leave.

451
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:34,840
N-no. No. Please introduce us to good medicine.

452
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,030
No. You guys should enjoy this time among friends.

453
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,400
Yes, you decided well.

454
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,430
Go home well. I'm extremely uncomfortable.

455
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,160
Hey. You leave. I'm more uncomfortable because of you.

456
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,600
You bastard.

457
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,230
Why are you being embarrassing? Seriously!

458
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,960
Don't worry about him and just stay.

459
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,180
He's not much of a welcomed character either.

460
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,270
No, I will leave now.

461
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,530
- No, it's... I mean... 
- You didn't even get to eat anything.

462
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,210
Y-you punk!

463
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:21,500
What did I do? I didn't say anything.

464
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,230
Sorry, you must have been very uncomfortable.

465
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:34,240
No, your friends are personable, enjoyable, and fun.

466
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,730
Perhaps, did Pil say something offensive to you separately?

467
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,440
No, that friend didn't say anything.

468
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,310
Oh, it seems like he did. That punk.

469
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,620
It's really not like that.

470
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,970
I am just busy, so I'm leaving because I have to go.

471
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,830
But you asked if you could come to the birthday party with me,

472
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:58,230
so it doesn't make sense that you have to leave suddenly because you're busy.

473
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,930
It's not like that. Don't misunderstand.

474
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:08,330
Honestly, I wanted to get to know your friends.

475
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,670
But if you're too greedy, you get indigestion.

476
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,510
Today, I am satisfied with just saying hello like this.

477
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:20,310
Go on in quickly. They shouldn't stay uncomfortable because of me.

478
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,550
Either way, thank you for today.

479
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,250
I'm the thankful one.

480
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,860
Then, I'll go.

481
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,250
Go safely.

482
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,900
Surprise!

483
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,500
Here.

484
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,090
- One, two—  
- Wait, wait, wait.

485
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,910
Hey, is Seok Tae making the cake? Why isn't he coming?

486
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:57,640
Let's push the cake cutting to the after-eating celebration and do the before-eating celebration first.

487
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,320
One, two, three!

488
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,380
♫ Happy birthday to you.

489
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,390
♫ Happy birthday to you.

490
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,870
♫ Happy birthday, dear Jin Sook.

491
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:12,920
♫ Happy birthday to you.

492
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:18,770
- Happy birthday! 
- Happy birthday!

493
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:35,050
Jin Sook, happy birthday. No, that's not it.

494
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,230
Jin Sook, happy birthday!

495
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,810
Open it at home.

496
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,610
Thank you. When did you prepare all this?

497
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,980
Wait. My present.

498
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,650
I definitely bought one and brought it.

499
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,260
 He's putting on a show again. 

500
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,230
Hey, if you didn't prepare anything, just sit down.

501
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,350
You're getting all the dust into the air.

502
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,180
Jin Sook knows that you're poor, studying for the civil service exam.

503
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,320
So don't put on a show and why don't you try making a deal using something called conversation?

504
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,900
No, I'm saying that's not it. I really, really bought a present today.

505
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,500
Hey, sit down. I'll pretend that I received one.

506
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,240
Hey, it's not this?

507
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,060
Military mail?

508
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
What is it?

509
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,600
They're letters you sent to Soo Jin.

510
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,690
Why is he carrying the letters he sent himself?

511
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,880
Hey, those aren't the present. Give it. Give it, give it.

512
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,130
What is it? Secret letters?

513
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:25,110
I'm telling you that's not it. Why are you looking at someone else's letters without permission?

514
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,330
Why? They're just letters.

515
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,800
- I'll leave first. 
- Hey, Jin Sook.

516
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,540
That's not it. It's... What I mean is...

517
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,010
Hey.

518
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,730
I passed. I passed, I passed! Jin Sook! Jin Sook!

519
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,470
I passed! Hey, Jin Sook, I passed— hey, Jin Sook.

520
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:47,020
Hey, hey, Jin Sook.

521
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,040
Jin Sook!

522
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,800
What's going on?

523
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,860
What's with the atmosphere?

524
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:02,330
W-what happened?

525
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,040
Oh?

526
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,900
Hey Jin Sook, just a moment. One moment.

527
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,160
Yes, I took those letters.

528
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,090
If you want to curse me out, go ahead.

529
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,290
I'm sorry, Jin Sook.

530
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,460
What are you sorry for? I'm the one who took the letters.

531
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:32,900
Hey, curse me out. I would rather have you be angry at me!

532
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,200
I know it all. With what feelings you took these.

533
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,900
Jin Sook.

534
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:43,970
I'm sorry for knowing your feelings too late.

535
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:48,100
If I were a little... If I were a little...

536
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,180
A little quicker about catching on...

537
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,540
Were you going to take these and show them to Soo Jin?

538
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:09,770
Even if you knew my feelings, you would have continued to hurt them.

539
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,530
And continued to look only at Soo Jin.

540
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,060
Jin Sook.

541
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,180
Pil...

542
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,760
I'm embarrassed that I can't look at your face,

543
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,530
and I can't go inside to look at Soo Jin's face either because I feel sorry.

544
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,590
You figure it out well for me.

545
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:29,210
Hey, Jin Sook. Hey, hey, hey!

546
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,700
Soo Jin.

547
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,210
The thing is...

548
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:11,450
Where I should even begin to explain, and how to explain all this... I am really not sure.

549
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,110
   

550
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:30,720
These are yours. Even though they're a bit late.

551
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,410
I see.

552
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,820
But...

553
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,790
What good are these right now?

554
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,550
What value do they have?

555
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,460
It's because of these letters.

556
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,920
Because you didn't receive my letters, our relationship drifted apart.

557
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,830
So I am trying to solve the misunderstanding.

558
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,410
Pil...

559
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,010
You really don't know.

560
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,660
Our relationship didn't have any misunderstandings from the start.

561
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:24,640
Hey... what, what do you mean?

562
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,650
Bong Pil.

563
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:33,390
Sook... has really liked you for a long time.

564
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:45,430
I wish... that you would... not hurt Sook's heart.

565
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,910
Hey, Soo Jin.

566
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,440
Did you give up on me because of Jin Sook?

567
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:13,790
Sometimes... friendship hurts more than love.

568
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,730
Let's stop... Pil.

569
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,390
Jin Sook.

570
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,960
Why did you come? You should be hanging out more with our friends.

571
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:17,860
What purpose does a birthday party have without the birthday girl? Everyone left, too.

572
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,870
I feel bad.

573
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,790
I completely ruined the atmosphere.

574
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,700
I'm really disappointed in you.

575
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,170
As soon as I heard that I passed the civil service exam, I didn't even call my dad and ran to you.

576
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,340
I wanted to tell you first, and I wanted to receive your congratulations first.

577
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,840
Sorry. I was really out of it.

578
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,050
Congratulations on passing.

579
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:58,290
You don't care whether or not I passed.

580
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:01,290
If Pil passed, you wouldn't be like this.

581
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,770
Seok Tae.

582
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,680
Why are you suddenly like this?

583
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,580
Do you know why I was trying to become a civil servant?

584
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:16,920
You... said that you would like your future husband to be a civil servant, right?

585
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,860
That's why I prepared for the civil service exam.

586
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:26,460
You said that guys with short hair look cool, so I immediately shaved my head the next day.

587
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:33,040
You said you like tall guys, so even though my feet hurt so much, I stacked three shoe insoles.

588
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,960
My world revolves around you, so how come you don't look at me? Why?

589
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,260
Seok Tae.

590
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:56,220
You know whom I like. Why are you being like this too?

591
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:03,180
Like how you can't give up on Pil, I can't give up on you either.

592
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,480
Even if the world can't understand me, you should understand me.

593
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:16,720
I have something I want to show you. Follow me.

594
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,150
Hey.

595
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:33,650
Look.

596
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,010
What is it?

597
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:40,510
They are letters that Soo Jin sent to Pil ever since high school.

598
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,850
   

599
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:46,560
Why do you have these?

600
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,790
Sometimes, people act childish like you did.

601
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:56,430
Back then, I just hated Pil without a reason.

602
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,810
Because I felt like I was getting ignored.

603
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:03,240
So I took the letters that Soo Jin sent to Pil.

604
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,170
What is the reason for showing me these?

605
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:11,560
If you read them, you'll know.

606
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:16,390
But Pil's love for Soo Jin isn't one-sided.

607
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,630
Soo Jin really likes Pil, too.

608
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,000
You're Soo Jin's best friend.

609
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,800
For Soo Jin, can't you give up on Pil?

610
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,320
Hey.

611
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,020
What can I do when I can't control my own heart?

612
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,180
If I could, I want to change things back to how they were, too.

613
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,140
I didn't know that

614
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:47,200
liking someone would become something I have to be sorry for to this many people.

615
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,810
But what can I do when I can't give up on it?

616
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,940
I'm not able to.

617
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,630
   
   

618
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,640
 Loyalty! 

619
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,780
 Soo Jin, have you been well?  I miss you a lot. 

620
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,310
 I am training and working every day. 

621
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:04,500
 I lost a lot of weight, and my face got really tan. 

622
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,530
 They say that you mature into a person when you go to the military. 

623
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:11,900
 But now that I'm actually here, it's a place where they stop a person.  

624
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,100
 Don't do this and don't do that. 

625
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:21,180
 Since I can't do things that were so normal, I feel impatient. 

626
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:27,610
 Even so, the thing I miss the most isn't my mom's warm food, 

627
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:32,690
 nor the ramen that you cook in the middle of the night,
 but you. 

628
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:37,120
♫  You are the so-called feeling  ♫

629
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:41,190
♫  You are the small tremor  ♫

630
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:45,750
 To Bong Pil, it must be very busy and hard. 

631
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:51,350
 I've heard that military is a place where you don't even have time to blink, so I know.  

632
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:55,070
 But since I'm not getting a reply, I'm needlessly worried.  

633
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:59,330
♫  Because you are the feeling that is love, this tremor is good  ♫

634
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:06,340
♫  Even today, I'm falling more for you  ♫

635
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:10,220
 So I'm thinking about coming to visit you sometime this weekend. 

636
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,970
 When you receive this letter, at least give me a call. 

637
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,780
 Mom! 

638
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,800
 How can you eat it without telling me! I'm going to give these to Pil. 

639
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,800
 They do say that it's useless to raise children. 

640
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,160
 You've never even cooked birthday meals for me or your dad. 

641
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,990
 But you're pouring out your love.  

642
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:43,100
 Well... Pil's in the military. How hungry he must be. 

643
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,490
 Hey, but you said Pil doesn't reply to your letters. 

644
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:49,900
 Does he know that you're coming to visit? 

645
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:53,150
 It's not that he isn't sending them. He's busy so he can't send them. 

646
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:56,330
 Last time when we talked over the phone, I told him that  I'll be visiting him soon. 

647
00:52:56,330 --> 00:53:00,840
 You did? Either way, you're going all out. 

648
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,890
 - This is good. 
- It is, huh?  

649
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,980
 - The flavor is perfect. 
- Mom, eat just that one. 

650
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,160
 Okay. 

651
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,820
 Ah, Mom! 

652
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,320
♫  My feelings for you  ♫

653
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:23,540
♫  That I hid from you for so long might be all right  ♫

654
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:28,340
♫  It must not be a one-sided love  ♫

655
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:32,340
♫  Tell me that you want me  ♫

656
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,930
♫  For you, I can do anything  ♫

657
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:35,790
 Excuse me, hello. 

658
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,220
 What is your reason for visiting? 

659
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,460
 I came to request for a visitation. 

660
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,900
 Please wait over there as you fill out this form. 

661
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,010
 Thank you. Work hard. 

662
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:50,750
 - Salute! 
- Gosh, my son. 

663
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:57,500
♫  Look at me  ♫

664
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:03,320
   
♫   Love me. Only you  ♫

665
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:09,040
 Relationship... 
♫  Are the one who makes me smile  ♫

666
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:11,980
   
♫  Tell me  ♫

667
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:19,140
 Girlfriend! 
♫  That you love me. Just like that  ♫

668
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:25,570
♫  If the growing love is the same as my heart  ♫

669
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,630
 Is it too much? 

670
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,920
   

671
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:46,060
 I've been told that Private Bong Pil already went out with a different visitor. 

672
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:50,010
 Went out? Then when will he come back? 

673
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:53,700
 I wouldn't know. But curfew starts at 8 o'clock.  

674
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,200
 8 o'clock? 

675
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,840
 Who came to visit him? 

676
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,030
 I made a trip in vain. 

677
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,880
 - Do you know how hungry I was? 
- That one is really spicy. 

678
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,300
 Really? 

679
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,350
 - Ah, spicy. 
- Hey, hey, hey. 

680
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:28,680
 Add a lot to your wrap. Eat a lot. 

681
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,150
 - Spicy. 
- Gosh. 

682
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:31,220
 It's good because it's spicy. 

683
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,430
 Hey, what is this? 

684
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,060
 - If you eat capsaicin, you're supposed to get a lot of adrenaline.
- Is that mine? 

685
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,560
 - It's mine, right? 
- Yes, here. 

686
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,970
 When I'm sleeping...  

687
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:46,960
 - Here. It's a present. 
- What is it? 

688
00:55:56,330 --> 00:56:01,930
 What is this! If I wear this, I'm going to get in huge trouble. 

689
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:05,280
 Eat, eat. Eat first. Now. 

690
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,330
 Hey, where did it go? What about— 

691
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,550
 I brought it. Who do you take me for? 

692
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,730
 Here, eat. 

693
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,890
 It's really good. 

694
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:30,740
♫  In case you are serious  ♫

695
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:38,810
 Pil... We... 
♫  I wanted to ask you again  ♫

696
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,740
 Are too late. 

697
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:46,740
♫  Because it comforts my heart  ♫

698
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:51,340
♫  Which hasn't opened up  ♫

699
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,270
♫  Although I'm scared and it's growing  ♫

700
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:59,670
♫  Everything will open up to you  ♫

701
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:06,150
♫  If we are like each other  ♫

702
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:15,170
♫  We can feel each other  ♫

703
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:22,400
♫  Now I know your pain  ♫

704
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,200
Soo Jin already decided to give up on me.

705
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,500
What else can I do?

706
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:37,560
What should I do?

707
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:43,640
What in the world am I supposed to do to change Soo Jin's heart?!

708
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:51,420
♫  Everything which has distressed my heart  ♫

709
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:58,840
♫  I want to entrust to you  ♫

710
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:03,930
♫  Up to now, I've been keeping my heart shut  ♫

711
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:11,540
♫  I am someone who believed I could live alone  ♫

712
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:16,040
♫  Like a fool  ♫

713
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,960
Yes, Grandma. Sorry, I woke you up when you were sleeping, huh?

714
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:54,180
 No, no. My puppy, did you have a good birthday? 

715
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,200
Of course, I did.

716
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,470
Soo Jin made me seaweed soup, and my friends threw me a birthday party.

717
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:06,030
 Gosh, I'm so thankful to Soo Jin. 

718
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:09,630
 You just came back after hanging out with your friends until now? 

719
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:11,370
Yes.

720
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:19,570
Grandma... Should I pack up here and come live with you?

721
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:26,880
No... There's nothing wrong.

722
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,420
I'm just tired of this neighborhood.

723
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:36,250
Yes... If I decide, I'll let you know.

724
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,280
Good night.

725
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,430
 Jin Sook, happy birthday! From Pil. 

726
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,540
   

727
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:13,530


728
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,130
   
 Cheers! 

729
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,940
 - The weather is nice. 
- It's nice. 

730
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:30,360
 Sook, what are you doing this weekend? Want to come with me somewhere? 

731
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,730
 This weekend? 

732
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,590
 I have somewhere I have to go. 

733
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,600
 Where? 

734
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,360
 An appointment. 

735
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:50,430
 Really? Okay, then I'll have to go alone. 

736
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:55,220
 Sorry for making you go alone. 

737
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:59,110
 But where are you going? To meet a guy? 

738
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:01,000
 I'm not! 

739
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:04,870
 I'm going to get some fresh air. 

740
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:10,730
 Where I go... I'll tell you after I come back. 

741
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:13,450
 Gosh. Hey. 

742
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:15,830
 Where are you going? 

743
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:18,310
 I'll tell you after I come back. 

744
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:22,620
 What? Where are going? Are you trying to flirt with me? 

745
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,380
 I'll tell you after I come back. 

746
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:29,600
♫  Now both the pain  ♫

747
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:34,330
♫  And all the wounds  ♫

748
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:41,990
♫  Everything which has distressed my heart  ♫

749
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:48,770
♫  I want to entrust to you  ♫

750
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:50,870
♫  Up to now, I've been keeping my heart shut  ♫

751
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:54,300
   

752
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,300
 Why are you- why are you in my room? 

753
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:00,200
 I- I am marrying Jin Sook? 

754
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,290
 Young master! 

755
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,390
 Dal Soo is a young master? 

756
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,200
 Oppa, who are you? 

757
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,570
 Which school is that woman going to? 

758
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:10,480
 Studying abroad? What is going on? 

759
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,300
 No way... You don't know my birthday or my phone number? 

760
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,970
 I'll write it for you. Give it. 

761
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:18,550
 The only thing I can do is to go back to the past through the manhole. 

762
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:23,010
 I'm going to get rid of all the manholes in that neighborhood.
