1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,430
I'm wearing a suit.  It seems like I got a job.

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,930
Nice. I'm feeling nice from the start.

3
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:20,530
The gangsters are gone. The neighborhood is clean. Good!

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,030
So everything's back to normal.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,410
It'll be fine if Soo Jin is normal too.

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,430
I saved her life, so her feelings should've changed, right?

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,530
Nice.

8
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,030
What, what, what? Wait a second.

9
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,530
Gosh, that scared me.

10
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,230
Gosh... is it because of all of the traveling through the manhole?

11
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,130
My mental state is messed up.

12
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,330
Get your head on straight, Bong Pil!  Damn it.

13
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,530
   

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,000
Ah, where did she go now?

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,210
Every time I come see her, she's not here.

16
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,130
Huh? Where have you been?

17
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,830
- I went out for a bit. You were looking for me?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,230
You— You went to see the photographer lady again, right?

19
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,030
I did, but she wasn't there.

20
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,430
You're putting in a lot of effort, you are.

21
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,730
Hey. Why is a fine man like you chasing after a girl?

22
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,330
You still have a lot of hair on your head.

23
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,830
- Because it's fate. 
 - What?

24
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,930
I have that feeling. I don't know the reason, but

25
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,830
it feels like we have been together for a long time.

26
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,230
Even when I saw her for the first time, I felt so familiar with her.

27
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,230
Maybe a déjà vu for love?

28
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,730
What should I do, Teacher?

29
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,030
I don't know.

30
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,630
It seems like lovesickness. There's no medicine for it.

31
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,430
Even if you go to the doctor, it won't be cured either.

32
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,230
   

33
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,030
 University Hospital 

34
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,130
Welcome.  Where are you going?

35
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,930
Excuse me, Customer?

36
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,730
- Pardon? 
 - Where are you going?

37
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,730
Oh?  That is ...

38
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,130
Wow, why are there so many customers?

39
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,330
Aw, Jin Sook achieved a big success, didn't she?

40
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,630
Apple juice, here you go.

41
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,930
Yes, please enjoy. Next, please.

42
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,130
Two cups of kiwi juice.

43
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,530
Did she change her part-time workers?

44
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,530
Wait, but where is Jin Sook?

45
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,330
Hey, Kang!

46
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,330
Why are you blanking out in someone else's neighborhood?

47
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,630
Long time no see.

48
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,530
Are you eating well?

49
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,230
Hey, I'm thirsty.

50
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,830
Your habit of ordering people around hasn't changed.

51
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,730
Drink this. Let me rest too. My feet hurt so much.

52
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,530
That's what I'm saying. You should live the way you look.

53
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,430
What's with those heels on you?

54
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,330
Hey, there is a dress code in the company.

55
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,930
Do you know about working in the company?

56
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,630
Who told you to get a job?  You always didn't like working under someone.

57
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,430
Didn't you say  you'd be a young entrepreneur who'd earn ₩100 million  a year?

58
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,230
You're right. Why did I get a job?

59
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,730
How's the neighborhood?

60
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,430
Where else would it go? It's just there.

61
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,530
The neighborhood is the same, but there's no people.

62
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,930
It's empty.

63
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,430
Oppa Goo Gil, Oppa Dal Soo,  Seok Tae, Jeong Ae. I miss them all.

64
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,830
I don't know if they're all doing well or not.

65
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,030
What about Pil?

66
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,730
He's well.

67
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,130
   

68
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,230
  
  

69
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,630
Ah, where did everyone go?

70
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,030
Did I mess something up again?

71
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,030
I wasn't involved in anything else besides saving Soo JIn.

72
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,530
I don't have my cell phone or wallet. What exactly do I do?

73
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,730
Oh, this place is the same.

74
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,930
Hyung Goo Gil.

75
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,830
You're here?

76
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,330
Where have you been wandering?

77
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,130
A-ahjussi?

78
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,430
 H-how are you alive? 

79
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,830
 He definitely passed away in 2014— 

80
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,430
 What did I do that caused Goo Gil's father to live? 

81
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,620
 Ahjussi had nothing to do with the beach fire incident. 

82
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,230
Why are you standing there like an idiot? Hurry up and grab a cue stick.

83
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,630
Today, we'll do "massé."

84
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,930
The official term is "massé shot."

85
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,130
This technique is prohibited from being used by players who play an average score under 300.

86
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,230
But... wait a minute.

87
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:10,330
Wait, Ahjussi. I'm quite sorry to say this, but...

88
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,130
Why are you alive?

89
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,130
- What are you talking about?
- You died, Ahjussi—

90
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,630
You passed away in 2014, Ahjussi.

91
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,930
I went to your funeral and gave ₩50,000  for the funeral expenses too.

92
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,330
You idiot, what are you talking about?

93
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,830
My lunchtime is over. I need to get going.

94
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,830
Okay, go in.

95
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,230
Why aren't you saying anything?

96
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,030
About what?

97
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,430
The words you want to say are bubbling in your throat right now, aren't they?

98
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,330
Hey.  What's with you?  Did something happen?

99
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,030
Sook...

100
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,830
We...

101
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,530
We can't see Pil anymore.

102
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,530
 Pil... 

103
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,830
 We decided to stop waiting. 

104
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,430
 What  ... are you saying? 

105
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,130
 If we can't change anything, we must accept it. 

106
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,630
 That's love, and that's life. 

107
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,730
 This was a hard decision for us too. 

108
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,330
 There's no need to be in despair because you're sorry. 

109
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:01,730
 You need to be happy, Soo Jin. Pil would  want that too. 

110
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,230
 Ahjumma. 

111
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,530
 Ahjussi. 

112
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,030
- What did you say?
- I...

113
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,030
I said that I died in 2014.

114
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:21,030
But... how are you talking to me, if you're dead?

115
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,430
I heard you got into a fire accident after going on a vacation to the beach.

116
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,630
Yes. And?

117
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,930
You got hurt then, so now you're in the hospital in a comatose state, you punk.

118
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,930
Ah, why am I? I— I saved Soo Jin and escaped safely.

119
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,230
You did save Soo Jin.

120
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,730
Yeah! You did, but you got hurt too much.

121
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,030
So you were admitted to the hospital, and you've been in a coma since then.

122
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,730
I— I even visited you in the hospital.

123
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,630
It was before I died, so maybe... 2011?

124
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,230
No.

125
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,650
Hyung.

126
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,070
Hey, Hyung.

127
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,420
Hyung.

128
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,860
Hyung.

129
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,220
Hyung.

130
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,040
Hyung! Hyung Goo Gil!

131
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,440
How could he hear you?

132
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,570
Ahjussi, d-d-did I die?

133
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,720
Not yet. Only your soul escaped from your body.

134
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,020
But your parents seem like they're about to give up on you now.

135
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,300
After all, they've been waiting for a very long time.

136
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,410
I...

137
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,750
How long have I been lying here?

138
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,560
For six years.

139
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,150
After the accident, you couldn't return to your body.

140
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,840
You were just drifting around.

141
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,880
If your treatment is cut off today,

142
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,830
you really will die.

143
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,750
Aigoo.

144
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,650
The flowers that Soo Jin brought these past few years seem like a truckload.

145
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,780
Why would Soo Jin do that?

146
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,630
She has someone she's going to marry.

147
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,760
What are you talking about?

148
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,710
What marriage?

149
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,020
After you became like this,

150
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,030
it seems Soo Jin didn't date anyone.

151
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,350
  The occurrence of Soo Jin's wedding has disappeared. 

152
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,430
 I've stopped Soo Jin's wedding after all. 

153
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,930
 But I'm dying... 

154
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,830
 That makes no sense. 

155
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,720
What do you mean?

156
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,940
Going to Pil is Soo Jin's daily routine...

157
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,850
She came today too.

158
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:51,610
Not too long ago, she was so happy because Pil reacted to what she said.

159
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,950
We also think of Soo Jin as our daughter.

160
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:04,730
Our PIl has liked Soo Jin a lot since he was young.

161
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,570
Those two matched so well together.

162
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,070
Soo Jin should find a nice man now.

163
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,300
Ah, seriously.

164
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,260
No. No matter what how I think about it, I'm the only son for the third generation.

165
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,200
How can they just cut off my treatment? That's too much.

166
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,920
No, I've never been treated as their son.

167
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,260
Does this family have a lot of sons? I mean—

168
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,310
What?

169
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,050
What? Ahjussi? Ahjussi?

170
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,390
What?

171
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,420
You should've told me there was such a way to travel.

172
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,240
Since we're in a hurry, let's cut across.

173
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,750
I was wondering why you were following the street.

174
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,320
Mom, Dad!

175
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,540
He was the one who ran fast.

176
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,970
Although his start was slow...

177
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,930
He was like that for everything.

178
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,850
He was slower than other kids to speak.

179
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,190
He was slow at reading Korean too.

180
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,580
I know, right?

181
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,720
He was slow at everything,

182
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,940
so I thought he'd last longer.

183
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,620
Until now,

184
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,150
we haven't had anything more precious than Pil.

185
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,840
I feel like he was taken away from me.

186
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,940
 Oh my. Oh my. 

187
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,660
 Oh my goodness. 

188
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,850
 Oh my, what shall I do with you? 

189
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,990
 Ma'am, I'll do it. 

190
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,590
 Okay. 

191
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,360
 Are you okay? 

192
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,620
 Yes, I'm fine. 

193
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,310
From now on,

194
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,760
the time we have left will be as painful as Hell.

195
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,920
You don't need to feel like that.

196
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,540
If we can send Pil off to a good place,

197
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,550
I'm willing to suffer in your place in Hell.

198
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:08,100
Thinking back, I haven't told him...

199
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,180
how proud of him I was whenever I looked at him running.

200
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,640
I have never told him that...

201
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,160
 Hey look, it's Bong Pil over there! 

202
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,390
 - Bong Pil! 
-  Pil! 

203
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,580
 Hey! Be careful! 

204
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,170
 Hey! 

205
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,790
 You can't be standing here. Go back quickly. Go back. 

206
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,350
 - It's not okay here today! 
 - He's all baked. 

207
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,510
♫  The morning we wanted to spend together  ♫

208
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,450
 What am I going to do about you? 

209
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:50,070
♫  The memories will soon be filled (memories)  ♫

210
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,690
♫  Just smile secretly in your imagination, yeah  ♫

211
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,850
♫  You and I sit facing each other  ♫

212
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,000
♫  There's still one thing to whisper  ♫

213
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,020
♫  Don't worry about anything  ♫

214
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,300
♫  Take this hand.  It will go away.  ♫

215
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:15,490
♫  Under heaven in another world  ♫

216
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,590
♫  After I sit on a blue park bench  ♫

217
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,830
♫  While drinking coffee, I'll lean on you and take a break  ♫

218
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:28,220
♫  On a bridge in an unfamiliar city  ♫

219
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,510
♫  Both you and I will whisper this love  ♫

220
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,060
♫  Sweetly kiss, baby. We will share together  ♫

221
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,080
♫  I love you  ♫

222
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,260
Soo Jin.

223
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,090
 I actually had something to tell him. 

224
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,830
 But Pil is not giving me a chance to do that. 

225
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,040
 I think I hesitated too much. 

226
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:30,060
 Perhaps, I was thinking too much. 

227
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,290
 There's no way Pil is doing this to us. 

228
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,690
 Soo Jin's got it wrong. 

229
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,570
 She must've heard it wrong. 

230
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,460
 What are you talking about? What's happening to Pil now? 

231
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,950
 I don't know, Oppa. 

232
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,020
 Soo Jin just contacted me out of the blue. 

233
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,830
 Oppa, so what's going to happen to Pil? 

234
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,270
What does this even mean?

235
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,920
I planned to go see Pil tomorrow.

236
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,980
What the heck does this even mean?!

237
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,180
- I'm leaving to go over there right now.
 - I'll be there right away.

238
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,020
I'll be going there too, so be here right away.

239
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,380
Alright, so hurry up. We don't have much time.

240
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,130
I just rode on this stupid manhole a few times. That's all.

241
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,480
Let's see.

242
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,540
So are you saying that you rode on this thing to travel to the past and back to the present?

243
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,010
That's correct. I'm really not supposed to die.

244
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,590
What are you saying?

245
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,150
What kind of nonsense are you spewing here?

246
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,940
It's the truth I'm telling you!

247
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,640
If I can't get on this thing,  I'll be in big trouble, Ahjussi.

248
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,000
Go back on this thing and travel back to where you came from then.

249
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,550
This thing opens up only at 12 o'clock midnight though.

250
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,130
Aren't they suspending all treatment today?

251
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,240
So that means I'll be dying for good before I can even go on this thing!

252
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,410
Ahjussi, please save me.

253
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,330
I beg of you. Please, Ahjussi.

254
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:32,500
Look here. If I had the ability to save you, do think I would be dead right now?

255
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,480
Fine. Fine.

256
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,270
Let's try to stop them from suspending the treatment for now.

257
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,550
Gosh, boy.

258
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,130
What the?

259
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,670
Did he finally become a public servant?

260
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,150
Everyone in the group separated after what happened to you,

261
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,660
and Seok Tae just did nothing but study.

262
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,430
Why in the world did the lights go out again?

263
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,320
Did something happen to the manhole?

264
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,330
The weather is so toasty too. This is so annoying.

265
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,590
This manhole gives me a bad feeling for some reason.

266
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:23,170
I have to block this stupid thing. I can just feel this thing causing nothing but trouble in the future.

267
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,960
Hey...

268
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,650
Hey, don't do that.

269
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,780
I have to block this stupid thing.

270
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,860
I told you to stop! I have to get on that thing!

271
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,630
Where did that bastard Seok Tae go anyway?

272
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,150
Am I Seok Tae?

273
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,860
What just happened?

274
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,880
Ahjussi, what happened just now, huh?

275
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,950
You're Pil?

276
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,070
What the?

277
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,720
Hey, how in the world did you get inside there?

278
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,870
Hurry up and get out of there, punk!

279
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,250
Hey, Seok Tae!

280
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,070
Why are you being like that? You're scaring me.

281
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,260
What's going on here?

282
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,380
Hey.

283
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,790
So dizzy. Did I just doze off or something?

284
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,420
Hey mister, did I do something silly just now?

285
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,780
Why am I so tired?

286
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,790
Gosh, we have to hurry up and block this thing.

287
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:42,760
Mommy, mommy, my mommy.

288
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,730
This is the twelfth chapter of the Mystery Chase.

289
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:48,980
I wonder what being possessed is all about.

290
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,240
That is when a ghost is stealing my body.

291
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,020
However, it doesn't matter what kind of ghost it is.

292
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:59,180
It doesn't matter what kind of evil spirit it is. They won't be able to possess a spirit that is strong and intense.

293
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:13,650
In nomine domini sabatos. Iboride ideas impetus.

294
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,500
Ghosts can be anywhere.

295
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,610
You! It's right behind you!

296
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,430
If you've been possessed for a long time, then you should not leave it alone the way it is any longer.

297
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:31,720
Maybe your physical body will never forever...

298
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,240
be yours again because they will take it away from you forever!

299
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,360
Oh that smell.

300
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,200
Please maintain your strong spirit.

301
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,440
If you don't do that, then you'll forever be food for ghosts to eat.

302
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,760
You're mine now.

303
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,810
You and your stupid freak show!

304
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,820
- Ow, what are you doing?!
 - You're playing ghost again!

305
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,990
Oppa! What are you doing every night when you do nothing but play ghost, huh?

306
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,480
Mom, please. I will be a good boy and study hard from now on, okay?

307
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,500
Father.

308
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,240
Just one more day, Father.

309
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,610
Just one more day, please!

310
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,670
See? I told you this won't work.

311
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,930
Oh, Father!

312
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,470
No, this won't work. Not even a pinch.

313
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,570
You won't be able to possess these two.

314
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,220
Then what do you want me to do?

315
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,060
How am I supposed stop the suspension of the treatment then?!

316
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,880
Man, I'm in big trouble now! I don't have much time!

317
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,020
Hello.

318
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,390
I understand. I'll be there right now.

319
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,290
Something happened at the hospital.

320
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,920
You can't be doing this!

321
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,190
You seriously can't do this! No, you can't!

322
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,560
You can't do this!

323
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,060
The kids are all here just for you.

324
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,550
- Don't do it! 
- Kids!

325
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,750
We should talk.

326
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,900
Let's not do this.

327
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,830
Ahjussi! This isn't right!

328
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,150
I agree. We won't ever let Pil leave us.

329
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,350
You'll regret it. You should know better that he's not the type to ever give up.

330
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,680
Mr. and Mrs. Bong, please have a talk with me for just a moment.

331
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,500
Sorry for not visiting you more often.

332
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:03,910
We are always thankful to you and Soo Jin both.

333
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:08,730
The nurse let us know about something not too long ago.

334
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,220
Through that nurse we found out that both you and Soo Jin came to visit our boy a lot.

335
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,430
Thank you.

336
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,720
The neighborhood is so empty now.

337
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,980
So many things have changed all at once as if it's all a lie.

338
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,910
It's all because of Pil.

339
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,940
Maybe everyone left the neighborhood

340
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,160
because they knew that something like this would happen eventually.

341
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,580
I have no idea if Pil will be able to ever wake up,

342
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,940
but I won't be able to ever come back to a place where Pil isn't around.

343
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:45,700
So, Mr. and Mrs. Bong. I beg of you, just a little longer please.

344
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,480
Let's wait a little while longer, okay?

345
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,810
It's been six years.

346
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,810
It's time that we send him off, Jin Sook.

347
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,760
   
   

348
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,830
I'll be dying soon.

349
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,160
There's nothing I can possibly do.

350
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,540
People learn and realize that they actually loved the dead person after they're gone.

351
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:22,960
I'm pretty sure all your friends and your parents feel that way too.

352
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,980
You don't know how regretful I am.

353
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,850
I wish that I could've been a better father to my son Goo Gil while I was still alive.

354
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,490
I regret that I didn't even say, "I love you" to him.

355
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,960
If you don't say it then,

356
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,780
you might never have the opportunity to say it again.

357
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,320
Soo Jin!

358
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:26,280
Excuse me, Ahjussi. I have something to tell you.

359
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,360
Let's go out for a bit.

360
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,850
I came here to give you this.

361
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,910
I took this photo at the beach that day.

362
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,970
It's the last photo I have of Pil.

363
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,930
I was going to give this photo to Pil after returning,

364
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,060
but I didn't get to.

365
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,540
So I brought it.

366
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,350
I wanted to give it to him myself when he woke up again. 
   

367
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,790
I am now

368
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,930
going to try my best to get used to living without Pil.

369
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,090
Mr. and Mrs. Bong...

370
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:25,240
Pil lied to me.

371
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,160
He told me this...

372
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,400
That I will be fine.

373
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,450
That nothing will happen to me.

374
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,830
That if something happened to me,

375
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,620
he said that he will always watch over me.

376
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,610
But he won't be able to do that anymore.

377
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,230
You'll be fine.

378
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,760
Nothing will happen to you.

379
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,560
Pil...

380
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,330
Is that what he told you?

381
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,930
I'm not fine right now,

382
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,070
and bad things are happening to me.

383
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,070
But all Pil is doing is just lying there.

384
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,390
So I will be

385
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:31,840
trying to get used to living without Pil now.

386
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:43,530
♫  In case you are serious  ♫

387
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:52,150
♫  I wanted to ask you again  ♫

388
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:58,830
♫  Because it comforts my heart  ♫

389
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,330
♫  Which hasn't opened up  ♫

390
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,290
♫  Although I'm scared and it's growing  ♫

391
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:11,860
♫  Everything will open up to you  ♫

392
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:18,050
♫  If we are like each other  ♫

393
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:27,280
♫  We can feel each other  ♫

394
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,730
♫  Now I know your pain  ♫

395
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:38,000
♫  When I see your tears flow  ♫

396
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,190
♫  It feels like even my heart is ripping apart  ♫

397
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,560
♫  Now both the pain  ♫

398
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,040
 Bong Pil. 

399
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,710
♫  And all the wounds  ♫

400
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,670
♫  Everything which has distressed my heart  ♫

401
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:04,870
 Didn't I tell you that nothing will happen to you no matter what? 

402
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,700
 You asked me if I would come forward and be there for you if something happened to you? 

403
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,550
 Of course, I would. 

404
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,090
 Was there a time when I didn't? 

405
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:23,120
♫  I am someone who believed I could live alone  ♫

406
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,550
♫   Like a fool  ♫

407
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,120
You'll be fine.

408
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,200
Nothing will happen to you.

409
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:23,300
When Pil was younger,

410
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,160
every time he was sick,

411
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,450
this is what we always told him, right?

412
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,580
Would it be okay for us to send our Pil away like this?

413
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,430
Nothing will happen?

414
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,130
Thank you.

415
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,480
Give him his antibiotics well.

416
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,670
Make sure to do his check up thoroughly as well.

417
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:09,300
- His vitals are normal.
- What did Soo Jin  do  to change Mr. Bong's mind?

418
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,560
Soo Jin came to visit Pil practically everyday from what I heard.

419
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,100
In the end, Soo Jin saved Pil.

420
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,550
And Pil saved Soo Jin at the beach that day.

421
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:23,430
This is good, at least for now.

422
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:28,630
We haven't seen each other as a family in a while so let's go have a drink somewhere nearby. It will be on me.

423
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,220
Wow, Jin Sook. Thanks for the treat.

424
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,790
Let's go.

425
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:38,060
Hyungs, girls! This. What does this text even mean, huh?!

426
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:43,000
I saw it late because I was working. What's going on with Pil? What's wrong with him?!

427
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,750
Mr. Bong! Mr. Bong, Mr. Bong, Mr. Bong!

428
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,960
Our Pil. Please save our Pil!

429
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,540
You listen up! Don't you dare do anything to our Pil!

430
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,160
If you do, I will put my public service on the line and will never forgive you!

431
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,040
- No matter when we see him, he is never to be liked. 
- Please, Sir! We have to save Pil.

432
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,670
Let's go.

433
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,000
I saved her once and Soo Jin saves me once.

434
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,920
I would say that our relationship is practically like Altair and Vega.

435
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Altair and Vega represent sad love. Are you okay with that?

436
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,360
Oh yeah? Then I cancel what I said.

437
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,370
Hey, hey, hey. The sun's going down.

438
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,870
You said that the lid will open at midnight. How are you going to go inside?

439
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:27,000
Now that I think about it, I couldn't come up with a plan because of my father.

440
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,610
I need my physical body in order to get back into that manhole.

441
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:35,180
That means we should get some help from one of the living then.

442
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,240
It seems like Seok Tae is easy to possess, so let's get  some help from him for now.

443
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,610
Ah, that sounds like a good idea.

444
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,720
That Seok Tae hardly thinks about anything,

445
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,060
so I was able to go in easily, just like that.

446
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,360
I'd like to say that punk has such a free mind. He is basically like free Wi-Fi.

447
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,320
But you still have to be careful. If you possess someone's body for too long, you can ruin them.

448
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,560
In some cases, you can even get trapped in that body.

449
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,270
So you have to run in and out of there quickly, as if you're hitting a massé shot.

450
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,830
What about you?

451
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,380
What about me?

452
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,500
Hey, hey, I won't be able to.

453
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,740
I can't do anything like possessing a body.

454
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,550
If you're going to help me, you should help me until the end. You're being unreasonable.

455
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,140
I can't because I have weak energy. I won't be able to possess someone.

456
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,060
Pick someone well. This needs teamwork.

457
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,700
How can I move him by myself?

458
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,550
You are so bothersome even in death, gosh!

459
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:32,000
Fine, fine... I will try to find someone.

460
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,200
I'm going to go meet Soo Jin now. See you at the hospital at 11 PM.

461
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,870
You little punk.

462
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,960
Try to do it better. When I was young, I used to be so good at it.

463
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,540
You are so young, but can't even do it properly.

464
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,500
Unni, you should get married.

465
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:56,050
This place never changes no matter what.

466
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,030
What's up with the atmosphere here? Is someone dead or something?

467
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,290
♫  With that beautiful voice  ♫

468
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,720
Where's Soo Jin?

469
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,670
Oh yeah, where is Soo Jin?

470
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,090
I texted her to come but there's no answer.

471
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,040
Call her.

472
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,380
She doesn't even answer my calls.

473
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,390
Soo Jin didn't look so good.

474
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:24,670
Ah by the way, actually the truth is... Soo Jin liked you too, Pil.

475
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,450
Are you drunk now? Pil was the one who liked Soo Jin.

476
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:32,020
No, Hyung. Soo Jin liked Pil as well.

477
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,290
 Soo Jin liked me too? 

478
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,210
I can't trust a sober Seok Tae, so how am I suppose to believe what a drunk Seok Tae is saying?

479
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:42,510
But I'm really saying the truth though. Soo Jin liked him ever since high school.

480
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,940
 Since high school? 

481
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,600
Pil has no idea, but I know it.

482
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,110
I know it!

483
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,740
 - The person you have called is unable to answer...  
 - Soo Jin really is not answering.

484
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,100
Just let her be. Soo Jin is probably feeling like she's in hell today.

485
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,760
She doesn't need us. Whom she needs right now is Pil.

486
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,590
That's true.

487
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:11,720
 I'm not fine right now, and bad things are happening to me. 

488
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,930
 But all Pil is doing is just lying there. 

489
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,370
 So I will be 

490
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,060
 trying to get used to 

491
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,920
 living without Pil now. 

492
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,700
Soo Jin is really...

493
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,420
 Soo Jin needs me right now. 

494
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:41,030
 Why have we become like this? 

495
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,020
 Why is it that we aren't there when we are looking for each other? 

496
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,860
 Why do we say something random when we're in front of each other? 

497
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,790
 We like each other, but how come we couldn't say it? 

498
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,850
 Since when were we out of step? 

499
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:48,340
 Where do I have to go to start all over from the beginning again? 

500
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,630
I thought you might be here.

501
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,020
Sitting here and looking down at our neighborhood...

502
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,460
It strangely makes you feel better.

503
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,020
When we were younger, we used to sit on this bench and play a lot, too.

504
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,360
You remember, right?

505
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,730
Do you...

506
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,970
like me?

507
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,340
Thanks, Soo Jin.

508
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,980
I missed the chance

509
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,510
to say it.

510
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,200
You were always there by my side,

511
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,790
so I thought whenever I made up my mind,

512
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,770
I would be able to say it.

513
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,790
That I like you.

514
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:57,670
I should have said it while we were at that beach.

515
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,800
Because I wasn't able to say it that day,

516
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,890
I really regret it.

517
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,390
♫  In case you are serious  ♫

518
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:28,080
♫  I wanted to ask you again  ♫

519
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:34,830
♫  Because it comforts my heart  ♫

520
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:39,420
♫  Which hasn't opened up  ♫

521
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,340
♫  Although I'm scared and it's growing  ♫

522
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:47,810
♫  Everything will open up to you  ♫

523
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:51,510
♫  If we are like each other  ♫

524
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:54,210
 I wonder why I wasn't able to see her love? 

525
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,440
 We could have worked out well. 

526
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,090
 Ahjussi was right. 

527
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,770
 If you don't say it then, 

528
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:15,700
 you might never have the opportunity to say it again. 

529
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:22,450
 There is so much I am learning after death. 

530
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:26,770
♫  Now both the pain  ♫

531
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:31,700
♫  And all the wounds  ♫

532
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:39,550
♫  Everything which has distressed my heart  ♫

533
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:46,760
♫  I want to entrust to you  ♫

534
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,150
♫  Up to now, I've been keeping my heart shut  ♫

535
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:59,470
♫  I am someone who believed I could live alone  ♫

536
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,930
♫  Like a fool  ♫

537
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,800
 Wow. 

538
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,680
 It's working well. 

539
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,640
 But the neck of the fan won't turn, okay? But just use it anyway. 

540
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,270
 Thanks. 

541
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,850
Even if I want to fix it...  There is no way for me to do that.

542
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:04,690
Wow... They have nothing between them now, so why did this punk come here?

543
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:12,440
Soo Jin, you walked by my pharmacy four times today.

544
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,080
But all four times, you passed by while crying.

545
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,050
Did I?

546
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:23,820
I came by because I thought you might need someone by your side.

547
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:29,000
I don't know what the reason is but you looked like you needed someone to comfort you.

548
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,790
You won't be much comfort.

549
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:35,690
Yes, I need some comfort.

550
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:38,250
This symptom

551
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,900
is because of one particular person.

552
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:53,850
And I end up crying frequently  because of that person.

553
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:58,640
Sometimes, I also end up laughing frequently because of him as well.

554
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,280
Ever since a long time ago,

555
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:06,650
I cried a lot because of him

556
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:09,670
and laughed a lot, too. I think that's why.

557
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,910
You see those pictures up there, right?

558
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,240
I take a picture of him almost every day.

559
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:26,590
He has no facial expression and he doesn't show any reaction.

560
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,150
But I get to see his different faces every day.

561
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,840
 ♫ Happy birthday  

562
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:40,580
So every day, I would take a picture of him.

563
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:45,260
Hoping that tomorrow, he will open up his eyes and look at me.

564
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:49,380
I would imagine that while I take pictures of him.

565
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:57,450
 ♫ Happy birthday to you 

566
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:03,200
I did that for the last six years.

567
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:15,120
I'm being paranoid, right?

568
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:21,070
I know the cure for this.

569
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:24,240
All I need is for that man to open his eyes.

570
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,470
When I look into the eyes of that man...

571
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,970
I can tell all of his thoughts.

572
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,540
But now...

573
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,760
He is not showing me his eyes, not once.

574
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:03,070
I can see the reason why you're having such a hard time.

575
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,720
But nothing will happen to you, so don't worry.

576
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:12,730
No matter what happens to you, I will always be by your side, so don't worry.

577
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,690
Was there a time when I didn't?

578
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:22,200
 You asked me if I would come forward and be there for you if something happened to you? 

579
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,990
 Of course, I would. 

580
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,630
 Was there a time when I didn't? 

581
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,660
Jae Hyeon, I can't believe that I'm hearing that from you.

582
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,440
- But that's... 
- Don't cry in front of me like that! I...

583
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,270
It's a torture for me to see you like that.

584
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:05,190
So don't cry. Laugh. Laugh every day like you're crazy.

585
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,570
I'm going to turn everything around,

586
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:18,810
so all you have to do is just stand right there.

587
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:24,710
I'm going take care of everything, and I will run over to you.

588
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,770
Seriously.

589
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:39,130
Is he sleeping or is he passed out?

590
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:43,360
It doesn't matter since no matter what he does, he's just dislikable anyway.

591
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:47,720
Maybe I should've become a public servant since even Seok Tae can pull it off.

592
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,060
Don't think that you can become one just because Seok Tae pulled it off.

593
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,370
Then that means a miracle has to happen for you too.

594
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:56,030
Hey! I was smarter than Seok Tae in school, you know!

595
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:59,140
We would say that that's apples to apples.

596
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,160
I'm being serious.

597
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,460
   
- I mean it.

598
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,970
Her condition is more serious than I thought.

599
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:09,890
There is some kind of spirit lurking around in our neighborhood.

600
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,090
Man, this stupid bastard. I don't have much time.

601
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,230
What's up with his state?

602
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:19,380
There's no other choice.

603
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,030
Why?

604
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,960
- Oh my gosh!
- You scared me!

605
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:33,960
 At least he wasn't so drunk after all. 

606
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,680
 What a relief. 

607
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,150
Seok Tae, that's—

608
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:44,170
I was mistaken.

609
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,990
Hyungs and you girls! Thank you for everything. I will try to do better in the future.

610
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:50,510
- See you guys next time. 
 - Hey, hey, hey!

611
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,210
Your calf!

612
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:58,190
Why doesn't it work?

613
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,580
What in the world?

614
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,350
This neighborhood has some spirit lurking around. I'm sure of it.

615
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,610
Something is strange.

616
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:14,410
That's not Seok Tae's usual speed.

617
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:50,570
 Seok Tae! Seok Tae, you little bastard! 

618
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:53,710
 Seriously, exercise a bit. 

619
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,310
Ah, my hamstring!

620
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,160
Why isn't Ahjussi coming already?

621
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:21,150
 What the? What is Seok Tae's father doing over here? 

622
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:42,010
That was definitely Pil.

623
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:45,070
But this doesn't make sense though.

624
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,610
No way. I probably saw it wrong. I am sure of it.

625
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:03,990
But how was Jae Hyeon able to say what Pil said to me?

626
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:12,030
And how did Jae Hyeon know about what happened between Pil and me on the day of the accident?

627
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:34,910
 That man is so darn stubborn. 

628
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:38,840
 What did this bastard Seok Tae do wrong this time? 

629
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,490
You scared me!

630
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:55,750
Mister! No, that's not it... Father! What are you doing here?

631
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:59,630
Father? Are you really Seok Tae?

632
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,880
O-o-of course I am.

633
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,820
So you're Seok Tae?

634
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:12,320
What are you doing here, Seok Tae?

635
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,430
Ahjussi?

636
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:19,750
I'm Goo Gil's father. Who are you? Are you Seok Tae or Pil?

637
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,220
Ahjussi. Ahjussi, I'm Pil.

638
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:25,840
Ahjussi, we don't have much time. We must hurry.

639
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,790
This family, they're such fools. I was able to possess his body in just one take.

640
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:35,670
Then you should've told me earlier.

641
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:38,860
You didn't give me a chance to do that. So why were you constantly running away?

642
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,840
We just wasted our time. Let's hurry.

643
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,400
It'll be okay if we rush. You can put your body in here and get out of the hospital.

644
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,200
At this rate, we will miss the manhole.

645
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,990
Let's hurry it up.

646
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:51,220
The white blood cell count is—

647
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,590
What are you doing?

648
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:58,980
Pardon? It's... Just laundry.

649
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,940
Right now, at this hour?

650
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,590
- The patient has requested this.
 - That's right.

651
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:04,690
You mean this person did?

652
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:10,620
Oh no, not this person. His guardians, Mr. Bong Dal and Ms. Kkeut Soon.

653
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:13,100
- Just a moment then. 
 - Okay.

654
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:16,290
The blood test showed that his white blood cell count is normal.

655
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:18,860
- Excuse me.
 - Yes?

656
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,850
It's dirty, so I think I need to change it.

657
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:23,040
Please go.

658
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,190
Do you think we'll have enough time?

659
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,460
I think fifteen minutes will be enough if we catch a taxi.

660
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:28,930
Okay.

661
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:31,100
They're leaving. Leaving...

662
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,260
Work hard.

663
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,080
Hurry, hurry.

664
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:44,770
We created a commotion trying to stop the suspension of treatment but now we're suspending it.

665
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:46,930
The body will be able to last for a day even if we stop the treatment.

666
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:49,050
Oh yeah?

667
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:52,900
- Ahjussi, be gentle, please. It's my body.
- Okay, okay, okay.

668
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,930
- Ahjussi, be gentle please.
 - Alright, okay.

669
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,890
Okay.

670
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:12,610
Seok Tae! Mister! What are you two doing?

671
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,810
Soo Jin!

672
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:21,230
Soo Jin, I don't have much time. I have to hurry and leave.

673
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:23,960
Even if I told you, you won't be able to understand.

674
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,050
I do know...

675
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,330
You're Pil, right?

676
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:53,610
Are you... able to see me?

677
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,860
No...

678
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,320
I can feel you.

679
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:25,720


680
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:31,520
 Why am I standing here?
  

681
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:34,860
 Why are my pants down? 

682
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:47,660
♫  My feelings for you   ♫

683
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:54,260
♫  That I hid from you for so long might be all right  ♫

684
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:58,540
♫  Don't avoid it and show me your heart  ♫

685
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:04,770
♫  I hope that you will fall into my heart  ♫

686
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:07,300
   

687
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,830
 It seems like she's able to feel something. 

688
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:11,510
 What is this? Where are you? 

689
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:14,220
 - I feel like someone stole my body.
 - I don't think I would take it if someone offered it to me. 

690
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:16,810
 That wasn't Seok Tae. It was Pil. 

691
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:18,410
 I'm the one who's going crazy. 

692
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:22,060
 Soo Jin is constantly texting me now. She keeps on asking me if I'm Pil or not. 

693
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,690
 There's something strange going on. I'm sure of it. 

694
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:25,520
 I feel some kind of wicked energy lurking around! 

695
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,960
 Power of love. 

696
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,800
 There is no way to explain this! There's none. 

697
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,760
 What took you so lo— 

698
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,750
 I feel... I feel weird. 

699
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,530
 You are on the brink of death right now! 

700
01:02:35,530 --> 01:02:39,100
 I wonder where he was going take his body to.
