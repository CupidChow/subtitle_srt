1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,550
   

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,440


3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,360
♫  Look at the sky, the dazzling sky  ♫

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,640
♫  My cloud which contains your smile  ♫

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,440
♫  All right, this feeling which is gradually growing bigger  ♫

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,520
♫  Look at me girl, I can't hide it  ♫

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,700
♫  The smile which engulfs me all at once  ♫

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,200
♫  I'm so used to it, but I keep wondering  ♫

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,760
♫  Why would I be doing this  ♫

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,560
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,420
♫  I think of it throughout the day  ♫

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,000
♫  I've fallen in love  ♫

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,530
Wait a minute! Where did it go?

14
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,220
Oh, Soo Jin!

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,960
Oh, Jae Hyeon!

16
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,190
Wow Soo Jin, I get to see you here out of all places.

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,770
Do you go to this school?

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,450
Yes, I do.

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,190
Thank you.

20
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,030
How did you end up here in England, Jae Hyeon?

21
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,470
I'm traveling in England. I have a friend who goes to this school, so I came to see him.

22
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,280
Oh, is that right?

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,350
Either way, I'm so glad to see you.

24
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,340
I know, right?

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,450
I'm sorry but I have to go to class now.

26
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,500
You should hurry up and get going then.

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,210
Enjoy your vacation here and have a safe trip back home.

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,490
Will do.

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,860
Hey? Where is water? Come and bring me some water!

30
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,260
Hey, Officer Shin. Punk, do you know the bitterness of life, huh?!

31
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,310
Man, you're at it again.

32
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,200
What the heck are you doing?

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,370
   

34
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,960
What are you doing? Please let go of me!

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,570
Where is this place?

36
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,970
What do you mean where? This is the police station.

37
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,700
Hey there, Officer! This man-

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,170
Try to stop this man.

39
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,670
Hey punk, are you allowed to sleep while on duty, huh?

40
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,870
- Please stop.
- Let go of him!

41
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,270
You always end up here every early morning! Hurry up and go on home!

42
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,630
I don't want to go home. I don't want to go home because of my scary wife.

43
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,020
I'm going to sleep here instead.

44
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,530
What the heck?

45
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,110
I'm a cop now?

46
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,650
Gosh, every early morning he does this.

47
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,250
Officer Bong, it hasn't been a while since you were assigned to this station, so it must be a little crazy, huh?

48
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,540
I've been doing this for thirty years, yet I'm still not used to it.

49
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,940
Excuse me, but what year is this?

50
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,920
Hey, quit that. You're too handsome to be joking around.

51
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,370
Dude, it's 2018 right now.

52
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,200
2018? You said it's 2018?!

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,520
Are you still half asleep?! Why are you acting this way?

54
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,200
Let's go out and do some patrolling.

55
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,040
Go out and prepare while I go get my jacket. Hurry it up.

56
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,110
2018...

57
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,980
   

58
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,900
   

59
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,940
What's going on here?

60
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,530
I'm supposed to go back to the past this time, but  why did I come to the future?

61
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,940
 Huh?! 

62
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,970
 Hey! What the! 

63
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,980
 What are you doing right now?! 

64
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,970
Yeah, that's right.

65
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,400
I was swept away by the manhole even though it wasn't even midnight yet.

66
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,190
This never happened before too.

67
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,390
How in the world did this happen?

68
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,610
- What are you doing? 
- Pardon?

69
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,050
As a person that has eaten more than you have and has lived more years than you have,

70
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,570
I would like to tell you that this is a bit wrong...

71
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,190
What's the problem?

72
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,950
Should I drive? I'll just do it.

73
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,190
Ah, driving. S-sorry, I'll do it. I will.

74
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,240
I'm older so I'll just drive safely.

75
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,550
I'll do it.

76
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,310
Would you?

77
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,560
Oh my.

78
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,600
Grandma, I will help you.

79
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,250
But I'm done.

80
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,640
It's okay, it's okay.

81
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,480
Thank you. I can push it.

82
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,240
- Where are you going to? 
- I'm going over that way.

83
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,290
Oh my.

84
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,590
- Alrighty, it's heavy so be careful.  
- Okay. Thank you.

85
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,170
Be safe now!

86
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,620
Man, this neighborhood was such a good place to live way back in the day.

87
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,100
Why? Is there a problem with this neighborhood now?

88
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,050
Man, why are you acting like you don't know?

89
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,300
Because of the assault cases that's been happening late at night in this neighborhood,

90
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,380
people here don't want to come outside once the sun goes down.

91
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,070
Whoever it is, if I catch him I'm going to take his face and...

92
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,890
 Please confirm the location please. 

93
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,510
Yes, Haeyo-dong Station 1 is patrolling right now.

94
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,470
 Samho Villa #101, 21st Street, in Haeyo-dong. 

95
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,520
 Please confirm the resident applicable to this address. 

96
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,530
Patrol car #11 dispatching, over.

97
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,690
You heard, right? Let's go over to 21st Street in Haeyo-dong.

98
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,810
It's over there.

99
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,780
Hurry up and come this way.

100
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,140
Hurry up please. It's right over this way.

101
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,310
Hurry up please. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

102
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,710
- This way. 
- This way. Here. This one.

103
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,440
We came from the police station. Please open the door!

104
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,590
That's no use. I knocked on the door since a few days ago, but there's no answer.

105
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,470
Are you sure that there's an actual person in there? They could have left the house empty for a few days.

106
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,120
I checked the CCTV too.

107
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,310
I'm telling you that I haven't seen this resident come out of there for a month now.

108
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,970
I decided to contact you because I was scared that a dead body might be lying there at this rate.

109
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,750
I guess I just have to pop the door open and get in there.

110
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,910
Officer Bong, call the locksmith.

111
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,430
Pardon?

112
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,570
But I don't know the phone number for the locksmith though.

113
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,520
Gosh, you're really...

114
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,030
I begged you to save it onto your phone. But you already forgot about it?

115
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,180
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,250
Hello, this is Officer Choi from Bora Station.

117
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,580
I think I might need your help. This is Samho Villa #101.

118
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,150
- It's open now.
 - Thank you very much.

119
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,020
We are from the police station! So please excuse us!

120
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,460
- Why is it so dark? Officer Bong, go over there and open up the curtain.
 -  Okay.

121
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,470
Wow, it stinks in here.

122
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,460
I'm barely getting used to the fact that I've become a cop.

123
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,390
And now I'm over here at the scene of an incident. It's so darn spectacular.

124
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,080
So spectacular indeed.

125
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,360
O-officer, it's over here.

126
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,140
Excuse me! Excuse me, are you alright?

127
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,200
I will call 119 right away.

128
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,870
Hello there. The address here is Samho Villa #101, 21st Street in Haeyo-dong.

129
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,640
There's a person that's passed out here. Please come quickly.

130
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,910
Yes, yes, yes.

131
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,990
  Is no one supposed to see us? 

132
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,820
 Well, it's nothing like that, but... 

133
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,910
 Hey! 

134
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,740
 Honey, do you know this person? 

135
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,980
 No, I don't. 

136
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,800
 Yes, it's her. It's that girl who was dating that pharmacist punk. 

137
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,870
It looks like  she passed out due to malnutrition and anemia.

138
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,770
It's not so severe though.

139
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,050
She'll wake up once the IV kicks in.

140
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,350
That's a relief.

141
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,650
But more importantly, you were saying that the patient didn't leave the house for about a month?

142
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,360
Yes, we were put on dispatch because a neighbor reported the incident.

143
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,800
It seems like there is a problem with this patient if she didn't eat or leave the house.

144
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,100
It will be good for the patient to go talk to a psychiatrist once she recovers.

145
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,740
I understand. We'll do as you instructed.

146
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,540
Alright, then.

147
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,210
I will go contact our station, so you stay here and watch her for a bit.

148
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,300
Okay.

149
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,350
How did this woman end up like this?

150
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,260
There were pictures of her and that pharmacist punk in her house.

151
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,520
So it seems like they're still seeing each other.

152
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,410
What exactly is going on?

153
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,600
Excuse me. Are you awake?

154
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,010
Where am I?

155
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,500
This is the hospital. I'm a police officer at the local police station.

156
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,110
There was a request to confirm your residency from your neighbor, so we were dispatched.

157
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,830
We found you unconscious.

158
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,490
I see.

159
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,070
But... I heard that you haven't left your house in a month.

160
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,190
Did something happen?

161
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,310
No. Nothing happened.

162
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,030
I just didn't want to go out, so I didn't.

163
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,490
Excuse me, you know Park Jae Hyeon, right?

164
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,650
How do you know Jae Hyeon?

165
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:16,450
I know him personally, a little.

166
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,570
But... from what I know, you two were dating since a while ago.

167
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,180
Perhaps... are you still dating now?

168
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,340
Excuse me, if you know Jae Hyeon, can you contact him for me?

169
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,240
Tell him that I'm in the hospital.

170
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,100
Jae Hyeon won't meet with me.

171
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,260
When I'm having a hard time because of Jae Hyeon...

172
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,450
So please contact him for me, okay?

173
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,080
If you tell him that I'm in the hospital, he might be worried and come.

174
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,320
What's going on?

175
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,140
Nothing. The patient is awake.

176
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,600
Are you okay?

177
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,090
You can leave work now. I'll take care of the rest.

178
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,040
Okay.

179
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,490
When I saw her then, she was fine. When did she become like that?

180
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:27,680
The pharmacist and she seem to be broken up, so perhaps he's dating Soo Jin.

181
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,890
No. No. Soo Jin is studying abroad. That can't be the case.

182
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,680
It's that pharmacist punk.

183
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,300
What? Why is that punk going to Soo Jin's house?

184
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,620
It's been a while since we've come together for tea like this. This is so great.

185
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,170
Seriously. I think  we've been out of touch for too long.

186
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,250
Let's have tea time often from now on.

187
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,810
Okay. Contact me at any time.

188
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,670
By the way, you said there's something you wanted to say.

189
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,550
Ah, it's not a big deal, but if you two are okay with it,

190
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,570
we were wondering if you would like to travel with us.

191
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,370
Oh my, that would be great.

192
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,720
It happens to be about the time when the leaves are changing colors for us to go see.

193
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,410
No, not traveling domestically but traveling abroad.

194
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,850
Recently, I've been watching home shopping channels. There are a lot of cheap but nice deals.

195
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,870
Oh, abroad?

196
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,910
Isn't going abroad expensive?

197
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,310
Isn't Pil making money? Ask him to send you.

198
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,370
We're also not using our own money to travel.

199
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,870
Then? Who's sending you?

200
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,730
It's obvious, of course. Who would send us?

201
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,050
Father-in-law, Mother-in-law, I'm here.

202
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,850
Jae Hyeon, you're here.

203
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,570
Hello. You're here too.

204
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,300
- Yes. 
 - Yes, nice to see you.

205
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,740
Come sit here.

206
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,280
You're sending us on a vacation abroad,

207
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,490
so I was in the middle of telling Pil's parents that they should come with us.

208
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,720
Is that so? It'd be good for you to go together so that you won't get lonely.

209
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,620
Oh my, what is that?

210
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,020
Oh this? I brought some vitamins for you two.

211
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,650
I added enough vitamins and iron supplements, so make sure to take them.

212
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:35,180
This guy! There's still a lot left from what you brought over last time.

213
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,940
Why are you always bringing them?

214
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,550
Yes, we're overwhelmed.

215
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:46,070
I mean, we tell him not to do things like this over and over, yet he does.

216
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,770
It's so hot.

217
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,760
Hey!

218
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,770
Father, Mom, why are you here?

219
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,390
We came to play. If you got off work, you should have gone home. Why did you come here?

220
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,120
No... I saw this guy suddenly come in here.

221
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,700
Who are you— who are you to sit here?

222
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,230
T-this child! Pil, what's so weird about a son-in-law visiting his in-laws?

223
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,790
You're so weird.

224
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,330
What did you just say? In-law?

225
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,890
Who? This punk?

226
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,460
What do you mean "this punk"? Pil, why are you so rude to Son-in-law Park?

227
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,190
What's with him? Honey, hurry and take Pil away.

228
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,130
- Gosh, why is he like this? 
- I apologize on behalf of him.

229
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,480
- Okay. 
- Son-in-law Park... Son-in-law Park?

230
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,520
- Why are you like this? 
- Get a hold of yourself!

231
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,630
Did he drink? Pil is getting weirder day by day.

232
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,480
Seriously. When will he act his age?

233
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,260
Son-in-law Park, don't mind him.

234
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,410
Okay.

235
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,210
Gosh, really. You must be crazy!

236
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,090
Because of you, I can't live because I feel embarrassed.

237
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,300
Did you drink a soju pack at a convenience store on your way home?

238
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,930
No. I'm very clear-headed.

239
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,970
But why are you all saying weird things?

240
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,750
Didn't Soo Jin go study abroad? How could someone studying abroad get married?

241
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,970
Gosh, this child. Soo Jin has been back from studying abroad and got married a while ago! What are you saying?

242
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,470
Looks like you didn't drink just a little alcohol.

243
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,590
- Hey, go to your room and sleep. 
 - No.

244
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,680
Until I confirm this with my own eyes, I absolutely won't believe it.

245
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,000
Hey! Hey! Oh, honey!

246
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,070
Honey, did I really give birth to him?

247
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,740
I have my doubts sometimes too.

248
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,560
- Excuse me. 
 - What is it?

249
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,570
Oh, aren't you Soo Jin's friend?

250
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,130
Yes. Soo Jin went to study abroad, right?

251
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:56,290
Gosh, study abroad? It's been a while since she has gotten married and quit her job.

252
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,800
You're her friend, but you didn't even know?

253
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,760
You got off work?

254
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,990
Hyung, did you know about Soo Jin getting married?

255
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,830
What are you talking about? Soo Jin's been married for almost a year.

256
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,110
It's already been a year?

257
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:30,600
No, Soo Jin said she was going to study abroad. So how could she have gotten married without me knowing?

258
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,460
Stop scaring me. What's with you?

259
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,990
You caused a ruckus when they were delivering Soo Jin's wedding gifts. What's with you?

260
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,970
 Why? 

261
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,530
 You're too damn loud! 

262
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,270
 You cheap multi room like jerk! 

263
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,090
 Oh! He's woken up. He woke up. He woke up. 

264
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,880
 Hey, are you awake now? 

265
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,970
 I'm giving it to you now, since you didn't get one. 

266
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,880
   

267
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,150
Hyung, was I ever punched by the pharmacist?

268
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,120
Yes, you were beaten up quite badly by Jae Hyeon,

269
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,060
so I was the one who carried you to Jin Sook's rooftop place.

270
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:22,030
 Then... it's a year after I first went through the manhole. 

271
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,220
 This isn't part of the time travel. This is actual present time. 

272
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,540
Officer.

273
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,410
What's with you? Gosh, seriously.

274
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,570
Hey, you must not have had enough sleep. Hurry and go home to sleep.

275
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,790
   

276
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,990
Oh, who is it?

277
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,570
- Why did you come here?
 - Hello!

278
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,880
Welcome!

279
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,650
- Yo, Kang! 
 - Surprise!

280
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,460
We came to have morning juice with you.

281
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,250
What are you doing?

282
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,050
I'm making lunch for my husband.

283
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:30,740
Hey! Don't touch it. You guys can eat fruit.

284
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,510
But you guys haven't been to my house in a long time.

285
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,030
Jin Sook and I are running businesses, so we're very busy.

286
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,180
Well, more accurately speaking, it's just Jin Sook who's busy.

287
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:45,170
Gosh, I gave you a good spot and the truck, but you're not able to run it?

288
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,860
That's what I mean. I trusted you and took over, but I'm not sure why I can't succeed.

289
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,730
But I can still vouch for the taste of the juice, so take a glass.

290
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,870
- Wow.
- Cheers!

291
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,800
 What are you talking about? Soo Jin's been married for almost a year. 

292
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,010
Jeong Ae, you're still not able to reach Dal Soo?

293
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,930
Hey, let's stop. If we continue on, it'll just ruin the mood.

294
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,340
Alright.

295
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,650
How are you these days, Sook?

296
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,300
I've never imagined that you two would be dating.

297
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,980
Yeah, I'm curious too. What do you like about him so much?

298
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,600
I really don't know what I like about him, but sometimes you never know what the future holds.

299
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,160
This is Soo Jin's place, so let's stop talking about that. How are you and Jae Hyeon doing?

300
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,750
Just by watching you, I can tell that you two are a sweet couple.

301
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,200
Look at you making packed lunches like this. You're so devoted.

302
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,560
You know, I'm always so happy.

303
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,780
Goosebumps all over!

304
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,140
Oh my, it's already noon! Don't you guys need to go open  up your shops?

305
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,490
Oh, that's right.  It's already noon.

306
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,740
Let's get going. Let's go!

307
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,710
- You guys go work hard, okay? 
- Okay.

308
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,280
- Go enjoy your lunch.
 - Okay.

309
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,780
- Let's see each other at Bongbong Pub Cafe later, okay? 
 - I'll be on time.

310
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,880
- Bye! 
- Work hard!

311
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,710
What's the problem today?

312
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:09,010
I'm dying here because my eyes have been blurry and teary too.

313
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,810
Are you still feeling that way even after using the eye drop that I prescribed for you?

314
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,980
Well, I thought it was getting better but it's happening again.

315
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,640
I'll make you an appointment with an optometrist nearby instead of prescribing you an eye drop. You have to go there, okay?

316
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,100
I would be so grateful if you did that for me.

317
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,770
Dr. Park, my knees have been  constantly sore every night.

318
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,010
What should  I do about that?

319
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:35,290
I'll give you some warm massage packs, so starting tonight, make sure to use them before sleeping.

320
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,390
- Okay. 
- You shouldn't go hiking too much either.

321
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:43,580
Hey, Soo Jin.

322
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,220
Ta-da!

323
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,540
What? Did you make all of this yourself?

324
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,540
You told me that you're sick of eating out every day.

325
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,150
It's been a while, but I decided to show off my cooking skills.

326
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,570
Wow, it looks delicious.

327
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,890
So good!

328
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,980
Try this one too. Say ah!

329
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,090
Oh yeah, I went over to your parents' and I ran into Pil there.

330
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,910
- Pil?
 - Yep.

331
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:28,770
He must have drunk because he came in and said all these weird things.

332
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,350
I guess he's still having a hard time believing that we're married.

333
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,990
He told me that he couldn't believe that we got married.

334
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,700
Man, that Pil. I bet you felt so uncomfortable around him.

335
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,820
He looked drunk so I should just understand him.

336
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,930
Eat a lot. Do you want some of this too?

337
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,930
I wonder how it all ended up this way.

338
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,050
You know, Jae Hyeon...

339
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:19,580
I want to do photography work again, so I am wondering if I can open up my studio.

340
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,580
But it hasn't been long since you took a break.

341
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,150
You worked hard until now, so isn't it okay to take a longer break?

342
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,290
But I  don't think I'm the type to just do housework.

343
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,280
I've been itching to get back to work again.

344
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,380
Oh, yeah?  Let's take some time to think about it then.

345
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,200
Okay. Oh, you didn't forget that we are meeting with the friends later on, right?

346
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,910
Yep, I will go over there as soon as I close up the pharmacy.

347
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,710
- Are you okay? 
- I think I ate too much.

348
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,250
Let me go get us something to drink.

349
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,790
I have a friend who has a juice truck around the corner from here.

350
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,500
Take your time eating.

351
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,040
Hey, Bong Pil!

352
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,550
What are you doing over here?

353
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,260
Oh, I just got off work so I was on my way home.

354
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,710
By the way, I heard that you came over to my house and said some weird things this morning.

355
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:30,080
Well, that is... I'm sorry. I think I just lost my mind for a bit.

356
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,560
You should quit drinking. If you don't, you're going to ruin your body.

357
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:41,960
Soo Jin, is it true that you're really married?

358
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,260
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

359
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,300
It's just that... I have a hard time believing it, that's all.

360
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,590
You still aren't sober yet.

361
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,680
Hurry up and go home so you can get some sleep. I'll see you later on at Bongbong Pub Cafe.

362
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,160
You do know that we are all meeting up today, right?

363
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,110
Oh... yeah... I got it.

364
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,580
Okay, I'll see you then.

365
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,450
How do your tense shoulders feel now?

366
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,690
I feel so much better after your massage.

367
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,050
Maybe it's because you were stressing out so much because of Pil earlier.

368
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,340
Whenever I think of Pil, I feel so upset that I'm going to die.

369
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:38,190
I guess he keeps on thinking about Soo Jin everytime he drinks.

370
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,940
How can he cut off the love he's had for her for 28 years all at once?

371
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,550
We just have to leave it up to time.

372
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:47,480
I feel so jealous every time Soo Jin's mom brags about her son-in-law.

373
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,120
I also feel so upset seeing Pil without anyone.

374
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,280
Then what are you planning to do?

375
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,340
These are the ladies that are potential marriage partners for Pil.

376
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,850
Wow.

377
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:09,080
What do you think about this girl? Don't her pretty eyes make her look like a nice person?

378
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,950
I kind of like this girl or perhaps even this girl over here.

379
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,880
She looks like she has a nice countenance with her lips' corners up.

380
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,090
That's true. I like all of the ladies here, but I can't have all of them as my daughters-in-law though.

381
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,750
It doesn't matter if we like it or not when Pil doesn't really want to go on an arranged date.

382
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,280
Don't you think he'll change his mind once he sees them?

383
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,550
These ladies are good looking enough to not lack anything when comparing them to Soo Jin.

384
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:39,860
That's true. We have nothing to lose, so why don't we push it through once?

385
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,420
I'll go up and get some rest now.

386
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,850
Can't believe Soo Jin is married now.

387
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,110
I guess it couldn't be stopped in the end.

388
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,310
Pil, take a look at this for a bit before you go to sleep, even if you're tired.

389
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,800
What do you think about this girl?  This girl's ideal type is a cop too.

390
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,500
Just by looking at her, I can tell that she would look good with you.

391
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,490
I don't want to go on a date, Mom.

392
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:52,510
Stop being like this and take a look at this photo. She's so pretty that she looks better than a celebrity.

393
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:57,280
Forget it. I just want to live single for the rest of my life.

394
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,550
How long are you going to think about Soo Jin nonstop and live like this?!

395
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,470
Your friends all have mates and are happy.

396
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,480
Are you going to spend your days like the only ugly ducking in the lake does?!

397
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,350
Yes! I will just live  becoming the only ugly duckling in the lake forever.

398
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,610
Jin Sook got so much business, but what's wrong with me?

399
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:31,910
I wonder if I should go pass out some flyers.

400
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,350
- Oh, you're here. 
- Did your sales go up?

401
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,860
Three cups.

402
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,690
Give me a cold cup of juice.

403
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,440
You're the one who bought those three cups of juice!

404
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,650
Stop drinking! If you drink too much, you'll get a stomach ache.

405
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:55,080
I'm going to get a stomach ache?

406
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,290
I'm still fine. Give me once more.

407
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,170
We are going to be meeting up with the friends tonight. You're going, right?

408
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,400
I don't know if I should go or not.

409
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,650
Why?! Are you afraid that Dal Soo will be there?

410
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:15,030
I told you not to talk about him.

411
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,160
Dal Soo's not going to be there.

412
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,140
He's a nobleman now, so how can he come to a place like that?

413
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,490
You should go, okay? You should go, please.

414
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,820
I don't know.

415
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,540
I said you should go!

416
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,930
Yes, come in.

417
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:49,410
Director, this is the budget proposal for next year.

418
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,790
Please take a look at it for approval.

419
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,900
But you should look at the content at least.

420
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:04,160
My brother is the CEO, so I'm sure he'll take care of all the details.

421
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,250
Okay then, I will process it as it is.

422
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:25,260
Why is life so boring?

423
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,480
I'm so sick of it.

424
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,630
   

425
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,060
   

426
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,970
How can I go there?

427
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:46,130
♫  Under heaven in another world  ♫

428
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:51,770
♫  After I sit on a blue park bench  ♫

429
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:55,190
Hello, this is the civil engineering department for sewer management.

430
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:59,240
Yes. Oh, so your drainpipe is clogged up?

431
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,520
May I get your exact address please?

432
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,940
Yes, okay.

433
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,420
Alright.

434
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,020
Okay, I will send a worker out there to take care of your problem.

435
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,000
Yes, okay.

436
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,330
I guess Hyung Dal Soo is not coming again since he hasn't replied yet.

437
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:29,300
   

438
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,500
- Excuse me. 
- Yes, sir.

439
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,320
- Please bring me another bottle of sake over here. 
 - Another bottle of sake? Coming right up.

440
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,390
- Na Yeon.
- Yes.

441
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:38,210
Please bring another bottle of sake and a complimentary plate for this table over here.

442
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,510
Your friend has been here since earlier, Boss.

443
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,240
Yes. I got it.

444
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,600
Seok Tae buddy.

445
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,280
When did you get here? You should've told me that you were here.

446
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,030
I didn't want to distract you from your work.

447
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,790
Wow Jin Sook, you're so full of charisma ever since you became a CEO.

448
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,600
Am I now?

449
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,640
You're so cool. You totally made my heart shake because of your charisma.

450
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,060
You're so cute.

451
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,350
Jin Sook, your leg hurts, right? Do you want me to massage them?

452
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,870
Over here?

453
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:13,900
There are many eyes here so I will just accept the intention.

454
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,460
My Jin Sook, I'm so proud of you for successfully becoming a founder of this new business.

455
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,490
You're so beautiful. Very praise worthy.

456
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,550
Thank you so much.

457
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh, that's right. Is Oppa Dal Soo coming tonight?

458
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,060
I'm not sure. I don't think he's coming. I texted him but there's no reply.

459
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,750
Oh yeah? He's being too much.

460
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,460
He got along so well with Jeong Ae too.

461
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,130
Seok Tae buddy, wait here for a bit.  Once I wrap everything up, let's go together.

462
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,810
Sure thing.

463
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,940
Hey, eat this.

464
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,270
You're so good at eating.

465
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,770
Thank you.

466
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,080
They always meet up so persistently.

467
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,090
I know right? I thought they would stop meeting up after Soo Jin got married.

468
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,330
Habits are hard to break.

469
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:15,990
It's not easy to stop meeting up when they've been doing it for many years.

470
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,190
It would be nice if they ordered a lot of the appetizers.

471
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,570
They only order one side of seasoned shellfish and that's it.

472
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:25,150
Boss, 500 cc of beer and a side of seasoned shellfish please.

473
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,040
Ah, yes...

474
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,580
Didn't I tell you that habits are hard to break? So frustrating.

475
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:42,180
   

476
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,460
Cheers!

477
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,130
Let's drink up!

478
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,500
Oh, you're here!

479
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,600
Scratch me right there. A little bit lower.

480
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,300
What? Why are you looking at me that way?

481
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,820
Jin Sook, why are you being so sweet to Seok Tae?

482
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,300
Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?

483
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,600
They always do that to each other whenever they meet.

484
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,710
Man, whenever I see you,  you're acting strangely today.

485
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,470
Are you two going out by any chance?

486
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,210
Hey, what are you talking about?

487
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,780
Jin Sook and I have been dating for 361 days now.

488
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,510
It will be exactly one year after four more days, okay?

489
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,320
My goodness.

490
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,440
Hey Seok Tae, something seems a little different about you now.

491
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,960
You're all dressed up in a nice suit and all.

492
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,470
I must have the look of a dignified civil servant of this city.

493
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,020
- Am I right, Jin Sook? 
- Yep.

494
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,740
Do I look handsome?

495
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:08,180
You became a civil servant, too. Congratulations man. You're a success now.

496
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,550
Are you mocking me? Are you now?!

497
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:14,680
I got the acceptance notice three days before you did! I'm your senior!

498
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,340
You were so bad at your studies too. You look like a dummy anyway.

499
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,210
Congratulations.

500
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,610
 Why did so much change in just one year? 

501
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,650
 I'm seriously having a hard time adjusting to this. 

502
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,130
Oh, Soo Jin!

503
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,980
Sorry, we're a bit late.

504
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,860
Nice to see you all. Pil, long time no see.

505
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,100
Hey, come here and have a seat. Jae Hyeon, you too, please come and have a seat.

506
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,720
Sure.

507
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,070
- Let me go bring a chair. 
- Okay.

508
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:43,010
Wow, you look pretty today.

509
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,970
Did you talk to him about the studio?

510
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,280
No, I didn't get his approval. He doesn't like me...

511
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,480
 You're the one that I can't adjust to the most. 

512
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,700
Back there.

513
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,560
Right there.

514
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:10,420
♫  I know.&nbsp;I said perhaps I should let you go  ♫

515
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,700
Cheers since a long time ago!

516
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:17,010
Cheers!

517
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,370
- Drink only a little bit.
 - Just one glass.

518
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,060
♫  It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.  ♫

519
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,670
I wonder how Jae Hyoen is so sweet to Soo Jin?

520
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,780
I want to be loved by my husband when I get married later.

521
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,200
I know, me too. Jeong Ae, how was business today?

522
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,070
Let me tell you, nothing but swarming flies.

523
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,680
You should do some consulting for me one of these days.

524
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,610
When it comes to business, we can count on our CEO Ms. Yoon Jin Sook.

525
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,970
Okay, deal. Let me transfer all of my know-how to you.

526
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,970
But you have to hook me up with free juices for the rest of my life.

527
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,380
Okay, girl.

528
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,470
♫  If you  ♫

529
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:55,250
But I wonder if Hyung Dal Soo is not going to show up at all today?

530
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,330
Hey! Would he show up here if he had a lick of conscience?!

531
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:01,390
He abandoned us family in a day and left this neighborhood.

532
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,270
So what right does he have to show his face here?

533
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:09,840
Oppa! But still, he is probably a director by now, since he went to work for his father's company.

534
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,990
Then he can just show his awesome self in front of us. Don't you think so?

535
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,020
Why do you think he went to work at his father's company?

536
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:20,130
He got sick and tired of cosplaying and living the poor life of a commoner, that's all!

537
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,110
And you think that he'll show his face again after that?

538
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,980
I bet everything I have on him not showing up here!

539
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,310
Let's stop talking about Dal Soo now.

540
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,230
Yeah, let's do that!

541
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,440
Cheers!

542
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,980
Seriously, stop  talking about Dal Soo anymore!

543
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,900
Can't be talking about someone who's not here.

544
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,900
♫  I can't do anything more for you  ♫

545
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,230
Let's drink, let's drink.

546
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,150
Hey, pass me some of that.

547
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,580
♫  Don't go. Don't go. Don't go.  ♫

548
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,920
♫  I see you nodding your head but  ♫

549
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:07,110
♫  You are just going one and two steps farther away  ♫

550
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:19,030
♫  With you, I guess I was too young then  ♫

551
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:26,000
♫  If you, if only you  ♫

552
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,780
By the way, I thought about something.

553
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,220
Soo Jin's wedding was the turning point to all of our lives.

554
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,050
Pil and Seok Tae have passed the civil service exam.

555
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,010
And Jeong Ae is running the juice truck.

556
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,730
I became a founder of my business and became a CEO.

557
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,260
And Oppa...

558
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,590
What did I do?

559
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,360
I think that's so true actually.

560
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,340
Soo Jin's marriage has brought us all  good fortune.

561
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:54,050
Because of that we're able to go out like this too, isn't that right?

562
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,710
But I wonder why that fortune didn't come to me though.

563
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,090
What's wrong with owning a pool hall?

564
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,440
As long as you're able to make a living... You're making a lot of money.

565
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,120
Thanks, Jeong Ae. You're such a big comfort to me.

566
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,560
You don't need to be so touched though.

567
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:19,170
Pil, I would like to apologize to you since you're here.

568
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,430
There was a minor happening before our wedding.

569
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:25,570
I was a bit rash at the time.

570
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,880
He deserved to be beaten 100%.

571
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,480
Should I say that his friendship went way out of line? You don't have to apologize to him.

572
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,080
No, I should still apologize for that.

573
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,690
I'm truly sorry for what I did.

574
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:46,610
Jae Hyeon seems to have a great character too.

575
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,290
It was just a minor happening, that's all.

576
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:55,910
Bong Pil, you should get over that too now.

577
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:00,100
Are you dating anybody right now, Pil?

578
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,360
Why are you curious about that anyway?

579
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,520
It's because everyone else here has someone by their side,

580
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,680
so I thought you might be lonely.

581
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,900
I'm not all that lonely really.

582
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,540
I don't think you need to worry about me.

583
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,880
There should be a fateful someone for you out there. Just like me and Seok Tae here.

584
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,940
Hey, you two are not really a fateful couple compared to Jae Hyeon and Soo Jin here.

585
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,590
Look at those two who went to England to study abroad and met each other coincidentally then got married.

586
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:38,630
That, I must say, is truly destiny. I'm so envious.

587
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,480
- Soo Jin.
 - Huh?

588
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,180
Did you two meet in England while studying abroad?

589
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:49,950
Yep. Even when I think about it, now it's pretty amazing. Isn't that right?

590
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,280
 Wait a minute! Where did it go? 

591
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,790
 Oh, Soo Jin! 

592
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,680
 Oh, Jae Hyeon! 

593
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,870
 Soo Jin! 

594
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,550
 Oh, Jae Hyeon! 

595
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,700
 Good to see you again. 

596
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,460
 What's going on? How did  you know that  I was here? 

597
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,930
 I know, right? 

598
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,590
  Since we are constantly seeing each other like this, 

599
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:32,670
 I think it's someone's will for us to go out on a date? 

600
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:38,870
 Say, would you like to go have dinner with me tonight? 

601
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,940
 Yeah, I'd like to. 

602
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:46,030
I knew it then that there was such a thing as destiny.

603
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,240
It's like reading one of those novels. So romantic.

604
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,470
 Oh! Are you two coming back from somewhere? 

605
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,440
 Jae Hyeon. We just came back from marriage-related shopping. 

606
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,330
 I sincerely congratulate you on your wedding. 

607
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,000
 Thank you.
    

608
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,560
I never believed in such a thing as destiny,

609
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,460
but I started believing in it ever since I met Soo Jin.

610
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,810
Hold on please.

611
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,140
Yes, hello.

612
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,630
I'll move the car right away.

613
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:24,230
- Let me go pull the car out. 
- Okay.

614
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,830
- Hey!
 - I heard that steak is really good over there.

615
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:28,310
Steak? Isn't that place famous for fish and chips?

616
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:31,040
- I don't know.
- Steak is really good anyway.

617
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,170
Is it delicious?

618
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:36,210
Where are you going?!

619
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,890
What are you doing out here, Pil?

620
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:45,830
I felt all stuffy inside so I came out to get some fresh air.

621
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:50,450
I feel like Soo Jin's friends are all nice people.

622
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:54,210
Would it  also be okay for me to be part of this meeting and come by often as well?

623
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,280
Meeting up with Soo Jin in England wasn't a coincidence, right?

624
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,230
Pardon? What are you...?

625
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:09,030
I feel like you approached her on purpose.

626
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:12,760
You knew that Soo Jin was going to go study abroad.

627
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,230
So you followed her on purpose.

628
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,510
Pil, you're an interesting guy.

629
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:25,180
How can you come up with such things?

630
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,580
I guess you don't want to believe that Soo Jin and I are destined to be together.

631
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,130
And I  understand that you liked Soo Jin a lot in the past.

632
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:37,580
But it would be nice if you draw the line to a degree, since Soo Jin is a married woman now.

633
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,950
That depends on you.

634
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,200
What do you mean by that?

635
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,340
Such a witty guy.

636
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,530
Oh, wait a minute. Where did Jae Hyeon go?

637
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,170
He went to go pull out his car, but I guess he's still outside.

638
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,690
Oh, Pil isn't around either.

639
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,900
It looked like he was leaving along with Jae Hyeon earlier.

640
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,750
I guess they are talking man-to-man or something.

641
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:11,280
When guys usually fight with each other, they become good friends and stuff.

642
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,870
Just leave them be so they can become close friends.

643
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,540
Cheers!

644
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:21,530
That sounds like if I'm not good to Soo Jin,

645
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,670
you'll take my spot away.

646
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,380
Oh, so that's how it sounded to you?

647
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,990
But I didn't mean it that way though.

648
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:37,300
I really don't want to have this kind of emotional battle with you, Pil, so let's go back in.

649
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,770
When did you break up with Park Yeong Joo?

650
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,950
I happened to go to Ms. Park's house because of work.

651
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,080
And she looked like she was having a hard time mentally.

652
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:58,220
It seemed like the reason behind it was you.

653
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,890
We already broke up so she should try to get up on her own.

654
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:05,840
Do I have to be responsible for her even after we already broke up?

655
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,900
Even when a couple breaks up, there is such a thing called common courtesy.

656
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,880
But I can't help but to think that woman is having a hard time because you didn't wrap up the relationship properly.

657
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,580
How dare you say that when you don't know anything about me?!!!

658
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,540
Don't you know how hard it was for me after I broke up with her?!!

659
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,750
She was obsessively spying on me and stalked me wherever I went.

660
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:29,400
I'm the victim here so why do I have to hear shit like that from a guy like you?

661
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:39,220
You probably know this since you saw Yeong Joo today. She has mental issues.

662
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:44,540
So how can you blindly believe the words she said and question me? I don't believe this.

663
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:50,120
I don't know why but no matter what you say

664
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,200
I just can't believe it.

665
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,430
The you that I know looked so innocent as a lamb

666
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:00,640
but behind the scenes you were always doing something else.

667
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,290
Look here, Mr. Bong Pil.

668
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,780
Stop it right there, Jae Hyeon!

669
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,560
Pil, how could you talk to him like that?

670
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,300
How could you say that when you know nothing about Jae Hyeon?

671
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,470
Stop it, just forget about it.

672
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:23,860
I'm leaving now. You come home once you're done.

673
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:27,590
Jae Hyeon! Jae Hyeon!

674
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,820
Jae Hyeon!

675
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,040
Jae Hyeon! Oh, Jae Hyeon..

676
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,090
Why are you leaving like this?

677
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:39,700
Why are you following me when I told you to come home later.

678
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,090
You are very upset because of Pil. right?

679
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:44,080
I will apologize for him.

680
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48,040
Who is Pil to you so that you apologize for him?

681
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:54,110
Huh? Because he is my friend...

682
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:57,450
Why in the world are you going to that meeting anyway?

683
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,640
What do you mean by that?

684
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,980
Be honest with me. Is your purpose for going there really about seeing your friends?

685
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,560
Or is it because there is someone that you really  want to see?

686
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,210
What do you mean by someone that I really want to see?

687
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,510
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

688
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,990
Nothing, forget it.

689
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:24,270
If you can help it, try not to go to that meeting next time around.

690
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,340
Even if you do happen to go, just go by yourself.

691
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,200
Meeting with your friends tires me out.

692
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,690
Jae Hyeon.

693
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,480
Jae Hyeon. Jae Hyeon.

694
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,570
No...

695
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:09,470
   

696
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,540
 You dropped this. 

697
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,450
 I'm trying to tell you that you dropped this. 

698
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,010
 You dropped this... 

699
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:57,820
♫  The morning we wanted to spend together  ♫

700
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,220
♫  Follow a distant road (follow)  ♫

701
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,270
♫  The memories will soon be filled (memories)  ♫

702
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:10,450
♫  Just smile secretly in your imagination, yeah  ♫

703
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:14,030
Who the heck parked their car in front of the shop?

704
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,210
Geez!

705
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,710
Why are you coming all the way over here for no good reason?

706
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,660
Why would this be for no good reason?

707
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,320
The atmosphere of this neighborhood has been rough lately.

708
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,420
Don't be going to places late at night all by yourself, okay?

709
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:32,120
Thanks, Oppa. You're so reliable.

710
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,510
- I'm going in now. 
 - No...

711
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,460
It's good that we met with the guys today, right?

712
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:43,770
Yes. For a while I was feeling a bit down, but I feel better after meeting them.

713
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:46,390
See?

714
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:50,600
Don't get too stressed out because of the juice truck.

715
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,490
There will be more customers soon and it'll get better.

716
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,020
Right.  Every dog has his day.

717
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,940
I'm really going inside now.

718
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,050
Okay, go inside.

719
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:01,800
- You go on first.
 - No, you go in first.

720
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,980
I'll go in first. I'm going.

721
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,690
Good night.

722
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,060
Juice truck?

723
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,720
Soo Jin.

724
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:50,280
Didn't you leave with Jae Hyeon earlier?

725
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,600
I have something to give you, so I momentarily stopped by the house.

726
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,470
It worked out. Here, take it.

727
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,580
What is it?

728
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,130
The things that contain our memories.

729
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:10,570
All things you gave me since our childhood. Toys, dolls, camera...

730
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:15,090
All the pictures we had taken together. They're all in there.

731
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:20,000
Why are you giving these to me?

732
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:27,330
Because I think our relationship can be neatly settled by giving you these things.

733
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,890
Now I'll give your heart back with this, too.

734
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,010
- Soo Jin.
 - Pil.

735
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:44,470
I understand why you didn't come to my wedding

736
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:50,010
and why you caused a ruckus when I was getting my wedding gifts.

737
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:55,400
Since we've been together for so long, the fact that someone else is beside me

738
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,970
is hard for you to accept.

739
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:04,060
If you would have gotten married first, I would have been like that too.

740
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:09,660
But we can't be together forever.

741
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,460
You might not like Jae Hyeon,

742
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:18,170
but I wish you would respect my choice now.

743
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:26,450
Hey, Bong Pil. From today, we're going to forget the past and be friends. Got it?

744
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:32,050
Okay? With that understanding, shake on it.

745
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,860
Take good care of me from here on, my friend.

746
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:38,120
♫  When I see your tears flow  ♫

747
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:46,370
♫  It feels like even my heart is ripping apart  ♫

748
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:50,690
♫  Now both the pain  ♫

749
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:55,600
♫  And all the wounds  ♫

750
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:03,310
♫  Everything which has distressed my heart  ♫

751
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:10,840
♫  I want to entrust to you  ♫

752
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:16,030
♫  Up to now, I've been keeping my heart shut  ♫

753
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:23,410
♫  I am someone who believed I could live alone  ♫

754
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:27,970
♫  Like a fool  ♫

755
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:00,740
If you're going to park, you should do it properly. What is this?

756
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,910
How can the other cars park?

757
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:04,860
I'll pull out.

758
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,260
As a young man, you lack the basics.

759
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,700
In this situation, shouldn't you apologize first?

760
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,670
Why did you get out when I asked you to pull your car out?

761
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:31,170
But why are you speaking to me informally?

762
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:43,720
If you want to park your car, then stay quietly without saying anything.

763
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:15,120
He told me he wanted to break up  because he found another woman.
   

764
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,910
So what did you say, Yeong Joo?

765
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:21,580
I told him that I wouldn't break up with him.

766
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:26,900
Because Jae Hyeon married that woman at the spur of the moment, not out of love.

767
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:32,470
So you continued to stay by his side and monitored him?

768
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:40,000
Doctor, I'm the only one who can make him happy.

769
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,580
That woman doesn't know anything about Jae Hyeon.

770
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:51,610
If she really knows what he is like, she won't be able to handle it.

771
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:12,860
   

772
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,500
This is driving me crazy, Soo Jin.

773
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,470
I have to congratulate you on your marriage,

774
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:30,020
"I'm relieved that you look happy."

775
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,800
I have to say that too.

776
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:41,870
But... I... I just can't get those words out.

777
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:08,970
♫  My feelings for you  ♫

778
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:14,580
♫  That I hid from you for so long might be all right  ♫

779
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,220
 That's right. I can't live like this. 

780
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,230
 I've returned to the current time period. 

781
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:22,070
 I've become a police officer that I wanted to be so much. 

782
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,610
 But without Soo Jin, my life has no meaning. 

783
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:28,670
♫  I hope that you will fall into my heart  ♫

784
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:32,610
♫  Woo~ Look at me  ♫

785
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:36,650
♫  Woo~ Love me. Only you  ♫

786
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,080
 Soo Jin, I'm going to change this situation. 

787
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:45,980
 No matter what, I'm going to change this situation and find you again. 

788
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:08,370
What's this? Where did the manhole go?

789
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:10,290
This...

790
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:16,250
What happened here?!

791
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:22,630


792
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:26,930
♫  Now both the pain  ♫

793
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:31,680
♫  And all the wounds  ♫

794
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:38,890
♫  Everything which has distressed my heart  ♫

795
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:42,950
   

796
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:48,570
 Soo Jin, we are supposed to return to being friends, but why is it so hard for me? 

797
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:50,940
 Did you ever see Pil as a man? 

798
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:53,650
 It's true! What do I have to do for you to believe me? 

799
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,250
 Ah, forget it. Go away. 

800
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:59,380
 If Seok Tae won't do it, I'll open it myself. 

801
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:02,950
 Is Pil really time traveling through that manhole? 

802
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,900
  Do you love her more than me? 

803
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,900
 It looks like that woman. 

804
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:10,150
 Why does he keep seeing her when he said they broke up?
