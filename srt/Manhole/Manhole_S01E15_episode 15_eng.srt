1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:10,610


2
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,760
 Where is this? 

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,410
 What's this? I definitely went through the manhole, but— 

4
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,840
Soo Jin!

5
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,730
Soo Jin!

6
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,140
Soo Jin, are you alright?

7
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,150
What the heck? That bastard!

8
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,020
- Pil, let's go. We have to leave. 
 - Why?

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,230
- It's Jae Hyeon's car. 
 - What?

10
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,920
Let's hurry.

11
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,660
   

12
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,790
Soo Jin, are you alright?

13
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,750
All of this... How is this happening?

14
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,650
You were a bit shocked, weren't you? You didn't get hurt anywhere, right?

15
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:14,800
Pil, I remember what just happened to us.

16
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,350
I was the one who saved you back then.

17
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,150
But this time it was you who saved me.

18
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,410
Soo Jin.

19
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,050
Huh?

20
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,070
How do you remember that?

21
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,670
I don't know. I just remember it all.

22
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,560
The exact situation from before just repeated itself.

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,890
I got away from Jae Hyeon, climbed  up to the roof, then fell off from it.

24
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,120
And at that time you grabbed my hand.

25
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,670
But how in the world did I come back here after that?

26
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,360
Pil, all of this... What is going on?

27
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,660
I think...

28
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,450
we went through the manhole together this time.

29
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,300
What do you mean by going through the manhole?

30
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,580
Why in the the world did she meet up with that punk Bong Pil, anyway?

31
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,380
Could it be that you were trying to report me?

32
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,730
That can't be right.

33
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,250
There is no way that will ever happen.

34
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,090
   

35
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,360
Yes, Jin Sook?

36
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,420
Jae Hyeon? What about Soo Jin?

37
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,710
Soo Jin must have left her phone and went somewhere for a bit.

38
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,850
Oh, is that right?

39
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,970
Oh okay, please tell Soo Jin to call me back when  she gets back.

40
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,680
Okay.

41
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,680
Jin Sook.

42
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,620
What's wrong? Did something happen? What's up with your facial expression?

43
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,600
Soo Jin came by the shop earlier but she didn't look too good.

44
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,420
So I gave her a call but Jae Hyeon picked up the phone.

45
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,090
Oh yeah? I wonder if something happened.

46
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,590
I don't know. I wonder if she got into an argument with Jae Hyeon or something.

47
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,390
I'm worried for her.

48
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,590
But you know, couples argue all the time. It won't last long.

49
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,140
That's true.

50
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,740
I'm pretty sure it's trivial.

51
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,960
Oh yeah, I saw Pil in front of the manhole again on my way over here.

52
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,460
Manhole again? What for?

53
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,920
He wants to dig it up again?

54
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,850
I guess it's difficult for Pil to forget about Soo Jin still.

55
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,360
He's having such a hard time seeing Soo Jin married to another man that

56
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,450
he wants to time travel back to the past because of it.

57
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,240
Unbelievable.

58
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,670
He is going mad for sure. He's definitely a goner.

59
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,520
I know, right? I feel like Pil is going to do something really stupid at this rate.

60
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,110
He never seems to grow up.

61
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,640
Drink some of this.

62
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,550
Oh, thanks.

63
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,610
Pil.

64
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:28,040
So what you're saying is that we are time traveling by going through that manhole, right?

65
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,880
Yup. I originally time traveled alone

66
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:38,180
but somehow we ended up going through that manhole together this time.

67
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,210
I still have a hard time believing it even though I just experienced it.

68
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,910
How can something like this happen?

69
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,980
I understand your confusion more than anyone else right now.

70
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,990
At first, I felt as confused as you are.

71
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,070
But to believe that Park Jae Hyeon was the hit-and-run criminal...

72
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,420
This is really unbelievable.

73
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,860
How could he hit you with a car then shamelessly stay beside you?

74
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,330
Pil, what you said was right.

75
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,350
What is?

76
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,180
The assault criminal

77
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,090
is really Jae Hyeon.

78
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,250
How did you know that?

79
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:45,310
I discovered the hat, mask, and clothes that appeared on the news

80
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,200
all  inside of the trunk of Jae Hyeon's car.

81
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,470
I knew that Jae Hyeon is the criminal after I saw all that.

82
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,820
So that's why I called you.

83
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,020
I thought that I might need your help.

84
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,330
Then what shall we do now?

85
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,980
Should we report Park Jae Hyeon to the  police right now?

86
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:24,070
No, not yet. I want to organize my thoughts for now.

87
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,400
I am so confused that I don't think I can form any type of judgment.

88
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:37,960
That's fine. We should think more about what to do while being on our way.

89
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,390
Here, be careful. Let's go.

90
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,140
   
   

91
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,740
Uncle!

92
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,700
- Uncle! 
- Who is it!

93
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,110
Who is that so late at night?

94
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,200
- Huh? Pil. 
 - I'm came here, Uncle.

95
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,540
Gosh, punk. What are you doing here so late at night without even giving me a call?

96
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:40,610
Oh, wait a second. This is a face I know. Are you Pil's friend from before?

97
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,400
- Hello. You recognize me. 
 - Of course I do!

98
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,950
Isn't she the girl that you were following around to death a long time ago?

99
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,270
Uncle, you don't have to remember all that. That's such an old news.

100
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,940
By the way, what brings you two here in the middle of the night? Did something happen?

101
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,980
I guess you two ended up together, isn't that right?

102
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,370
Did you two come on a night beach trip or something?

103
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,490
Oh no, it's nothing like that at all.

104
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,580
I had some business to take care of near here, so I decided to stop by.

105
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,060
Uncle, please let us stay for the night.

106
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,320
Oh yeah? Come on in, we have plenty of rooms.

107
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,850
Uncle, you have the first aid kit, right?

108
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:25,540
First aid kit? For what? Did someone get hurt?

109
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,640
Does it hurt a lot?

110
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,030
Should we go to the hospital right now?

111
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,040
The wound is bigger than I thought.

112
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,790
It's not that bad.

113
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:48,000
- Just give it to me. I will—
- Stay still, I will do it. Hold on a minute.

114
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,310
A girl's leg shouldn't look like this. You'll get a scar at this rate.

115
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,290
Tell me if it hurts a lot. If so, we can go to the hospital tomorrow, got it?

116
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:11,050
Hold on a minute. You're hurt too!

117
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,140
You're  hurt so badly and you didn't even know that it hurt?!

118
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,190
♫  This is a heart which loves me  ♫

119
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,460
♫  It's uselessly pretending not to know  ♫

120
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,980
What are we going to do?

121
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,820
I guess this happened when you rolled while saving me earlier.

122
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,130
I suppose.

123
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:42,500
In the future, you should take care of yourself before you take care of me.

124
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
It upsets me if you get hurt because of me.

125
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,890
What are we going to do?

126
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:57,760
♫  I love you. The words for you which were said to you  ♫

127
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,780
♫  The words which I expressed sincerely  ♫

128
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,860
♫  Both a shy heart and a favorite word too  ♫

129
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,930
I think it's good for now.

130
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,050
Let's go to the hospital tomorrow if the wound gets worse.

131
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,240
♫  Love you, love you for you  ♫

132
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,780
By the way... shouldn't we contact your parents at the very least?

133
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,970
Oh yeah, that's right. I totally should.

134
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:33,280
My phone. Oh, my cellphone!

135
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,650
I think I dropped it somewhere. Pil, give me your cell phone.

136
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,390
Okay.

137
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,540
Thanks.

138
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,260
   

139
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,860
   

140
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,280
Hello.

141
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,030
 Hello? 

142
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,520
Are you the person that found my phone by any chance?

143
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,550
Hello?

144
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,510
 Hello? 

145
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,060
What's wrong?

146
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,580
I don't know. The person just listened to me without saying anything then hung up.

147
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,570
Kang Soo Jin, are you going to spend the night with that bastard?

148
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,990
Hey there! Who are you?!

149
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,870
How could you light a fire here?

150
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,610
What are you going do if it spreads to all of the construction material?!

151
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,430
Gosh, who are you anyway?

152
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,080
Gosh, darn it.

153
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,600
My uncle has blankets that are clean and washed.

154
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,740
Even though he looks like that, he's tidy.

155
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,570
Pil, you should go get some rest. I will take care of this.

156
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,430
Alright, go for it.

157
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,660
Get some rest, Soo Jin.

158
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,450
Oh, what's wrong with this?

159
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,050
Is it a power outage?

160
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,190
- Let me look for— 
- Don't go. Hold on a minute, Pil!

161
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,120
- Please don't go! I'm really scared! Don't go. 
- Hey, hey.

162
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,390
- I'm going to get my phone. 
- Don't go. Wait a second. I'll go with you.

163
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,740
- Pil, I'm really scared. Hey, hey, hey. 
- Okay, let's go together.

164
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,280
It's  back on now.

165
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,460
Oh, the light came back on.

166
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,930
That's a relief. Get some rest now, Soo Jin.

167
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,690
Okay, but where are you going to sleep?

168
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,140
I have space over there...

169
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,460
Alright then. Good night.

170
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,910
- Get some rest. 
- Okay.

171
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,800
Gosh, seriously!

172
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,510
Are you all right?

173
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,630
- Soo Jin. 
- Yeah?

174
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,620
Should we just stay here instead of going back to Seoul?

175
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,190
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

176
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,350
Because I don't want to be apart from you.

177
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,320
Oh yeah, you might  need some stuff.

178
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,460
Let me go get some stuff for you at the convenience store. So get some rest.

179
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:47,810
♫  In case you are serious  ♫

180
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:56,160
♫  I wanted to ask you again  ♫

181
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,080
♫  Because it comforts my heart  ♫

182
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,240
Why did I say that we shouldn't go back to Seoul in there out of all things?

183
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,380
Snap out of it, Pil.

184
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,980
♫  Everything will open up to you  ♫

185
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:22,840
♫  If we are like each other  ♫

00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:31,360

00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:50,400
♫  It feels like even my heart is ripping apart  ♫

190

208
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,230
♫  Like a fool  ♫

209
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,780
Soo Jin.

210
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Soo Jin.

211
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,310
Pil.

212
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:51,540
I wonder why I didn't believe you when you told me that Jae Hyeon is a dangerous person.

213
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:57,580
This wouldn't have happened if I had listened to you at least once.

214
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,770
I think you had no other choice.

215
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:07,010
You chose him, so I'm sure you wanted to believe in him.

216
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:16,700
As I was time traveling,  I realized many times that Park Jae Hyeon isn't such a nice person.

217
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,600
But then, no matter what the situation was

218
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,800
you and he gradually got close,

219
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,920
and I didn't know how to tell you about him.

220
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,920
In order for you to believe me,

221
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:38,160
I had to somehow tell you that I am time traveling through the manhole.

222
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,800
But I knew that there was no way you would believe me.

223
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,640
So I felt very frustrated about that.

224
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,460
Now I understand.

225
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,550
I can understand how frustrated you were and struggling so much all by yourself.

226
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:06,590
Pil, what in the world went on while you were time traveling anyway?

227
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,970
A lot of things happened that you have no idea about.

228
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:20,530
I saved you every time you were in danger.

229
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:26,140
I was in a coma and talked to you while I was floating around as a soul.

230
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,310
No way.

231
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,780
You probably won't remember but you even asked me to marry you.

232
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,210
I did?! Seriously?!

233
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,160
Yeah.

234
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,970
But once I got back through that manhole, all those things that happened disappeared

235
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,690
and we ended up becoming further and further apart.

236
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,410
You see that building over there?

237
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,070
That thing was burning up like crazy

238
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,190
and you were inside of that fire.

239
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:18,750
I went inside to save you and I almost got burned to death.

240
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,900
So... did you end up saving me?

241
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,840
Of course I did.

242
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:32,470
And because of that I ended up being in a coma.

243
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,620
Then I was roaming around as a soul.

244
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,350
Why did you do that, you fool?

245
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,680
What am I to you that you risked your life to save me?

246
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,510
You probably didn't even hear a word of thank you for doing that either.

247
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,780
I didn't do that to brag about it though.

248
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:56,590
I did risk my life for you since a long time ago.

249
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:11,310
But... do you know what frustrated me the most?

250
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,850
 I don't think I'll be able to say this to you while looking at your face, 

251
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,080
 so I'm leaving a video for you. 

252
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,530
 I... like you. 

253
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,700
 I never skipped a day for the last 28 years. 

254
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,630
 I have skipped a meal before, but I have never skipped a day of liking you. 

255
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,170
I mustered up the courage and confessed to you multiple times.

256
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,400
But you couldn't remember anything.

257
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,920
 I like you, Pil. 

258
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,620
 Huh? 

259
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,150
I heard your confession of you liking me

260
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,470
but the next day, I had to see you turn cold on me.

261
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,370
I was so upset.

262
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,300
We were able to confirm our feelings for each other.

263
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,680
But everything disappeared when I went through the manhole again.

264
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,250
I thought I was going to go crazy then.

265
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,480
During those times,

266
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,640
I bet you were bitter toward me.

267
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,420
I'm fine now.

268
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:41,770
We are able to share our memories together now,

269
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,470
so all of the difficult times that I went through

270
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,380
is paid in full it seems.

271
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:56,470
Pil. Sorry for making you go through a lot because of me.

272
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,090
 Report the status of the victim please. 

273
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,400
 He's transferred to a hospital and is being treated right now. 

274
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,850
 He is being treated, but is not in a good condition. 

275
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:41,060
 He says he was beaten up for no reason. 

276
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,700
Officer Choi.

277
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
The measuring instrument is arriving from the head office right now.

278
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,080
- What about the victim? 
- He's being treated at the hospital right now.

279
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,770
I don't know how much he was beaten but his face is badly ruined.

280
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,460
Did he say he saw the face of the attacker?

281
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:06,040
It was dark so it was hard to see, but apparently he's tall and young.

282
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,580
Just what did this guy burn so much of?

283
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,500
  - You know the assault incident? He is the culprit.
 - What? 

284
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,530
 You know the piece we gathered at the crime scene? That came off of that punk's keychain. 

285
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,060
Suspension?

286
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,160
Yes.

287
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,600
Okay.

288
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,720
Okay, I understand.

289
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,860
Please fix me some lunch because I need to head out right after I'm done eating.

290
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:58,760
Dear, Pil got suspended from his job.

291
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,370
I guess he got punished for beating up Soo Jin's husband.

292
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,380
Things are getting worse by the minute here.

293
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,530
The car isn't out there either so I'm assuming he took it out somewhere.

294
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,500
Maybe he got upset about being suspended so he went somewhere for a drive.

295
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,310
But at least he should've told us before leaving.

296
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,410
My goodness!

297
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,330
Pil finally caused something big to happen.

298
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,160
Last night, Pil took Soo Jin somewhere, and we haven't even gotten a call yet.

299
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,010
I don't know what you're talking about.

300
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:36,090
Please talk to us  slowly so we can understand what you're saying.

301
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,320
Pil kidnapped our Soo Jin! Kidnapped!

302
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,360
What do you mean kidnap?

303
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,600
Last night, he dragged our Soo Jin away and put her in his car while my son-in-law was watching.

304
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,200
Then he disappeared! Did you get any calls from him yet?

305
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,360
What the heck are you talking about here?

306
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,610
Hold on a minute. Let me call Pil.

307
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,140
-  The person you're trying to reach is unavailable—  
 - Oh, he's not answering.

308
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,460
As soon as I'm able to reach him...

309
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,810
Why should we wait till they call us when we don't even know when we are going to get a call?!

310
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,910
I don't care if they were born and raised in the same neighborhood.

311
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,650
I'm going to call the cops!

312
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,100
Please calm down for now, Mrs. Kang.

313
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,390
I will come up with a way to look for Pil, and we will bring Soo Jin home safe and sound.

314
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,420
So please don't report it. Please.

315
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,160
Oh, what should we do?

316
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,820
Oppa! Hey! Have you two had a phone conversation with Soo Jin or Pil yesterday or today?

317
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,100
- Or have you seen them? 
- No.

318
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,430
What now? What is it this time?

319
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,400
They say that Pil kidnapped Soo Jin.

320
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,210
In front of Jae Hyeon too!

321
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,210
No way... What are you blabbering?

322
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,710
Today, Soo Jin and Jae Hyeon were supposed to go on a trip to England.

323
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,550
But Soo Jin was kidnapped by Pil, so they didn't get to go.

324
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:50,120
He doesn't know where she is, and she's unreachable.

325
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,870
Really? What should we do? Pil must actually be crazy.

326
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,610
No way...

327
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,720
Where did you hear such weird things?

328
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,100
- Hey, wait. I'll try calling. 
- You should have earlier.

329
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,390
- She's not going to pick up. 
- She won't answer.

330
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,300
Wait a second. Where did you hear such weird things before coming here?

331
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,170
 The person you're trying to reach is unavailable. Please leave a message after the beep. 

332
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,600
She's not answering her phone.

333
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,670
♫ The person I loved

334
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,520
- Uncle. 
- Yes?

335
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,570
You're in the middle of cleaning up.

336
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,250
I should open my business soon.

337
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,930
But you don't wear your Navy uniform anymore?

338
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,360
Navy! I'm dating these days.

339
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,630
So I have to look clean.

340
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,120
Anyway, it's already lunch time. You must be hungry.

341
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,450
Well, Pil's making a lot of something to give to his girlfriend.

342
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,220
So why don't you head over there?

343
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,720
Uncle, two cups of coffee, please.

344
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,020
- Coffee? 
- Yes.

345
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,560
Just the two of you? Intimately?

346
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,940
- That's good. 
- Here, Uncle.

347
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,300
No, no. Don't be like that.

348
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,920
It's not like we don't know each other.

349
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,980
I stayed overnight, so at least let me pay for coffee.

350
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,410
Gosh, you really don't need to.

351
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:08,470
- Sit and wait a little bit. I'll quickly make delicious ones for you. 
- Okay.

352
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,030
Alright.

353
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,130
Oh right. Iced or hot?

354
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,400
- Iced, please.
- Okay, iced.

355
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:25,400
Gosh, Pil must still like you a lot.

356
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,250
Stop making him worry... Accept his heart already!

357
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,250
Uncle! Do you have a camera by any chance?

358
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,500
If you do, I was wondering if I could borrow it for a day.

359
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,660
A camera? Let's see...

360
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,620
Oh, I have one, but it's old. Wait a moment.

361
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,210
Thank you.

362
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,820
   
   

363
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,100
Park Jae Hyeon!

364
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,420
Park Jae Hyeon! Park Jae Hyeon! Hey!

365
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,020
- Wait! Park Jae Hyeon! 
- Park Jae Hyeon!

366
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:45,270
Why did they come looking for me?

367
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,750
By chance, did that punk Bong Pil report me?

368
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,740
Hot!

369
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,810
Pil, what are you doing?

370
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:28,460
Oh. You should stay inside. Why are you coming out? Oh thanks.

371
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,300
Why did you make so many things?

372
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,590
It's been a while, but to feed you, Chef Bong is pulling out his skills.

373
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,970
Look at this. Doesn't this fried egg look amazing?

374
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:41,320
Even though it looks easy, it's actually really hard.

375
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,910
Wow. I'm proud of you.

376
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,860
Pil. Let's carry these over to the beach and eat there.

377
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,690
Sounds good.

378
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,300
Hey, where did you get the camera?

379
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,590
I borrowed it from Uncle.

380
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,280
The scenery is nice, so I'm going to take some photos since it's been a while.

381
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:06,320
I guess I have to become a handsome subject for today.

382
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,080
Wait just a little bit. I'll pack the food quickly.

383
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,120
Take your time.

384
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,270
Where is the lunch box?

385
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:24,440
The weather is really great. The photos will come out really nicely.

386
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,000
I think so.

387
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,810
Hey. Your leg must still be hurting.

388
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,410
No, it's fine.

389
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,230
- Hey. Okay, get on.
- It's fine.

390
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,940
Since you're hurt, I'm specially letting you borrow my back.

391
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,140
This oppa has a wider back than you think.

392
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,880
- Okay, get on. 
 - Stand up. Quickly.

393
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,630
It's really okay. Get  on, get on.

394
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:49,430
- Hey, hey! Wait a second! 
- Okay, okay.

395
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,940
Wow! Why are you so light?

396
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,440
You should eat your meals properly.

397
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,030
Bong Pil, you grew a lot. You couldn't even piggyback me before.

398
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,920
- When? 
- Hey.

399
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,030
When we were in kindergarten, I piggybacked you.

400
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:09,710
That was such a long time ago. My muscles developed after kindergarten, okay?

401
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,420
Hold tight so you don't fall.

402
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,610
♫  Who makes me smile  ♫

403
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:20,490
♫  Woo~ Tell me  ♫

404
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:27,430
♫  Woo~ That you love me. Just like that  ♫

405
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,390
♫  If the growing love is the same as my heart  ♫

406
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,620
- One more. 
- Gosh, stop.

407
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,000
One, two.

408
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,950
♫  It might be a little awkward  ♫

409
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:47,630
♫  Honestly, I probably lack a lot  ♫

410
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:53,600
♫  But I will make you smile always. Show me now  ♫

411
00:35:53,600 --> 00:36:00,610
♫  I hope that it's not a misunderstanding on my end  ♫

412
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:04,670
♫  Woo~ Look at me  ♫

413
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:11,580
♫  Woo~ Love me. Only you  ♫

414
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:16,590
♫  Are the one who makes me smile  ♫

415
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:20,620
♫  Woo~ Tell me  ♫

416
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:27,660
♫  Woo~ That you love me. Just like that  ♫

417
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:34,620
♫  If the growing love is the same as my heart  ♫

418
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:43,930
I failed. I completely failed.

419
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,730
It looks pretty legit.

420
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,710
Of course. I poured my soul into this lunch. So you can't leave any of it.

421
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,940
Okay. Let me try.

422
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,240
Hey, it's good.

423
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,620
You're good at cooking too? Perfect husband material.

424
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,920
It's because I usually don't, but when I put my mind to it, there's nothing I can't do.

425
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,290
It's the first time that I cooked for anyone. So be honored.

426
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,100
Okay. I'll eat it well.

427
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,450
Pil.

428
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:25,930
I was thinking about it, and I think I have to go back to Seoul today.

429
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:29,080
- Today? 
- Yes.

430
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:34,130
I can't stay here indefinitely.

431
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,640
But can't you stay a little longer?

432
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,720
It's a shame that we have to leave just like this.

433
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,940
Here.

434
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,640
Spending time with you like this...

435
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,780
this will be the last time.

436
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,140
What do you mean last time?

437
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:10,400
I thought a lot after hearing about all the things that happened while you were time traveling.

438
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,760
It seems like we shouldn't be together.

439
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:23,390
You always got into danger because of me and went through difficult situations.

440
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:30,010
No, I never thought it was hard.

441
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,310
I just need to be by your side from now on.

442
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,070
There's nothing else I want.

443
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:40,150
Pil. I don't like it when you're like this.

444
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:48,510
I can't bear to watch you becoming unhappy because of me anymore.

445
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,820
Soo Jin.

446
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:56,260
You said things never went well between us while you were time traveling.

447
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:03,040
That's because we're not fated to be.

448
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,310
Look at us now.

449
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:13,160
I am already married, and we can't be together.

450
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:18,830
Soo Jin, you know what kind of person Park Jae Hyeon is now.

451
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,370
He's a dangerous person. You don't know what will happen to you.

452
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:24,250
Deciding not to see you

453
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,360
has nothing to do with Jae Hyeon.

454
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,920
It's just what I've decided.

455
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,910
Pil...

456
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:43,240
I would like you to be happy.

457
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,830
If you'll time travel again,

458
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,560
or if you'll stay in this time period... I don't know what will happen.

459
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,920
But from now on, no matter what situation you face,

460
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,840
don't ever choose me.

461
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,070
♫  It will be you forever  ♫

462
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:16,550
I would like it if you no longer suffered because of me.

463
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,970
♫  You and I  ♫

464
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,780
I will go first.

465
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,950
Take your time.

466
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:45,190
♫  With you, I guess I was too young then  ♫

467
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:54,710
♫  If you, if only you  ♫

468
00:40:54,710 --> 00:41:03,130
♫  With you, for me it will be you forever  ♫

469
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:11,610
♫  How would it feel if I hugged you  ♫

470
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:15,220
♫  You and I  ♫

471
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,400
J-Jae Hyeon.

472
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,230
Soo Jin.

473
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,240
Soo Jin.

474
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,260
Let's talk.

475
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,660
Listen to me for a little bit.

476
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,040
I beg of you.

477
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,730
How did you find out where to come?

478
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:02,530
Your cell phone that you dropped. I had it.

479
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:06,830
I saw your purchase history and came.

480
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:15,390
Soo Jin, I know you're very disappointed in me.

481
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,600
After knowing what I did,

482
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,540
how surprised and scared you must have been...

483
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:30,450
I can't... forgive myself either.

484
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,640
When Pil and I were together last night,

485
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,810
you were deliberately trying to run us over?

486
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,650
Seeing you with Bong Pil,

487
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,940
I was so mad

488
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,940
that I did it without realizing at the moment.

489
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,820
Is it okay to do that when you're mad? That's...

490
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:07,270
That's why you randomly assaulted people, too?

491
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,310
I don't know either.

492
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:13,460
When I'm mad, I suddenly can't control myself.

493
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:19,040
I always regret it but because I can't control it, it drives me crazy, too.

494
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,870
I still can't believe that you committed those acts.

495
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,320
Jae Hyeon, you were a nice and good man.

496
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,930
So why did you do those things?

497
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,640
Never mind.

498
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,270
No matter what excuse you give,

499
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:46,880
the things you did can't be over looked.

500
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,970
Jae Hyeon.

501
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,040
Turn yourself in.

502
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:03,180
Receive the sentence for the crimes you committed and get treated.

503
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:10,710
Then you might become better.

504
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:20,390
Okay, I understand.  I will turn myself in.

505
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:29,080
Soo Jin, but in return, will you come with me?

506
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,510
♫ The person I loved

507
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:53,900
Hey Pil!

508
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,380
Hey Uncle, where are you going?

509
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,770
Me? To the market. For groceries.

510
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,560
Hey Soo Jin has a guest visiting.

511
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,630
- A guest? 
- Yeah, he's about this tall.

512
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,110
He was a slim and handsome looking man.

513
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,810
What kind of person is he?

514
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,470
- No way. 
 - Hey—

515
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,900
Park Jae Hyeon is the culprit.

516
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,130
Call the detective in charge.

517
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:20,030
Tell him we secured the CCTV footage of the assault criminal.

518
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,020
Y-yes.

519
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:26,490
I have to do something.

520
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,290
I said let's wait a little longer.

521
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,570
Is anyone here?

522
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:34,900
The door was open, so... Excuse us.

523
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,050
What is the purpose for this visit?

524
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:38,050
Is Kang Soo Jin here?

525
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:42,930
She's not answering her cell phone and is not at home, so I came all the way here.

526
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,870
Why are you looking for our Soo Jin?

527
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:47,990
Did something happen to Soo Jin?

528
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,750
No, it's not like that.

529
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,310
If that's not it, then why are you looking for our Soo Jin?

530
00:47:53,950 --> 00:48:00,480
Ah well... We came because we wanted to ask about Park Jae Hyeon.

531
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,510
Park Jae Hyeon? Our son-in-law?

532
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:09,100
Yes. You know about the random assault cases that have happened in this neighborhood, right?

533
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,270
Yes.

534
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,980
But how is that related to our son-in-law?

535
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:17,920
Park Jae Hyeon... is the prime suspect of those cases.

536
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,520
- What? 
- Pardon?

537
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:45,920
So... you were with Bong Pil last night?

538
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,460
Yes.

539
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:53,430
By chance, did you sleep in the same room?

540
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:58,540
No. How could I?

541
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,620
Okay. My Soo Jin wouldn't do something like that.

542
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,880
But... aren't we going to Seoul?

543
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,160
Why did you turn this way?

544
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,480
Let's go somewhere to get some air then head back.

545
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:32,040
What do you mean all of a sudden?

546
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,620
Jae Hyeon, you said you would turn yourself in.

547
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:39,130
We didn't get to go on our England trip, so it's a shame to head back just like this.

548
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:42,010
We have a lot of time, so let's go slowly.

549
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,310
 Officer Bong! 

550
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,610
Officer Choi, I'm not in a position to answer your call...

551
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:00,880
- Are you with Kang Soo Jin? 
 - Pardon?

552
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,530
If you're with Kang Soo Jin, you two have to come to Seoul quickly to make a statement.

553
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:09,730
Like you said, Park Jae Hyeon is the culprit.

554
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:14,420
Park Jae Hyeon turned off his cell phone and is unreachable. I think he found out and escaped.

555
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:18,090
Park Jae Hyeon is currently in the Gangneung area and is fleeing with Kang Soo Jin.

556
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:21,280
- What? 
- I'm looking for him right now, but...

557
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:41,140
 Officer Bong. Officer Bong! What's happening? 

558
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,540
Jae Hyeon, why are you suddenly like this?

559
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:35,070
Hey man, drive properly!

560
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,450
I lost Park Jae Hyeon's car.

561
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:54,230
For now, I'll continue searching this area. Okay.

562
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,680
You must be really hungry. Wait a little bit. It'll be done soon.

563
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:38,020
Jae Hyeon. Let's not do this and go back to Seoul.

564
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,560
Let's go and  turn yourself in, Jae Hyeon.

565
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,030
It seems like you don't want to be with me.

566
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,040
It's been a while we had time like this.

567
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,210
Let's not think about anything right now and enjoy a little.

568
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,320
Stay seated.

569
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,830
   

570
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:06,090
You must be really hungry. Eat this first while waiting.

571
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,260
Okay, thanks.

572
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,880
   

573
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,760
Hello?

574
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:21,490
Soo Jin!

575
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:26,640
 The steak that Soo Jin likes is done! 

576
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,970
 Eat. There aren't many ingredients so I'm not sure if it'll be good. 

577
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,450
Okay.

578
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,760
How is it? Is it good?

579
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,150
Yeah, it's good.

580
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:09,610
By the way, I didn't know there was a vacation house near the lake like this.

581
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,770
 Didn't I tell you? 

582
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:15,500
 I think I told you that I inherited a vacation house from my parents. 

583
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,180
I think you did.

584
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:23,510
While we were coming, I saw that the lake was really beautiful.

585
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,950
 What's the name of the lake? 

586
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,840
Lake Sky.

587
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:33,220
 Lake Sky. I see. 

588
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,000
The name is pretty, right?

589
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,450
You should see it when there's fog over it at dawn.  It's quite grand.

590
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,970
 I should. 

591
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:44,610
Lake Sky.

592
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,440
Aren't you glad we came here? 
   

593
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,100
   

594
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,820
Thanks.

595
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:15,650


596
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:19,330
- Soo Jin. 
- Yeah?

597
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:22,160
Should we leave Korea?

598
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,430
What are you talking about?

599
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:31,980
If I turn myself in, I have to go to jail. So you'll live lonely.

600
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:40,160
Let's just go somewhere that doesn't have people and live by ourselves.

601
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:43,160
Jae Hyeon.

602
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:47,740
I am fine with only you, Soo Jin.

603
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,970
I don't need anyone else.

604
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,010
Well...

605
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:04,530
Why? Is something there?

606
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:12,690
♫  With you, I guess I was too young then  ♫

607
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:20,500
♫  If you, if only you  ♫

608
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,100
♫  With you  ♫
