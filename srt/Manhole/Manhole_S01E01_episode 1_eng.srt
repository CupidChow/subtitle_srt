1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:03,990
   

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:16,550


3
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,950
♬  When she got the word  ♬

4
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,940
♬   She said "I suppose you've heard   ♬

5
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,550
♬    about Alice"   ♬

6
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,710
♬   Well, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside   ♬

7
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,160
♬   And I could hardly believe my eyes   ♬

8
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,250
♬   Into Alice's drive   ♬

9
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,890
♬  Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go  ♬

10
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,380
♬  I guess she's got her reasons but  ♬

11
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,470
- You should stay in your room! 
- But I can help you, Mom.

12
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,830
Help with what? You just staying right here like this is helping me.

13
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,620
- Make sure you don't come out until the groom comes! 
 - Okay.

14
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,540
Oh my, my daughter is so pretty.

15
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,360
♬   To tell her how I'm feeling    ♬

16
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,110
 Bong Pil, 28 years old, has been studying for the civil service exam for 3 years. 

17
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,620
 He's the main character and instigator for all these happenings. 

18
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,540
 My love disappeared just like a shooting star into the sky. 

19
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,710
 Just like with my father's 20-year-old wild ginseng wine, when someone ferments a drink, 

20
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,310
 they hope that it will get sweeter as time goes by. 

21
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,620
 But the love I've been nursing in my heart has now become as bitter as poison. 

22
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,940
Pay us to get the box of the bridegroom's wedding gifts!  Pay us!

23
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,260
 Soo Jin, 28 years old. 

24
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,390
 That's right, 28 years. 

25
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,010
 I believe that it was 28 years ago that our love first began. 

26
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,380
 After being born 3 days apart in the same neighborhood and same obstetrician's office, 

27
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,310
 we'd already been lying on the same bed since 28 years ago. 

28
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,420
 And yet! To me, who had thought a chance to confess would come at some time or another, 

29
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,540
 her sudden announcement of her wedding to a guy she had met just a few months ago was shocking. 

30
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,490
 You only get one chance in life. 

31
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:06,220
 Life is something that will never go the way I want it to. 

32
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,400
They're so damn noisy!

33
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:46,290
   

34
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,410
We can't carry this with only this much!

35
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,530
Step back! Step back!

36
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,960
Why?

37
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,430
You're too damn loud!

38
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,650
Do you own this street? How can you be chattering on the street in the middle of the night?!

39
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,550
What is the great event that, at this late at night,

40
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,540
you're making loud noises in someone else's neighborhood?!

41
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,820
Just ignore him. Ignore him.

42
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,440
Pay us to get the box of the bridegroom's wedding gifts!  Pay us!

43
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,800
Here, money! Step forward!

44
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,110
- What was that? 
- Why'd you hit me?!

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,780
Oy. But, what time is it right now?

46
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,940
I said what time is it?

47
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,620
Nine o'clock.

48
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:56,920
When it's 9 PM, you're allowed to wear these kinds of things in someone else's neighborhood and raise a ruckus?
 Huh?

49
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,190
Is getting married something to get awarded?!

50
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,740
That...

51
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,550
All... marriages are youth's graves, you bastards!

52
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,000
Ugh, for goodness' sake. What's your problem?

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,550
- Ah, scary.
- Hey!

54
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,300
What?!

55
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,790
 Kang Soo Jin, 28 years old, the neighborhood femme fatale. 

56
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,100
 Although she was Bong Pil's Beatrice (as in Dante and Beatrice), she's getting married in a week. 

57
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,310
Oh dear, hurry back inside!

58
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,510
It's fine.

59
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,040
You crazy idiot.

60
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,460
- Hey! 
 - Why do you all keep yelling at me?

61
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,810
 Bong Pil's parents: a postmaster on the verge of retirement and a housewife. 

62
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,000
 They already gave up on their son long, long ago. 

63
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,380
 I'm remembering it. 

64
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,970
 The day when the beast that knew nothing of love finally became a human. 

65
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,000
 Elementary school, third grade. 

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,470
 When Soo Jin first became my seat partner, I suddenly realized what love was. 

67
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,600
 I could tell that I showed my enlightenment at that time too boldly and honestly. 

68
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,550
 At that time, I was too progressive 

69
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,230
 and Soo Jin was too conservative. 

70
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,200
 As a result, Soo Jin ended up bursting into tears saying she was going to transfer schools within 2 hours of becoming my seat partner. 

71
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,130
 So I tried to comfort her by saying I'd take responsibility for her but... 

72
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,070
 Damn it! From that point, it went wrong. 

73
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,920
Mom!

74
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,530
Dad! Dad!

75
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,460
Dad! Da...d.

76
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,380
Oh?

77
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,470
Mom! Mo—

78
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,830
Huh?

79
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,940
They were both just here. Dad? Dad!

80
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,310
Where did they go?

81
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,740
Ah, forget it.

82
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,820
Hey, Pil!

83
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,970
I heard you got drunk last night and caused a complete mess when Soo Jin's wedding gifts were being brought.

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,990
It must be upsetting when you were like fly next to poop, circling her for the last 28 years.

85
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,860
Hey!

86
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,440
- What? 
 - You convey your expression like poop.

87
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,170
It's a poop-like situation.

88
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,910
Stop talking about poop, I said.

89
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,200
Okay! You must be upset so drink a glass of juice. I'll make it for you.

90
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,650
You make it very hard, so drink all by yourself!

91
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,800
Why the hell is he getting mad at me for?!

92
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,880
 Yoon Jin Sook, 28 years old, born and grew up in the same neighborhood as Bong Pil. 

93
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,470
 His female friend who is beyond help. 

94
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,900
Do you have a cigarette?

95
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,370
I heard Soo Jin's wedding gifts were brought.

96
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,550
Give me a cigarette.

97
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,460
Is it one week until the wedding?

98
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,440
A cigarette!

99
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,470
What should I wear to the wedding when I don't have a suit?

100
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,210
I'm asking about a cigarette. Not a wedding, you bastard! Do you have a cigarette? A cigarette!

101
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,910
   

102
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,810
Does anybody have a cigarette?

103
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,040
 Jo Seok Tae, 28 years old, studying for the civil service exam for 6 years. 

104
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,080
 Likelihood of passing in this lifetime is utterly unforeseeable. 

105
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,980
Apparently the passing rate is 1 to 268.

106
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,740
I think I'm going to end up preparing for the civil service exams into my thirties.

107
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,000
Civil service exam?  That sounds good.

108
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:16,010
Ah seriously! When you're only preparing for positions in level 9, you keep empathizing "civil service exam."

109
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:20,100
By the way, you also misled the people at the Bongbong Pub by saying you were preparing for the civil service exams.

110
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,840
Hey, if we're preparing for the civil service exams, we're all the same, whether it's to be a prosecutor, judge, or something else.

111
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,840
A-and what about you? You're also level 9 (lowest tier)!

112
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,340
Hey, I'm preparing for the position of a cool police officer.

113
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,670
There's a huge difference between your position and mine.

114
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,170
Police officer, my foot. I'm going to study really hard,

115
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,810
and when I pass and you fail, I'll be a civil servant and you'll be unemployed.

116
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,820
Then would you and I be on the same level? Of course we'd be different! We'd be different!

117
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,310
I have already told you since we were young that a person who can't do it won't be able to do it forever.

118
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,770
That's how you are. So stick to dreaming only when you're asleep, kiddo.

119
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,470
Hey! The way I see it, you're also going to die before you ever pass!

120
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,470
Just look at Soo Jin! You chased after her so much, but she met a well-off guy and is marrying him instead. Oh how great you—

121
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,840
Are you really rubbing salt into the wound? Do you really want to die by me?

122
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,280
Hey!

123
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,060
Go study, you punks!

124
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,250
What great thing are you punks studying that you guys are ruining my pursuit of knowledge from morning?

125
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,520
If you're not going to study, get lost, you punks!

126
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,510
What is he studying?

127
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,700
Level 7, prosecution, you punks.

128
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,840
Okay.

129
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,480
Kill the groom.

130
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,060
Kill the groom?!

131
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,200
Oh my—

132
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,220
Because you guys look like this, one has been studying for the civil service exam for 6 years,

133
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,830
and the other is sitting around, selling juice.

134
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,510
Hey! How could you compare me with this thing?

135
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,530
I'm CEO Yoon at the business established by a young entrepreneur!

136
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,230
And! Why are you two stuffing yourselves with ramen at my table, instead of at a convenience store?!

137
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,300
Eat it at the convenience store!

138
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,500
It's too cramped there. Hey Pil, I'm going to eat yours.

139
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,650
Hey, Pil.

140
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,320
So how are you going to stop this? The wedding is the day after tomorrow.

141
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,500
I'll stop it. Just wait and see. I'll put a stop to it.

142
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,810
That's right, Pil is going to stop it. Don't worry.

143
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,610
Remember a long time ago, when he was in track and field, he was running the 1000 meter relay,

144
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,500
but fell and stopped our school from competing at nationals?

145
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,750
Pil is good at stopping things. That's his innate talent.

146
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,590
What?

147
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,180
Oh right, and remember? He's good at stopping credit cards from getting into trouble, too.

148
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,310
I'm not sure how he pays them so well by using one after another in turn without getting into any trouble.

149
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,260
So don't worry. I know.

150
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,770
He must be intoxicated by eating ramen.

151
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,600
Ah! It's hot!

152
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,720
Have you two gone crazy?!

153
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,700
Help me, help. Hurry.

154
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,640
Are you alright?

155
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,460
It stings, it stings, it stings.

156
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,810
Gosh, it stings.

157
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,090
You got a huge burn.

158
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,470
That jerk.

159
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,980
Hey! Just how much trouble must you have given Soo Jin?

160
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,040
Forget 28 years. You could wait 280 years and it still wouldn't work out.

161
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,940
That rotten kid. He's getting what he deserves.

162
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,400
You said it stings so much that you might die, but your mouth must have not gotten cooked from it yet.

163
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,210
Hey, I think I might have to eat this burn ointment. I think the inside of my neck is all burnt too.

164
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,410
Really? Don't go overboard.

165
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,560
Hey, stop making a fuss about your throat, punk.

166
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,460
I feel like someone took out my heart and is frying it to a crisp.

167
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,260
Stop acting all pitiful. You want me to call Soo Jin?

168
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,070
Before she becomes someone else's woman, do you want to at least confess once?

169
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,980
If I were you, I would feel like it's a waste to not confess once after holding your feelings in your heart for that long. I'll call.

170
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,170
- Hurry up. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. 
 - You can't. You can't.

171
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,290
What good would it be to confess?

172
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,240
Their first night is right in front of our eyes.

173
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,690
- Well you don't know if it'll be their first night. 
- That's right.

174
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,360
Ah, gosh. The first night. The first...

175
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,140
- Ah, it stings! 
- Ah! What's going on!

176
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,630
Gosh, why is he like this? He is acting like he is crazy.

177
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,770
- Just get out. 
 - Ah, seriously.

178
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,380
Hey, wait a second.

179
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,810
There is no one in our neighborhood who doesn't know that he loves Soo Jin.

180
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,000
Okay, we should hold an emergency neighborhood meeting.

181
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,530
Hey there, neighbors!

182
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,540
For 28 years, Pil has liked Soo Ji—

183
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,630
Everyone! There is a madman here. A crazy man.

184
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,270
- Are you crazy? You crazy girl!
 - There's a madman up here! He's crazy! Insane!

185
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,300
How can a madman be so strong? Ow, it hurts.

186
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,500
Hey, do you really think there isn't a way to turn this around?

187
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,140
If you can't do that, then just wait until she gets divorced.

188
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,300
These days people get married quickly and get divorced quickly.

189
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,360
They call it the trend these days. You should follow the trend.

190
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,660
You— Okay, just don't say anything. Just don't.

191
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,930
Is that something you should say?

192
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,940
Just because you have a mouth, you talk quite a lot.

193
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,130
Why'd you have to hit me?!

194
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,960
That pitiful guy. Soo Jin's the only girl he looks at.

195
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,110
Gosh.

196
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,180
Because of him, I couldn't get anything done today.

197
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,250
Your six years of studying didn't do much, so do you think you not studying today did a lot of damage?

198
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,300
Studying is about the flow.

199
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,170
Hey, you're going to get married some day too, right?

200
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,070
I guess.

201
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:11,210
I'm really curious about whom you're going to marry.

202
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,330
It won't be you.

203
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,430
H-hey! Did I say I wanted to marry you!

204
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,150
You're really ridiculous.

205
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,650
Why are you drinking the ash tray?

206
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,730
Okay.

207
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,510
The photos are...

208
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,900
 Park Jae Hyeon, 31 years old. 

209
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,940
 A pharmacist at the neighborhood pharmacy. 

210
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:10,710
  He's Soo Jin's fiancé and Pil's sworn enemy. 

211
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,910
My expression isn't that great.

212
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,080
I wonder why I didn't smile. We won't be able to use this picture.

213
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,730
My expression is rotten. Was I tired?

214
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,610
You look pretty.

215
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,640
No... Look.

216
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,780
Jae Hyeon, you're smiling so brightly, but look at me.

217
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,470
My expression makes this look sorry.

218
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,310
I'm grateful enough that you've taking a wedding photo with me.

219
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,200
You're right. Your smile is much prettier.

220
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,670
It's a shame.

221
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,010
I want to retake them.

222
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,890
What's wrong with this fan?

223
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,810
Because I touched it, it died.

224
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,750
I have a "minus hand."

225
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,470
Gosh.

226
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,080
I came by after eating lunch for a bit.

227
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,340
I'll come after work again. Let's eat dinner together.

228
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,740
Okay.

229
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,830
Sorry about all the ruckus yesterday when you brought the box of the bridegroom's wedding gifts.

230
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,630
Oh, it's okay.

231
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,410
It's a historical wedding, so that kind of chaos should happen.

232
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,570
Your friend is scary.

233
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,850
Endure a week more. I'll save you from this weird neighborhood.

234
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,740
- I'll be going. 
- Okay, I'll see you later.

235
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,230
Yeah.

236
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,340
   

237
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,370
♫ Our dreams, they finally—

238
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,020
Welcome... or not.

239
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,660
It's about a sad love story. Will you watch it?

240
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,570
There are a lot of similarities to your current situation.

241
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,070
Two past lovers broke up to follow their own individual dreams.

242
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,040
In the end, the woman ended up choosing to marry another man.

243
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,630
Damn!

244
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,190
Why are you here?

245
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,150
Just... while passing by.

246
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,930
This place isn't on your normal walking route.

247
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,350
Hyung, let me ask you something.

248
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,400
Ask away.

249
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,530
Hyung, you've watched a lot of movies, right?

250
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,500
How do people stop weddings in movies?

251
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,750
Hey, get your head on straight.

252
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,520
Movies are movies. Reality is different.

253
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,400
You might get arrested or beaten up to death.

254
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,960
But why couldn't you prevent the wedding?

255
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,860
That's what I'm curious about. Weren't you defending her man-to-man?

256
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,300
I didn't know they were getting married. I didn't even get a wedding invitation!

257
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,440
Ah, that's strange. The wedding invitation.

258
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,030
Right?

259
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,300
Why didn't she send me one?

260
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,070
That's not it. I'm saying that you're strange for being so obsessed over the wedding invitation.

261
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,400
If you got the wedding invitation then that means the game is already over. You needed to know about it before then.

262
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,530
Before they decided on the wedding date.

263
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,960
Is that so?

264
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,530
Ah really. Hey!

265
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,430
These days, it's all about information war.

266
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,900
You already lost in that aspect. That's where the game ended.

267
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,240
No!

268
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,200
No! But I really didn't know! I knew that she had gotten a new boyfriend,

269
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,700
but how was I supposed to know they would get married so fast!

270
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,470
"Sang Yoo Sip Ee"  (尙有十二, there are still 12).  Our General Yi Sun Shin didn't lose hope even though he only had 12 ships.

271
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:18,780
The game isn't over yet. If you go to aisle B, second row, there is  Four Weddings and a Funeral's  Hugh Grant.

272
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:24,620
He stops his own wedding at the wedding hall. No one knows what will happen in the next five minutes!

273
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,600
That's life.

274
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,500
Done. That was so cool.

275
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,130
Bravo! You're so cool!

276
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,990
I'll be back after going to the public bathhouse.

277
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,990
- You're here again. 
- I'm not here to see you.

278
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,900
 Hong Jeong Ae, 28 years old. Bong Pil and she do not get along like a cat and a dog. 

279
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:46,270
 Has been living and working together with Dal Soo for two years. How inappropriate. 

280
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,740
Hey, did you get a wedding invitation from Soo Jin?

281
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,430
I saw him the other time and he's super tall and super handsome.

282
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,910
Plus, I heard he's super great at earning money?

283
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,930
Why did that tall and rich guy do such a thing?

284
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,800
Why would he ruin his youth by getting married?

285
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,350
That's why he's crazy.

286
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,710
- Hyung, I'm going.
- Okay.

287
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,600
Bye.

288
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:20,960
Hyung, did you know that when she was in second grade in elementary school, she made a big poop in the classroom.

289
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,930
Hey!

290
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,420
 In high school, three days after my birthday, it was Soo Jin's birthday. 

291
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,310
 I prepared an amazing birthday party for Soo Jin. 

292
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,550
 Then I dragged her to the party location. 

293
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:47,820
 ♫&nbsp;Happy birthday dear Soo Jin, 

294
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,840
 ♫ Happy birthday to you. 

295
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,250
  You have to blow them out. 

296
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,170
  Happy birthday, Soo Jin. 

297
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,640
  Why is it Choco Pie every year? Where's my present? 

298
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,860
 Here, present first. 

299
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,790
 Okay then. 

300
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,430
  Tada! 

301
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,630
♫  My feelings for you  ♫

302
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:37,700
♫  That I hid from you for so long might be all right  ♫

303
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,670
♫  It must not be a one-sided love  ♫

304
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,630
♫  Tell me that you want me  ♫

305
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:52,610
♫  For you, I can do anything  ♫

306
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,820
  I imagined a beautiful scene with fireworks for the finale. 

307
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,690
 I'm a little touched. 

308
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,540
 What do you think? 

309
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,840
 Thanks. 

310
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,960
 But that's when things went downhill. 

311
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,740
 Hey you rascals! What are you doing? 

312
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,760
 Hey! What are you doing? 

313
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,590
♫  Woo~ Look at me  ♫

314
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,450
 That day, I made Soo Jin go to a police station for the first time, 

315
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,290
 and I caused her to go through a police investigation for the first time, too. 

316
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,270
 And a meeting between both of our parents, unseen outside of a wedding. 

317
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,010
 It was a magnificent party. 

318
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,810
 It really was an amazing birthday party. 

319
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,900
 Would she have forgotten it? 

320
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:47,300
♫  If the growing love is the same as my heart  ♫

321
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,310
Wow.

322
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,890
Whoa, the weather today is a killer.

323
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,940
Wow.

324
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,300
Wait a minute...

325
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,870
Aigoo, really? I knew it.

326
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,850
You haven't done this in a while.

327
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,810
Yes?

328
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,590
Why are you laughing like a crazy person the moment you answer the phone?

329
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,530
She must be with her husband-to-be. Aigoo, I'm so jealous.

330
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,760
- Where are you?
 - On the mountain behind the house.

331
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,820
 What are you doing there? 

332
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,150
I came up to take photos.

333
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:04,140
But I forgot my camera, so I'm going back down.

334
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,800
What is she saying? Forget that and come to Bongbong Pub. The three of us are getting together.

335
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,770
Hey, it's urgent.

336
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,800
Okay.

337
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,430
And don't laugh like that in the mountains. People will get surprised.

338
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,120
They'll think you're crazy. Come back quickly.

339
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,240
It was good exercise.

340
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,170
It's going to take me forever to get back down.

341
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,770
- Hello. 
 - Hi!

342
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,600
It's so hot outside. Look at me sweat.

343
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,500
I climbed up the mountain to take photos and came back empty-handed.

344
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,010
- In this weather? Oh my God. 
 - I left my camera.

345
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,500
Can I get a cold glass of water please? And take our orders too.

346
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,370
Okay.

347
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,490
- Hi! 
 - Hi!

348
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,970
Congratulations on your wedding!

349
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,790
So... I tried something similar to marriage before. It's nothing special.

350
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,560
Why get married so young when you're pretty?

351
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,330
You should enjoy your life a little more and then get married later.

352
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,010
It's a waste. What do you want, coffee or a drink?

353
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,960
I'm thirsty, so give me a drink.

354
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,630
I'll trust your choice, fashionable manager, and get a drink, too.

355
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,600
I want a coffee.

356
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,860
Dal Soo doesn't like me drinking and wandering about.

357
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,630
Hey Yoon Mi, two drinks and a strong coffee please!

358
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,490
- Are you pregnant? 
 - No, it's not like that.

359
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,430
Did you know? He asked my oppa about how to stop a wedding.

360
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,190
He asked me, too.

361
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,050
Really?

362
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,490
Pil is always getting in the way.

363
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,400
Wait.

364
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,470
He wouldn't actually do what I told him to, would he?

365
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,770
- What did you tell him? 
- To kill your groom.

366
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,530
- Hey! 
 - Hey, it's just a joke.

367
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,620
But it'll be crazy if he actually does that, right?

368
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,810
You guys, really!

369
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,100
Hey. But why didn't you give Pil a wedding invitation?

370
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,070
Huh?

371
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,800
I mailed it to him.

372
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,930
Why? He lives next door to you.

373
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,970
You could throw it to him in three seconds.

374
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,480
You could reach over and give it to him.

375
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,650
I was going to give it to him in person like I did with you guys, but it was a little weird.

376
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,550
- Why? 
 - What?

377
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,720
Why do you think? Pil had a thing for her and went after her.

378
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,730
Jeong Ae, listen carefully.

379
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,120
If you were marrying Dal Soo, would you be able to give your wedding invitation to Goo Gil in person?

380
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,400
Why would I? That's so awkward.

381
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,670
Did I tell him to like me? I have no interest in him.

382
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,770
Friend, she is in the same situation.

383
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,860
Ah, I see.

384
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,530
Honestly, what am I to do about Pil?

385
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,870
At least, you're close with him. I can't stand him.

386
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,290
If it were possible to talk some sense into him,

387
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,700
I'd have made him into a better person by now.

388
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,700
Hey, there's no way about it. Just put up with it for one week.

389
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,920
Order me another drink.

390
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,660
Don't you have a mouth or hands?

391
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,960
Am I your maid? Why are you asking me to order?

392
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,200
Manager, can we get another 500 ml here?

393
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,080
   

394
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,550
I was wondering why you weren't coming.

395
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,420
I heard you caused a ruckus yesterday. What do you want, a coffee or soda?

396
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,070
 Yang Goo Gil, 29 years old, a neighborhood hyung. He's strong but simple. 

397
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,450
 Even so, he's kind. He's a good person. 

398
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,500
Forget it, I don't want anything.

399
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,950
Punk. It seems like you really are distressed.

400
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,310
I know that feeling very well. I understand you.

401
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,450
If I did things properly back then, I wouldn't be in this rubbish situation right now.

402
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:41,230
I think that too, from time to time. If only I were a little smarter back then.

403
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,160
Do you get how I feel?

404
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,430
When Jeong Ae was taken from me, I felt just like that.

405
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,820
I cried a man's tear... a lot.

406
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,480
And then when I entered the military... How old was I at that time?

407
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,910
Stop talking nonsense. Don't you have a good solution?

408
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,200
For what?

409
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,090
I have to marry Soo Jin.

410
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,890
So, don't you have a good solution?

411
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,090
Are you a thug?

412
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,990
Her wedding is a week away!

413
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,980
That's not right! That's not what a man should do!

414
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,520
Give me a solution and I'll be a thug.

415
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,720
Don't do that, you'll break the balls.

416
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,730
It's not like there isn't a way.

417
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,300
That depends on your speed. Back then, when you were in track and field, I watched you carefully.

418
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,600
Back then, when you were in track and field, I watched you carefully.

419
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,790
You have  an explosive speed,

420
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,960
but the problem is that your start is worthless.

421
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,720
Nevermind that. What's the solution?

422
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,360
Make it explosive. A speeding... violation (make a baby).

423
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,140
Ugh, you're so dirty!

424
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,830
Why? If you look at celebrity articles they all get married right after that! A speeding violation! A speeding violation!

425
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,730
So you have to be faster than him—

426
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,850
Stop making such a dirty gesture in front of me!

427
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:03,790
- What? 
 - Don't say anything. Just don't. I clearly wasn't thinking straight.

428
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,660
How is there nobody normal in this neighborhood?

429
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,190
I was crazy to ask anyone in this neighborhood for advice!

430
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,880
Hey, hey, hey!

431
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,750
Dad!

432
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,420
Dad!

433
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,690
Dad?

434
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,890
   
   

435
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,430
   

436
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,520
Now I should review.

437
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,040
You're he—

438
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,850
Oh, it's you.

439
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:05,440
Who were you expecting that your face fell immediately like that?

440
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:17,230
If you- you're n-not using this, you should turn it off.

441
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,580
You'll hike up your electricity bill.

442
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,660
What brings you here?

443
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,400
Just...  I was just going around the neighborhood.

444
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,910
Are you getting money these days from those stock photo things?

445
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,950
I upload them but they're not selling well.

446
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:39,000
Ah, well, you said you were getting married all of a sudden, so I thought you must have hit it big or something.

447
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,890
Should I give up on the civil service exam and try doing that, too?

448
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,360
If I just take some pictures and upload them on a website,

449
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,190
will I be able to, you know, make my own money?

450
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,590
You can't just take any random pictures.

451
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,920
What do you want from me?

452
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,500
Soo Jin.

453
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,630
I came to see you. What other business would I have?

454
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,020
I've been looking at only you for 28 years to the point that my eyes could fall out.

455
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,650
Even now, when I look at you, my heart beats fast. Don't you know how I feel?

456
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,620
I'm saying I love you, you stone head! You're so unaware.

457
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,700
But without even a single word to me, you're getting married all of a sudden.

458
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,380
Soo Jin.

459
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,590
Soo Jin.

460
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,170
- Soo Jin. 
 - Hm?

461
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,020
Soo Jin.

462
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,120
What are you doing?

463
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,710
- Huh? 
- What're you doing?

464
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,400
Ah! Oh gosh!

465
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,000
Why is it so hot in this studio?

466
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,420
Hey, why did you get drunk and kick up a fuss yesterday when my wedding gifts were brought in?

467
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,540
I had to tell the gift carriers that you were a close friend and appease them so much to make them understand.

468
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,380
You crazy jerk.

469
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,850
Friend?

470
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,460
Are we friends?

471
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,800
What else would we be?

472
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,010
We're friends that are practically frenemies.

473
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,770
I should have been through with you.

474
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,420
Okay, sure. But, by the way,

475
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,570
why didn't you send a wedding invitation to me?

476
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,780
You still haven't... gotten it?

477
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,970
Your father is a director of Postal Services, yet you can't even get mail delivered correctly?

478
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,830
Ah, why hasn't it reached you yet.

479
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:38,600
Hey, forget it. I don't need it anyway.

480
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,130
I live right next door. If I do get it, it'll end up in the trash anyway.

481
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,900
So, uh, are you happy that you're getting married?

482
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,050
You're really asking all sorts of things.

483
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,280
Do you think I would get married if I didn't want to?

484
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,350
You're coming to the wedding, right?

485
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,200
D-don't know.

486
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,670
I'm really busy these days. I wonder if I have time?

487
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:07,340
Hey, what other person in our neighborhood has as much free time as you?

488
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,720
You must come and congratulate me.

489
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,470
You're my best frenemy.

490
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,350
Hey, hey, hey! That's hot! Ho-

491
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,610
Oh my! What should we do? Are you okay?!

492
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,990
There's no water! What do I do?

493
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:28,760
These days, I've been through so much lately,

494
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,630
that this is nothing.

495
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,290
- I'm leaving. 
 - Wait, hold on a sec!

496
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,800
Do you want some water? Hey!

497
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,990
Oh, what to do!

498
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,950
Ugh, seriously.

499
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,540
What am I going to do with you, Bong Pil?

500
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,480
Water! Water!

501
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,520
What's wrong?

502
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,890
Should I call an ambulance?

503
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,500
No!

504
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,000
No! This can't be fixed!

505
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:24,060
"I'm in love with you." I just need to say those five words.

506
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:29,570
Not even that. I can just say "I love you."

507
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:34,740
Aigoo! I waited 28 years and let someone else have it all.

508
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,670
I can't let her go.

509
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,290
Good. Let her go.

510
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,160
Let her go.

511
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,960
Let her go! Let her go!

512
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,570
I'm letting her go!

513
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,630
 If I were you, I would feel like it's a waste to not confess once after holding your feelings in your heart for that long. 

514
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,480
No.

515
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,400
I won't ever let her go!

516
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,020
♫  Yeah yeah yeah  ♫

517
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,350
♫  Yah yah yah  ♫

518
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,150
When I'm on fire, I have to confess to her quickly!

519
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,830
I can't let her go like this.

520
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:39,980
Never! Never! Never!

521
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,810
♫  Even though I have absolutely nothing and nothing to show you  ♫

522
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,160
Perfect timing.

523
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,730
♫  My heart is full of a bent toward you  ♫

524
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,320
What was that? Does he not even recognize his own parents now?

525
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,330
Honey, I told you we should just think of a way to live happily between the two of us.

526
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,980
Here, I'll help you.

527
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,200
Okay. In this harsh world, having each other is enough.

528
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,140
Of course. Come on, let's go.

529
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,010
♫  I will go to you again  ♫

530
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,670
♫  Whoa whoa whoa whoa  ♫

531
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,600
I can stop it! I can put a stop to it!

532
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,970
I still have one week!

533
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,500
Hey! Soo Jin!

534
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,370
Soo Jin! Soo Jin!

535
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,790
Soo Jin! 
    

536
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,030
Where did she go?

537
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,950
Here. Okay.

538
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,980
Stop ringing the doorbell!

539
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,630
- Who is it? 
- Ahjumma! Ahjumma! It's Pil!

540
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,130
Can you tell Soo Jin to come out for me?

541
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,800
Soo Jin hasn't come home yet though.

542
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,890
Huh? But she left work already.

543
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,450
She must've had something else to do then. Try calling her.

544
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,330
This isn't something I can tell her over the phone.

545
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:11,400
 Then you can just call to ask her where she is and then go find her! 

546
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,020
- Oh, I could do that. 
- By the way, Pil,

547
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,230
Soo Jin's wedding is coming up so  please  don't cause any trouble for her, okay?

548
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,520
Are you listening to me? Pil! Hey!

549
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,490
   

550
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,240
Why isn't she answering the phone?

551
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,700
What's she doing that she can't pick up the phone?

552
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,530
Again. Okay.

553
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,150
 The phone of the person you are trying to reach is turned off. 

554
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,360
 Leave a message after the beep.  
 What should I do? She turned her phone off?

555
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,880
W-Why?

556
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,170
 You're he— 

557
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,130
 Oh, it's you. 

558
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,990
 What good would it be to confess? Their first night is right in front of our eyes. 

559
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,780
 Well you don't know if it'll be their first night. 

560
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,720
 That's right. 

561
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,080
F-first night?!

562
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,720
No! No, no, no! No!

563
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,130
No! No!

564
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,160
Hey, Bong Pil!

565
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,740
He must have started.

566
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,790
He ended up causing trouble.

567
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,260
He's up to no good again.

568
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,800
The neighborhood is going to get noisy again.

569
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,850
Welcome—

570
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:29,310
Can you tell me... the pharmacist here. Where is your pharmacist right now?

571
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:32,190
Okay, calm down and tell me. What are you saying?

572
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,260
I'm asking where the pharmacist that works here is right now.

573
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,720
The pharmacist that works here is  right here!

574
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,300
No! I'm talking about the young one that still has all of his hair!

575
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,140
This rude—

576
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:51,650
This is a very important and decisive moment, that a woman's life depends on.

577
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,860
There is a punk who distributed wedding invitations recently, right?

578
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,440
Wedding invitation? What wedding invita—

579
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,160
Ah, Park Jae Hyeon? He just left.

580
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,840
P-p-phone number! His number!

581
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,700
- Phone number.
- Phone number? Why?

582
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,750
Hold on. Business card. Where is his business card...

583
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,010
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

584
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,620
 Your call cannot be connected. 

585
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,980
 - Please leave a message after the tone.  
 - Oh! What is this?

586
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,380
 Your call cannot be connected. 

587
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,010
 Please leave a message after the tone. 

588
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,630
Something happened!

589
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,730
Something is definitely going on!

590
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:50,710
Excuse me, have you seen this woman?

591
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,440
Is she having an affair?

592
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,160
No, it's not that. It's more like a false marriage. But I'm in a hurry, Ajumma.

593
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,860
Are you a police officer?

594
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,030
Huh? I'm a class nine police officer.

595
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,460
A police officer is a police officer. What's a class nine police officer?

596
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,820
And no, I haven't seen this woman, so go look elsewhere!

597
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,230
No, but... Ajumma!

598
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,260
Have you really not seen this woman?

599
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,490
I said I haven't!

600
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:13,210
If she's not here, where on earth has she gone?

601
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,100
    
Thank you.

602
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,950
Excuse me, is this woman here?

603
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,450
- She's pretty! 
 - Of course she's pretty.

604
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,270
Who is she?

605
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,840
Has she not come here?
   

606
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,260
How dare you come in here?

607
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,880
- Get out! 
 - Okay!

608
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,010
But really, Ajusshi-

609
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,210
Hey! Where are you going?

610
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,390
Really, she told me—

611
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,220
I told you she's not here, so why are you wandering around?

612
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,340
- Leave! 
- Stop touching me!

613
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,840
  
 
  

614
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,390
Soo Jin! Soo Jin! Soo Jin!

615
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,800
   

616
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,590
Soo Jin. 
   

617
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:16,330
What?

618
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,830
Hey, Pil!

619
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,930
What is that smell?

620
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,240
Did you fall into a manhole?

621
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:06,920
Honestly, you're doing all sorts of things. You're terrible.

622
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:44,260
   

623
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,230
Pil!

624
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,700
You didn't have enough money?

625
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:09,080
Huh? Do you know how old we are? Yet you're still-

626
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,600
At a multi room still...

627
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,010
What are you on about?

628
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:17,840
You're always gone when I have something important to tell you.

629
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,960
You won't answer my calls, and you live next door but I can't spot you all day.

630
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,190
You always do that.

631
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,570
What's with you?

632
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,240
Excuse me—

633
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,880
You shut up! I'm talking to her right now.

634
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,660
I don't know what it is, but why don't you calm down and talk to me—

635
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:35,590
Are you her attorney? Is she yours?

636
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:41,400
Are you acting all that because you went a few bases with her in there?

637
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,240
Ah! Seriously!

638
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,540
What on earth are you saying?

639
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:50,800
I'm so angry, but why am I crying right now? This is so embarrassing.

640
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,340
What is he going on about?

641
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,830
You are a pharmacist, yet you don't have enough money, that you brought her to this kind of a place?

642
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,090
You should have taken her to a five star...

643
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,900
No, at least a four star hotel.

644
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,830
If I were you, I would've even taken out a loan...

645
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,500
Hey, stop crying and calm down.

646
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,230
I can't understand what you're saying!

647
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,630
You have one week left to your wedding.

648
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:21,060
One week. You can do it after you get married.

649
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:25,720
Couldn't you wait one week? I waited 28 years!

650
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,860
Ah, really!

651
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:33,660
You cheap multi room like jerk!

652
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,000
Oh! He's woken up. He woke up. He woke up.

653
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,340
Hey, are you awake now?

654
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,500
Where am I?

655
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,800
Hey, don't you remember fighting with the pharmacist?

656
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,730
Goo Gil brought you here because you fainted.

657
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:58,560
Why would you faint after one punch? How embarrassing.

658
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,510
Goodness.

659
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:02,200
Ah! That hurts.

660
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,270
Did I get hurt? Why is my body hurting?

661
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:07,580
Aigoo, you're fine.

662
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,740
People say those who give you pain will give you medicine. I guess he really is a pharmacist.

663
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:14,540
Gosh, if he was a doctor, we would have sent him to an operating room. What a shame.

664
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,990
Put that away.

665
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,400
Hey, where's Soo Jin?

666
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,930
Hey.

667
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,030
But still, how could you hit a person?

668
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:29,420
He's still not awake.

669
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,040
I told you he's my friend!

670
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,600
- Hey, why is she like that? 
- I'm not taking his side.

671
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,730
Hey, hey, hey!

672
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,500
- She's in a fight, because of you.
- I'll call you.

673
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,260
So, is she not getting married?

674
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,600
Quit dreaming. Are you punch drunk?

675
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,410
Hey, this isn't right. Get up. Get up. Get up. Hey!

676
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:48,980
Get all the guys to go trash his pharmacy.

677
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,260
This jerk, does he think this neighborhood is a joke? He's dead.

678
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,800
- I'm in. 
 - Hey, hey. Suing him is better.

679
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,640
He should get checked out by a doctor and handle this rationally. That'll also get him some money.

680
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,230
Violence means we have to pay; suing means we get paid.

681
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,470
What are you saying?

682
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,550
No. That's not enough to sue him.

683
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,640
Hey Pil, we could hit you in the same place and make the wound deeper.

684
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:10,830
Oh, nice Seok Tae. But it's my style to go and just trash that pharmacy.

685
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,260
Exactly!

686
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,560
This won't do. Go get some liquor for our strategy meeting.

687
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,000
- I'm in. 
- Bring it.

688
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,730
- Here, cheers. 
 - Cheers!

689
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,570
- It's been long since our family has gotten together.
- It's been long.

690
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:30,870
I shouldn't be drinking whilst I'm studying.

691
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:33,230
You don't have to study when you drink then.

692
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:36,730
- Ah, that's true. 
 - Hey. You need to quit studying already.

693
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,830
Body is better than brain. Make a living with your body.

694
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,100
Hyung, I'm still better than Jeong Ae.

695
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,600
Go on.

696
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,330
Are you kidding me? You're the bigger idiot.

697
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,240
- Are you kidding me? 
- You're the bigger idiot.

698
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,830
- Pour me another drink. 
 - Me too.

699
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:52,560
This shot glass is too small for us. Let's use bigger cups.

700
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,320
Ah!

701
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,870
- Jin Sook, now you're talking!

702
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:57,200
- Let's change them. 
 - Let's do it.

703
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,130
Bottoms up!

704
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:01,240
Let's go home. I'll take you.

705
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:04,930
We should go have a glass too. It's been a while.

706
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,000
No. You can't.

707
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,330
If you get home late, your mom calls me.

708
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:16,700
You go out to have fun with another guy, but it's my fault when you get in trouble.

709
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,230
Hey.

710
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,670
♫&nbsp;Feet came down from the sky, whose feet are they?

711
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,280
- Dog feet, sheep feet. 
 - Hey, it's almost midnight.

712
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,110
Hey, let's go quickly. I'll take you.

713
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,800
I'll carry it. You're hurt.

714
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,470
Okay, Bong Dal. You got caught.

715
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:36,030
Drink up! Drink up! Alcohol is going down well.

716
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,710
Hyung, hurry up.

717
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,400
I'm sorry.

718
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,370
For what?

719
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:46,810
Just for yesterday, today... this and that.

720
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,940
You've always been like this.

721
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,700
Why is today so long?

722
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,870
I feel like today is longer than yesterday.

723
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,780
Here.

724
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,650
I'm giving it to you now, since you didn't get one.

725
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:14,780
Whether you didn't get it or didn't want it remains to be seen.

726
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,900
   

727
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,200
   

728
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,640
Hey, Bong Pil.

729
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,190
Yeah?

730
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,730
What was the important thing you wanted to tell me?

731
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,310
I-important thing?

732
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:41,900
That's what you said earlier, that you had something important to tell me.

733
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,750
That you were wandering around, looking for me.

734
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,620
What is it? You can tell me now.

735
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:04,140
I... uh... well... that's... the truth is...

736
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,780
The truth is...

737
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:17,490
Every time I see you...

738
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,880
Every time you... see me?

739
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,230
I have to pee.

740
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,350
What?

741
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:48,530
No, that's not it! I don't have to pee whenever I see you.

742
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,530
I just have to pee right now.

743
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:54,080
I've been running around all day so I couldn't pee.

744
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,460
I'll go pee real quick.

745
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,260
What'd you just say? Hey...

746
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,670
Wh-what was that?

747
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:16,620
♫  Oh my dear, even without saying it, I know  ♫

748
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:23,100
♫  This is a heart which loves me  ♫

749
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,790
♫  It's uselessly pretending not to know  ♫

750
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,810
   
   

751
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:39,410
♫  To you,&nbsp;I didn't express&nbsp;my feelings  ♫

752
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:44,060
What I was going to say...

753
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:49,070
There are so many things I want to say that I don't even know where to start.

754
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:52,280
♫  I uselessly pretended  ♫

755
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,110
♫  I love you.  ♫

756
00:51:57,110 --> 00:52:00,490
I-I love you.

757
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:03,020
I love you.

758
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,930
I thought with just those words, everything would be alright.

759
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:10,280
But on second thought, that's still very lacking. Right?

760
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,080
What I was going to say...

761
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,970
There are too many things to say!

762
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:21,290
Just looking at you...

763
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:23,350
♫  I would like&nbsp;you to enter&nbsp;my heart  ♫

764
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:27,600
Just looking at you makes my heart beat and dance like crazy.

765
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:33,010
But what use is confessing now?

766
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:40,040
Love... This mere thing called love...

767
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,790
What can it change at this point?

768
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:50,340
♫  While whispering&nbsp;in my heart both&nbsp;today and tomorrow  ♫

769
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:59,780
♫  Will my heart be discovered loving you  ♫

770
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:05,210
♫  I pretended not to know  ♫

771
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:14,420
♫  On such a night&nbsp;when I am walking with you  ♫

772
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:19,530
♫  I'll hold your hand and say the word  ♫

773
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:26,860
♫  Both quivering lips and&nbsp;the words which say I like you  ♫

774
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:31,720
Pil, hurry up.

775
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:36,850
Pil, hurry up...

776
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,250
What's taking him so long?

777
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,560
Did something happen?

778
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:52,190
♫  Love you, love you for you  ♫

779
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,810
Pil!

780
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:59,460
Until when are you going to stay there?

781
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,830
You're still not done?

782
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,370
Hey, Bong Pil!

783
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:21,030
Bong Pil! 
  Bong Pil! 

784
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:30,060
Pil! Where are you?

785
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:36,360
Did he not come here?

786
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,730
Hey, Bong Pil! 
  Hey, Bong Pil! 

787
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,520
No way. He ditched?

788
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,300
This guy always hits me in the back of my head.

789
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:25,230
This punk.

790
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,000
   
Okay, speaking practice. Repeat after me.

791
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,590
Guten Abend, Inge.  (Good evening, Inge.) 

792
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,130
Guten Abend, Inge.  (Good evening, Inge.) 

793
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,980
Das Fräulein ist klein.  (The girl is small.) 

794
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,230
Das Fräulein ist klein.  (The girl is small.) 

795
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:58,590
Your volume is too low. 
Das Auto der Frau ist blau.  (The woman's car is blue.) 

796
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:01,300
Das Auto der Frau ist blau.  (The woman's car is blue.) 

797
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:06,060
Who's sleeping back there?

798
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:13,620
Pil! Bong Pil!

799
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:29,890
Bong Pil! Get up, you punk!

800
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,230
What the?

801
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:43,400
Oh, Gestapo.

802
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,280
What did you just call me?

803
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,270
My high school German teacher.

804
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:57,960
Totally annoying and disliked.

805
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:05,790


806
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,790
I caught—

807
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:14,140
H-hey, Soo Jin!

808
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,370
Oh. Hey!

809
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:22,660
W-what, what are you guys doing?

810
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,510
Why are you wearing your school uniforms?

811
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:36,910
 Parents' small contribution to his extra income. German teacher who has never been to Germany. 

812
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:41,330
 Gestapo, 37 years old, single. 

813
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,260
You caught it.

814
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,880
You caught my chalkboard eraser.

815
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,490
No, I mean— I didn't meant to.

816
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:54,220
Without realizing, because I got hit with it before, I caught it.

817
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,200
I did catch it but—

818
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,590
B-but, where is this place?

819
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:02,790
This place? It was a classroom just a bit ago.

820
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:06,370
From now on, it's going to become hell to you.

821
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,900
Dummkopf!  (idiot in German) 

822
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:18,610
 What is this? This messed up déjà vu? 

823
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,600
♫  Let's go and fly lightly over the blue sky  ♫

824
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,360
♫  And ride the plane which I dreamed of as a child  ♫

825
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,780
♫  I can't say anything of what I looked forward to then  ♫

826
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,090
♫  I can't say what I was thinking  ♫

827
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,360
 Where is this place? 

828
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,920
 - Seoul. 
- Seoul? 

829
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,830
 Why are there so much stuff? It's too suffocating. Let's go somewhere else. 

830
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:48,970
 Let's depart. 

831
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:54,440
 Wow~ What a completely pitiful looking face! How could he look this bad? Hahaha. 

832
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:59,290
 Is that an incoming attack? That's not good. Prepare the weapons! 

833
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:02,080
♫  Today I should fly like a plane  ♫

834
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,030
♫  This moment, from the highest point of the world, you and I should wake up  ♫

835
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:07,630
♫  As white as the clouds we see, our old dreams and talk  ♫

836
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:12,070
♫  Let's go and fly lightly over the blue sky  ♫

837
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:15,490
♫  And ride the plane which I dreamed of as a child  ♫

838
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:18,980
♫  I can't say anything of what I looked forward to then  ♫

839
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:21,360
♫  I can't say what I was thinking  ♫

840
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,100
   

841
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,960
 What if I told you I came from the future? 

842
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,940
 Then where is your present self? 

843
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,790
 I really don't want to become a high school student again! 

844
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:37,030
 I'm not lying right now. I... came from the future. 

845
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:37,590
 Liar! 

846
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:42,250
 You've always been a crazy psycho, but you're even more of a crazy psycho today. 

847
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,230
 That manhole! 

848
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,460
 It was that manhole! 

849
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,250
 Seeing him like that, he looks a tiny bit cool. 

850
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,590
 Let's go, Bong Pil! 

851
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:52,890
 Why not? Let's take over Bong Pil's history! 

852
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,790
♫  The gist of the feeling while writing this song is that I'm still concerned about you  ♫

853
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:56,700
♫  Because the rain drops  ♫
