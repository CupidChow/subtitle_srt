1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,990


2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:09,530
♫  My feelings for you  ♫

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,210
 That's right. I can't live like this. 

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,230
 I've returned to the current time period. 

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,910
 I've become a police officer that I wanted to be so much. 

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,870
  But without Soo Jin, my life has no meaning. 

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:28,420
♫  I hope that you will fall into my heart  ♫

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,590
♫  Woo~ Look at me  ♫

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,160
 Soo Jin, I'm going to change this situation. 

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,760
 No matter what, I'm going to change this situation and find you again. 

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,590
♫  If the growing love is the same as my heart  ♫

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,010
Huh?

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,820
What's this? Where did the manhole go?

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,080
This...

15
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,060
What happened here?!

16
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,110
What happened here?

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,340
W-Who did this? Who?

18
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,180
Who did this and why?!

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,220
Where is the manhole?!

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,090
That man seems crazy.

21
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,800
Don't go near him. There are a lot of weird people these days.

22
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,500
Summoning time has passed.

23
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,460
Then I can't go through the manhole anymore?

24
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,470
   

25
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,450
I've decided on this woman.

26
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,700
As expected, you have the same eye as mine for choosing a daughter-in-law.

27
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,990
I also like this woman the most.

28
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,700
It's a relief that you also like her.

29
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,950
Her impression is very good, and she works at the bank so her job is secure.

30
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,930
Both of her parents are educators, so she must have been raised very well with good manners.

31
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,700
Moreover, the fact that she wants to have babies soon is my favorite part.

32
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,310
We are now at the age when we should have grandchildren.

33
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,940
Right.

34
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,670
Our Pil's appearance is not bad at all.

35
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,870
Therefore our grandchildren... would look very handsome.

36
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,510
Since this woman is so pretty, how beautiful will their babies be?

37
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,030
I'm already looking forward to it.

38
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,880
Omo! Pil, look at this picture—

39
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,160
I won't look at them.  I won't.

40
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,180
Okay, you punk.  I won't look at you either.

41
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,470
I won't see you from now on!  You, bad punk!

42
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,080
Really! Geez!

43
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,860
Let me see...

44
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,330
   

45
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,960
   

46
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,020
   

47
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,170
   

48
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,580
Nothing comes out.

49
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,960
I need to know why they got rid of the manhole so I can think of some solution.

50
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,990
Ah, really.

51
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,080
Who takes care of the manholes?

52
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,200
Ah, right. The district office.

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,820
Right. I heard Seok Tae is working at the district office.

54
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,680
What's matter in the middle of night?

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,390
Yeah, Seok Tae?

56
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,670
I'm just calling you to ask about the manholes in our neighborhood.

57
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,470
Can I speak with you for a short time?

58
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,790
Hey, don't you know that civil servants get off of work at 6 PM?

59
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,220
If you want to talk about anything related to work, talk to me tomorrow.

60
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,600
Hey, Seok Tae! Hey!

61
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,750
You're saying I have to wait until tomorrow?

62
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,170
Ah, really.

63
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,660
I heard you went to a hospital.

64
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,150
Yes.

65
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,150
Did you hear it from that policeman?

66
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,770
Yes.

67
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,820
Jae Hyeon. I'm having a hard time these days because of you.

68
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,520
I can't eat or sleep well these days.

69
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,360
- I feel like I'm going to die at this ra—
- So?

70
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,500
- Are you going to follow me forever like this and bother me?
- Jae Hyeon.

71
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,920
Yeong Joo, I'm a married man.

72
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,500
Please stop here.

73
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,060
Jae Hyeon.

74
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,490
Do you love her more than me?

75
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,400
You don't, do you?

76
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,670
Jae Hyeon, we have a lot of good memories.

77
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,050
I did something very wrong, didn't I?

78
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,620
So you married her in a fit of anger, didn't you?

79
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,070
No, I really love my wife.

80
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,130
- To the extent you can't imagine. 
 - What?

81
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,960
If you have the time to chase me around, then get properly treated instead.

82
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,600
Jae Hyeon.

83
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,050
 If you want to park your car, then stay quietly without saying anything. 

84
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,190
What are you thinking so much about this morning?

85
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,070
Did you exercise well? You came back earlier.

86
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,010
Have a seat. Let's eat.

87
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,740
Yeah.

88
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,670
You prepared a lot in the morning.

89
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,870
It's hard for you. Prepare it simply next time.

90
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,730
You should eat a good breakfast.

91
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,220
I made the squid soup that you like.  Have some.

92
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,770
It's delicious.

93
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,460
Why are you looking at me like that?

94
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,380
Nothing.  You, who eat deliciously, look cute.

95
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,300
- Have some, too.
- Okay.

96
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,950
Oh... I don't have my cell phone.

97
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,310
Huh?

98
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,770
By any chance, did you leave it in the room?

99
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,020
No, I took it. I put it in my pocket.

100
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,180
Oh,  I must have dropped it while jogging.

101
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,430
Let me call.

102
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,750
 - The client didn't answer your call. After the beep— 
- No answer.

103
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,370
Just leave it.  I'll call later.  Let's eat first.

104
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,670
Okay.

105
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,300
- Go safely. Drive safely.
- Okay.

106
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,030
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

107
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,140
Oh!  This is Jae Hyeon's number.

108
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,030
Hello?

109
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,770
Hello? Yes, I found this phone.

110
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,320
I'm calling this number because it's the most recent number on the call list.

111
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,110
This is my husband's phone. Thank you.

112
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,610
I'll come to you to get it. Where are you right now?

113
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,510
Excuse me, are you the one who lost the cell phone by chance?

114
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,140
Yes, I am.

115
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,700
Here.

116
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,140
It was on the bench in the park.

117
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,030
I'm really thankful.  I don't know how to reward you.

118
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,770
You don't need to reward me.

119
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,670
I also live in this neighborhood. Neighbors should help each other.

120
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,980
Ah, I see.

121
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,090
In return, I'll definitely treat you to a meal if I meet you again next time.

122
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,210
Okay. Then please do so.

123
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,430
I'll get going now. Thank you very much. Bye.

124
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,420
Bye.

125
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,880
- Yes, hello? 
- Officer Bong, where are you now?

126
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,900
Well that is... while I was patrolling, there was a fight that broke out on the streets, so I'm here trying to stop it.

127
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,120
Hey Mister, let go of him so we can talk—

128
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,070
Alright then. Come back right away once you're done.

129
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,970
I will go in as soon as I'm done taking care of this situation. Alright, bye.

130
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,820
- Excuse me.
 - Yes.

131
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,660
Is there an employee by the name of Mr. Jo Seok Tae?

132
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,610
Jo Seok Tae? I think he's an employee for the Civil Engineering Department under the sewage management team.

133
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,820
Where is the Civil Engineering Department for sewage management?

134
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,780
- It's right over that way.
 - Oh okay, thank you.

135
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,410
S-seok Tae.

136
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,870
Oh, hey.

137
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,410
Seok Tae, you work for the Civil Engineering Department under the sewage management team?

138
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,720
- Here, have a drink. 
- Thanks, man.

139
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,630
Anyway... because you're in charge of manholes, I feel like I have a whole army fighting with me.

140
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,650
I think the heavens are looking out for me.

141
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,840
By the way, what's that favor you wanted to ask me?

142
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,050
Right. You know that manhole near the tunnel over there...

143
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm curious to know why that disappeared all of a sudden.

144
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,760
Oh, that manhole? We got too many civil complaints because of it.

145
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,630
They called and said that they heard strange sounds. Some say that they even saw ghosts.

146
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,830
So we blocked it.

147
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:18,960
Hey... Does it make sense that they saw ghosts in this day in age?

148
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,530
So you blocked a manhole that's perfectly fine because of those complaints?

149
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,870
What's with you? When did a cop ever take interest in manholes anyway?

150
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,690
Hey, Seok Tae...

151
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,640
Listen to what I'm about to tell you really carefully now.

152
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,950
I'm really not making this up. I'm being super serious right now.

153
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,190
At least you have to really believe me on this.

154
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,370
Isn't it hard to believe?

155
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,270
Yeah, I understand. I would also have a hard time believing if I were you.

156
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:58,950
But Seok Tae, you have to believe that such unbelievable things are happening to me right now.

157
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:06,430
So what you're saying is that you've been time traveling through the manhole that was here?

158
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,220
I've been going back and forth from the past, present, and future.

159
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,400
But you have to understand that I need this manhole to be able to time travel again.

160
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,180
Can you please restore this manhole?

161
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,650
- Hey, be honest with me.  
- With what?

162
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,680
You placed a bet with Hyung Goo Gil, right? You guys placed a bet to see whether I would believe this or not, right?!

163
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,750
What are you talking about?! I'm telling you that I'm being super serious right now.

164
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,460
Hey, I'm not the old Jo Seok Tae you used to know, so don't mess with me, okay?

165
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:38,080
I already have so much work to do this morning, yet you're talking about such nonsense. Go away, man.

166
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,970
Hey. Hey, hey, Seok Tae!

167
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,820
Let go of me and leave already!

168
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,390
Hey, Seok Tae! Please believe me!

169
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,120
Man, this is driving me crazy!

170
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:55,400
How could he believe that I'm a time traveller when I'm telling him all this out of the blue?

171
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,190
How can I convince Seok Tae?

172
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,260
What are you doing?

173
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,640
Who are you?

174
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,130
What's going on over there?

175
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,180
- Are you alright, Mister?
- I'm okay.

176
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,790
Stop right there!

177
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,520
Stop right there!

178
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,160
Hey!

179
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,270
Officer Choi, there was an assault.

180
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,340
What ridiculousness is this in broad daylight?

181
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,400
Calm down.

182
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,270
I couldn't catch him. How's the victim doing?

183
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,810
He was telling me that they got into an argument here, and the guy immediately started to punch the living daylights out of him.

184
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,160
Man, a  lot of incidents happen inside this tunnel for some reason.

185
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,850
By the way, did you get to see his face at all?

186
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,060
No, I couldn't since I was chasing him from behind.

187
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,900
Let's go back to the station for now.

188
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,610
Hold on a moment. There is something here.

189
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,160
It looks like a broken ornament.

190
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,810
This can be a useful item for evidence so let's take this with us and hand it over to headquarters.

191
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,470
Okay.

192
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,490
While you're cleaning, clean the menu too, please.

193
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,630
Let's reorganize and set up the spoon containers here.

194
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,740
- Hey, CEO Yoon!
 - Yo! What brings you here?

195
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,340
- Hey, it's been so long since I saw you wearing your camera bag. 
- Are you really busy?

196
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,660
No, not yet since it's not opening time yet. Why do you ask?

197
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,100
Yeah? Then should we go out to eat lunch together since we haven't in a long time?

198
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,370
Okay. Let's go.

199
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,100
- Thank you. 
 - Enjoy.

200
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,870
Thank you.

201
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,270
The noodle here is really good, so eat a lot. It's my treat.

202
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,310
Awesome.

203
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,570
It's tasty. It looks like you didn't pack lunch for Jae Hyeon today.

204
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,710
It seems like he has a lunch appointment with someone today.

205
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:37,970
Hey, you two look so happy together to the point where I want to live like you two when I get married.

206
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,370
Why did you bring your camera today anyway?

207
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,940
I've been feeling a bit down so I wanted to cheer myself  up while taking pictures.

208
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,940
Oh my, why are you feeling down?  You're happy everyday.

209
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,770
Sook, this is really nothing but...

210
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,940
You know, Jae Hyeon...

211
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,630
He had a little fight with some gentleman at the parking lot over parking issues yesterday.

212
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,880
That person was an older gentleman,

213
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,220
but Jae Hyeon was suddenly being informal while being angry at him.

214
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,840
And I felt a little...

215
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,600
Jae Hyeon did that? I didn't expect that from him.

216
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,190
I know, right? I was so shocked by it, too.

217
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,310
It felt like he wasn't the Jae Hyeon I know.

218
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,300
He seemed like a strange and unfamiliar person to me all of a sudden.

219
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,010
But sometimes, men get like that when they're suddenly angry.

220
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,700
- Seok Tae looks so gentle on the outside, but he is very scary when he gets mad.
 - Really?

221
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,250
And Jae Hyeon doesn't seem like a guy who would do that either.

222
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,850
Maybe that older gentleman was the one who instigated it.

223
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,870
Plus, a person needs to know how to get angry when it's necessary.

224
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,880
Otherwise people would step all over you.

225
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,900
- Is that so? 
- I thought something big happened to you.

226
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,240
- Stop worrying and enjoy the noodles. 
 - I know, right?

227
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,880
 Recently, incidents targeting the general public have been more frequent. 

228
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,760
 Incidents that happen because of lack of anger management has become a societal issue. 

229
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,680
 An assault happened in the middle of Seoul last night, targeting a complete stranger. 

230
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,560
-  And the 47-year-old Mr. Bae was severely injured and hospitalized. 
 - Is it good?

231
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,770
It's the end of the world.

232
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,590
 The police stated that the attacker,  

233
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,300
 who assaulted defenseless Mr. Kim without any reason, avoided CCTVs... 

234
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,340
Why are all these incidents happening in our area out of all places? So annoying.

235
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,460
 ... are having a difficult time tracking down the culprit. 

236
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,450
- Another incident happened inside that tunnel again. 
- Another one?!

237
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,820
Incidents are happening continuously around there.

238
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,900
It's become a crime-ridden area.

239
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,030
- Officer Bong, did you hurt your leg? 
- Ah, yes.

240
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,790
Officer Bong, you're working so hard.

241
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,310
You can go home now, we'll take care of the rest.

242
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,160
Please give me call if you need me for anything.

243
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,190
- Alright, will do. You did a good job today. 
- Keep up the good work.

244
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,820
Director, you have to partake in the meeting that will be held soon at 3 PM.

245
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,010
- Secretary Kim.
 - Yes?

246
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,250
I have a favor to ask you.

247
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,350
Jeong Ae! I made some flyers to advertise your business. Take a look at it.

248
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,650
You didn't have to do this though.

249
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,560
It looks nice, doesn't it? 
   

250
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,320
If we pass these around, your business will thrive.

251
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,260
I'll go to the intersections, pass these around, then come right back.

252
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,540
Hello there.

253
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,460
Welcome, how can I help you?

254
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,430
By chance, do you deliver?

255
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,630
Of course we do. How many cups would you like?

256
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,400
Forty cups please.

257
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,330
Forty cups?! Where should I deliver them to?

258
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,210
   

259
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,350
You should be watching over your shop, Oppa.

260
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,840
No, I'm fine. How can you deliver forty cups of drinks all by yourself?

261
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,180
Two is better than one, right?

262
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,750
I will help you.

263
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,720
♫  Everything is ready  ♫

264
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,940
♫  After getting all dressed up  ♫

265
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,970
♫  Like a fabulous view, the time for feeling thrilled has arrived  ♫

266
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:45,970
♫  It's time to fly away above the sky now and overcome fear  ♫

267
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,720
♫  Time, which was still going so fast, is left behind  ♫

268
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,730
♫  Cut out some scenes from a movie  ♫

269
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,320
♫  The director who directs the film's lead  ♫

270
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,850
Hello. Hello. Hello, hello, hello.

271
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,700
This company is so huge.

272
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,650
The female employees look so stylish and pretty. Those shoes are super expensive too.

273
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,070
Jeong Ae, you're so much prettier than them.

274
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,570
I wonder how they found out about our juice place to place an order.

275
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,120
The moment I made some promotional flyers, we are getting orders like this right away.

276
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,200
You haven't even passed them out yet.

277
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,190
I guess there is always a way to survive.

278
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,020
I'm going to try to get them to be a regular customer. We're supposed to go to the conference room, right?  Let's go.

279
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,000
Let's go. Hello there! This is Hong Juice.

280
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,200
Come on in.

281
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,470
I would appreciate it if you set the drinks in front of each seat, please.

282
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,950
Yes, don't you worry!

283
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,890
Thank you so much for ordering our juice.

284
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,830
Please contact us any time you have a meeting.

285
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,010
We'll deliver any amount. Doesn't matter if it's forty or a hundred cups.

286
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:50,020
Well... I'm not the one who ordered  the drinks. I was following my director's orders.

287
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,970
I just did what I was told to do.

288
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,980
The director?

289
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,960
Yes, come in.

290
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:03,380
Excuse me. Is the director here?

291
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,950
   

292
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:17,900
Hello, Director. We are from Hong Juice.

293
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,430
I came to greet you and give you my thanks

294
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,320
because I heard that you were the one who ordered those cups of juice.

295
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,520
You're welcome. That's not a problem at all.

296
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,650
We want to  face you and give you our thanks.

297
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:36,920
Sorry but I don't like to talk to people that I'm not familiar with.

298
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,710
Wow, our customer is so fussy.

299
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:45,160
Oh, is that right? Either way, I thank you very much.

300
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,150
Well then, please choose us again.

301
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,730
I will leave a flyer with you here.

302
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,950
You don't have to have someone else do it for you. Please contact me directly.

303
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,370
Well then, bye for now.

304
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,400
Bye.

305
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,550
Why does that director read comic books?

306
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,630
Oh, hello. We meet again.

307
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,920
I know, right? We run into each other more often since we live in the same neighborhood.

308
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,520
I guess it's destiny since we are constantly meeting each other like this.

309
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,570
I think so too.

310
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,860
By the way,  are you a photographer?

311
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,790
Oh, I'm just doing it as a hobby now.

312
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,790
My hobby is taking photos, too. I'm so glad to meet someone like-minded.

313
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,600
Oh, really? So did you major in photography?

314
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,420
- Oh, no. It's just for personal hobby.
 - Oh...

315
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,640
Now that we have met, we should go out to take some photos sometime.

316
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,360
That would be great  since it could be kind of boring taking photos alone.

317
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,870
- You told me that it was your husband's cell phone, right? 
- Yes.

318
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,010
I presume that it hasn't been too long since you got married since you look young and all.

319
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,940
Oh, yes. We're still newlyweds.

320
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,430
It must be nice.

321
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,520
Yeah, I suppose so.

322
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,460
Oh now that I think about it, I forgot to ask you for your name.

323
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,410
My name is Park Yeong Joo.

324
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,620
Oh, Ms. Park Yeong Joo.

325
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,490
My name is Kang Soo Jin.

326
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,560
Okay.

327
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:35,510
I took your photo. Do you want to see? Okay.

328
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:47,460
What's going on here... I couldn't even dig up that manhole.

329
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,450
Ow, this hurts.

330
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:11,500
 Hey, Bong Pil. From today, we're going to forget the past and be friends. Got it? 

331
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,890
 Okay? With that understanding, shake on it. 

332
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,150
 Take good care of me from here on, my friend. 

333
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,970
Hey, Pil! Are you on duty right now?

334
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,510
Yeah.

335
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,560
Hey, what's wrong with your legs?

336
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,260
I... fell.

337
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,040
What? Let me see.

338
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,130
Hey, are you alright?!

339
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,010
What should we do? You're bleeding.

340
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,640
Hey, have you gone to that hospital yet?

341
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,240
Hey, gosh! I'm asking you if you did or not?

342
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,480
Why do I have to go to the hospital for something like this? It will heal on its own if I leave it alone.

343
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,500
Don't you say that. You should have at least gotten first aid.

344
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,460
It's nothing and I'm really fine so you should go on home now.

345
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,320
What do you mean you're fine?

346
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,440
Hey, I can't just leave you like this. Follow me.

347
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,080
- Hey... Soo Jin.
- Hurry it up. Come on, hurry up!

348
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,820
You okay?

349
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,530
Jae Hyeon!

350
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,220
You're coming back from your lunch now?

351
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,490
Yeah... But why are you two coming together?

352
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,470
Pil hurt his legs but he said he doesn't want to go to the hospital no matter what, so that's why I brought him here.

353
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,830
Jae Hyeon, please treat him.

354
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,750
Oh, yeah?

355
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,070
I told you that I'm fine. I'll just go now.

356
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,620
Hey! How can you go anywhere with that leg of yours?

357
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,140
Are you not going to listen to me?

358
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,890
Let's go in for now.  I will take a look at it for you.

359
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,550
Hurry up and go in. Hurry up and go in.

360
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,940
How is he? It's pretty severe, huh?

361
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,780
Gosh, I told you that we should go to the hospital!

362
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,480
You don't need to go to the hospital.

363
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,180
Just apply this antibiotic ointment on it regularly.

364
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,050
It will heal in a few days so you don't have to worry so much.

365
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:09,130
You heard him, right? Don't skip applying the ointment regularly just because it's bothersome to you, okay?

366
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,920
How much is all this?

367
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,440
Hey, why are you talking about money?

368
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,910
I'm the one who brought you here.

369
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,700
Isn't that right, Jae Hyeon?

370
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,360
If you don't get any better even after using that ointment, make sure to go to the hospital.

371
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,550
Yes. Okay.

372
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Why did he just leave without  even thanking you?

373
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,000
Thank you, my dear husband.

374
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,470
Oh by the way, I found your cell phone.

375
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,150
Here you are.

376
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,370
Where was it?

377
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,790
I was told that it was at the park.

378
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,930
Some lady who lives in our neighborhood found it for us.

379
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,960
 Hello, this is the Civil Engineering Department, Sewer Management Team. 

380
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,150
 I was taking a walk at Rest Park, but I kept hearing weird sounds from the manhole.  

381
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,080
 Pardon? What sound? 

382
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,890
 Well that is... It sounded like a person or kind of like an animal. 

383
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,200
 Anyway, it's so scary that I can't take a walk there  anymore, so please take a look at it. 

384
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,520
 Okay, I understand. 

385
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,230
 Was that a civil complaint? 

386
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,450
 Yes. It seems like there was a weird noise coming from a manhole. 

387
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,350
 By chance, are you talking about the one that's at Rest Park? 

388
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,390
 Yes. Did you get a call as well? 

389
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,570
 Wow, that's strange. 

390
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:09,230
 I also  got a civil complaint a few days ago about some weird light coming out of there. 

391
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,170
 But when I went to check, there was nothing there. Wonder why it's happening again. 

392
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,380
 I wonder if there's an actual ghost or something. 

393
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,980
 Manager, why would there be a ghost? I will check it out today. 

394
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,740
 Okay. 

395
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,000
 It looks like there's nothing here. 

396
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,600
 Man, why is this causing trouble now? 

397
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,040
 Let's take a look here. 

398
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,780
 What the heck? There's nothing here. 

399
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,000
 What the heck is going on here?! What is this?! 

400
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,800
 What the heck is this? 

401
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,290
 What is this? 

402
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,200
 What is this? 

403
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,200
 Gosh. Creepy. 

404
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,490
 What the heck is this?! Seriously, what is this thing?! 

405
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,740
 What the? What is this? 

406
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:40,160
 Seriously. 

407
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,650
 What can it be? 

408
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,670
 What the heck is this?! No, no. 

409
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,980
 Is Pil really time traveling through that manhole? 

410
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,830
Hey, Jin Sook.

411
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:28,110
Oh, nothing much.  I think I'll be off by 6 PM tonight. Yes.

412
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,640
So delicious. You want some?

413
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:34,370
No, I'm fine. You can eat more. Just watching you eat makes me full.

414
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,900
Hey Seok Tae, what do you mean when you told me earlier that you were pissed off because of Pil?

415
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,650
I think that Pil bastard made a bet with Hyung Goo Gil about me.

416
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,880
A bet? What bet?

417
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,780
Pil was saying how he was going back and forth in time, using a manhole to time travel. Something like that.

418
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,510
What kind of bullshit is that?

419
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,760
I don't know.

420
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,110
In my opinion, he must have made a bet with Hyung Goo Gil to see if I would believe that or not.

421
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,760
He still thinks that I'm stupid.

422
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,090
This punk, Pil.

423
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,730
Should I go and smack him for you?!

424
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,260
No, you don't need to.

425
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,620
But there is this one thing that's bothering me though.

426
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,070
I told you that something strange happened with the manhole in our neighborhood, right?

427
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,400
Oh, yeah... That manhole that's no longer there?

428
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,260
Yeah. I was thinking perhaps that manhole invoked some strange effects,

429
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:25,760
making it possible to time travel, no?

430
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,400
Oh, Seok Tae. You are such a naive guy,

431
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,130
and that's why Pil is constantly fooling you.

432
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,300
Didn't I tell you that you were hallucinating because your body is so weak?

433
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,300
Right? It's all bullshit, right?

434
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,660
Seok Tae. Don't believe what anyone else tells you from now on. Just believe in what I say. Got it?

435
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,160
Okay, I will.

436
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,170
Eat up. You're so cute.

437
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,870
What now?

438
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,770
But it's strange though.

439
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,240
 Hey, are you alright?! 

440
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,090
 What should we do? You're bleeding. 

441
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:16,160

We are supposed to return to being friends,

445
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,770
but why is it so hard for me?

446
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,000
I can't be having such a hard time forgetting about you.

447
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,110
But it's still really hard for me.

448
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:48,600
To accept the fact that you're a married woman now

449
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,610
is hard for me because I'm not emotionally ready yet.

00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,500
   

466
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,380
♫  Like a fool  ♫

467
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,830
 I'm okay. Don't worry. 

468
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,130
Who was that?

469
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,960
Huh? It was Pil.

470
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,740
He said he is much better now because of the ointment you gave him.

471
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,650
- Soo Jin. 
- Yeah?

472
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,300
Have you ever liked Pil?

473
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,330
Huh?

474
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,960
It seemed like he liked you a lot.

475
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,070
So I was curious how you felt about him. Did you ever see Pil as a man?

476
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:04,500
What are you talking about? Pil is just a friend to me.

477
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,680
Yeah? But why do I feel like you don't think of Pil as just a friend?

478
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,750
What are you talking about, Jae Hyeon?

479
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:22,660
The way you look at Pil and your actions towards him seem a bit unusual to me.

480
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,540
Jae Hyeon, that's seriously a misunderstanding.

481
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,900
Pil is really no different from my other family members like Sook or Jeong Ae.

482
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,310
We treated each other  like family because we lived next to each other ever since we were little kids.

483
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,720
So that's why we must have looked so much closer.

484
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,980
Is that so?

485
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,800
I trust you.

486
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,310
So I think that you won't do anything to disappoint me.

487
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,270
Of course.

488
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,570
Oh there is no more kiwi that my Soo Jin likes. Let me go bring some.

489
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,820
No, I will bring them.

490
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,400
 - Where was it?
-  I was told that it was at the park. 

491
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,580
 Some lady who lives in our neighborhood found it for us. 

492
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,340
Here you go. Jae Hyeon, what are you looking at?

493
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,620
Oh, I was just looking at your pictures.

494
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,710
By the way, who is this woman?

495
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,630
Oh, it's her! She's the lady who found your cell phone.

496
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,140
I met her coincidentally while I was taking photos in the neighborhood yesterday.

497
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,790
Oh, yeah?

498
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,730
Hey, Seok Tae.

499
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,860
Hey, what are you doing over here, Pil? Were you waiting for me?

500
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,730
Hey, Seok Tae.

501
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,800
I have nobody else but you to ask for this favor. Let's go have a talk somewhere.

502
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,480
About what?

503
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,090
Hey, you're going to talk about that again, right?! Then forget it. Leave.

504
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,300
It's true! What do I have to do for you to believe me?

505
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,200
- Should I get on my knees for you? 
- Forget it! Just leave already!

506
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,400
Hey, Seok Tae! There is a saying that you fulfill the dead's wishes, yet you can't listen to a friend's favor?

507
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,600
Hey, you have to save me. Seok Tae, please.

508
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,160
- Just go! Shut up!
 - Seok Tae, please!

509
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,760
Hey, Seok Tae! Hey, Jo Seok Tae! Please hear me out!

510
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,880
Did he seriously go mad?

511
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,410
Hey, shut up! Hurry up and leave!

512
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,040
Hey!

513
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,450
What am I supposed to do now?

514
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,800
 No, I really love my wife. 

515
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,220
 To the extent you can't imagine.  

516
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,280
 We're still newlyweds. 

517
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,740
 It must be nice. 

518
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,470
 Yeah, I suppose so. 

519
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,740
Jae Hyeon.

520
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,160
Jae Hyeon! Jae Hyeon...

521
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,470
Jae Hyeon! Jae Hyeon!

522
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,420
Miss, please open up the door.

523
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,740
I think something went on in there, but she won't open the door.

524
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,970
Oh my.

525
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,790
Oh, miss. What's going on in there?

526
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:28,480
Is there a tool to open it with?

527
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,160
Miss! We know you're in there, so please open up!

528
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,630
What should we do?

529
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,580
Please, miss. Open up the door please, miss.

530
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,790
Oh my.

531
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,430
Miss! If you're there, please open up!

532
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,380
Man, why doesn't this just break?

533
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,820
Seok Tae, if you can't help me with this, then I will break it.

534
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,070
Patrol office?

535
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:29,180
- Yes.
 - Officer Bong, sorry if I'm interrupting your rest.

536
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,820
No, you're fine. What's this in regards to?

537
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,670
Remember the lady who secluded herself in her apartment the other day?

538
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:38,160
I've been told that there have been sounds of things breaking in that apartment.

539
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,940
I'm sorry but I was wondering if you could go check it out?

540
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,290
You... want me to go right now?

541
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,700
If it's a hassle for you, I can just go myself.

542
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:53,060
No, it's okay.  I will- I will go and check it out right now.

543
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:57,290
Officer Bong, I'm sorry about this. I will treat you out to a meal next time. Thanks for your help.

544
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,720
Okay.

545
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:06,850
I have to wrap up this manhole business with Seok Tae once and for all,

546
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:09,860
but why is there so much to do?

547
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,040
Jae Hyeon.

548
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,920
Let's go somewhere and talk.

549
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,950
Can we just talk here?

550
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,000
Jae Hyeon.

551
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:53,570
Huh? What is that pharmacist bastard doing here?

552
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:56,880
Hold on a minute.

553
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:09,310
Jae Hyeon. What's wrong with you?

554
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:13,250
I've been talking to you in a nice way, so you didn't take me seriously, did you?

555
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,330
Why are you hovering around Soo Jin, huh?

556
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,550
What are you talking about?

557
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:25,470
You took my cell phone on purpose to meet with  Soo Jin, right?

558
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,800
What were you going say to Soo Jin? Huh?!

559
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,910
No.

560
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:35,920
I did that because I was curious about what kind of woman she was.

561
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,670
Please, Jae Hyeon...

562
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:51,080
Jae Hyeon... Jae Hyeon...

563
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,960
You know how I change when I get really angry, don't you?

564
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,730
If you meet with Soo Jin one more time,

565
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,960
I'm not going just let you be, so you better straighten up your act.

566
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,870
Where were you coming from?

567
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,370
What can I do for you?

568
00:47:55,370 --> 00:48:00,550
I went over to Ms. Park Yeong Joo's house earlier, and I saw you taking her somewhere.

569
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,070
So?

570
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,870
Didn't you say it was over between you two?

571
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,620
I met with her because I had something to say to her.

572
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,610
If you had something to say, you could have done it in front of her place.

573
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,210
Why did you have to drive somewhere?

574
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:12,200
On top of that, you did it forcefully.

575
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,600
I just gave her a ride home, that's all.

576
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,920
What are you so suspicious about?

577
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,850
Are you afraid that I'm going to cheat on Soo Jin or something?

578
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:25,210
Who knows what you might do behind other people's backs?

579
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,380
The thing that you said about Ms. Park being a stalker, is that even really true?

580
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:36,000
You don't think she's doing that because you're constantly giving her room to do that?

581
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,270
Think however you want to think. You won't believe what I tell you anyway.

582
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:51,000
It would be great if you don't say anything to Soo Jin that will cause a misunderstanding.

583
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,460
 But why do I feel like you don't think of Pil as just a friend? 

584
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,860
 What are you talking about, Jae Hyeon? 

585
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:28,850
 The way you look at Pil and your actions towards him seem a bit unusual to me. 

586
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,860
   

587
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:46,420
Hey, Pil. What's going on?

588
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,500
Soo Jin, do you have time some time to spare right now?

589
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,100
We need to meet up and have a talk.

590
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,720
Right now?

591
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,070
No, I'm busy right now. If you have something to tell me  just say it over the phone.

592
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:00,260
I can't talk about this with you over the phone.

593
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,180
Please spare a little bit of your time. All I need is a few minutes.

594
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:46,900
♫  Since love came and knocked on my heart  ♫

595
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:52,060
 Sitting here really makes me feel good. 

596
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,680
 Other kids don't know about this place. I discovered it. 

597
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,740
 - This spot belongs to you now.
 - Really? 

598
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,120
 Of course! I won't let the other kids sit here. 

599
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:13,130
♫  My heart is pounding, smiling broadly I whisper to myself  ♫

600
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,960
♫  You are the so-called feeling  ♫

601
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,390
 I missed the chance... 

602
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,720
  to say it. 

603
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,160
♫  Because you are my half which  ♫

604
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,680
 You were always there by my side, 

605
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:35,170
 so I thought whenever I made up my mind, 

606
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,800
 I would be able to say it. 

607
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,310
♫  Because you are the love that is always beside me, it's good  ♫

608
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:48,900
 That I like you. 

609
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:55,800
 I should have said it while we were at that beach. 

610
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,880
 Because I wasn't able to say it that day, 

611
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,310
♫  My heart is pounding, smiling broadly I whisper to myself  ♫

612
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,740
 I really regret it. 

613
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:13,050
 Fine then! Let's get married! 

614
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,090
 Huh? 

615
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:18,310
 You said that you'd be normal again after you're able to go back through that manhole. 

616
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,900
 So let's get married. 

617
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:27,260
♫  You are the so-called feeling  ♫

618
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,720
♫  You are the small tremor  ♫

619
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,790
 What would I be once you go back to normal again? 

620
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,530
♫  Because you are my half which  ♫

621
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:39,790
 Oh... oh. 

622
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:45,870
 Just... you'd be exactly the same. 

623
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:49,570
 You'll be waiting for me. 

624
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:53,070
♫  Because you are the love that is always beside me, it's good  ♫

625
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,990
 You'll also be preparing for the wedding as well. 

626
00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:02,930
♫  I love you. I love you. Love for you  ♫

627
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,380
♫  I will confess my feelings a little later  ♫

628
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:09,010
 We really had many experiences together here. 

629
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:12,930
 There is still no one by my side, 

630
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:16,160
 but at your side, you have someone. 

631
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,760
♫   I must have fallen for you  ♫

632
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,700
♫  Because I love you, only you can be seen  ♫

633
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:33,320
♫  Even today, I'm falling more for you  ♫

634
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,480
Pil.

635
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,240
Oh, you're here.

636
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,390
What's going on this late at night?

637
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,290
Oh. Well...

638
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,300
Honestly, today...

639
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:15,220
Soo Jin. How much did you know about Jae Hyeon before you married him?

640
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,990
What do you mean out of the blue?

641
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:21,430
I was wondering if you knew him well enough before you married him.

642
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:24,830
What is it that you want to say?

643
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,650
Okay, I'll be frank.

644
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,720
I don't know if Jae Hyeon is a good person or not.

645
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,740
On the outside, he treats you well, but I'm positive there's something you're not aware of.

646
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:41,410
Pil. Jae Hyeon is my husband.

647
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:46,440
I probably know Jae Hyeon better than you do.

648
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,290
- Yes, but Soo Jin-
 - I asked you for a favor.

649
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:53,520
To respect the person I've chosen.

650
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,320
The way you are, it doesn't help me one bit.

651
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:03,750
Perhaps, is it because you want my relationship with Jae Hyeon to turn out badly?

652
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:09,920
It's not like that. I want you to be happy more than anyone else.

653
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,490
So why would I do that to you?

654
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:15,740
If you want me to be happy,

655
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,980
don't speak ill of Jae Hyeon in front of me in the future.

656
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,320
I don't know what you want to say,

657
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,920
but no matter what I'm going to believe in Jae Hyeon.

658
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,970
Even if Jae Hyeon did something wrong,

659
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,700
I'm the one who would shield him.

660
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:52,090
If you keep doing this, even the good memories we have will end.

661
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:57,110
So, Pil, please stop.

662
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:09,470
This is the last time that I will come out to see you late at night, too.

663
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:15,490
I came to tell you this. I'll be going now.

664
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,200
I'm here!

665
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,780
Oh, what's going on here?

666
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,680
Ahjussi, you drank a lot again!

667
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,220
I did again and that's why I'm here again. I will sleep here tonight then leave.

668
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,390
Where are you going?

669
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,990
Ahjussi, we really don't have any rooms tonight.

670
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,910
I will take you home, so let's go.

671
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:10,280
Do you know how scary my wife is when I go home?

672
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,020
Why do you always tell me to go home?

673
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,070
I'm going to sleep here tonight then leave.

674
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:19,920
Your wife is in there!

675
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,520
- My wife is... Shh. 
- Hurry on.

676
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,220
- I'm going. 
- Okay, go quickly.

677
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,260
Be careful.

678
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:29,550
He'll be okay, right? It's not the first or second time.

679
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,120
Of course.

680
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,830
Don't drink anymore either!

681
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:45,580
Hey, manhole. I really... need to go back.

682
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:49,710
You're telling me to live this way?

683
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:57,600
Let's see if you win or I win.

684
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:53,330
It's not summoning me this time again.

685
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:56,590
If this continues, it's really over.

686
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,850
Gosh, my head.

687
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,930
I'm so sleepy.

688
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,230
But I should sleep at home.

689
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,370
Man, I should really quit drinking. I'm dying.

690
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:36,330
Let's see if I drink starting tomorrow.

691
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:38,530
Director Choi, that bastard.

692
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,590
What was that?

693
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,590
I don't have anything.

694
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,880
Of course.

695
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:03,800
Yes.

696
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:12,420
Okay. And Jeong Ae, sleep well and dream of me.

697
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:17,760
No, dream about pigs. Yes, dream about pigs.

698
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,930
Okay, good night.

699
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,130
What's going on?

700
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,920
Yeah, Hyung.

701
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,210
Hey, Pil. T-t-there's someone beating a person here.

702
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:03,600
An assault?

703
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,940
Yeah.

704
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,380
Where are you?

705
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:11,980
T-this is... the alley behind the supermarket.

706
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,730
Pil, wait a second.

707
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,320
A-are you okay? Oh. Okay, okay.

708
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,210
Oh no, look at your face.

709
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,980
Who are you?

710
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,290
You bastard!

711
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,470
Hello? Hyung. Hyung Goo Gil!

712
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,460
 Hyung, can you hear me? Hyung, what's going on? 

713
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,940
 Hyung, are you okay? Hyung? 

714
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,730
Hyung!

715
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:37,580


716
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:40,120
Hyung.

717
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:49,120
Hyung! Hyung Goo Gil!
