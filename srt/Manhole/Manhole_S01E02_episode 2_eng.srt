1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,260
   

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,970
Ah... he really is hitting me in the back of my head.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,140
What kind of person is he?

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,450
He threw away my wedding invitation and also abandoned me.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,980
He's not even answering my calls.

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,950
Ah, really.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,680
Hey! Pil is there, isn't he?

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,360
 Of course, I like it. 

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,690
You took him, you wench!

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,940
What?

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,810
 - He is not there? 
- Ah really!

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,760
Be quiet!

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,580
What?

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,110
What? Did you lose him in the middle of taking him?

15
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,980
This crazy punk ran away on the way home, abandoning me!

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,640
Don't you know how to get to your home or where your home is?

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,310
Just go home by yourself! He's really in terrible shape these days.

18
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,900
If you find Pil, send him here so I can give him a drink.

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,190
Ah, really!

20
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,910
Hey, hang up!

21
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,150
Hey, you clean up first then play games!

22
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,050
- Come close. 
 - You start first.

23
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,300
He's really a funny punk!

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,410
He's always like this, unpredictable!

25
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:09,600
He really doesn't get along with me since a long time ago.

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,800
He is not suitable for me... since a long time ago.

27
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,990
Even if we're born again, we wouldn't be suitable for each other.

28
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,950
We're not a good match at all.

29
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,970
   

30
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:29,900


31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,310
  
 Your friend was too rude, but I'm sorry that I hit him. 

32
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,510
  Call me when you feel better. 

33
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,950
   

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,220
Pick up the phone.

35
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,520
Pick up the phone.

36
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,550
 Call me. 

37
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,560
 If you don't call me right away, I won't see you again. 

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,490
 You're really dead. 
 I have something to tell you! 

39
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,590
Really.

40
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,240
 Okay, I don't give a damn, you punk. 

41
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,850
 Live well yourself!
Dang! 

42
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,450
Your son stayed away last night.

43
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,650
What do you mean?  I don't have a son.

44
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,770
I'm correcting myself. Your ex-son.

45
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,290
We'll have a big trouble if we lose our appetite in the morning.

46
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,830
So let's enjoy our breakfast.

47
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,500
You're right. Let's enjoy our meal.

48
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,690
Try this. This one.

49
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,000
Mmm, it tastes very good.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,730
   

51
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,320
Huh? There is no strawberry?  It's the most basic ingredient for juice.

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,420
That's impossible. Why isn't it here?

53
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,380
It's not here. You have to come back with it.

54
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,530
Yes. I'll bring it right away.

55
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,700
That's why I felt like something was missing somehow.

56
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,130
It's strange.

57
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,200
I still feel like something is missing.

58
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,210
Ah, it's refreshing.

59
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,220
Instead of the bone rank system...

60
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,590
Huh? Why is there only this much?

61
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,700
Ah, seriously!

62
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,270
What is this?
   

63
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,950
Something is missing!
   

64
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,310
Where did it go? It was here until yesterday.

65
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,280
Oppa Dal Soo, have you seen my scrub towel?

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,030
I'm sure I left it here.

67
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,210
Here, here.

68
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,940
What is this? Why is the soup base not here?

69
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,300
I feel something missing.

70
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,170
Come to think of it...

71
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,850
Come to think of it, I don't see Bong Pil.

72
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,860
W-well... Teacher... It's been a while since I saw you so I'm glad to see you...

73
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,340
But... I should not be here...

74
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,300
This r-really doesn't make any sense.

75
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,550
I know.

76
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,750
I'm also against having track and field athletes come into morning classes because they only interrupt the class.

77
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,950
Especially if it's you, the worst track and field athlete of all time.

78
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,490
Well... Ah... This...

79
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,350
This... is a d-dream, isn't it?

80
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,580
You're still wandering around in the dream, Pil, huh?

81
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,820
What did you call me earlier? Totally annoying and disliked Gestapo?

82
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,320
I always request something before I give you a love-punishment, don't I?

83
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,780
Memorize the definite articles and indefinite articles from case 1 to 24.

84
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,850
Teacher, I'm asking for a time-out.

85
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,700
I... don't give a damn about the definite articles or the indefinite articles at all.

86
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:47,150
For me... I'm really wondering why I'm here and why you're here.

87
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,860
Do you want to escape this crisis right now by pretending you're crazy, Pil?

88
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,310
Ah, really.  Y-yes. I'm really going crazy and nuts.

89
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,380
But... how would I know what I didn't know ten years ago?

90
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,320
And why are you going to hit me again with the rod you hit me with ten years ago?

91
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,840
You, really.

92
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,630
Hit the dirt!

93
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,380
T-t-teacher! T-t-teacher!

94
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,230
Ah, it hurts!

95
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,470
Stay still! Stay still!

96
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,080
♫ The memory that was stuck deeply like a thorn

97
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,750
♫ Even when it hurts,

98
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,270
♫ Not being aware that it hurts.

99
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,650
Wow. This is too ruined. I don't think this will cover this up.

100
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,050
It's still a mystery why a person on the track team, who attends the morning class, always gets beaten up.

101
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,340
Hyung, here is your lunchbox.

102
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,810
Thank you.

103
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,580
Pil, I'll open your lunch for you.

104
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,340
Hyung, this— this is a joke, right?

105
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,420
Of course. When you were against Gestapo and got hurt only this much, it's a joke.

106
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,080
And still, kids from our neighbor have some guts, don't they?

107
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,580
Right.

108
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,190
Ah, really!

109
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,540
I know where this place is.

110
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,640
But why are we here?

111
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,420
Is this question based on the ontology?

112
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,320
You lunatic!

113
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,640
Hyung, we already graduated a long time ago.

114
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,370
Hyung, why are you acting like this? It's scary.

115
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,880
This punk must have had his head beaten up as well.

116
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,440
- Hey, check it out.  
- Come here. Come.

117
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,340
Turn your head this way.

118
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,610
- Which side? Where?
 - Did your head get beaten up?

119
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,820
Ah... a flip phone...

120
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,850
It's really been a while.

121
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,150
2007, it's just ten years ago.

122
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,690
Did I go crazy?

123
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,450
My thigh is hurting this much, so it can't be a dream.

124
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,930
Hey!

125
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,950
What are you doing?

126
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,350
When you always get beaten up, why do you look so depressed?

127
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,150
Aren't you going to go to training?

128
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,110
Jin Sook.

129
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,400
Since you're the smartest among us, let me ask you something.

130
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,080
What question?

131
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,000
Do you believe in "time travel?"

132
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,240
You mean time travel?

133
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,470
If I came from the future...

134
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,810
Then where is your present self?

135
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,140
You said you came from the future.

136
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,510
Then it makes sense if two of you are here because   you and the present self exist at the same time.

137
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,850
That's right.

138
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,870
Ah, only one of  you  already gives us enough trouble.  But if two of you exist here...

139
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,300
that would be a world disaster, right, Future Kid?

140
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,440
Geez. Lunch time is over. Don't talk nonsense and go run.

141
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,380
Properly, diligently, please! Your hand!

142
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,650
Came from future? Yeah right.

143
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,070
 Is that so? 

144
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,980
 Then what on earth is going on? 

145
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,550
 How can I understand this situation? 

146
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,150
 Then what is this? 

147
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,920
 Was this all dream then? 

148
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,320
 I've dreamed for ten years until  Soo Jin's wedding, so vividly like this? 

149
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,720
Stretch your legs.

150
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,990
Stretch more!

151
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,710
 I've given up on track and field so long ago. 

152
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,580
 What is going on here? 

153
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,630
Bong. Bong!

154
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,450
This punk. His coach is calling him, and he doesn't even hear me. Is he out of his mind?

155
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,380
Hey you!

156
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,760
What are you doing instead of getting ready?

157
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,340
What are you looking at?

158
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,690
Kid, listen to me carefully.

159
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,660
Once you start running, your acceleration power is awesome.

160
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,280
But your start is way slow.

161
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,430
When everyone starts running, you then raise your butt. You think that's fine?

162
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,490
 That's right. My start was always late. 

163
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,680
 My start was always the problem. 

164
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,650
Huh?

165
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,050
Focus, focus and look at my eyes.

166
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,240
How many times have I told you?

167
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,590
For short distance, you need quick reflexes.

168
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:22,770
It's instant. The start is an instant and that instant decides everything. Got it?

169
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,720
He's always asleep.

170
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,010
Look over this way.

171
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,140
What are you doing? You're studying?

172
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,760
What... You have a camera? Take it again.

173
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,460
Hold up, hold up. Hey, hey!

174
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,210
Did you buy it? It's brand new. Let me see.

175
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,540
No, I wanted to borrow it but I was told I could have it.

176
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,530
When we go to the concert this weekend,  let's take bunch of pictures of our boys, okay?

177
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,720
Hey! Alright, deal.

178
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,530
Don't the photos look awesome?

179
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,380
Why would someone just give this to you when it's so brand spanking new?

180
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,560
There is someone but I can't tell you who.

181
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,290
What the heck? Who is this person?

182
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,630
A boy from church? Did you decide to date him after all?

183
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,470
What are you talking about?

184
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,750
Now concentrate, boys! Get ready, get set, go!

185
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,790
That's right, boys. Good job! Just run!

186
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,860
- What the heck. 
 - Coach.

187
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,420
- Yes? 
 - I want to quit track and field.

188
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,140
Are you messing with me, boy? You little...

189
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,160
What's going on?

190
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,730
Wow, Bong Pil...

191
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,950
Pil can't even run for crap but why is he so darn popular?

192
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,320
Honestly, everyone else likes him but you.

193
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,310
Pil likes you. He's been playing pranks on you since elementary school.

194
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,640
He likes me? Yeah right.

195
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,770
He never told me that he liked me anyway.

196
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:05,070
Does he need to spell it out for you? When someone gives you a hard time, then it means he likes you.

197
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,570
Honestly, it's not easy for someone to tell a friend that he likes her.

198
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,410
It's possible for him to lose a friend if something goes wrong.

199
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:21,570
What the? Do you like Pil or something?

200
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,230
Girl, what the heck?

201
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,880
Look, I don't have any feelings of like and dislike. We are friends after all.

202
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,650
To me he is... how should I say this?

203
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,280
Oh, he's like the existence of this desk.

204
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,740
Liking him nor disliking him isn't the problem.

205
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,140
It has everything to do with whether I'm comfortable or not.

206
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,800
Comfortable or not?

207
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,360
Then Pil is...

208
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,990
a very uncomfortable desk to me.

209
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,850
 I'm telling you that you can't! 

210
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,570
He is a short distance runner but his start off is so slow.

211
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,980
All he has going for him is that crazy ass speed.  He doesn't have skill.

212
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,250
You should learn how to play pool like me.

213
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,040
You don't have to run in the hot sun but  play it under the air conditioning. Isn't that great?

214
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,790
Right. It's so obvious that there is a limit to running a 100 meter course.

215
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,850
There's no way that someone can run within nine seconds.

216
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,650
It is impossible for any human to do that.

217
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,460
Pil does have a tendency to go for the impossible, now that I think about it.

218
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,140
When we were little, he was racing you for who could eat 5 whole fried chickens first,

219
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,890
but he ended up in the hospital.

220
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,130
Dude, never play around with food.

221
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:39,290
This guy is even more competitive than the swimmer Park Tae Hwan.

222
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,450
He should get a gold medal for that.

223
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,110
Have you guys seen me anywhere else?

224
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,290
I'm not talking about me over here. What I mean is another version of me elsewhere.

225
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,280
Listen to me carefully.

226
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm not making this up, guys. I am...

227
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,270
The truth is... I am from the future.

228
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,570
You're making it up.

229
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,610
I don't know how I should explain this really.

230
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:18,070
The me that you're seeing now is not the current me, but I'm from ten years in the future.

231
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,330
But that doesn't mean that I'm not the Pil that you know of. I am Pil indeed..

232
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,010
As I was running I was able to feel my old body again.

233
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:33,080
Even though I haven't done this in ten years, I still have the pose and the speed. I am far from that now.

234
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,040
But...

235
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,610
Please listen to me for Christ sake! I'm being serious here!

236
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:46,370
I know for certain that I was walking Soo Jin home yesterday...

237
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,960
Man, this is driving me nuts.

238
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,880
Soo Jin.

239
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,140
Hey!

240
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,560
Hey...

241
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,840
Hey, Soo Jin!

242
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,000
Ah!

243
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,700
You alright?

244
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,110
Hey, what am I going to do?

245
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,700
Just stay put and don't move.

246
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,930
I was running over this way.

247
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,380
Okay, okay.

248
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,690
Don't move around. Don't move and just stay put.

249
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,880
I... it's not that I meant to do it.

250
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,150
I know, I know. It's alright.

251
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,610
It'll be alright.

252
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,810
It's dangerous here, so let's get up, okay?

253
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,000
- What am I going to do? 
 - It'll be alright.

254
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,710
Alright, be careful now.

255
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,540
I'm scared.

256
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,580
What are you doing? What's that sound?

257
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,150
Now I remember.

258
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,840
  The day Soo Jin, who broke whatever she touched, broke the giant mirror at school. 

259
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,080
 What did I do at this very moment anyway? 

260
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,440
 You just go in. Nothing will happen to you. 

261
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,420
You just go in. Nothing will happen to you. Okay?

262
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,400
What?

263
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,070
Hey...

264
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,720
Hey...

265
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,360
What is this doing over here like this, eh?

266
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,340
I... broke it.

267
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,970
Why?

268
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,770
Well, umm... I usually, umm... Oh yeah!

269
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,350
- My start timing is slow...
- Yeah.

270
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,250
I thought that perhaps, it might be because of this start gun...

271
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,150
so I ended up kicking this thing and then like this...

272
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,860
Come here, you little punk!

273
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,110
- Follow me! 
  - Darn it. 

274
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,060
Yes.

275
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,240
Follow me to my office!

276
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,680
What are you scared of, kid?!

277
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,200
Ow.

278
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,180
Why are you hitting me, you punk?!

279
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,570
This track and field runner is also considered a student of this school, right?

280
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,140
As the director of this school, I can't just let this go.

281
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,500
He also was running like a crazy person in the hallway last time too.

282
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,320
Then he ran directly into the principal and so he ended up going to the hospital, you know.

283
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,200
What can we do when this boy just wants to do some running?

284
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,980
That's why he is a part of the track and field team.

285
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:10,210
But he shouldn't be rashly running around everywhere, right?

286
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,700
He is in the prime of his youth though.

287
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,970
Look at our Pilly boy looking so youthful and glowing.

288
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,980
He is in the prime of his youth, because he is running around rashly!

289
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,930
You should know better.

290
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh, is that right?

291
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,270
You are so young that you don't hurt when I do this, right? Right? Right? Right?

292
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,930
Does it hurt?

293
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,870
It hurts!

294
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,210
You little... Look here boy...

295
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,550
- You around the track—
- 50 laps?

296
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,650
You little punk. Are you reading my mind now?

297
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,720
Pil, 100 laps.

298
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,830
100 laps?!

299
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,670
 It was 50 laps ten years ago. Darn it. 

300
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,030
 It changes too. 

301
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,950
Start!

302
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,510
Okay fine! Youth!

303
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,040
When you write in a fanciful way without any conditions, the sentence can end up losing grammar.

304
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:09,740
Once you make sure to find relations with the word

305
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:15,360
then you bring it to life by thinking of a concept to set a phrase which is good.

306
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,740
No homework today.

307
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,410
- You all go home now.
 - Yes, ma'am!

308
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,060
♫  My feelings for you  ♫

309
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:53,930
♫  That I hid from you for so long might be all right  ♫

310
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:59,000
♫  It must not be a one-sided love  ♫

311
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,010
♫  Tell me that you want me  ♫

312
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,280
♫  For you, I can do anything  ♫

313
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,920
He must be hot.

314
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,950
♫  Don't avoid it and show me your heart  ♫

315
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:22,480
♫  I hope that you will fall into my heart  ♫

316
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,820
♫  Woo~ Look at me  ♫

317
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,170
Seeing him like that,

318
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,580
he's a little bit cool.

319
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,200
Just a little bit.

320
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,720
♫  Only you are the one who makes me smile  ♫

321
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,240
 I was walking Soo Jin home last night. 

322
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,970
  I received a wedding invitation from Soo Jin,  

323
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,140
 I was thinking to make my first and last confession. 

324
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,630
 I suddenly felt the need to pee so in front of the tunnel, in front of the street lamp... 

325
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,850
Oh, that's right. The man-manhole...

326
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,650
It's the manhole.

327
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,290
Manhole, it's the manhole.

328
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,240
It was the manhole!

329
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,290
Goodbye.

330
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,130
Hey, Pil! Bong Pil!

331
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,600
Oh, where is he running to like that?

332
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,670
When I've finally dug up some information that he wanted.

333
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:48,830
You manhole, hey.

334
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:53,520
Hey! Hey! Hey, manhole!

335
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,480
What to do? Why isn't it working?

336
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,630
Swallow me up again!

337
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,050
Do I have to perform some kind of ritual? Please, I pray to you.

338
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,180
Hey manhole! Come on!

339
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,730
Man, I really don't want to become a high school student again!

340
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,710
Hey, you wretched manhole!

341
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,070
There's no way. Do I have to live the same life twice?

342
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,370
This life that won't even start?!

343
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,640
Why are there only pictures of Seok Tae?

344
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,270
Oh, here it is.

345
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,160
What do I write?

346
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,200
June 20, 2007.

347
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:54,960
The day you ran 100 laps on the track!

348
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,710
- What are you doing? 
- Oh, you scared me!

349
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,720
You surprised me.

350
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,930
Hey, it's good you came.

351
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,820
Here, pictures of you.

352
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,390
Thank you.

353
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,990
Let's go.

354
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,520
Hope it arrives well.

355
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,450
There.

356
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,420
Soo JIn.

357
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,320
- I'll carry this for you. 
 - No, it's okay.

358
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,820
- No, I'll carry it for you. 
 - It's not heavy.

359
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,320
I'll carry it for you!

360
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,960
Thanks.

361
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:50,160
How did I get in there?

362
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,010
I'm not hot.

363
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:01,100
He was really hitting on Soo Jin.

364
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,040
Hey, Soo JIn.

365
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,230
No, no. It's a mis-mis-misunderstanding!

366
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,900
- I was... only carrying her bag for her because she said her shoulder hurt. 
- I did? When?

367
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,200
What? Did you say your legs hurt?

368
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,620
- Hey, save me. Please. 
 - Save you from what?

369
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,680
Hey, you give me that and go wait at Hyung Goo Gil's billiards.

370
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,400
I c-c-can't though. I have to go study at the study hall.

371
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,010
Your fate is to still be studying even after ten years,

372
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,350
so stay worried, go there, and wait.

373
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,430
Thanks.

374
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,420
Why are you doing that making me uncomfortable? Give it here.

375
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,560
Oh, hey? Why are you not uncomfortable with Seok Tae but uncomfortable with me?

376
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,880
It's uncomfortable because it's you.

377
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,530
You're like an uncomfortable desk since a long time ago.

378
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,910
  I'd rather at least be your desk.  

379
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,760
  When you lie forward there sleeping... 

380
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,200
Oh, hey. Right, there's somewhere you have to go with me.

381
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,810
Come with me. Follow me. Follow me.

382
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,530
- Hurry up and follow me. 
 - Hey, hey, hey. My skirt!

383
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,950
Hey! Where are we going?

384
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,100
- Oh, it hurts. 
- Hurry up and come.

385
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,530
- It hurts. It hurts. 
- This way. Here.

386
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,970
- It's here.
- Hey, let go.

387
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,710
Hey, get out of the way while I'm being nice.

388
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,610
Hey, Soo Jin.

389
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,940
You, are you the Soo Jin of now or the future?

390
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,430
What in the world are you talking about?

391
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,650
Okay, okay. Think carefully.

392
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,520
So last night around 12 o'clock, you were waiting for me at the park over there.

393
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,450
But I came here to pee and fell into the manhole.

394
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,710
At that time, perhaps you too...

395
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,950
Hey Pil, I'm seriously grateful and sorry for what happened today...

396
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,800
Hey, if it's for you, I could run a hundred or a thousand laps,

397
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,230
so don't worry about that and think carefully.

398
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,070
Last night, when I took you home...

399
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:00,780
You remember last night, right? You'll remember.

400
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,520
You gave me something important and everything. You do remember, right?

401
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,020
Did he lose his marbles doing laps around the track?

402
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,600
What are you talking about?!

403
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,570
How would I see you here last night at midnight, when I watched a drama and went to bed early last night?

404
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:17,710
Did you dream about it? Pil, get yourself together. If you fall into this, you'll die.

405
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,140
Just fall in and die. Die.

406
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,280
That would be a waste. If you fall in and die, I'm going to kill you.

407
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,030
N-No. Wait...

408
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,690
 She really is the Soo Jin from the past. 

409
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,970
 She doesn't remember at all. 

410
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,940
 What should I do now? 

411
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,240
Soo Jin! Soo Jin, let's go together.

412
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,320
You've always been a crazy psycho, but you're even more of a crazy psycho today.

413
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,830
It's because I feel messed up as if I did two rounds of military service.

414
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,070
Okay.

415
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,450
Look here. When you are about 20 or 21,

416
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,400
this is where you break your arm while fooling around, trying to learn to ride a motorcycle.

417
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,140
You are not the athlete type, so don't even think about learning those thing.

418
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,640
You see that empty place?

419
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,860
What about there?

420
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:21,000
When I was a soldier, I came out to see you and slept there all drunken.

421
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,110
So... back then, those senior bastards kept pushing me to drink on the bus.

422
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:31,280
So it's not that I blew you off on purpose, so please don't get me wrong, okay?

423
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,650
What are you talking about? What's wrong with you today?

424
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:38,540
The heat got to you. The heat.

425
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,060
Right. How could you possibly know?

426
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,630
What do you think about a pharmacist, as a profession?

427
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,740
A pharmacist?

428
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,300
Be careful with pharmacists. You'll get dragged to a multi room and experience horrible things.

429
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,680
What are you saying? Doesn't make sense...

430
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,140
That man. Seems like he had a full set of hair when he was younger.

431
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,920
Hey.

432
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,740
You completely ignored me and ran off when I called you before.

433
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,060
Were you going to meet Soo Jin?

434
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:20,590
You... Your family runs the supermarket over in that neighborhood, so why are you hanging around in front of a convenience store?

435
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,950
Because our market doesn't sell sanitary pads.

436
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,080
You say unnecessary details.

437
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,080
It's fine. He and I have seen way too much.

438
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,320
So let's stop seeing each other already.

439
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,510
But you probably should make sure to see me today.

440
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,000
Come here.

441
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,500
What?

442
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,850
This is not the time to be like this.

443
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,010
No? Then what?

444
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,100
Soo Jin is meeting this church oppa today!

445
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,980
That church oppa is a ladykiller who stole kisses from

446
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,910
the five nearby schools' most popular girls!

447
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,910
I told you yesterday, you punk!

448
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,450
So... that is today?

449
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,360
Hey, hey, hey.

450
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,740
Get along with each other while showing each other things that should and shouldn't be shared.

451
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,700
I'm going!

452
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,040
- Hey!
- Hey, Soo Jin!

453
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,680
Hey, hey! I have more things to tell you!

454
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,100
Kiss... Right. Is a kiss so important?

455
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,110
Yesterday, she and the pharmacist guy did... in the multi room...

456
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,460
That... why am I even talking about the multi room right now?

457
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,480
I don't know! I'm going. You can have that.

458
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,430
- Hey, hey! 
 - Soo Jin!

459
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:40,080
I said she will kiss the church oppa! Then who's the pharmacist?

460
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,700
What's multi room?

461
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,030
He's the one who told me to tell him every single detail about the things around her.

462
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,010
What should I do with that pharmacist?

463
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,300
That pharmacist! Seriously!

464
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,480
- Oh, that scared me.
- You scared me. Gosh.

465
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,720
You startled me!

466
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,420
You... what's wrong?

467
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,410
You... you wouldn't know.

468
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,290
The explosively frustrating feeling I have.

469
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,790
But why are you hiding over here?

470
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:18,400
If you were me, wouldn't you hide when some lunatic is going around doing this?

471
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,510
Going around with makeup done like some egg ghost.

472
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,010
Did you go around looking like this since a long time ago?

473
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,140
Long ago? When?

474
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,680
It's only been two months since I've been wearing makeup.

475
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,880
Try and see if putting on gold teeth would change whom your husband will be.

476
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,620
I can't believe that I have to see a replay of these guys.

477
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,670
Hey, Bong Pil.

478
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,440
What is it?

479
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,170
I have a favor to ask.

480
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,930
What, what favor?

481
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,890
What is this?

482
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,830
Something like a déjà vu is happening again.

483
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,900
Whoa, it looks delicious.

484
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,150
Pil, you eat first.

485
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,790
Jeong Ae, what's up with you, treating us to hamburgers?

486
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,940
I didn't say I'd treat everyone.

487
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,550
I asked only for Oppa to come out.

488
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,350
- Which oppa? 
- You little...

489
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,930
Why? We all met a long time ago as well!

490
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:37,460
I only asked for you to call Dal Soo.

491
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,180
- Hey. 
 - Let's go.

492
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,330
Hyung, if you happen to see rice cakes, you should hold an ancestral rite, so let's go after the ancestral rite.

493
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,640
Hey, are we beggars?

494
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,350
We're not beggars, but it's true that we're hungry like beggars.

495
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,180
If you're just leaving, then I'm going to eat this.

496
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,410
I'll tolerate it.

497
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,110
If you have something to say, can you say it quickly?

498
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,130
I came out in the middle of playing pool, so I have to go back.

499
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,420
Well, you see...

500
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,400
 Hurry up and take it out. 

501
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,060
 It's exactly the same as ten years ago. 

502
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,220
- Hey! Hey!
- What is this? What is it?

503
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,550
What do you mean! What do you think it is?

504
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,150
It's a love letter.

505
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,680
 For me? 

506
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,610
Please read it by yourself.

507
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,660
Hey, there's water. Be care—

508
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,890
I'll call you.

509
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,090
Hey, there's a glass door—

510
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:48,040
♫  Load your body to this music, Rock n Roll  ♫

511
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,470
♫  Anyone is fine, Rock n Roll  ♫

512
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,920
♫  Move it freely  ♫

513
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,410
It's fine.

514
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,900
Did she learn from the circus? She sure is doing some interesting acrobatic moves.

515
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,200
You must be happy.

516
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,000
You even received a love letter.

517
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Hey. Why would I receive it when I know very well that you like Jeong Ae?

518
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,170
Then rip this in front of me.

519
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,190
Alright.

520
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,230
Ah, seriously. Stop this childish act, please!

521
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,800
Is my love childish?

522
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,410
Love, it is childish.

523
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,040
Hyung, don't waste your time on this.

524
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,970
Let's forget about Jeong Ae. I'll give you this. Please, I'm begging you.

525
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:41,800
You have to secure love.

526
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,530
I can never give up.

527
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,050
Then, I'll secure this.

528
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:50,700
Let us have some soju.

529
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,010
I really can't live with a sober mind any longer.

530
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,570
Ahjussi.

531
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,940
It won't work if you hit it like that.

532
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,070
He became very bold after one night.

533
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,390
Hey, I think some big trouble will occur today.

534
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,390
He is blurting out nonsense more frequently.

535
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,340
If my dad comes, it'll be quite troublesome.

536
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,340
Did something happened today that we're not aware of?

537
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,820
Truthfully, Pil caught me carrying Soo Jin's bag today.

538
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,370
You opened the doors of hell.

539
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:38,460
Seok Tae, bite down hard—

540
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,450
Save me. Really. What am I going to do?

541
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,050
It's alright. It can happen.

542
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,650
- Welcome. 
- Give us a table. 
- Okay.

543
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,970
What did you understand? You have to bring that yellow ball here.

544
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,030
Young bastard drinking alcohol. Geez.

545
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,890
Look at that. Look.

546
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,750
HEY!

547
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,720
I'm turning 30 next year.

548
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,270
Can't I drink some alcohol?

549
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,310
Crazy.

550
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,320
Gosh.

551
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,400
They're completely ignoring me.

552
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,610
Why... why why why?

553
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:19,290
Sorry. Gosh, so scary.

554
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,700
Ah! It hurts!

555
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,260
This little...!

556
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,090
- Which bastard is it?! 
 - Dad!

557
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:43,600
So... you were running away because you got scared of getting hit?

558
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,480
Yes.

559
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,710
His dad is the post office chief,

560
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,710
and I'm just one of the mailmen.

561
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,530
So did he look down on you?

562
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,830
Since elementary school.

563
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,620
You fool.

564
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,810
Then you were treated like this all along? This is all you got?

565
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,400
I'm sorry.

566
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,880
   

567
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,690
It's okay. I taught you wrong.

568
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,180
Because you lost your mom early, I raised you too softly.

569
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:36,130
It's revenge now. Bitter revenge.

570
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,530
Do you know what's the ultimate revenge in this world?

571
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,470
Wh-what is it?

572
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,580
Taking something from them.

573
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,070
The thing that the person most highly values.

574
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,380
Then, without getting any blood on your hand,

575
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:55,250
you can ruin the person completely.

576
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,060
Father! I have a request.

577
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:37,860
♫  Oh my dear, even without saying it, I know  ♫

578
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,290
 I was going to go in this way, but it suddenly fell and... 

579
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:46,280
 I know, I know. It's alright. It'll be alright. 

580
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:52,210
 You just go in. Nothing will happen to you. 

581
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:59,760
I mean... that guy just appeared suddenly and saved me and stuff...

582
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,650
♫  To you,&nbsp;I didn't express&nbsp;my feelings  ♫

583
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,610
Ah, really.

584
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,370
I must be crazy.

585
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,850
Why do I keep smiling?

586
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,170
Get a hold of yourself!

587
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,760
He is handsome.

588
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,810
Oh!

589
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,040
♫  The word which I expressed sincerely  ♫

590
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,120
What is this?

591
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,710
"Faith, hope, and love."

592
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,310
"And the greatest of these is love."

593
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,150
Is love...

594
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:52,460
♫  I would like&nbsp;you to enter&nbsp;my heart  ♫

595
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,450
Sorry...

596
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,720
♫  Saying it surreptitiously to you  ♫

597
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,540
 Hey, Bong Pil. What are you doing? 

598
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,450
- Come here.
- Hey, hey, hey.

599
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,320
 Thank you for today. 

600
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,940
 But I didn't even say "thank you" properly. 

601
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,740
- We're sorry. Really sorry. 
- I'm so mad.

602
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,200
We're sorry.

603
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,410
What's wrong with him? Really.

604
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,310
- Hey!
- My friends—

605
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,700
 I had plans, but if you want, I can let them fall through. 

606
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,570
 I'll wait. 

607
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,780
♫  Love you. The words for you which were said to you  ♫

608
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,310
Let go!

609
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,350
Look, look. They're nothing.

610
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,330
What?

611
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:55,340
 You worked hard running 100 times around the field. 

612
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,690
 Should I buy you some meat? 

613
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:01,430
What? What!

614
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,410
 Hey! What are you doing? Are you ignoring me? 

615
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,270
Come at me!

616
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,210
Geez...

617
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,280
 This is your last chance. 

618
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,420
 Answer me! 

619
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,640
   

620
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,280
 Get lost! 

621
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,790
Don't go...

622
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,280
I left the building under their care for just a short bit,

623
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,170
and when I came back, this punk that's still wet behind the ears was brandishing a cue stick

624
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:57,280
and fighting with regular customers.

625
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,110
Is that so?

626
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:03,170
Just how exactly did you raise your son?!

627
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,280
We did try our best, but we failed.

628
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,590
Let me sleep...

629
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,820
There's no such thing as a failed son.

630
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,300
You must teach them over and over again. You just have to keep teaching them!

631
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,210
If that's how it is, then I don't think your son turned out that well either.

632
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,890
What did you say?

633
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,690
It's apples to apples. So let's just stop.

634
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,250
Look at these people. Since we're long time neighbors, I let things slide before.

635
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:35,410
If something like this happens again in the future, I'll kill him with my own hands!

636
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,120
If it's possible, please do so.

637
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,910
Mister.

638
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,910
Mister, quit drinking.

639
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:49,300
In 2014, do you know how much Hyung Goo Gil suffered while trying to hold your funeral?

640
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,320
Do you think you can live until then?

641
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:11,390
If anyone has an objection to this marriage, please say it now.

642
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,820
Objection! Objection, objection, objection!

643
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,580
Me. I object!

644
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,720
Seok Tae, Seok Tae. Objection! I object!

645
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,870
There's no one, right?

646
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,130
I object! Soo Jin, I object!

647
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,380
- Then those that oppose this marriage, 
- No! I object this marriage!

648
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,090
must forever hold their peace.

649
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,610
I pronounce you husband and wife.

650
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,470
Husband and wife, march down the aisle.

651
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,530
Oh, no, no!

652
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,690
Object! Objection!

653
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,230
Oh gosh!

654
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,210
It'll hurt more if you get hit from this side.

655
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,050
No, Father...

656
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,610
Wh... what is this smell?

657
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,160
You stink so much that I can't even beat you up.

658
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,320
Did you drink poop instead of alcohol now?

659
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,050
How come you smell like a decontaminant?

660
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,830
I'll ask you! Answer me.

661
00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:00,510
A digital camera that I bought a few days ago is missing. Is this your doing?

662
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:02,250
A digital camera?

663
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,610
 A digital camera? What digital camera? 

664
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,740
 Oh, that digital camera that I gave to Soo Jin a long time ago? 

665
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,420
By chance, are you working with a pawn shop? If so, let me beat you up.

666
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,240
No, Father. I'm not!

667
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,090
Generation after generation there has not been a Bong family member who is athletic.

668
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,860
When you said you wanted to play sports, I should've stopped you from getting involved!

669
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,610
- I didn't say I wanted to do sports! 
 - It's not that we have no athleticism at all.

670
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:25,420
If you look at it, we're born with thick bones.

671
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,400
But then, Honey, what's the point of doing all this?

672
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,780
Let's just stop now. Only our lifespans will decrease.

673
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,250
That's right.

674
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,230
We have to live happily ever after.

675
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,430
Let's go. Lady first.

676
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,660
- Thank you.
- Mom! Dad!

677
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,000
No... Mother, Father!

678
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,800
Gosh, why!

679
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:50,520
Since it turned out like this, should I just fix everything completely and live diligently?

680
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:56,460
Should I just quit sports that's not working out for me and go for remodeling my life altogether?

681
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,410
   

682
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,250
 You're so cool! 

683
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,850
   

684
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:10,840
 Keep up the good work. 

685
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:23,030
   

686
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,490
  Me?   

687
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,090
 Stop! 

688
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,510
 Will you marry me? 

689
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:42,080
I mean, that's right! I've lived this life once.

690
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,350
I already lived this life and seen how it is!

691
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:47,550
Since it's already like this, let's just go, Bong Pil!

692
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:51,740
Let's create the history of Bong Pil!

693
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,410
Let's see...

694
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,770
What the heck... The studies...

695
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,710
I'm sure it's less difficult than sports.

696
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,690
Let's see. When is the next test?

697
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:08,370
Let me try getting first place!

698
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:13,880
When Soo Jin sees my grades, she will be very surprised.

699
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,700
  Soo Jin is meeting this church oppa today! 

700
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:35,300
  A ladykiller who stole kisses...  

701
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,900
That's right... That jerk...

702
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,600
Soo Jin's luscious lips... The one who stole them for the first time...

703
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,370
That jerk who threw her away like an old sock after playing with her for the next six months...

704
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:50,890
Right! I'll start my legacy again with that bastard!

705
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,870
The vertical line Y is X + In...

706
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,530
- Oh my! 
- He-hey!

707
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,550
Hey! What time and where is it?

708
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:07,070
What is? You crazy idiot!

709
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,210
Geez!

710
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:42,370
It's amen, you bastard!

711
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,300
That's right. I got totally beat up by that jerk that time.

712
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,280
The guy who learned boxing for the last five years...

713
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,940
I couldn't even get one punch in!

714
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,670
Hey, Seok Tae, Seok Tae.

715
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,080
I-i-it wa-wasn't me! My dad did it!

716
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,160
What are you talking about? Go wake up the other guys.

717
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,110
Hey, hey, hey...

718
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,940
Hey, hey, I'm your hyung.

719
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,170
That's not it. Help me.

720
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,770
Who called you to be here today?

721
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:26,880
Because our Father called us, I believe we are here at this time.

722
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,170
Hey, aren't we the kind that should not be here?

723
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:34,850
Especially with the mind to beat someone up.

724
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:36,670
Right, Seok Tae?

725
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,230
Opening the gates of hell at church...

726
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:43,060
Our Father in Heaven,

727
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,640
Whoa... Whoa...

728
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,590
That jerk... Look at that jerk...

729
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,170
Making moves while sitting inside a holy church...

730
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,890
That young bastard!

731
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:00,790
You just pray hard today.

732
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:04,340
Hey, he's the best fighter in his school.

733
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,940
Brother, let's love our neighbor. Amen.

734
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,150
He's still young even if he may be the best fighter.

735
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,430
Hey, he is 2 years older than us. He repeated a year.

736
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:17,500
Today, I'm 8 years older.

737
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,040
Amen.

738
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,010
Please deliver us from evil...

739
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,680
- Get home well. See you next week. 
- See you next week.

740
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,900
Yes.

741
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,070
Did you pray well?

742
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:34,610
You should have prayed hard. It's probably your last prayer.

743
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:37,650
- Do you know me?
- Very well.

744
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:41,330
You know me well and you're acting like this?

745
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:46,180
Bong Pil. You ignored all of my texts. Why are you being like this?

746
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,930
Because there's a revenge match today.

747
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:52,980
You need to know English better, my brother. Revenge match means—

748
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,040
I know, you punk.

749
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:01,370
You may not remember, but we already fought one in the past.

750
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,230
Really?

751
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:09,250
You must've been knocked unconscious. I've never lost a fight.

752
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:15,010
Pil, you can't win. So stop doing weird things.

753
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,650
Oppa, let's just go.

754
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:20,150
Soo Jin, are your eyes for men that bad?

755
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,280
This jerk is total trash.

756
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,350
He's going to play with you and dump you in 6 months.

757
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,420
I go to church because I don't want to see blood anymore.

758
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,370
Are you trying to make me a sinner again?

759
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:41,820
Then you shouldn't have dared to pout your lips that look like pork sausages.

760
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,210
Wait, wait.

761
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,500
Try to stop them, Oppas.

762
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,860
If you stopped them, we would be very thankful, too.

763
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,920
- There's no repeat for a man. 
 - Retreat. No retreat for a man.

764
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,940
Hiding ignorance is polite. Let's be well mannered.

765
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:56,700
Seriously.

766
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,010
- I'll stay neutral. 
 - I'll referee.

767
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:02,170
Hey, Bong Pil, I told you to stop.

768
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:06,610
Soo Jin. I had some plans with you but that has changed.

769
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:10,590
I will make this guy's face into two.

770
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:15,540
That's right. I've been in pain for the last ten years in my memory.

771
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:22,150
Thank you, manhole, for letting me take my revenge.

772
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:26,710
I'll be sure to stop you from stealing women's lips with those lips.

773
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:27,680
What is he saying?

774
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,400
This crazy jerk.

775
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,130
Shalom.

776
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:38,650
This place is not good. There's a good place to get beaten up. Over there.

777
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:41,940
I know. That empty place behind the church.

778
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:45,880
That place will become your grave, and from there, I will be born again.

779
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,950
My dark history that's covered with shame will change there.

780
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:52,800
Follow me.

781
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,100
Wait... where is it?

782
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,160
Where is it?

783
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,630
It's almost 12 o'clock. When are we going to fight?

784
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:18,010
Just stand still for a second, you punk.

785
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:20,970
It was here.

786
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:24,100
Hey, why is he like that?

787
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:28,520
He must be regretting it. No matter how you look at it, you can tell how it will end.

788
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,190
Hyung, should we just throw in the towel?

789
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,630
Leave him and let him get beaten up.

790
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:34,020
When did you get here?

791
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:37,590
Oh! I go to church. Born Christian.

792
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,140
You're not that type of character.

793
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,350
Why?

794
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:45,150
If you go to this holy place with that holy body, isn't it blasphemy?

795
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,580
My friend. Watch your mouth in front of Jeong Ae.

796
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,890
It's a compliment, right, Oppa?

797
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,330
You're saying that I'm sexy, right?

798
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:56,340
What bullshit.

799
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,390
When did you get here?

800
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:00,310
I came here to see you, man.

801
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,200
What's wrong with him at this night?

802
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,370
I don't know.

803
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:08,360
Why is Soo Jin over there?

804
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,570
Soo Jin is on the other side, not on ours.

805
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:11,960
Go and bring her.

806
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,250
Soo Jin is definitely out of our family.

807
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,140
Wait. So what are you guys all doing here, not stopping him?

808
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,750
Let's go.

809
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:25,510
Did he ever listened to us? Enlightenment comes after suffering.

810
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,310
Right, I found it.

811
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,120
What are you saying that you found?

812
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,160
There's something that you guys don't know.

813
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,830
Are we going to stay the night?!

814
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:44,000
Oh right. Now, should we cross Jordan River?

815
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,920
Come here.

816
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,470
Ah!

817
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:55,990
- Fighting! 
- Right hand! Right hand!

818
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:57,710
- Right hand! 
- Bong Pil!

819
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,410
- Hey, hey, hey! 
 - Fighting!

820
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,980
Pil!

821
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:22,250
When it becomes 12 o'clock, she's going to change back to a beggar.

822
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:25,540
See, it turned 12 o'clock. Now she's going to run away.

823
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,670
  When did the time go by?  

824
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,940
She's running away, right?

825
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,750
 Princess! 

826
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:34,110
She's going to subtly drop one of her glass slippers on the stairs.

827
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:35,630
 And only one glass slipper remained. 

828
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:37,850
Look, she dropped it, right?

829
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,170
Wait... Are you sad? Don't worry...

830
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,770
Hyungs, should I call 911?

831
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,210
Idiot, you should call the mortuary if we need to take care of a dead body.

832
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,710
- Should I call a mortuary? 
 - You have a number?

833
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,640
Hey...

834
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:13,680
 It's amen, you punk. 

835
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,720
It's going to be midnight. Let's go in and sleep now.

836
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:25,470
Pil, get up! Fighting!

837
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:28,600
- Get up! Get up! 
- Aish!

838
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,100
 10 years ago, this is where Pil's foot got stuck. 

839
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,650
 So he helplessly got beaten up. 

840
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:44,240
 But no one believed him. 

841
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,210
♫  My heart is burning hot again today and  ♫

842
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:03,110
♫  I have no fear right now  ♫

843
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:09,040
♫  Even though I have absolutely nothing and nothing to show you  ♫

844
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,780
♫  My heart is full of a bent toward you  ♫

845
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,980
Wow, you're fighting well today!

846
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,050
♫  The moonlight resembles you, oh  ♫

847
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:16,850
Victory!

848
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:21,120
- Bong Pil! 
 - Hey!

849
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,880
If you replied to my text, that would have been enough. Did you have to cause a ruckus like this?

850
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,500
Text? What text? Did you send me a text?

851
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:33,070
It's fine. Get lo— No, I'll get lost.

852
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,840
- Hey! 
- Hey...

853
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,410
You. Pil, your face... it's bloody all over.

854
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:41,660
Action and romance. This genre is very complicated.

855
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,220
Hey, hey!

856
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,310
It's dangerous!

857
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:09,310
Soo Jin!

858
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,330
Soo Jin!

859
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,790
 12 o'clock. 

860
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:24,310
What is this? What happened?

861
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:27,610
Hey! Hey, Soo Jin!

862
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,570
This is my neighborhood.

863
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:39,630
That scared me!

864
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,240
 This is the 12 o'clock noon news. 

865
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,410
  Organized groups of gang members who fought for rights in broad daylight  

866
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:04,740
  have been arrested in droves.  

867
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,600
  On the 15th, the Seoul Prosecutors Office  

868
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,800
  have arrested 23 members between two different gangs  

869
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,670
  who fought over the rights of illegal financial accounts... 

870
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,410
Who is this?

871
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:35,350


872
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,710
No... No way.

873
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:46,480
No way... Is this me?

874
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:54,300
   

875
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:05,370
♫  Let's go and fly lightly over the blue sky  ♫

876
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:08,700
♫  And ride the plane which I dreamed of as a child  ♫

877
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,090
♫  I can't say anything of what I looked forward to then  ♫

878
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:15,350
♫  I can't say what I was thinking  ♫

879
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:18,890
   

880
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:21,110
 What? Pil is back? 

881
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,710
 Everything has changed. 

882
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,410
 Ah, this is real! 

883
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:28,550
  I think he'll finally come to his senses if he goes to jail for a few more years.  

884
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:30,620
 Ta-talent discovered! 

885
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,070
 So, you went to the past and came back through the manhole? 

886
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:35,540
 This really isn't my life! 

887
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:39,170
 If you marry that jerk, your life will be f***ed. 

888
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:41,750
 Are you not going to move?! 

889
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,360
 Pil! 

890
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,600
 Her name... was it Soo Jin? 

891
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,570
 Do you all want to see me going crazy? 

892
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,400
♫  And ride the plane which I dreamed of as a child  ♫
