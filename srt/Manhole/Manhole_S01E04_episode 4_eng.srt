1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,380
   

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,000
   

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:18,400


4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,600
   

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,530
What's this?

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,980
W-wait...

7
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,940
What is this?

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,330
What is this? Where is this place?

9
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:46,260
Where in the world did you bring me to, you damn manhole?!

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,670
This is driving me insane!

11
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,900
This ... 
   

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,170
      
 This is not right!

13
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,580
I do know where this is though.

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,100
I do remember.

15
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,760
But why am I here?

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,670
I have to go back to the church as a high schooler.

17
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:30,140
Hey, you punk. Pil, what's going on?

18
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,680
Hey, wake up. Wake up, punk.

19
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,380
Uncle.

20
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,790
- I'm here by mistake. 
- What?

21
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,340
I wasn't originally trying to come here.

22
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,570
What you're saying is reeking of alcohol.

23
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,000
Hey, didn't you come here to help me with work?

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,020
You're already completely drunk in the middle of the day.

25
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,780
Your father said that your tenacity is so lacking it's even smaller than an ant's poop,

26
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,800
and it seems like that is all true.

27
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,950
Uncle, that's not it.

28
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,350
Not it? What's not it, you punk?

29
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,990
The alcohol. Seriously...

30
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,690
Your father gave me a special mission.

31
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,140
To convert you into a human being.

32
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,650
Starting today, you will receive no mercy. I'm going to do it military style, just like—

33
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,290
Get up. Wake up! Wake up, you punk! I'm going to—

34
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,760
- Attention. 
- Okay, waking up. I'm waking up.

35
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,860
- This punk, I'm going to have to put a megaphone next to your ear. 
 - I'm waking up!

36
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,860
- Hurry up and get up, you punk! 
- Ah, I'm getting up!

37
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,130
Gosh, my head really hurts!

38
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,750
If your head hurts, stuff yourself with soda!

39
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,260
We're going to open at 10 AM! Get to work!

40
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,380
Oh my head.

41
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,560
 I'm ruined. What am I supposed to do here? 

42
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,650
 Nothing can be resolved from here. Jeez! 

43
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,710
- Oppa, are you okay?
-  Who are you? 

44
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,770
You're still lying down? Your alcohol tolerance is weaker than I thought.

45
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,000
 Why does she look familiar to me? 

46
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,390
Seeing your condition, you need to sleep some more.

47
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,570
You're cute.

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,700
 H-hey, hey. Hey... 

49
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,100
 Hey, no... Hey, wait a minute... 

50
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:47,200
 Get yourself together. Get yourself together, Bong Pil. 

51
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,800
 Oh forget it. Alcohol is the enemy, seriously. 

52
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,141
Be quiet! Guys, I can't focus on driving.

53
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:57,651
Hey, Jeong Ae. There's a lot of empty space here. Come this way.

54
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,251
Let's leave a bit of empty space there.

55
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:03,031
That space, can you give it to me? It's hot and I'm struggling.

56
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:04,721
Jin Sook, turn on the air conditioner. Oppa is hot.

57
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:08,721
- It's on.
 - I bet even if there's a blizzard inside the car, Oppa Dal Soo will be hot.

58
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:11,451
He's hugging a passionate thing. It's  a wonder that he hasn't burned to death.

59
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,691
Hey, by the way, Jin Sook, when are we arriving?

60
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:14,901
Stop asking.

61
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:17,051
Just imagine that you're dead and sleep.

62
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:20,571
I can't sleep; it's too hot. Is there any water up there? Give me some water, please.

63
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:22,941
- Soo Jin, pass me the water. 
- This? Is it okay to give him this one?

64
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:24,501
Here.

65
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:29,611
Hey Jin Sook, I'm sorry, but when you go over the speed bump, can you go a bit slower? My butt hurts too much.

66
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:33,421
And Jin Sook, why are the songs continuously on repeat? It's not like we're at a pool hall. Change it.

67
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:35,591
Jin Sook, I'm hot. Turn on the air conditioner quickly.

68
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:38,141
- Open the window.
- Jin Sook.

69
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:40,921
- Change the song. 
- Turn on the air conditioner.

70
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:43,241
Hey!

71
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:47,001
I, too, am using my precious time to go on vacation.

72
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:49,311
But is this a vacation? Huh?

73
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:52,041
I'm the one who got the rental car. I made sure we had everything in the morning!

74
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,531
I'm the one who is also driving!

75
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:56,291
Why is there so much lip service when all you guys are doing is bringing your own bodies?!

76
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,951
Then why don't you guys drive?!

77
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:06,501
Go eat, take a shit, and gather here in 20 minutes.

78
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:08,401
- If you're late, I'm just leaving. Okay?
- Yes.

79
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:11,911
- Dismissed.
- Dismissed!

80
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,691
Hey guys, get me out.

81
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:20,971
Jin Sook, turn on the air conditioner in the back.

82
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,631
Jin Sook, do you have cold water?

83
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:28,621
No...

84
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:34,051
No. No.

85
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:39,251
No, it's all... All, all catching, catching on fire!

86
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:46,031
- Then you should put out the fire. 
- It's cold!

87
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:50,101
Is it cold? This kid, I left you to look after the store,

88
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:52,841
- and you're passed out sleeping. 
 - I can't hear.

89
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:57,471
Hey, punk. The day's already hot so why are you talking about fire?

90
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:01,031
When I taught you how to drink a long time ago, what did I tell you?

91
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:05,891
I said you have to eat something first to lay the foundation then drink so that the next day, your insides will be fine. Didn't I?

92
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:10,121
Fire. That's right. There was a fire.

93
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:11,671
Oh man, we're in trouble.

94
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,521
This, this little, you little thing. Did you still not get a hold of your senses?

95
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:17,681
Did you not drink alcohol but get high off of something else?

96
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:22,181
F-f-fire. There's going to be huge trouble, Uncle!

97
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,521
One, two, three.

98
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:27,901
They're having a great time.

99
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:30,311
This is the most expensive one from the market.

100
00:06:30,311 --> 00:06:34,471
A special service for Ms. Yoon.

101
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:37,181
There's at least one of you who knows about manners.

102
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:39,831
Hey, smile.

103
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:42,761
One, two, three.

104
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:46,641
It came out nice.

105
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:49,291
Hey, what's over there that Pil asked all of us to come?

106
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,951
What would be there? He asked us to come because you're among us.

107
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:55,041
If he just asked you to come, would you go? We're just fillers.

108
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,311
I mean, well he just said we should have a family get-together.

109
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:01,541
He said his uncle is pretty well off in that area.

110
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,921
Wow. Look at this guy.

111
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:08,951
You don't know about Bong Pil's evil persistence.

112
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:10,461
What are you talking about?

113
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:12,431
- There is such thing. 
- What are you talking about?

114
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,111
- Thanks. 
- Endure well.

115
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:16,031
- Get on quickly. 
- Okay.

116
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:18,281
- Jeong Ae farted. 
- It wasn't me.

117
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:24,771
Where are you all going?

118
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:27,371
Soo Jin, it's been a long time.

119
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:31,031
Is that dude from the church?

120
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:34,861
They say that you will meet your enemy at the worst place and time.

121
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:37,371
If we only had time, we would teach them a lesson.

122
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:41,691
If you mean only by words, then I could take over the world like Napoleon.

123
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:44,961
If you meet your divorced husband by coincidence, it would feel like this, right?

124
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:46,261
I'm smart, huh?

125
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:50,671
Jeong Ae, you're going to cause some big trouble with that mouth of yours some day.

126
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,701
Aside from her body, there's not an ounce of usefulness.

127
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:55,451
Did I say something wrong?

128
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:59,861
No. It's my fault for not having good eyes for men.

129
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,791
Memories of embarrassing moments are surfacing again.

130
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,081
Put your sunglasses on. Your face is burning, too.

131
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:09,811
Wait, wait a minute. There's three of them.

132
00:08:09,811 --> 00:08:12,011
We have three men. Shall we go for it?

133
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:16,911
Let's not say such things when you know we can't turn back,  my friend.

134
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:21,691
Seok Tae is here. He is no help since he brings no benefit.

135
00:08:21,691 --> 00:08:23,691
- Did you call me? 
 - Just go to sleep.

136
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:26,431
Now, now. Oh! It's the sea!

137
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:29,511
- The sea? 
- Wow, it's summer!

138
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:35,381
♫ Let's leave, hey, hey, hey to the sea

139
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:39,641
Wow. Wow.

140
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:42,651
- Should we? 
- Should we?

141
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:46,101
The weather is so nice!

142
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:48,171
Wow, it's so pretty.

143
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:57,151
 That's right. That year's summer, Soo Jin came on vacation. 

144
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:59,011
 But then... 

145
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:02,071
No, no. That's right. No.

146
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:05,641
- It's- It's dangerous here. No, no. No, no, no, no.
- What? What's dangerous?

147
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:08,711
No, no, no.

148
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:13,431
- What are you looking for right now? 
- Cell phone. Ce-cell phone. Cell phone.

149
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:16,151
- Isn't it in your pocket? 
- What?

150
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:18,041
In your pocket.

151
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:21,471
Gosh, you, you, you little...

152
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:24,851
Ah, battery died!

153
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:27,441
Uncle's cell phone. Uncle's cell phone.

154
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,171
- Hey punk, my cell... Hey, hey. 
- Uncle's cell phone.

155
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:32,321
- Hey punk, you're- Left, left left. 
- Uncle's cell phone.

156
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:38,841
Oh, I can't remember the phone number.

157
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:40,781
Why are you like this?

158
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,731
When you were younger, you were so smart.

159
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:44,141
There's nothing I can do with you now.

160
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:46,571
Who memorizes phone numbers these days?

161
00:09:46,571 --> 00:09:50,481
- There's a charger in the store! 
- Oh right.

162
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:53,391
Gosh, you little—

163
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:56,461
My sister and brother-in-law ruined him.

164
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:57,791
Where did my cell phone go?

165
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,641
C-c-c-charger. Charge, charger.

166
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:03,751
Okay.

167
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:08,741
Ah... Work, work.

168
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:14,621
I should have the phone number, right?

169
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:21,571
Oh it's been so long since I heard this sound.

170
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,631
They came already! These guys, really.

171
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:27,811
When they're coming to play, they're so quick! Damn!

172
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:31,771
- Hey, Hey, Hey! 
- It's the beach!

173
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,991
- It's the beach! 
 - Hey, Jeong Ae.

174
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:38,531
Wow!

175
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:40,211
Wow, so pretty!

176
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:42,301
Wow! It's so pretty.

177
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:45,841
Look over there!

178
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,891
Oh, no way.

179
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:51,721
- So pretty. 
- This is so nice.

180
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:53,791
Wow!

181
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,471
Hey look, it's Pil over there.

182
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,111
- Bong Pil! 
- Hey Pil!

183
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:58,691
Pil!

184
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,891
- Hey, be careful! 
- Go! Go!

185
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:02,421
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

186
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:04,071
You can't be standing here.

187
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:06,531
Go back quickly. Go back. It's not okay here today!

188
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:08,221
- He's all baked.
- Where do I park?

189
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:10,731
Really, don't do this and just go back to Seoul. Hurry back to Seoul.

190
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:14,071
What are you saying? We left in the morning and came. Do you want to die? You park.

191
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:16,281
- Let's go!
- No, you can't—

192
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:18,721
Yay!

193
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,731
Seriously, they just won't listen!

194
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:24,081
One, two, three.

195
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:25,621
One more time. One more time. I'm going to go.

196
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:28,811
One, two, three.

197
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:30,851
Damn it, seriously.

198
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:32,031
Aish!

199
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:34,481
Hey, hey.

200
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:37,241
Give me that.

201
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:40,201
Listen to me carefully. There is going to be a fire.

202
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:42,041
Tonight, there is going to be a fire here.

203
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,151
But nobody's going to get hurt.

204
00:11:44,151 --> 00:11:46,411
But some guy is going to come and save Soo Jin.

205
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:50,631
So they will end up dating each other after that, and they will be in a burning relationship!

206
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:52,551
What are you saying?!

207
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:54,621
Seriously, it smells like alcohol. You're drunk.

208
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:56,381
I'm telling you there is going to be a fire here!

209
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,191
Why can't you remember for goodness sake?!

210
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:00,341
Then you have to extinguish the fire.

211
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:02,311
- Uncle!
 - Hello.

212
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:06,351
Oh, so you guys are Pil's friends from Seoul, right?

213
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,961
Yes.

214
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,381
- But he keeps on...
- Don't worry about it.

215
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,571
Okay, come this way.

216
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:14,941
Uncle, I'm telling you that there is really going to be a fire here!

217
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:17,411
You extinguish the fire then. The fire.

218
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:21,931
- Over here, there's a... and on top of that... 
 - Man, I'm going to go mad!

219
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:25,071
One e and a, two e and a...

220
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:28,071
Jeong Ae, try it. Hurry up and try it. Try it again.

221
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:33,341
There are people who can't do it. One e and a, two e and a...

222
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:39,941
I guess... It makes sense that she can't remember it.

223
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:43,381
They are about to experience it for the first time after all.

224
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:49,211
What am I to do? I'm going to go crazy.

225
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:52,731
Hey, Seok Tae. You should help Goo Gil.

226
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,001
- Here. 
- What are you doing?

227
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:58,741
I will sing a song of labor for you.

228
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:05,011
♫ Let's put up the tent

229
00:13:05,011 --> 00:13:07,431
- ♫ In Gangwondo... 
 - This is a nice place.

230
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:10,241
Let's settle down here, too.

231
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:13,191
- There are many people we know, too. 
 - Who?

232
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,441
That beautiful lady over there?

233
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:20,651
Alright!

234
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:24,361
A fire accident will never happen.

235
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:27,261
So damn heavy.

236
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:29,811
Pil will take care of the fire today.

237
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:32,771
This Pil will prevent it!

238
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:37,801
- It's so strong!
- Patty cake, patty cake.

239
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:41,571
Even if a storm comes this way, the tent won't budge. Right, Oppa?

240
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,811
Our Jeong Ae speaks so adorably.

241
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:46,611
I do, huh?

242
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:49,561
Rock, paper, scissors.

243
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,841
- It hurts so much. 
- Hey guys, we're missing something.

244
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:56,951
Pil, what's all that?

245
00:13:56,951 --> 00:14:02,051
There will be a fire. No, there might be a fire, so I have to take these.

246
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:05,481
Why is he constantly talking about fire since earlier? He is just bringing in bad luck.

247
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:08,991
Would he be so earnestly sincere if Soo Jin weren't here?

248
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:11,821
I don't think so.

249
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:35,121
- It's refreshing! 
- Hey!

250
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:37,511
Hey!

251
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:41,051
You stupid little!

252
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:43,661
- You! 
- Hey, hey, hey!

253
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:46,291
You come back!

254
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,921
- Hey, come over here. 
 - Let's go.

255
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:52,871
Take the photo.

256
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,981
- Hey! Just wait until you get caught.
- They're stupid.

257
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,541
Oppa, over here too.

258
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,891
- I will put it on up to your knees. 
- Then over here.

259
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:11,721
Arms? Okay.

260
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:17,621
I'll put some on over here. Yeah, over here.

261
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:18,801
Aish!

262
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,491
- Should I put some on for you too, Oppa?
 - Oh, me?

263
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:24,261
I'll put it on for you.

264
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:34,061
What am I going to do about you?

265
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:51,781
Don't go down. Come back up.

266
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:53,791
I said, come back up.

267
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,621
I told you that you don't need to put any on me.

268
00:15:56,621 --> 00:16:00,311
You became so countrified after a few days! Keep your face right here.

269
00:16:00,311 --> 00:16:04,421
How much sunscreen do I have to put on you?

270
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:07,641
 You... 

271
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:09,521
 Why are you getting married? 

272
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:13,171
 If you leave me, then what am I supposed to do? 

273
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:18,501
- Jin Sook, sunscreen lotion.
 - I already put it on, so get lost.

274
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:22,151
You're ruining the beautiful scenery I'm looking at.  Get lost, man!

275
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,851
Fine.

276
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,741
What have you been doing here anyway?

277
00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:31,311
Were you two in this kind of a relationship?

278
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:34,211
Wow, looks so nice.

279
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:35,951
Hey there.

280
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:38,461
- Give me some dried squid. 
- Get lost.

281
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:41,631
Soo Jin, you doing that is making me jealous for some reason.

282
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:43,121
If you came here to have fun, just do that and go.

283
00:16:43,121 --> 00:16:46,131
Let's go hang out since we haven't in a while. We have a spot over there.

284
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,831
My goodness.

285
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:53,161
No. Did you get caught in a heatwave, you jerk?

286
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:58,161
Soo Jin, nothing will happen to you, so go have a seat over there.

287
00:16:58,161 --> 00:17:01,051
Do you really want to die?

288
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:04,631
Excuse me, what are you talking about?

289
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:09,451
Did you already forget about how I beat the living daylights out of you at the church?

290
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:12,681
You're here on a vacation so why do this? Stop it.

291
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:15,481
Hey, snap out of it.

292
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:19,311
There are so many guys that try to be all brave in front of women.

293
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:22,601
They will be regretting it right after getting beaten up badly. Right, Soo Jin?

294
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:25,251
Well, that is...

295
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:32,921
Hey bros! I think he already forgot, but back when we were in high school, he got his ass kicked.

296
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:35,851
Then he got his act together to study for the civil service exam.

297
00:17:35,851 --> 00:17:39,021
 You got beaten up so horribly, so why don't you at least apolo— 

298
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:45,031
 No! Seriously, this is not right. 

299
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:48,131
- Pil!
 -  Too late. 

300
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:53,921
 So strange. 

301
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:57,351
 I am definitely sure that I won that night. 

302
00:17:58,171 --> 00:17:59,721
 What happened? 

303
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:03,051
Elders, first repeat after me please.

304
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:04,851
- Reset. 
- Reset.

305
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:07,911
Good job, folks. Reset is how you read this word, okay?

306
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:12,321
What this means is... When you're on your computer and there's an error in your system,

307
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:16,981
you push the reset button and it will go back to the way it was originally.

308
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,731
Let me explain to you in an easier way.

309
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,871
You're on your computer and you just want to give up and go back to the way it was,

310
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:26,811
then all you have to do is press this reset button.

311
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:29,121
Pil, Pil.

312
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:32,221
Pil, are you awake? Pil! Hey, you!

313
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:35,091
Hey, Bong Pil! Wake up!

314
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:37,121
He's waking up now.

315
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:38,661
He's not dead.

316
00:18:38,661 --> 00:18:42,151
Pil, you alright? Are you awake now?

317
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:47,141
I... when I was in high school,

318
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:50,121
did I fight that punk at the church and lose?

319
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:52,781
Dude, you don't remember? You were completely smashed.

320
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,711
- Did I? 
- Completely smashed. I saw it all.

321
00:18:54,711 --> 00:18:57,161
For some reason I was so fatigued that night.

322
00:18:57,161 --> 00:19:00,651
One should forget about painful memories, but he's gaining even more to forget.

323
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:03,531
 If I go back through the manhole, it seems that I go back to my original past. 

324
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:07,051
 The past still gets a reset no matter how much I change it. 

325
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:11,091
Enough already, you guys. But Pil was the only one that was willing to step up.

326
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:14,221
You keep yapping away about family! I don't need that kind of family! You can give it to the dogs!

327
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,451
Hey! We are still your oppas!

328
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:18,191
We did our best as your oppas.

329
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,681
- But... 
 - Did you say, "hey" and "oppa"?

330
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:22,441
- Very nice!
 - Over there!

331
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:25,171
- You guys are nice. 
 - Look at her pose, man.

332
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:26,841
- Hey, you're here. 
 - Hi!

333
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:28,681
Hi.

334
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:43,511
Living my life until now, there were two confessions that I'm most embarrassed about.

335
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:47,551
Once was back in high school, to the guy that you hit earlier.

336
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:52,391
I secretly took a photo of him and mailed it to him because I was shy to say it in words.

337
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:56,781
Back then, I was so ashamed that someone would find out about that.

338
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:58,491
I understand.

339
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:00,141
You're saying the other one is to me.

340
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:03,481
Why do you have to be so long-winded? It's boring.

341
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:15,521
The other time was...

342
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:17,671
also to him.

343
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:22,051
When you came to me earlier, he stepped forward again and stopped you.

344
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:23,931
He's always like that to me.

345
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,511
Whenever something happens to me, he is there to take it all.

346
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:28,121
And then he says this to me...

347
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:32,491
"Soo Jin, nothing will happen to you, so don't you worry."

348
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:38,871
So I confessed to him inside my heart.

349
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:42,121
So I feel embarrassed because of that.

350
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,651
Because I can't say it in words.

351
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:48,021
You said it so easily to me in words, so why?

352
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:55,841
When you seriously like someone,

353
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,521
I guess it's impossible to say it in words.

354
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:05,371
I'm afraid when he realizes that I really like him,

355
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:09,691
his love for me might cool down.

356
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:12,221
I'm afraid it all might go away.

357
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:15,221
I think that's why  I'm afraid to say it.

358
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:20,461
I heard rumors.

359
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:25,401
I heard that you are asking around about my school and major because you want to date me again.

360
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:29,551
Isn't it true that you followed us here because you knew that we're coming here for vacation?

361
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:36,251
Dream on, pal. There is no reason to meet someone like you again.

362
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:40,351
Don't you dare touch him ever again. You got that?!

363
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:46,251
Weren't you two dating?

364
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:50,071
What the hell? Why is that girl so damn arrogant?

365
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:54,111
Pack up. Let's go somewhere else. It's boring here.

366
00:21:54,111 --> 00:21:56,821
I think it's fun here.

367
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:07,121
Are you okay?

368
00:22:09,991 --> 00:22:12,051
Please stop getting beaten up all the time.

369
00:22:12,051 --> 00:22:15,611
You used to be an athlete, but you're always getting beaten up?

370
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:25,261
But I  was an awesome fighter just yesterday.

371
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:29,691
Man, yesterday I was so good...

372
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,611
Let's go!

373
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:33,751
Where are you guys going?

374
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:37,341
We finally realized what you pointed out to us.

375
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:39,831
We are going to show them our family power.

376
00:22:39,831 --> 00:22:41,921
Stop messing around and get ready to have some fun.

377
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:44,651
We are here to have fun and not to fight.

378
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:50,611
Hyung, I agree with what Jin Sook just said.

379
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:52,971
Jin Sook is certainly a smart girl.

380
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,961
I'll go first and have some fun.

381
00:22:57,831 --> 00:23:01,341
♫  Let's go and fly lightly over the blue sky  ♫

382
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:04,151
♫  And ride the plane which I dreamed of as a child  ♫

383
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:08,491
♫  I can't say anything of what I looked forward to then  ♫

384
00:23:08,491 --> 00:23:11,381
♫  I can't say what I was thinking  ♫

385
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:13,511
Hey, look at Pil.

386
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:17,231
Isn't he the guy who fainted about thirty minutes ago?

387
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:20,781
I know, right? Whoever marries him won't be bored at all for sure,

388
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:22,721
since there is something going on with him everyday.

389
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:26,331
Hey, you sound immature.

390
00:23:26,331 --> 00:23:30,051
We have to meet someone that's smart rather than a person that'll give us a good time.

391
00:23:30,051 --> 00:23:31,551
We have to think of our offspring.

392
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:33,241
I'm sure you have to stoop to that.

393
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:36,091
I must do that.

394
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:38,391
Come here. Come over here.

395
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:42,691
- Come over here. 
 - Oppa. Oppa!

396
00:23:42,691 --> 00:23:45,481
- Yeah? 
 - Oh, you seem fine now. You came back to life.

397
00:23:45,481 --> 00:23:49,871
- Hello. 
- Hello. Hello.

398
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:52,221
- What were you doing?
 - Are you Pil's friend?

399
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:54,891
Yes, that's right.

400
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,461
- If you have time, you can join us.
 - Oh, really?

401
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:02,951
- You're beautiful.
 - Oh, am I?

402
00:24:02,951 --> 00:24:07,351
Let's go, come on. Hurry, Oppa.

403
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:10,211
Beach ball, here.

404
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:20,461
Kkeut Soon, it's been a long while since we've laid down here together.

405
00:24:20,461 --> 00:24:22,751
Isn't that the line from the show called, "Home of the Stars"?

406
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:25,181
We used to watch that when we were still dating.

407
00:24:25,181 --> 00:24:28,031
We were so hot... in love with each other back in those days.

408
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:31,601
I'm still hot...

409
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:33,971
Ah, really. You're going to suffer from a heatstroke.

410
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:36,831
Has Pil called you yet?

411
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:40,381
He said he was doing good. I'm sure his uncle is taking good care of him.

412
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:44,021
Didn't his uncle really adore the boy ever since he was little?

413
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:49,731
The ocean, the sun, and the warm beach. I bet it's so wonderful to be around all those things.

414
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:54,831
It would be nice if Pil hurries up and realizes how precious being young is.

415
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:57,821
Youth never comes back once it leaves.

416
00:24:57,821 --> 00:25:02,061
But when my boy looks like that, do you think he can even start dating properly, at that rate?

417
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:06,731
If he took after his father, then I'm sure it's not a joke how well he could make a pass at someone.

418
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:13,781
What are you doing?!

419
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:16,431
   
   

420
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:24,081
   

421
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:26,361
We just opened, so please come by.

422
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:29,501
Hello there, we just opened today, so please come by.

423
00:25:29,501 --> 00:25:32,651
Hello, we just opened today, so please come by.

424
00:25:32,651 --> 00:25:36,861
Hello, we just opened today, so please come by.

425
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:40,721
Wow, you're so good with people, Unni.

426
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:43,661
You're treating all the neighborhood people like friends, right?

427
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:48,601
Girl, that's all fake. Stop staring at me so I won't get caught, okay?

428
00:25:54,991 --> 00:25:57,471
   

429
00:26:01,261 --> 00:26:07,661
♫  When I look at you, everything stops  ♫

430
00:26:07,661 --> 00:26:13,841
♫  I'm not sure when it started  ♫

431
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:15,951
   

432
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:19,891
♫  I love you  ♫

433
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:23,681
He just caught my eyes from the start without me even realizing it.

434
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:25,011
Really?!

435
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:29,351
He's really not my style though. What do I call it?

436
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:31,701
- What is it? 
 - You know, it's the way you Seoul people  say it.

437
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:33,591
What term from Seoul I wonder?

438
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,801
I got it. It's "I have the feels."

439
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:40,161
- But that's an English term though.
 - Feel, Feel.

440
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:44,191
We had a drink together last night, and we had tons of fun.

441
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:46,111
He seems to be weak with his liquor.

442
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:47,581
Really?!

443
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:50,401
That's strange. He is good at drinking though.

444
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,351
I wonder what made him so drunk.

445
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:54,651
Hey, you acted as if you were drunk, huh? You did, didn't you?

446
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:56,211
He was just pretending that he was drunk.

447
00:26:56,211 --> 00:26:58,311
I can tell just by looking. He really doesn't have a girlfriend, right?

448
00:26:58,311 --> 00:27:00,551
What did he say himself?

449
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:04,511
You... alcohol...?

450
00:27:04,511 --> 00:27:07,351
Wait guys, let's not talk about stuff like this.

451
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:11,061
Let's talk about the fun stuff, okay? Fun stuff, yeah.

452
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:12,451
- But this is fun.
 - Let's talk about fun things.

453
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:16,541
Girl, stop killing the poor straw.

454
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:19,321
We did already!

455
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:22,681
She seems kind of skilled with what she does.

456
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:28,931
Those two look good together like a beautiful painting.

457
00:27:28,931 --> 00:27:32,651
Gosh, you should stop chewing out that straw!

458
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:37,631
But she better not hit on my Oppa Dal Soo, or else she is going to die.

459
00:27:37,631 --> 00:27:40,661
You wait and see. I'm really strong, you know.

460
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:44,551
I'll be back. I'm going to go over there and have a talk.

461
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:47,151
Where are you going? Let's go together.

462
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:49,641
Goodbye.

463
00:27:50,811 --> 00:27:54,401
I'm sure of it.

464
00:27:57,141 --> 00:28:00,651
Hey, I'm going to go somewhere and do something for a bit, so you go ahead and have fun for the time being.

465
00:28:00,651 --> 00:28:02,301
Okay, I will.

466
00:28:02,301 --> 00:28:04,561
Hey, where are you going?

467
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:07,101
To the pension over there.

468
00:28:07,101 --> 00:28:09,211
What in the world are you going to do at the pension anyways?

469
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:12,391
You know that pension over there.

470
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:14,431
I'm going over there to bring the tube...

471
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,641
H-Have to go re-return them...

472
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,841
- Yeah, re-return them.
 - Why are you stuttering?

473
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:20,461
W-When... did I... st-stutter?

474
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:22,791
You are stuttering now.

475
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:24,571
I'll be back.

476
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:27,121
Hey, are you leaving? Pil!

477
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:32,061
They use it and then don't return it. It's so annoying. Geez!

478
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:36,201
Sorry, Oppa. There's some in my room too.

479
00:28:36,201 --> 00:28:39,541
Then, shall we go get it together?

480
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:43,371
I have friends down from Seoul now. Next time.

481
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:46,801
You came all the way and you're just leaving? Does that make sense?

482
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:50,051
Oppa! Please.  It's because I'm sorry.

483
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:52,781
- Let's go together. 
- No, I can't.

484
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:56,961
Okay, I get it. I'll go by myself.

485
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:02,821
Okay, okay. I'll go. I'll go get it.

486
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,551
Oppa! Let's go.

487
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:10,211
Let's hurry up and go.

488
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:15,061
 Did something happen between me and her? 

489
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:16,611
 Or not? 

490
00:29:16,611 --> 00:29:18,951
 I don't remember. 

491
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:23,061
Didn't you say you'd hurry back to the friends?

492
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,591
 I feel bad about this. 

493
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:26,311
Oppa.

494
00:29:27,021 --> 00:29:28,901
Come over this way, Oppa.

495
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:35,711
Oh no! What shall I do?

496
00:29:35,711 --> 00:29:37,851
N-no, i-it's fine.

497
00:29:37,851 --> 00:29:40,311
No, it's really okay.

498
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,761
H-hey. I'm leaving.

499
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:46,271
What are you doing, Oppa? You came all the way up here to leave?

500
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:48,831
What do you mean I'm just leaving? I'm taking these tubes with me.

501
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:50,651
Oppa, please.

502
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:54,211
My friend won't even come home tonight, so I'm scared by myself.

503
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:56,171
So many men stay in the other room.

504
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:59,191
My friends are waiting for me.   I must get going.

505
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:02,251
Don't go! Please don't go. I'm so scared.

506
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:05,061
I'm telling you that I'm scared. I'm telling you not to go.

507
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:07,831
- Okay? You're not going to leave me, right?
 - I remember now.

508
00:30:07,831 --> 00:30:09,711
What do you remember?

509
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:11,921
Don't remember anything.

510
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:14,611
 - You trash-like jerk. 
 - You trash-like jerk. 

511
00:30:14,611 --> 00:30:15,901
No, you can't!

512
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:19,311
No, this is a trap. Trap indeed.

513
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:22,961
Something very damaging happened.

514
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:27,891
There was a time when none of my friends treated me as a normal human being for awhile.

515
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:32,671
Oppa, I'm hurting.

516
00:30:34,101 --> 00:30:35,681
I'm sorry.

517
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:37,811
It hurts.

518
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:39,651
You okay?

519
00:30:42,811 --> 00:30:46,671
Wow, great job, Bong Pil.

520
00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:48,601
- Bravo!
- Hey. No, it's not.

521
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:50,021
Carry on!  Are you in the middle of doing something?

522
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:51,421
- What happened here? 
 - Wow, seriously.

523
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:52,831
- Is this what she took off just now?
- No, no.

524
00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:55,171
- Hey! 
 - No. You got the wrong idea!

525
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:58,631
You are doing this kind of thing with a girl in broad daylight when you invited us over?

526
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:01,291
Who the heck are you anyway?

527
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:04,651
Hey, none of your business.

528
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:06,331
- I just—
- Oppa.

529
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,251
Move and let go of me.

530
00:31:08,251 --> 00:31:10,511
I was just working on this tube and...

531
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:14,841
These two... tubes... so I... I was climbing the stairs...

532
00:31:14,841 --> 00:31:17,521
You are stuttering again!

533
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:20,671
What's up with these girls? Do you know my oppa?

534
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,551
- "My oppa"?
 - "My oppa"?

535
00:31:22,551 --> 00:31:24,971
She said that in front of us.

536
00:31:24,971 --> 00:31:30,691
Hey, this girl here and this guy here have something together.

537
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:33,181
You satisfied now?! So go!

538
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:35,391
You playing with me?

539
00:31:35,391 --> 00:31:37,641
Man, this is so embarrassing.

540
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:39,421
Forget it!

541
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:41,411
Goodbye!

542
00:31:42,261 --> 00:31:46,591
 I'm sorry. You go ahead and meet a nice man. 

543
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:50,191
 You also have a wonderful... 

544
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:53,581
Hey, why are you staring like that?

545
00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:55,211
- Huh?
 - Why don't you follow her?

546
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:58,011
- Follow her! I said go follow her! 
 - Where...

547
00:31:58,011 --> 00:32:01,161
Go over there and hug her, why don't you? Follow her!

548
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:04,001
We now know the true nature of all this, so we can evacuate now.

549
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:07,121
- I don't feel bad at all, so follow her!
- Let's evacuate.

550
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:08,811
I don't feel bad about it, so just go follow her!

551
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:11,771
Go and give her a hug too!

552
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:19,771
I should've known a bit earlier... What the hell!

553
00:32:21,531 --> 00:32:23,041
Move side! I won't leave him alone!

554
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,761
Jin Sook, just let me go for a moment.

555
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:26,501
What do you mean "let you go"? Stop it!

556
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:30,091
Bong Pil, if you do anything stupid, I'm going to kill you!

557
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:32,051
Hold on a minute! I'm not going to leave you alone for that!

558
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,221
I'm being serious!

559
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:38,021
- Oppa, let's go.
 - Okay.

560
00:32:41,891 --> 00:32:45,481
What shall I do now?  I'm about to go crazy here!

561
00:32:45,481 --> 00:32:49,291
Let's hurry up and go. What did I... what did I...

562
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:52,751
what did I ever do wrong?

563
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:57,851
 Oh! That's... 

564
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,981
 That jerk is... 

565
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:03,901
 What is that pharmacist punk doing here anyway? 

566
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:06,081
 Is this just a coincidence or what? 

567
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:14,971
Hey, what are you? What are you doing here?

568
00:33:14,971 --> 00:33:16,611
Do you even know me?

569
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:20,641
 Oh yeah, this punk doesn't even know who I am yet. 

570
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:23,481
Honey, do you know this person?

571
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:26,011
No, it's my first time seeing him.

572
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:29,101
Do you know me?

573
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:33,441
No, I think I made a mistake.

574
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:36,641
Sorry about that. Sorry.

575
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:56,511
See? What did I say? Those jerks are dating each other after all.

576
00:33:56,511 --> 00:34:00,251
Man, they dated for a very long time.

577
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:04,221
I caught you red-handed. Wait until I go back.

578
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:08,081
I'm going to expose the truth and break off your wedding too.

579
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:11,391
It's 10,000 won please.

580
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:14,171
Thank you very much. Have a nice day.

581
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:17,631
You see this? I told you I just went up there to bring out these tubes!

582
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:19,131
You're right.

583
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:21,191
You happy now? You believe it now?

584
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:23,651
Look over there. Something already happened.

585
00:34:23,651 --> 00:34:25,811
What? What?

586
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:29,521
What about Soo Jin? She is beautiful as usual.

587
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:33,041
Take a better look.

588
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:51,981
 Oh, it's him. 

589
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:03,751
 Miss Soo Jin! Miss Soo Jin. 

590
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:06,271
 Are you okay? Aish! 

591
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,371
Man, just leave them alone.

592
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:21,311
Get out of my way.

593
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:24,571
They look good though.

594
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:27,121
Soo Jin, Soo Jin, Soo Jin.

595
00:35:27,121 --> 00:35:29,461
Soo Jin, that was a misunderstanding.

596
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,301
Look over there! Those are the tubes that I brought from the pension.

597
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:34,931
- My intentions weren't to do anything naughty, okay?
 - So, what?

598
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:36,331
- Did she just say so what?
 - Do you know him?

599
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:39,391
No, I do know him but I'm not close to him. We are just acquaintances.

600
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:41,821
Oppa, should we go for a walk?

601
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:44,181
Yes, we can go.

602
00:35:48,971 --> 00:35:51,761
The traffic was so heavy on my way over here.

603
00:35:51,761 --> 00:35:53,531
- Oh, really?
 - Was traffic bad for you too?

604
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:55,201
But I didn't bring my car here...

605
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:57,121
I think it took about six hours to get here.

606
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,701
Oh really?

607
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:02,721
A straw for one and a can for the other. It's so pitiful to watch.

608
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:08,231
Hey. Soo Jin's been hanging around in front of you for the last twenty minutes.

609
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:10,291
So what?

610
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,051
You still don't get it?!

611
00:36:12,051 --> 00:36:14,841
Soo Jin is bored talking with that guy.

612
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:19,481
And she is crying for help to get her out of there with all of her body.

613
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:22,041
- What? 
 - For goodness sake.

614
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:24,431
It's not only track and field that you have a poor start.

615
00:36:24,431 --> 00:36:29,051
You have a poor start with romance too. That means you have no sense.

616
00:36:29,051 --> 00:36:31,271
You should be starting even before you here the gun goes bang!

617
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:33,791
That's what a guy with sense does.

618
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:38,141
Oh! Oh!

619
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:41,291
What are you doing?  You should be running now. The game has already begun.

620
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:44,371
Bang!

621
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:46,421
Bang!

622
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:49,851
- Isn't it funny?
- Yeah, that's so awesome!

623
00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:51,071
Soo Jin!

624
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:53,121
What the? You're here again.

625
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:55,451
Soo Jin, let's go. The sun will go down pretty soon too.

626
00:36:55,451 --> 00:36:57,581
Campfire...

627
00:36:57,581 --> 00:37:01,891
Oh, we can't do that. No fire. I'll put some sunblock on you.

628
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:02,961
I already put it on earlier.

629
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:05,941
The woman doesn't want it. Why are you bothering her?

630
00:37:05,941 --> 00:37:07,461
But you don't have to push him.

631
00:37:07,461 --> 00:37:09,891
- My goodness.
 - Would you like to visit my tent?

632
00:37:09,891 --> 00:37:11,321
We also have a lot of barbecue meat.

633
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:15,471
We have tons of meat here too.

634
00:37:15,471 --> 00:37:17,241
What are you?

635
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:21,981
He is the only son for three generations of the Yoon Clan,

636
00:37:21,981 --> 00:37:24,351
and you dare to hit him like this?

637
00:37:24,351 --> 00:37:27,751
No, it's just that this man kept on stalking this beautiful lady.

638
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:31,691
It doesn't matter if my nephew is stalking someone or playing with stockings.

639
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:35,471
It doesn't matter. I am the one that has the right to beat him up, okay?

640
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:41,411
So don't touch him! If you do that, I can knock you out with just one punch.

641
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:44,871
Get going! You can go grill your own meat over there.

642
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:46,531
Go play amongst yourselves quietly!

643
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:51,791
Truth be told, I'm also part of the marines, Sir.

644
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,941
- What? What class?
 - Class 1900th, Sir!

645
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:56,061
Oh yeah? Then hurry up and run.

646
00:37:56,061 --> 00:37:58,291
- Victory! 
- Victory!

647
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:01,471
Take this.

648
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:03,561
I'm giving you this so you can have fun with your friends.

649
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:05,931
You must go have fun all the way.

650
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:08,641
- Make it happen!
 - Make it happen!

651
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:12,591
Please adore my nephew Pil.

652
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,641
Yes, Uncle.

653
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:23,181

It's so nice.

666
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:34,431
I have to go study.

667
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:36,931
It's so pretty.

668
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:39,011
The sun is setting now.

669
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:42,871
Wow, I'm so hungry.

676

♫ The man is crying with a smile

677
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:30,521
Ah man, more booze.

678
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:33,421
You drank it all, Hyung. The singing is so awesome.

679
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:39,521
♫ How much more

680
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:45,921
♫ I'm just looking at you

00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:51,431
♫ This love is like a wind. This love is so useless.

682
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:55,221
 Today is the day of the fire accident. A fire will happen. 

683
00:40:55,221 --> 00:40:59,561
 A fire will happen. A fire will happen. A fire will happen. 

684
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:05,211
 I can just blow it out. Be focused. Be focused. 

685
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:07,561
 I'm going to blow out the fire, and I'm going to be the one to save her. 

686
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:11,921
 I'm going to save her. 

687
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:16,121
♫ I, who love you, am still with you.

688
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:17,531
Hey, Seok Tae.

689
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:19,401
Huh? What's up?

690
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:21,701
Please don't do that.

691
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:24,441
I would like to ask you to let me be in peace since I'm at such a beautiful place.

692
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:31,451
That was good.

693
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:34,891
Let's try not to sing about love if we can help it.

694
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:37,281
Why, Oppa?

695
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:43,501
Love is something that you need to approach in a rational way, but nobody among us is rational. That's why.

696
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,171
What are you talking about?

697
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:48,631
Love is something that you do with hot passion, with all your heart.

698
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,771
But if it gets heated up fast then it cools off just as fast too.

699
00:41:50,771 --> 00:41:55,811
Mental exchange helps a relationship last a lot longer than something physical. It's all about being platonic.

700
00:41:55,811 --> 00:41:58,601
Wow, smart guy.

701
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:02,821
I like that about you too. I like everything that you do.

702
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:05,111
He thinks he's all that.

703
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:07,081
Hey!

704
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:11,081
Do you even know what love is?

705
00:42:11,081 --> 00:42:15,471
Even when you love someone and you just can't bear to say "I love you."

706
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:18,231
Do you know what that feels like?

707
00:42:29,251 --> 00:42:32,401
I must get going now.

708
00:42:32,401 --> 00:42:34,641
- Don't get up, guys.
 - Where you going, Uncle?

709
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:40,351
There are my lady fans waiting for me in town so I must get going.

710
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,381
Why are there so many fire extinguishers here?

711
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:45,181
Are you guys playing some relay game here?

712
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:47,801
Just in case. Since we have a bonfire here...

713
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:52,061
Are you afraid that your heart will be burning with fire or something?

714
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:55,131
Wow, you are all grown now, boy.

715
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:58,821
This little guy here couldn't even go peeing and pooping by himself...

716
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:02,191
Fine, fine. I'll be going now. Have fun, kids.

717
00:43:02,191 --> 00:43:05,381
- Call me if you need anything, alright, Pil?
 - Yes, sir.

718
00:43:05,381 --> 00:43:08,591
- Make sure to eat some appetizers with your drinks too, okay?
 - Yes. Victory, Sir!

719
00:43:08,591 --> 00:43:10,261
Victory!

720
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:14,241
- Bye!
 - Bye!

721
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:18,171
♫  Since love came and knocked on my heart  ♫

722
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:21,771
Wow, so pretty.

723
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:31,781
♫   It gently enters, comes beside me, and excites me  ♫

724
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:36,451
♫  This love which stays in front of me while whispering in my ear  ♫

725
00:43:36,451 --> 00:43:38,891
Thank for what you did earlier, Pil.

726
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:42,791
I'm sorry as well.

727
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:45,451
Oh...

728
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:49,391
♫   My heart is pounding, smiling broadly I whisper to myself  ♫

729
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:52,451
♫   You are the so-called feeling. You are the small tremor  ♫

730
00:43:52,451 --> 00:43:57,741
 Why does she have to be so pretty? 

731
00:43:57,741 --> 00:44:01,101
 Should I just go ahead and kiss her? 

732
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:04,521
 Should I just prepare myself to get slapped and do it? 

733
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:09,441
Even if it's something I can take care of on my own,

734
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:14,401
if someone just comes forward to help me,

735
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:19,611
that gets me to think that I'm not alone after all for some reason.

736
00:44:19,621 --> 00:44:23,181
And it makes me feel confident and reassured.

737
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:27,561
You know what?

738
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:31,311
If something were to happen to me in the future...

739
00:44:32,741 --> 00:44:38,421
are you going to come forward and do something like what you did today?

740
00:44:38,421 --> 00:44:41,691
♫   Secretly entering, come beside me and excite me more  ♫

741
00:44:41,691 --> 00:44:49,451
♫   My heart which is on the tip of my tongue confesses to you always  ♫

742
00:44:49,451 --> 00:44:51,881
Don't mess with me.

743
00:44:51,881 --> 00:44:53,621
Wh-what?

744
00:44:53,621 --> 00:44:57,181
Whenever I give you chance, you get filled with lusty thoughts.

745
00:44:57,181 --> 00:45:00,011
Wh-what did I do?

746
00:45:00,011 --> 00:45:03,471
I can tell just by looking at your eyes. Do you want to die?

747
00:45:07,011 --> 00:45:12,451
 I would die a happy man if she just gave me a kiss already. 

748
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:15,031
Hey.

749
00:45:15,981 --> 00:45:17,721
Do you even remember this?

750
00:45:17,721 --> 00:45:21,441
Oh! This thing is still alive and doing well?

751
00:45:21,441 --> 00:45:24,671
Whatever you own doesn't last long since you always break it.

752
00:45:24,671 --> 00:45:26,911
But for some strange reason this thing never breaks.

753
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:30,911
This thing takes some good pictures too. This guy brings in the good feels.

754
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:34,021
Do all you can to take good pictures.

755
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:36,071
You are talented with photography.

756
00:45:36,071 --> 00:45:40,031
You'll be making a living with this in the future.

757
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:41,991
- Seriously?
 - Yes.

758
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:44,521
To me...

759
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:47,581
I have this set of eyes that can look into the future.

760
00:45:48,891 --> 00:45:51,661
Then what's your future going to be like?

761
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:53,971
I...

762
00:45:55,251 --> 00:45:58,441
 will be marrying you of course. 

763
00:45:59,411 --> 00:46:02,151
I'm... going to go get some firewood.

764
00:46:02,151 --> 00:46:06,871
Hey. Hey! Hey!

765
00:46:15,061 --> 00:46:19,931
August 17, 2011.

766
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:23,701
This here...

767
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:28,051
will be called, "Run to me."

768
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:31,411
This will be a good title for it.

769
00:46:32,811 --> 00:46:34,711
So cute.

770
00:46:43,361 --> 00:46:46,921
I'm so tired from all that drinking.

771
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:50,111
Ah, so tired.

772
00:46:56,041 --> 00:47:02,931
Oppa, what do you think of me? Rationally speaking?

773
00:47:02,931 --> 00:47:07,551
I'm not sure because my rationality is becoming numb.

774
00:47:07,551 --> 00:47:10,831
No, that's not what I mean.

775
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:15,021
I'm talking about a man and a woman.

776
00:47:15,021 --> 00:47:19,121
Then you shouldn't have said, "rationally speaking."

777
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:23,041
What you're supposed to say is "by the opposite sex."

778
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:27,861
But why is your rationality feeling numb?

779
00:47:27,861 --> 00:47:29,641
You said that your rationality was becoming numb.

780
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:34,011
I don't know. I have no idea why my body is feeling this way.

781
00:47:34,881 --> 00:47:39,591
That moon over there looks so erotic to me.

782
00:47:39,591 --> 00:47:42,711
What about that moon? Ah, where?

783
00:47:45,111 --> 00:47:48,631
Ow, freaking hot!

784
00:47:48,631 --> 00:47:52,241
- Are you alright?  What are we going to do?
 - Don't touch my leg.

785
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:53,891
Where? Here?

786
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:56,301
Yeah, over there. Right there.

787
00:47:58,781 --> 00:48:01,611
- Are you okay?
 - Yeah.

788
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:07,181
Where did Oppa Dal Soo and Jeong Ae go anyway?

789
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:10,541
Oh, I haven't seen them since earlier now that I think about it.

790
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:13,841
Maybe they went somewhere to exchange something mentally.

791
00:48:15,301 --> 00:48:18,021
Alright! Right on.

792
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:22,051
So during this trip, those two will be getting it on. Then they will end up living together.

793
00:48:22,051 --> 00:48:26,181
So this means she won't be in a relationship with Hyung Goo Gil. This is awesome actually.

794
00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:28,011
Ah, you scared me.

795
00:48:28,011 --> 00:48:30,861
Where did Jeong Ae and Dal Soo go now?

796
00:48:30,861 --> 00:48:34,951
Maybe they went to go to sleep. Just go to sleep already!

797
00:48:34,951 --> 00:48:37,061
They are both sleeping together?!

798
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:40,381
When? Where? Who? How? Why?

799
00:48:40,381 --> 00:48:44,231
You guys are so silly.

800
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:46,751
Pil is not even drinking.

801
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:52,011
I'm going to go in and get some sleep.

802
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:56,451
This punk, Seok Tae...  no matter where he goes,

803
00:48:56,451 --> 00:48:59,411
this guy always sleeps like a homeless guy.

804
00:48:59,411 --> 00:49:02,451
Thanks for the hard work.

805
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:09,911
Where are these bastards, huh?

806
00:49:09,911 --> 00:49:12,441
Hyung, just go get some sleep!

807
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:14,981
Stop interfering with their relationship please!

808
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:18,551
Pil, I'm going to go get some sleep now. I'm going to use your little dorm room, okay?

809
00:49:18,551 --> 00:49:20,991
Hey, no. Not there.

810
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,451
Absolutely not in that place!

811
00:49:23,451 --> 00:49:28,261
I can't sleep in the tent. I need to sleep on the hard floor with a hard wall.

812
00:49:28,261 --> 00:49:33,091
No, no, no, no. You also got into an accident last time because of your stubbornness.

813
00:49:33,091 --> 00:49:35,311
What are you talking about?

814
00:49:35,311 --> 00:49:38,051
You are going to stay with me tonight.

815
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:42,611
That's the safest for you. So you'll be with me and we can chit chat and...

816
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:46,271
And we can use this atmosphere to talk about something real nice.

817
00:49:46,271 --> 00:49:48,141
Look at this guy.

818
00:49:48,141 --> 00:49:50,981
What are we going to do together now?

819
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:56,031
Look at your eyes. Your eyes are looking very strange, very strange indeed.

820
00:49:56,031 --> 00:49:57,681
What are we supposed to do all night anyway?

821
00:49:57,681 --> 00:50:00,741
There won't be another opportunity like this again, right?

822
00:50:00,741 --> 00:50:03,361
And besides, I have to go somewhere later.

823
00:50:03,361 --> 00:50:05,261
Where are you going?

824
00:50:05,261 --> 00:50:07,151
So...

825
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:12,771
T-there is this p-place... yeah. I'm not going there because I want to though.

826
00:50:12,771 --> 00:50:17,421
I'm destined to go there, so until 12 o'clock...

827
00:50:17,421 --> 00:50:20,831
Where do you think you'll be going leaving me behind, huh?

828
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:24,291
You said that there will be an accident, so you should stay here and protect me, you punk.

829
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:27,751
Hey, you stay right here and protect me.

830
00:50:27,751 --> 00:50:30,411
If you go anywhere you're going to die. Got that?!

831
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:33,301
- Okay.
 - You go over there and watch over this place.

832
00:50:33,301 --> 00:50:35,151
Alright.

833
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:49,351
So dizzy.

834
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:54,441
Ah, it's cold.

835
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,361
  
  

836
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:04,111
Let's see here.

837
00:51:05,571 --> 00:51:09,851
Alright, I have about an hour left.

838
00:51:09,851 --> 00:51:12,461
All I have to do is endure till then.

839
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:15,811
Now I know for sure that the pharmacist jerk is a player.

840
00:51:15,811 --> 00:51:17,681
And that church boy situation is all set and done.

841
00:51:17,681 --> 00:51:21,541
So when I go back, everything will be back to normal again.

842
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:23,801
Alright, Bong Pil, you have one hour!

843
00:51:23,801 --> 00:51:25,891
Let's just do this for another hour!

844
00:51:25,891 --> 00:51:28,761
As long as there is no fire.

845
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:48,661
Where did everybody go?

846
00:51:49,351 --> 00:51:51,421
So cold.

847
00:52:01,801 --> 00:52:04,041
So cold.

848
00:52:12,701 --> 00:52:14,741
I need to pee.

849
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:33,101
Hey Pil, why aren't you asleep? What are you doing out here?

850
00:52:33,101 --> 00:52:37,231
None of your business. Where are you going?

851
00:52:37,231 --> 00:52:40,031
I have to go pee.

852
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,471
What about the campfire?

853
00:52:41,471 --> 00:52:44,591
I think it died out... maybe not?

854
00:52:44,591 --> 00:52:47,001
Where did everybody go?

855
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:49,471
Some are sleeping and some just left to go get some sleep.

856
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:52,511
And some went to go disturb the ones that are already sleeping.

857
00:52:52,511 --> 00:52:55,721
Hurry  up and go pee so you can go back in already!

858
00:52:55,721 --> 00:53:00,351
No, until the very end, I need to make sure that everything is fine.

859
00:53:04,961 --> 00:53:07,821
He's crazy. He finally went mad.

860
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:09,781
It's over now.

861
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:24,231
Alright, everything is perfect now.

862
00:53:25,371 --> 00:53:27,771
It's all over now.

863
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:30,611
Jeong Ae, wait for me.

864
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:33,291
You two go play now!

865
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:34,831
- What's wrong?!
- Ah, really!

866
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:37,811
I told him not to interfere, but he still did it anyway.

867
00:53:37,811 --> 00:53:40,951
This can be troublesome if I'm not careful.

868
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,101
I can't help but...

869
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:11,381
- Come on now. 
 - What?

870
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,361
You should go to sleep after drinking so much.

871
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:15,071
Why are you roaming around like this, Hyung?

872
00:54:15,071 --> 00:54:17,431
- Hurry up and come if you're drunk! 
 - What?

873
00:54:17,431 --> 00:54:19,201
Oh!

874
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:23,311
Fire! It's a fire!

875
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:25,031
It's a fire!

876
00:54:28,741 --> 00:54:31,331
Hey! Hey!

877
00:54:40,551 --> 00:54:42,041
Oh! What is that over there?

878
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:46,171
The smoke is too intense for it to be from a campfire.

879
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:49,901
Oh my! Pil! Oh, Pil!

880
00:54:49,901 --> 00:54:52,351
It's a fire!

881
00:54:53,981 --> 00:54:57,851
Call 911!

882
00:55:04,821 --> 00:55:07,311
Call 911!

883
00:55:07,311 --> 00:55:09,281
Blow out the fire!

884
00:55:09,281 --> 00:55:11,171
Hurry!

885
00:55:12,441 --> 00:55:14,521
Splash the water!

886
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:16,681
Don't do that!

887
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,501
Let go!

888
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:21,101
None of us are going to get hurt!

889
00:55:21,101 --> 00:55:22,681
Give me that!

890
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:25,311
Over there! Move away!

891
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:28,431
Move! Over there!

892
00:55:30,521 --> 00:55:32,641
Pil!

893
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:39,171
Hurry up and call 911!

894
00:55:42,871 --> 00:55:45,221
Let's dive in.

895
00:55:50,871 --> 00:55:54,571
Soo Jin! Soo Jin!

896
00:55:58,381 --> 00:56:02,511
Soo Jin! Wake up, Soo Jin. Soo Jin, wake up!

897
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:40,231
Splash it!

898
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,271
Is she okay?!

899
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:42,961
She's okay.

900
00:56:42,961 --> 00:56:45,031
911!

901
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:49,971
Soo Jin! Soo Jin, wake up. Soo Jin!

902
00:57:11,701 --> 00:57:16,251
Oh, Pil. Bong Pil.

903
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:33,331
What's going on?

904
00:57:34,971 --> 00:57:36,671
Hey, Pil.

905
00:57:38,141 --> 00:57:42,821
Pil, you okay?

906
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:45,661
What is going on, huh?

907
00:57:48,241 --> 00:57:53,001
Didn't I tell you that nothing will happen to you no matter what?

908
00:57:53,751 --> 00:57:59,211
You asked me if I would come forward and be there for you if something happened to you?

909
00:58:00,941 --> 00:58:03,171
Of course I would.

910
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:06,811
Was there a time when I didn't?

911
00:58:08,871 --> 00:58:10,671
Hey.

912
00:58:51,831 --> 00:58:53,941
 12 o'clock. 

913
00:58:56,151 --> 00:58:58,411
Wait, hold up!

914
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:01,971
Hey, Soo Jin!

915
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,731
Hey, Soo Jin!

916
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:06,821
Manhole, hold up. Just five more seconds! One more second!

917
00:59:06,821 --> 00:59:09,861
You cruel manhole bastard!

918
00:59:23,621 --> 00:59:29,221
Seriously. Manhole, what's wrong with your timing?

919
00:59:29,221 --> 00:59:31,441
What am I supposed to do with this?

920
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:03,741
That scared me.

921
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:07,011
   

922
01:00:13,841 --> 01:00:17,121
I'm wearing a suit and tie.

923
01:00:18,631 --> 01:00:21,711
Everything seems a bit better this time.

924
01:00:21,711 --> 01:00:23,511
Wait a minute.

925
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,611
Alright, even the tattoo is gone.

926
01:00:29,611 --> 01:00:32,931
So everything is back to normal now. This is great.

927
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:38,091
I saved Soo Jin's life and I also know the rules to all of this,

928
01:00:38,091 --> 01:00:40,831
so now I can do everything the right way.

929
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:44,191
Soo Jin, where are you now?

930
01:00:46,201 --> 01:00:53,301


931
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:56,341
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

932
01:00:56,341 --> 01:00:59,241
♫  I think of it throughout the day  ♫

933
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:04,091
♫  I've fallen in love  ♫

934
01:01:04,091 --> 01:01:05,801
♫  I want you. Stay with me.  ♫

935
01:01:05,801 --> 01:01:08,481
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

936
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:11,421
♫  Every day you overwhelm me  ♫

937
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:16,491
♫  I've fallen for you  ♫

938
01:01:16,491 --> 01:01:20,151
♫  I want you. Stay with me.  ♫

939
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:24,021
   
 Do you know that we haven't made any progress yet? 

940
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:26,311
 What progress? 

941
01:01:26,311 --> 01:01:28,951
 Is love mathematics? Are you studying right now? 

942
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:32,151
 Perhaps this is like doing research. Should I say, research about physicality? 

943
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:33,501
 Oppa, let's do some research. 

944
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:35,601
 Wait. Wait a moment. 

945
01:01:35,621 --> 01:01:37,781
 Hey! Hey! 

946
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:39,221
 What are you doing to your family member?! 

947
01:01:39,221 --> 01:01:41,331
 Family members shouldn't treat each other that way! We are not animals! 

948
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:42,541
 Oppa, what are you talking about? 

949
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:45,151
 Jeong Ae, we are having a man to man talk here. 

950
01:01:45,151 --> 01:01:48,481
 Dal Soo, let's not ruin our friendship. 

951
01:01:48,481 --> 01:01:50,551
 Let's work at it. 

952
01:01:50,551 --> 01:01:51,371
 You go back— 

953
01:01:51,371 --> 01:01:55,211
 Jeong Ae! It was a lovely night. Good night. 

954
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,381
 Let's go, Friend. 

955
01:01:59,741 --> 01:02:01,641
  I'll kill you! 

956
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:03,300
 - Hey! Hey!
- Stop there!
