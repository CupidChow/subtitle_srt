1
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,370
Aish...

2
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,620
This is my neighborhood.

3
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,790
That scared me!

4
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,300
 This is the 12 o'clock noon news. 

5
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,320
  Organized groups of gang members who fought for rights in broad daylight  

6
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,700
  have been arrested in droves.  

7
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,640
  On the 15th, the Seoul Prosecutors Office  

8
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,290
  have arrested 23 members between two different gangs  

9
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,580
  who fought over the rights of illegal financial accounts... 

10
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,310
Who is this?

11
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,760
No... No way.

12
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,810
No way... Is this me?

13
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,770
   

14
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,250
Why am I in this state?

15
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,980
What happened to this neighborhood?

16
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,390
- Hello.
- Hello.

17
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,370
 What the heck? Why are these people whom I don't know greeting me?  

18
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,390
Yeah, okay.

19
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,470
Aish... this... how do I get back?

20
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,730
Wait a second. What's  today's date?

21
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,860
Promissory Note...

22
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,320
 If it's 2017, then have I returned? 

23
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,620
 But I'm not the me ... whom I know. 

24
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,680
Aish...

25
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,040
   

26
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,380
 What was the important thing you wanted to tell me? 

27
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,690
 - Ah...
- What is it? 

28
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,760
 You can tell me now. 

29
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,450
 I... The truth is... 

30
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,800
 Every time I see you... 

31
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,960
 Every time you... see me? 

32
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,500
 I have to pee. 

33
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,460
 If you replied to my text, that would have been enough.  

34
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,890
 Text? What text? Did you send me a text? 

35
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,080
 Get lo— No, I'll get lost. 

36
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,740
 Soo Jin. 

37
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,590
 It just happened, but 10 years have passed. 

38
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,730
Is this real?

39
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,160
Aish...

40
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,030
Ah, this is real!

41
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,150
There's no one. We just need to leave.

42
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,880
- Oh? 
 - These  two just ...

43
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,160
Father! Mother!

44
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,120
We said we wouldn't raise you anymore.

45
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,860
Where's your father and mother?

46
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,560
We promised to forget about our family ties, didn't we?

47
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,020
Why are you being like this all of a sudden?

48
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,740
We already buried that child in our hearts.

49
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,650
The beautiful image of that seven-year-old is in here.

50
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,920
So even if you get dragged to the police station, don't mention your family.

51
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,720
We've been there so many times I remember every single detail of their interior construction! I do!

52
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,100
Ahem. We agreed to forget everything, so don't say that with emotion.

53
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,770
Of course, Honey. I chipped my nail  while I was cleaning today, so I'm a bit sensitive.

54
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,160
We will soon leave this wretched neighborhood.

55
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,730
Don't look for us. Let's go.

56
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,220
Ah, Mom! Mom! Father!

57
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,260
How did our neighborhood become like this?

58
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,460
It's a pickpocket! A pickpocket!

59
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,800
It's a pickpocket!

60
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,200
Aren't you going to stop? Stop there, you punk!

61
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Pickpocket!

62
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,970
   

63
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,240
Oh. This is Hyung Dal Soo's shop.

64
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,640
What's wrong with his shop?

65
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,870
Ugh, the dust.

66
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,090
Agh, what happened here?

67
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,130
Hyung. Dal Soo Hyung.

68
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,860
Agh, where— That scared me!

69
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,380
Uh... who who are you?

70
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,390
Who are you?

71
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,330
Oh... Hyung Dal Soo?!

72
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,430
Bong Pil.

73
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,790
Dal... Dal Soo Hyung...

74
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,160
Dal... uh.

75
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,340
But what happened to you, Hyung?

76
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,050
I don't know when it started to go wrong either.

77
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,160
If I knew that, I would change my life. Would I be living like this?

78
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,290
What's up?

79
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,150
Oh... that's right.

80
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,230
Hyung, I'm a bit strange.

81
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,440
While coming here, I got into some fight but then I just dodge all the punches.

82
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,400
And every time I hear police sirens, I get so surprised.

83
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,020
And my mom and dad keep talking nonsense.

84
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,870
They won't acknowledge me as a person!

85
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,490
Why are you asking me that after three years of hiding?

86
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,130
Three...

87
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,670
Wait. Hyung.

88
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,980
I haven't been here in three years?

89
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,920
That's right.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,010
T-Then, where do I live right now?

91
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,070
I don't know where you live either.

92
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,340
Ah! Seok Tae said you live around the adult entertainment area.

93
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,360
H-Hyung.

94
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,290
Why did I become like this?

95
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,360
Are you regretting your life now after all those fights, screams, and blood?

96
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,270
What are you talking about? Explain it so I understand.

97
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,960
Okay.

98
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,270
Ready, action!

99
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,220
After that church fight incident, you got suspended from school and kicked off the track team.

100
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,620
And then you were wild and full of yourself.

101
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,960
You started to beat up those who were notorious for their fighting around our neighborhood.

102
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,400
It was like a beast's thirst for blood.

103
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,330
And then some people started to view you as a threat.

104
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,490
So the gangs around the town gathered and threw a party for the new face who invaded their territory.

105
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,560
However, the only one who actually enjoyed that party was you.

106
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,830
It was fine up to there.

107
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,630
You became the center of all the incidents

108
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,430
and also became the most wanted criminal from the police.

109
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,500
You became everyone's enemy. Public enemy.

110
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,250
So you mean... I... I really have a criminal record?

111
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,830
Aish... I'm going crazy.

112
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,460
Ugh, so?

113
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,270
I... really became a thug?

114
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,770
After the church fight, you became a thug.

115
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,140
What's so new about...

116
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,840
It's self denial, right? Self denial!

117
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,370
You can do it. Keep doing it. Enjoy it.

118
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,390
Do it.

119
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
That's right.

120
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,710
What about Soo Jin?

121
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,830
Soo Jin? She's getting married next weekend.

122
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,450
Why are you asking about her?

123
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,990
What do you mean, why?

124
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,160
I'm asking why.

125
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,410
Because I like Soo Jin. You know that.

126
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,920
You? Why?

127
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,410
You're asking why?

128
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,970
You and Soo Jin have never interacted like that.

129
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,700
So why?

130
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,880
Everything's changed.

131
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,420
Just because I beat up the church oppa that day,

132
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,730
the present has changed.

133
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,880
Hey, Seok Tae!

134
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,130
Ah, where did this guy go now, really.

135
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,520
Huh?  Why is this kid here? 

136
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,710
Shalom.

137
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,490
Seok Tae left earlier.

138
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,610
 What is this kid? 

139
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,400
Hey,  you. What are you doing here?

140
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,590
Studying, what else?

141
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,460
Why are you studying, punk? It doesn't suit you. You should become a person.

142
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,380
Uh, I need to study in order to become a person.

143
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,700
No way. Look at this.

144
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,510
You're in my seat, doing my studying.

145
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,570
It's not easy fulfilling a dream of being a police officer.

146
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,780
What do you mean police officer? You? You're just a bum!

147
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,990
I was like that ten years ago. Before we met.

148
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,410
That night, I realized something. 
 ♬   Hallelujah!  ♬

149
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,370
To put it simply, I was saved.

150
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,090
 I must have switched lives with this punk. 

151
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,100
 Aish, what a curse. 

152
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,860
We don't have any customers.

153
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,540
I'm back.

154
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,120
You're back?

155
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,700
So did you find any marriage gifts you liked?

156
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,630
I don't know, they're all the same.

157
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,540
If I like it, it's expensive. And if it's at a moderate price, I don't like it.

158
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,070
Right? Why did our son-in-law's parents pick such a big house for the newly wed couple?

159
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,880
Too much money is going out to fill that house.

160
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,790
What's the big deal? You can live with open spaces without too many things.

161
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,830
What's with filling in the whole house?

162
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,760
You're saying that so easily.

163
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,930
They will look down and take her lightly then.

164
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,700
Why did you even get involved with the auction business and waste all that money?

165
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,370
Really.

166
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,120
Welcome.

167
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,290
What can I get you?

168
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,590
My head hurts a bit.

169
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:09,270
There are different types of headaches. Is it a migraine or a tension headache?

170
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,060
I'm just troubled with something.

171
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,730
Troubled?

172
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,510
Here? Or what about here?

173
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,460
No. It hurts here.

174
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,780
- Here?
- Yeah.

175
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,690
Here? Here?

176
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,440
Stop!

177
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,940
Is it fun playing customer? Both of you, get out.

178
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,870
Why? What? You think a forty-year-old bachelor doesn't have human rights?

179
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,500
You cringe shits, get out!

180
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,990
I'm scared.

181
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,370
Won't you leave?!

182
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,170
Pil is back.

183
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,590
- What?
- Why?

184
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,080
You say Pil is back? Wow...

185
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,940
I didn't hear from him for a while, so I thought he was in some prison.

186
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,000
What are the police doing? The neighborhood is becoming a mess.

187
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,190
Hey, don't be like that! We were all a family once.

188
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,670
Pil is not a bad kid.

189
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,000
- He's bad.
- No he's not.

190
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,500
- But Pil was saying something weird. 
 - Wh-wh-what is it?

191
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:12,080
He said, "Why is my life like this" and that he liked Soo Jin.

192
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,700
- Why? He must be crazy, even about someone getting married. 
- Exactly.

193
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,030
But Pil did like her.

194
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,000
When I was younger,

195
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,340
Pil dragged me to the playground and beat me up because I liked her.

196
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,620
Hey, you guys saw him beating up that guy at church ten years ago!

197
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,620
- Yeah, he's a total thug. 
- You're right.

198
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,510
That church hyung was really nice.

199
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,080
Anyway,  starting from when he was younger, he was overflowing with a thug vibe.

200
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,940
In my opinion, I think he needs to go to jail a few more times in order to come to his senses.

201
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,400
He has a long way to go before he becomes a person.

202
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:55,960
N-N-N-No, I was t-talking about m-my friend, Young Pil. That was about my friend Young Pil. That ...

203
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,970
Our Bong Pil is a gentle and nice guy.

204
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,970
Right. Here, drink this juice. It's  yours.

205
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,870
What are you guys doing gathered here?

206
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,580
I went to Goo Gil's store, but it was closed.

207
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,710
O-Oh.

208
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,640
That, I was thinking of closing down the store and starting something else.

209
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:29,650
Why? You said that you would protect that place until the day of your death because you inherited it from your father.

210
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,160
Will you stop interfering with our business?

211
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,950
- Honey, it's been a while since we saw a friend, so...
- Why is he so invested all of  a sudden?

212
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,600
Hey, wait a minute. What did you just say?

213
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,080
Oh, Pil, you know how she usually talks like this.

214
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,260
I said, who are you to keep interfering with our business?

215
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,310
Honey, quiet! I said be quiet.

216
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,430
What do you mean, "our"?

217
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:49,470
What about our business? Stop being curious about me and Oppa Goo Gil! Why?

218
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,620
Honey. Stop it.

219
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,850
Hey, no way.

220
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,900
Are y-you livin— working with Goo Gil?

221
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,700
Yeah, why?

222
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,370
What about Hyung Dal Soo?

223
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,430
You worked together and lived with him.

224
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,730
What are you talking about? Why would I be with Oppa Dal Soo? This punk.

225
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,270
- He's saying nonsense.
- Honey, tolerate it.

226
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:18,210
 What is this? Jeong Ae is supposed to be with Dal Soo. 

227
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,960
 So that's why that punk is so ruined. 

228
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,490
Jeong Ae did like me. She gave me a love letter too.

229
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,990
- Hey, that was a long time ago.
- Hey, that was a long time ago.

230
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,570
- Did I say anything? 
 - Ah, this bastard.

231
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,830
She bought me a hamburger too.

232
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,250
Guys, wait.

233
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:43,730
I've had this weird feeling before, in high school.

234
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,820
 Do you believe in "time travel"? 

235
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,270
 Are you talking about time travel? 

236
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,610
 If I were from the future ... 

237
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:05,540
Back then too, you were suddenly saying strange things. Ten years ago.

238
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,220
That wasn't ten years ago; it was yesterday.

239
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,440
Wait so, you fell through a manhole and traveled to the past?

240
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,800
There's no way to explain this.

241
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,120
Hey. I'm saying this isn't really my life.

242
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,530
You know it well. I'm really not the type to become a gangster, am I?

243
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,200
Wait so, you fell through the manhole, traveled to the past and beat up the church oppa,

244
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,330
and that's how your life became so twisted?

245
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,540
Yeah, that's what I'm saying!

246
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,670
Yeah, I can't believe it either. How could you believe it?

247
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,790
Wait, wait.

248
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,860
Hey. What happened to our neighborhood?

249
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,810
Hey, it became like this after those adult entertainment places took a spot.

250
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,910
I thought you lived around there too.

251
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,510
I don't even know where I live!

252
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,340
And, I'm saying I just got here from ten years ago.

253
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,670
Hey Pil. Do you even touch drugs?

254
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,070
Oh my, really.

255
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,000
How can I live like this? I'm going to go crazy, aish.

256
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,730
It's real. It doesn't look like this punk's lying.

257
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,400
What the heck? Soo Jin had a hard time because of you.

258
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,710
Why?

259
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,940
What do you mean why? Because of her, you got suspended from school,

260
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,670
kicked off the  track team so you couldn't continue your running,

261
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,380
and that's why you became like this.

262
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,950
She was sobbing and crying, a total mess.

263
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:46,010
Hey. Soo Jin really had a hard time because of me?

264
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,660
Yeah.

265
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,660
Hey. Hey.

266
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,280
Thanks.

267
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,220
I should just quit photography and hand out some flyers.

268
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,340
Welcome.

269
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,730
- Pil. 
- It's been a while.

270
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:28,000
Oh, w-what are y-you doing here?

271
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:37,270
Aigoo, this place hasn't changed.

272
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,700
H-Here?

273
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,250
It's your first time here.

274
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,870
Never mind. If I tell you, I'll look like a fool.

275
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,010
Oh, anyway. It's really been a while.

276
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,300
Were you okay all this time?

277
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,970
 What do you mean "It's been a while"? My shoulder still hurts from yesterday. 

278
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,890
I... We...

279
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,940
For the last ten years, we...

280
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,040
Have we never crossed paths?

281
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,500
What are you saying...

282
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:27,610
I heard that you had a hard time because I became like this.

283
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,860
Ah, that.

284
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,980
Ah ... I-I did. A bit.

285
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,850
Why?

286
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,270
You became like this because of me.

287
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,100
You might've become a good track and field athlete,

288
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,150
but after that fight, you messed up your chance.

289
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,780
You fought because of me.

290
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,160
Hey, then you should've taken good care of me, so I wouldn't make a mess of my life.

291
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,210
You're right.

292
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,420
If that were the case, I would've been there to hold onto you.

293
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,620
Hey! Don't you remember?

294
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,440
Why?  You know, when we were back in high school.

295
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,180
I broke the big hallway glass mirror, remember?

296
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,690
You took all the blame for me and said this.

297
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,860
"You just go in. Nothing will happen to you."

298
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:31,760
You looked a little  cool back then for the very first time.

299
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,320
Why did I say that?

300
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,460
Funny, huh? It's such an old story after all.

301
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,100
Yeah.

302
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,900
That fight has nothing to do with track and field.

303
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,330
I couldn't join the track and field team in the first place.

304
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,780
I'm not good with the start timing.

305
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,410
What's the use of having quick feet?

306
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,650
So what I'm saying is, you don't have to be sorry and feel difficult around me.

307
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,910
It really has to do with the fact that I wasn't skilled enough.

308
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,790
I just came to tell you this.

309
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,310
Hey...

310
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,300
Do you have green tape?

311
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,130
Green tape?

312
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,930
It's working well.

313
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,770
But the neck of the fan won't turn, okay? But just use it anyway.

314
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,500
Thanks.

315
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:42,470
You do your best with your photography work. You are very good at what you do.

316
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,000
You were actually better at drawing. I...

317
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,350
Well, drawing and taking pictures are pretty much the same.

318
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,110
I'm leaving now.

319
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,620
So amazing.

320
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:10,050
"You looked a little cool for the first time back then."

321
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,830
How can I let someone else take her in my place, for goodness sake?

322
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,260
Man, I loved her for so long too. Ah, seriously.

323
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,850
Love? That's a beautiful thing.

324
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,860
Wh-Who... are you?

325
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:35,290
I guess you wanted to hide this shitty reality of yours from the woman you love.

326
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,430
 What the heck is this? 

327
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,660
I'm here 'cuz the big guy sent me to see you.

328
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,470
You could've just said that you needed a ride, man.

329
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:54,250
Sorry. I'll just walk, okay? I'll just walk, alright?

330
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,430
No way! I'm going to take you in my car.

331
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,410
You annoyed the hell out of me.

332
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,660
No. Please take it easy.

333
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,830
Let me know the reason at least. Why are you doing this?

334
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,360
I will tell you all about it when you wake up.

335
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,650
Oh my, what is this?

336
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,310
Bastard.

337
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,660
What the heck? Why are you looking at me?

338
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,940
Ta-talent discovered!

339
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,760
Whoa! Whoa!

340
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,450
Hello, is this the police station? I'm a law abiding citizen.

341
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,020
There is a gang member running wild in my neighborhood right now.

342
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,760
This is an emergency.

343
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,870
Please hurry.

344
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,770
   

345
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,360
Hyungnim, Hyungnim.

346
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,020
Wanna die? You shouldn't remember anything, gosh darn it.

347
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,650
Darn, that scared me! Who the heck did...?

348
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,620
Oh, this is Goo Gil's shop.

349
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,670
What's going on here?

350
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,260
You can't do that with these! Give me those!

351
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,950
I can never communicate with you.

352
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,520
You can't do that with those. If my father sees, I'm a dead man.

353
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,080
I'm going to open a cosmetics store, so does it make sense to have a pool hall here?!

354
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,210
What's wrong with that? They come here to buy make up but can also play a game of pool too.

355
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,950
Isn't that a good thing?

356
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,970
Why would they play pool when they came to buy makeup?!

357
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,840
You rock head!

358
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,100
I told you to stop calling me rock head. Why do you always call me that every chance you get?

359
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,720
Jeong Ae, you okay?

360
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,290
He called me a rock head.

361
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,400
Why are you hugging him?

362
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,530
Stop hugging Dal Soo right in front of me!

363
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,440
Three two— Oh.

364
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,380
Bring it over.

365
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,500
It's mine. It's mine.

366
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,200
Oh my.

367
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,850
It belongs to my honey!

368
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,640
Hey, Yang Goo Gil!

369
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,470
Hey!

370
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,600
You annoying little punks. You annoying little punks.

371
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,420
I know my life is pitiful but why are you guys living like this?

372
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,380
 Hey, hey! 

373
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,260
 It's dangerous! 

374
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,980
I was so crazy back then. I must have had something in my eyes or something.

375
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,840
I thought he was a normal looking man then.

376
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,270
Honey.

377
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,860
 How can one hit just flip someone's life upside down? 

378
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,300
I still love you.

379
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,600
Shut up! You are such a stubborn rock head.

380
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,670
Bong Pil, you're right. I had a crush on Dal Soo originally.

381
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,090
Then why are you living with Goo Gil?

382
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:45,210
I don't know! Maybe that's why there is such a saying. They say that a woman's heart is fickle.

383
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,750
I know, right?

384
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,650
There is a verse in a Verdi opera.

385
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:54,660
"A woman's heart is so very fickle."

386
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,030
- Hey! I'm going knock you out! 
 - I'll knock you out!

387
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:01,780
He is knowledgeable too. I used to like intellectual men.

388
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,960
Fickle women waver for sure but they don't switch places on a dime.

389
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,230
That's what I'm saying.

390
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,500
You guys are living such comfortable lives.

391
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,960
I'm here living a life that's still on fire that'll be forever burning.

392
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,670
This is such a mess, all of it.

393
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,220
   
   

394
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,420
   
   

395
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:19,410
  It's all my fault that this neighborhood became this way. 

396
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,630
  For both Dal Soo becoming a mess and Jeong Ae's change of heart too. 

397
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:29,270
 Is Soo Jin having a  hard time as well because of the past I changed? 

398
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,510
  All I did was just that one fight. This is not what I expected! 

399
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:41,170
  Soo Jin, what am I to do really? 

400
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,890
 Do I really have to live this way? 

401
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,670
 Can I go back through the manhole again? 

402
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:53,590
  No, I mean, would I still be able to change Soo Jin's mind?! 

403
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,680
Is it this neighborhood?

404
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,000
Ah, yes.

405
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,280
What a punk. He looks like he was raised in a rough neighborhood.

406
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,510
Hey, finish him off quickly.

407
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,100
Let's go.

408
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,650
So I should go on this thing and go back to the time of my high school years,

409
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,490
and I should get beaten the crap out of by the church oppa

410
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,880
like the good old days and then turn my life back to the way it was...

411
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,870
But this stupid thing won't move! This dumb thing! Jeez!

412
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,240
How am I supposed to...?

413
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,020
How am I supposed to open this stupid thing in order for me to go through it?

414
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,350
It's him, right?

415
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,000
Yes, that's right.

416
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,280
What's wrong with that punk?

417
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,700
I don't know.

418
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,760
Hey, Bong Pil!

419
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,500
There are two of them this time.

420
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,440
Do you want to quietly go with us, or do you want to be dragged off like a dog?

421
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,590
Wait. We can't just drag him away.

422
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,450
That's right! Let's get him for now.

423
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,210
Who are you?

424
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,790
Where did you come from?

425
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,850
That is ...

426
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,440
You... the right to... spe... ak to an attorney...

427
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,050
What did you say?

428
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,300
What did you say?

429
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,750
Y- you have t-the right to... to speak to an attorney...

430
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,610
Ahjussi, are you okay?

431
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,190
What the...

432
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,920
Who is this guy?

433
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,490
Civil serv—

434
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,190
Police!

435
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:22,260
Wh-what kind of police looks like a thug?

436
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,800
Gosh, how great would it be if they went around in business suits like they do in the US?

437
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,840
This isn't reality.

438
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,630
This is a dream, yeah.

439
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,530
This is a dream.

440
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:32,890
What is this mess after I fell into that wretched manhole?

441
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,690
H-He's... He's...

442
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,090
Honey, let's sit.

443
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,600
He's... He's that pharmacist guy.

444
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,710
I remember when we went to the swimming pool.

445
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,300
What are they saying?

446
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,410
But we can meet at the coffee shop.

447
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,250
Why did you bring me all the way here?

448
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,840
Oh, because there's a lot of people watching.

449
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,970
Why? Is no one supposed to see us?

450
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,370
Well, it's nothing like that, but this place is nice and quiet.

451
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,250
You sweat a lot, right, Oppa?

452
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,050
- Oppa?
- I remember you sweated a lot during our first kiss too.

453
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,240
Did I?

454
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,320
Oppa. Don't you remember our first kiss?

455
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,940
I do.

456
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,090
So when are you going to come?

457
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,920
I don't think I can today. I'm a bit busy these days.

458
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,220
I'll call you when I can.

459
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,580
Let's go.

460
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,520
- Oppa.
 - Huh?

461
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,520
Make sure you eat. Your face is so thin.

462
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,440
Oh, okay. Where are we going? Which hotel did you say it was?

463
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,820
It's the one we went to before.

464
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,310
- H-Hotel?
- Let's go, quickly.

465
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,590
- Let's go.
- Why?

466
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,200
What...

467
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,750
Wow...

468
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,520
That bastard!

469
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,770
That scared me. Why?

470
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,220
Go, go on your way.

471
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,990
I'm not a bad person.

472
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,680
Ugh, where did they go?

473
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,900
Hotel?

474
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,340
He meets a girl at a hotel?

475
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,900
Hey, Soo Jin!

476
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,960
Oh, you scared me!

477
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,020
Why is everyone so shocked when they see me?

478
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,960
Hey, there's something that's even more shocking.

479
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,140
Don't be so surprised.

480
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,670
Do you know what I saw today?

481
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,730
You know that pharmacist, the man you're going to marry?

482
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:45,840
That guy is seeing a woman.

483
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,950
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

484
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,720
Hey, look! You didn't know!

485
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,170
I knew this would happen.

486
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:57,960
Hey, that bastard planned to meet that woman at a hotel!

487
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,360
And this is what they were doing, look.

488
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,540
They were this close. "Jae Hyeon, you sweat a lot."

489
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,790
"You sweated a lot during our first kiss, too."

490
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:10,340
And she was touching him, and—

491
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,510
It's not okay to do that when you're going to marry someone.

492
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,010
That's not real love.

493
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,730
Hey, can you get off?

494
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,090
It's uncomfortable.

495
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,630
Soo Jin, you should've really seen it!

496
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:32,310
Hey, won't you get off?

497
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,170
   

498
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,500
Pil...

499
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,250
 Ah, that's right. I remember now. 

500
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,960
 It's almost 12 o'clock. Hey, let's go quickly. I'll take you. 

501
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,440
 - It's almost 12 o'clock. When are we going to fight? 
 - 12 o'clock.  

502
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,600
 This is the 12 o'clock noon news. 

503
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,030
 That's right. It was 12 o'clock. 

504
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,650
Oh no, what do I do?

505
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,390
Pil... Don't die...

506
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,920
 I left at 12 o'clock midnight, and I returned at 12 o'clock noon. 

507
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:33,460
That's right! I spent 12 hours in the past.

508
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,480
Pil, are you awake?

509
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,500
Oh, where is this place?

510
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,100
What time is it?

511
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:51,230
Hey, how can you pass out after one hit? I was so surprised.

512
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,260
Ah, I heard the sound of something breaking.

513
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,780
What?

514
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,090
Wait a minute.

515
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,520
Ah, I'm screwed.

516
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,680
Hey.

517
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,230
I'm sorry.

518
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,110
Why are you sorry, when I'm the one who hit you?

519
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,810
If I got hit a little bit better, then it wouldn't have broken. Aish, really.

520
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,910
You're pretty funny.

521
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,560
It's nice to see you smile.

522
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,110
 My heart is going to burst. 

523
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,230
Huh?

524
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:55,880
Hey, don't look at me like that. I'll hit you again.

525
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,880
Hey, aren't you scared of me?

526
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,710
The other guys all get scared when they see me.

527
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:14,640
Weirdly, when I look into your eyes, I get the feeling you aren't going to beat me up.

528
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:23,230
But... what did you mean when you said Jae Hyeon had a woman?

529
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,990
Oh, right. Get your head straight.

530
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,680
That... that guy is a huge pervert.

531
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,900
Hey. My Jae Hyeon isn't that kind of person.

532
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,600
You probably saw the wrong person.

533
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,360
But how do you know Jae Hyeon?

534
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,770
It's been three years since you've been here.

535
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:54,400
I... I can draw that guy from memory.

536
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,600
He's like my sworn enemy for life.

537
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,080
Are you really hurt?

538
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,960
Are you okay?

539
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,550
Yes. It's me.

540
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,740
Brick's jaw went out so we had him admitted to a hospital.

541
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,540
Yes.

542
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,700
But I think we need to change the plan.

543
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,660
I understand.

544
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,350
Do you want to go around the neighborhood?

545
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,790
There are no police and the night air is nice.

546
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:45,370
Hey, are you romancing me?

547
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:48,320
It's been so long, and you're talking to me as if we saw each other yesterday.

548
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,230
Don't go overboard.

549
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,250
I'll go in. You go too.

550
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,350
Why? I'll take you home.

551
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,620
Why will you take me?

552
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,610
Excuse me. I'm taken.

553
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,710
Go.

554
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,980
If you have time, come to the wedding.

555
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,790
♫  There's still one thing to whisper  ♫

556
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,720
♫  Don't worry about anything  ♫

557
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,660
♫  Take this hand. It will go away.  ♫

558
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:25,530
In the movies, they always turn back once. Because they have lingering feelings.

559
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,330
She's so harsh.

560
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,800
That bastard cheated on a woman like her?

561
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,030
♫  Both you and I will whisper this love  ♫

562
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:45,150
♫  Sweetly kiss, baby. We will share together  ♫

563
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,990
♫  Somehow I have a good feeling about it  ♫

564
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,800
H-Hey!

565
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,500
Bong Pil.

566
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:06,350
I was going to turn around once, but I guess the timing wasn't right.

567
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,680
♫  I love you  ♫

568
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,910
   

569
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,160
- Why?
- Pardon?

570
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,740
Why? You said these are free.

571
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:44,570
But... other customers need to drink, but you just had seven bottles by yourself.

572
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,570
- Hey.
- Yes.

573
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,660
- Are you popular among women? 
 - Pardon?

574
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,010
Do you date two, three women at the same time? Do you?

575
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,400
N-N-No.

576
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,710
- Hey. 
 -Yes?

577
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:05,250
Y-you! We'll see each other quite often from now on.

578
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,230
Let's see each other later.

579
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,180
Who is that guy?

580
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,810
Ah, he drank it all.

581
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,450
- Do you know him? 
 - No.

582
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:21,860
But what does he mean by "we'll see each other quite often"?

583
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,590
What? I don't know.

584
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,760
But I just have a bad feeling.

585
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,490
   
   

586
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,820
Okay, okay.

587
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,200
Hey, open the door.

588
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,700
Hey, hey. I said open the door.

589
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,400
Hey... what?

590
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,490
Why are you... why are you here?

591
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:36,920
Huh? Oh, Jin Sook's computer broke.

592
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,350
But are you okay? The police aren't looking for you?

593
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,450
Hey, that's why I'm here.

594
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,280
- I need to hide here for a bit, just until 12 o'clock.
- Huh?

595
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,290
Is someone at the door?

596
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,320
Why, what?

597
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,580
Pil.  What are you doing here?

598
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,770
Oh, I... I'll stay here for a bit.

599
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,570
The police keep on...

600
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,690
Wait. How did you know, Seok Tae?

601
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,390
That I was being chased by the police.

602
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,060
That's right.

603
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:16,670
Huh? Oh, that's ... could you call it intuition?

604
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,860
What are you talking about? How would a dull guy like you have intuition?

605
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,830
Hey, I have some.

606
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:28,580
Pil. What trouble did you cause that you're being chased by the police?

607
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:31,130
Come to your senses, Punk.

608
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,520
- Yeah, get a hold of yourself.
- You be quiet.

609
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,330
Hey. Bong Pil.

610
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,770
What is this now?

611
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:44,350
Answer the call. You have to answer it.

612
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:46,970
Because It involves your woman.

613
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,050
Answer it for now.

614
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,390
Is it Pil?

615
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:58,900
Who...?

616
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,480
Child, it's your hyung.

617
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,730
I'm the only son for the third generation. I don't have any hyungs.

618
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,020
You're quite humorous, punk.

619
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,470
At first, I scouted you because of your fists.

620
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:18,920
There'll be trouble if you try to run from this life now.

621
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,680
I spent a lot of money on you.

622
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,660
Money? What money?

623
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,660
Hey!

624
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,740
If you're like this, you'll get hurt.

625
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,240
- Your bride...
 - Bride?

626
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,190
Your bride is here. With us.

627
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:47,000
She's pretty.

628
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,740
Her name... was it Soo Jin?

629
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,740
I heard about your marriage.

630
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,220
You rascal. You should've told me you were getting married.

631
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,580
We aren't strangers.

632
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,870
Good. Let's have a party tonight.

633
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,670
Come quickly.

634
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,690
Hey, what is this place called?

635
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,420
- Bongbong! 
 - It's Bongbong.

636
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,130
Bongbong?

637
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,170
Pil, Bong—

638
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,600
Hello?

639
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,360
Hello?

640
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,150
He hung up. It was an important message, but the bastard—

641
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:31,210
If he didn't hear it, that means he can't come, right?

642
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,890
Did he hear? He would've heard, right?

643
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,530
Should I call again?

644
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,310
Hyungnim, that's kind of humiliating.

645
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,030
Right?

646
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,130
You jerk! I haven't even paid this off yet!

647
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,450
Soo Jin, do you guys have her?

648
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:55,750
As you know, we have a neat way of working—

649
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,600
Soo Jin.

650
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,950
Pil! Pil!

651
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,770
Hey, hey, hey. He'll get up on his own.

652
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:11,420
What are you doing, you punk? It's my house. Call the police quickly.

653
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,540
Mister! Mister!

654
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,650
The rain is pouring so suddenly.

655
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:23,220
You're right, you should've taken out the trash later.

656
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,340
I hope it doesn't get rained on.

657
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,490
I'm sure he'll be fine.

658
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,910
I'm talking about the recyclable waste.

659
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:34,970
If the boxes get wet, it'll be harder for Grandma.

660
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,300
I thought...

661
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:42,510
I thought you were talking about that trash we knew back then.

662
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:45,480
Here. Eat one.

663
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,240
Why is the weather like this so suddenly?

664
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,040
As if something big is going to happen.

665
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,540
There's no time.

666
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,240
Our hope, Bong Pil is here!

667
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,770
It's raining. If you had called, my guys would have at least brought you an umbrella—

668
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:14,730
Who are you?

669
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:19,850
This punk... how do I answer?

670
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:21,820
He's asking who I am?

671
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:26,580
Let her go. She has nothing to do with me.

672
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,570
I said it wasn't!

673
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,590
Then why did you kidnap her?

674
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:35,830
You said she was Pil's girlfriend. He's saying she's not!

675
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,380
If you touch a hair on her, a big accident is going to happen tonight.

676
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,640
And I'm a bit busy tonight. I need to go somewhere at 12 o'clock.

677
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,460
So while I'm saying it nicely, why don't you go inside somewhere

678
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,370
to wipe your feet and sleep after a glass of soju on this rainy night?

679
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:58,770
Soju sounds good.

680
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:05,060
Okay. Then give it back. The money you borrowed.

681
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,600
Today. Now. Right now.

682
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,330
There's no time now. Next time.

683
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,040
I will take her away.

684
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,300
Don't come over. Don't come.

685
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:20,860
Bong Pil, don't.

686
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,190
Let's not make this situation hard for you.

687
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:28,080
These guys are all hungry for daily work.

688
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,850
Do you all want to see me go crazy today?

689
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:36,430
Hey, Little Bro, don't be rash.

690
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:38,570
Grab him.

691
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:49,470
Didn't I say that I'd go crazy if you lay a hand on her?!

692
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:58,470
   

693
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:27,390
Let's report him.

694
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:29,380
Hey, bastard!

695
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:33,400
I'm calling to report something urgently.

696
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,980
I'm an innocent civilian.

697
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,890
Some heinous jerk—

698
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,900
Bro, use words.

699
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,200
Let's talk it out.

700
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,800
That doesn't make any sense.

701
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,190
Don't say anything to us.

702
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,120
Heard Bong Pil beat you up.

703
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,010
That's not true.

704
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:13,490
Then why did you go unconscious?

705
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:19,080
I just... do... sometimes...

706
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,160
- You witnesses.
- Yes?

707
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,770
Did this guy get beaten up by Bong Pil?

708
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:24,840
Ah, yes—

709
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:29,480
Don't know. When we came out, he was lying on the ground and getting rained on.

710
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,780
What is this? It's different from the report.

711
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,800
There was a report of mob violence in this neighborhood.

712
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,190
- Mob violence? 
 - Yes.

713
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:48,320
I guess even thugs are running wild now.

714
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,750
It's a mess.

715
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:53,700
No, it's not that. It's about one person beating up a group of people.

716
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,110
What?

717
00:52:55,110 --> 00:53:00,090
Well, don't mind me and go about your business. I'm okay.

718
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:04,740
It's raining so I'll have a drink and go home to get some sleep.

719
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,590
Well then, good work.

720
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:09,090
- Bye. 
 - Yes.

721
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:11,140
Goodbye. Come on.

722
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,650
Over there. Hurry!

723
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:24,100
Hey! Stop!

724
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,590
Surround them! Go over there!

725
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,400
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

726
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,320
I'm fine.

727
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:25,480
Soo Jin, I have to go somewhere.

728
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,760
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

729
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,590
Hey.

730
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,850
Go turn yourself in.

731
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:38,310
I'll tell them everything clearly. Let's go together, okay?

732
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:46,520
- Soo Jin. 
 - Yes?

733
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,100
You see...

734
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:59,010
Hey! Are you really...

735
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:02,780
Stay here. Nothing will happen to you.

736
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,110
You trust me, right?

737
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,060
 I need to go back. 

738
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:31,430
 I'll get beaten up at the church. That should solve everything. 

739
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,650
 What if it doesn't work? 

740
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:37,980
 No. There's no way. No. 

741
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,390
Bong Pil!

742
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:59,060
Get him!

743
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,250
 12 o'clock. 

744
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,650
Give me one more chance.

745
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:32,600
I need to go back. I really want to go back!

746
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:35,450
What?

747
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:37,160
Where did he go?

748
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,510
What on earth!

749
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:40,890
That bastard.

750
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:42,020
Go find him!

751
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,360
Search thoroughly!

752
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,260
Darn it!

753
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,660
 I did it! 

754
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:59,480
 I'm going back! Yeah! 

755
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,820
   

756
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:09,610


757
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,810
What? Where is this?

758
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:20,600
Is it a residence for the track team?

759
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,120
Huh?

760
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,350
What?

761
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,260
What's going on?

762
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,680
What's going on?

763
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,530
What is this?

764
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,670
Where is this place?

765
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:56,710
Where in the world did you bring me to, you damn manhole?!

766
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,230
I'm going crazy, seriously!

767
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,900
♫  Yeah yeah yeah  ♫

768
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,200
♫  Yah yah yah  ♫

769
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,930

 Oh man, we're in trouble. 

780
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,330
 You can't be standing here. Go back quickly. Go back. 

781
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:49,400
 There's going to be a fire today. There is going to be a fire here today! 

782
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,640
 You stupid little! 

783
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,750
 I caught you red-handed. 

784
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:58,070
 You have a poor start with romance too. That means you have no sense. 

785
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,950
 Shall I just kiss her? 

786
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:03,960
  You don't know about Bong Pil's evil persistence. 

787
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,800
 - You trash-like jerk. 
 - You trash-like jerk. 

788
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,600
 You see, I can see the future. 

789
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,560
 It's a fire. 

790
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,360
 Soo Jin! Soo Jin! 

791
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,600
♫  Just thinking about you is enough  ♫
