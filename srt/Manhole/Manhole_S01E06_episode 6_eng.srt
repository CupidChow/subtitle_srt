1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,470
- Ahjussi, be gentle please.
 - Alright, okay.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,260
Okay. Okay, punk.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,310
Seok Tae! Mister! What are you two doing?

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,300
Soo Jin.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,820
Soo Jin, I don't have much time. I have to hurry and leave.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,300
Even if I told you, you won't be able to understand.

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,490
I do know...

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,990
You're Pil, right?

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:41,960


10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,000
Are you... able to see me?

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,080
No.

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,820
I can feel you.

13
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,240
You're Pil, right?

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,950
Right?

15
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,810
I can tell it when I look at your eyes.

16
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,790
In your eyes,

17
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:34,260
there's been something special

18
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,450
since a long time ago.

19
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,700
I've waited for you for so long.

20
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:00,460
There are so many things I have to tell you.

21
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,480
Are you going to stay by my side from now on?

22
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,920
Are you staying by me like this, Pil?

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,980
I've always been next to you, Soo Jin.

24
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,340
Ah! Hold on! Hold on a minute!

25
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,240
Wait for a moment! Wait! Are you okay, Pil?

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,180
- Please wait!
- Oh, what? Soo Jin!

27
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,940
W-Why am I here?

28
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,060
What?

29
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,940
Wait, wait, wait!

30
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,670
I'm asking why I'm here!

31
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,320
No... He was surely Pil.

32
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,240
Who are you?  Who are you?!

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,870
- Father!  Father, why are you here? 
 - Seok Tae!

34
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,570
- Yes? 
 - What is this?

35
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,740
Hey, Soo Jin,  I'm asking why I am here!

36
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,690
Ah, these people! Let go of me! Why am I here?

37
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,580
   

38
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,490
Hey, what are you doing these days,

39
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,640
that you haven't contacted me at all?

40
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,320
Well, just... I've lived by mooching around my brothers' business.

41
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,030
Well, you'd better go now if you wanted to keep living like that. It's past 12 o'clock midnight.

42
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,660
I also have to go to work tomorrow.  Let's go.

43
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,320
By the way, why did you get a job?

44
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,260
You used to say you'd start your own business.

45
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,100
What do you think the reason was? It's because of Pil, that punk.

46
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,260
I mean a long time ago, Pil prodded me so much about how we should start a business together.

47
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,140
After saying that, he's just...

48
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,210
lying down like that.

49
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,680
I'd already planned a project for saving 100 million won per year.

50
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,660
Was that Pil's idea?  I didn't know that.

51
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,200
Ah, I had also been hoodwinked by Pil.

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,890
Pil said Jeong Ae liked me when we were in high school.

53
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,410
Hey, what are you talking about?

54
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,030
Really.  He said she was always looking at me.

55
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,520
So my heart fluttered so much at that time.

56
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,210
Hey, I was looking at Oppa Dal Soo.

57
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,190
You were just next to him.

58
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,780
Hey, long ago, when I first bumped into Oppa Dal Soo, who wore a red jacket,

59
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,630
I completely fell for him instantly.

60
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:05,160
That red... in front of my eyes... radiating itself...

61
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,180
Heart, don't get too excited.

62
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,060
Ah, that red jacket.  It belonged to Pil.

63
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,830
He lent it to me because I looked cold.

64
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,630
I had worn only that one for a while.  That's right.

65
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,700
Wait... Did the story go like that?

66
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Then, Oppa, you were also hoodwinked by Pil.

67
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:27,920
Because of that, Jeong Ae was following you like a stalker.

68
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,350
I should've worn that red jacket at that time.

69
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,120
Even if you had done like that, could a replica replace the authentic brand?

70
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,110
If you want to use it casually, the replica will be better.

71
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,220
How do you know when you've never used it?

72
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,750
I'll use the authentic brand.

73
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,680
Really. Your love hasn't cooled off yet.

74
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,570
If you consider me the authentic brand, will you just leave me alone nicely?

75
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,530
- In my house?
- What does it mean?

76
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,230
Apparently, there's a ruckus going on at the hospital right now.

77
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,770
I'm telling you I don't know why I'm here either! I mean it, Ahjussi!

78
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,670
- Jin Sook! 
 - Seok Tae!

79
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,190
Ahjussi, what are you doing here?

80
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,460
I was possessed by a ghost.

81
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,920
Excuse me?

82
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,920
I was possessed by a ghost.

83
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,200
These two people stole employee clothes and were trying to kidnap a patient.

84
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,060
What?! They were trying to kidnap Pil?!

85
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,270
- Thank goodness this person over here discovered them early on. 
- That's not it!

86
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,290
That's really not what it was!

87
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,370
Guys, please listen to me. I really don't know why I'm here.

88
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,450
It seemed these people made a ruckus because they were afraid that I might stop the Pil's treatment.

89
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,120
This is Pil's friend and my employee.

90
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,950
So let's just settle this quietly and go home.

91
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,250
Even though you don't understand them, just think they are just  nonsense people.

92
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,630
- Like this.
- Ahjumma, it's really not like that.

93
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,000
Dad! Dad, say something already! Come on!

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,350
I don't know why I'm here. I just opened my eyes and this is where I was.

95
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,260
Darn it.

96
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,250
It doesn't make sense. Right?

97
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,700
There's no way Seok Tae wasn't aware that Pil was still undergoing medical treatment,

98
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,460
so why would he try to smuggle him out?

99
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,370
That's because that wasn't Seok Tae.

100
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,460
That was Pil.

101
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,130
Good grief, you're making me go crazy.

102
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,530
I'm the one who's going crazy.

103
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,840
- Sook. 
- What?

104
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,900
I saw Pil.

105
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,890
He even tried to kiss me.

106
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:29,190
But where do you think Pil was trying to take his body?

107
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,930
That was Seok Tae.

108
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,950
Is everything okay with you?

109
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,280
That girl Soo Jin...

110
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,630
it seems like she recognized you.

111
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,950
But is that even possible?

112
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,660
At any rate, you punk, what were doing acting romantic when you're in the midst of a crisis?

113
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,930
She was having such a hard time,

114
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,920
I just wanted to try to comfort her a bit.

115
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,530
If your son is up to no good, you, as his parent, should stop him.

116
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,700
But instead of stopping him, you actually did it with him.

117
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,770
Does that make any sense?

118
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,770
It's not like I don't have inner energy (spirit) enough for being possessed by a ghost,

119
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,490
but I'm positive that wasn't me.

120
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,730
Stop talking about ghosts! You're really unbelievable.

121
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,630
Have you no shame!

122
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,970
It looks like you always have a sense of rivalry when it comes to me.

123
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,700
Let's not be involved in such an undesirable matter together in the future.

124
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,640
I have gone through a lot of things today.

125
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,800
I'll put up with you.

126
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,250
Oh, by the way!

127
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,060
Why aren't you delivering mail to my house?

128
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,870
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

129
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,150
How childish.

130
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,130
That wasn't me.

131
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,600
I wasn't the one who did it. There's definitely something else to this.

132
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,290
I feel some kind of wicked energy lurking around!

133
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,410
We were definitely drinking together, right?

134
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,490
But I was tired so I closed my eyes for a bit,

135
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,100
and when I woke up I was in Pil's hospital room.

136
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,490
Could it be alcohol-induced dementia?

137
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,720
No, he's just an idiot, you dummy.

138
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,190
This, this... When he's drunk, there is no answer.

139
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,970
Hey! Stop drinking, man!

140
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,770
That's not it, Hyung! I wasn't drunk! Really!

141
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,770
But for some reason,

142
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,040
I feel like someone stole my body.

143
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,900
Damn it. I don't think I would take it if someone offered it to me.

144
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,960
I feel weird.

145
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,160
I've never missed the time for the manhole before,

146
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,660
but it can't be that missing it once means it's over, right?

147
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,080
It will still work again, right?

148
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,930
How would I  know when someone who has used it before doesn't know?

149
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,490
Time in my real time period is going to keep flowing as usual.

150
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,990
Ugh, I don't have time for this.

151
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,360
About Soo Jin's getting married or about the manhole...

152
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,100
I honestly don't understand what you're talking about, you punk.

153
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,390
I must go in the manhole tonight at midnight.

154
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:18,240
I have to travel through the manhole again and return everything  to normal.

155
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,860
I think the two of us won't be enough.

156
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,210
Let's bring one more person on our side.

157
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,170
It was this, Sook. It's this right here.

158
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,040
This was the mirror where I saw Pil. He went from here to there in a flash.

159
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,560
- He went by in a flash just like that? 
- Yeah.

160
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,210
- Soo Jin.
 - Huh?

161
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,560
- Do you hang out with people at all these days?
 - Nope.

162
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,790
Girl, you should go out and hang out with people.

163
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,770
You used to have a lot of people around you in the past, right?

164
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,360
But that's not the important thing though.

165
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,470
I wonder where Pil was going to deliver his own body  while being inside Seok Tae's body?

166
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,190
Pil will be back and he needs me.

167
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,910
Soo Jin, I can't go back home because of you.

168
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,250
You won't understand what I'm saying now.

169
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,370
My eyes are capable of seeing Pil through it all.

170
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,370
He really did go by in a flash from here to there and went out the door super fast.

171
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,920
I should've followed him.

172
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:27,480
- Goo Gil.
 - Oh, no.

173
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,180
You go back in. I will take Jeong Ae first and I'll go home afterwards.

174
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,530
I will take her home since you live out of the way anyway.

175
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,710
I'll be fine since I closed up the shop already.

176
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,820
You should open up the shop. You need that extra money.

177
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,410
Why are you worrying about such things?

178
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,520
You should go and do some cleaning ahead of time too.

179
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,990
Hey, stop it, you two! You should both leave. I will just go home by myself.

180
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,620
You're going to go home by yourself?

181
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,850
What?

182
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,200
No, how can you go home by yourself at this hour?

183
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,380
Hey. You take her home.

184
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,160
You both haven't seen each other in a while so you guys should do some catching up as well.

185
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,390
No... I said I'd go home by myself.

186
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,230
Good idea. Let's get together tomorrow so we can talk more about Pil's situation.

187
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,420
Tomorrow? I won't be able to tomorrow because I'm moving.

188
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,560
- I will be helping my mom, and it will be just us two moving.
 - Oh, yeah?

189
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,620
- You're moving?
 - It's getting late, so you guys should go already.

190
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,720
- Alright then. See you. 
 - No, you don't have to...

191
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,640
- Get in.
 - Bye, Jeong Ae.

192
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,520
Bye.

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,670
I think you should keep an eye on Soo Jin.

194
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,320
Huh?

195
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,200
I dragged her over here when she told me that Pil came to visit her and she must go to the hospital.

196
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,270
Oh my...

197
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,500
Don't do that.

198
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,070
You don't have to take me all the way home.

199
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,690
It's been a while. It's been six years since I've done this.

200
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,710
It seems like you've changed a bit.

201
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,180
People change, you know.

202
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,210
Everything seemed too easy when I was younger, but I've realized that real life isn't that way.

203
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,920
I can't believe I'm hearing you say stuff like that with your own mouth.

204
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,540
You... didn't miss me?

205
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,030
Well... not really.

206
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,470
I read in some book that women say things that are opposite of what they're really thinking.

207
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,610
Are you still learning about dating through books?

208
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,570
I told you to learn about women through women themselves.

209
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,780
If I'm going to learn about women through women, then that means I have to meet some women.

210
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,350
But since I don't know any women, I end up not being able to meet with them.

211
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,650
And because of that I'm not able to learn about women through women themselves so I never get to learn about them.

212
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,750
Forget it. You make things way too complicated for no good reason.

213
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,200
You should go back in now.  That's your place right up there.

214
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,590
How did you know?

215
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,020
We passed by that place for the third time already.

216
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,680
Oh, yeah.

217
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,280
I'm off now.

218
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,100
Okay.

219
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,180
My legs hurt.

220
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,950
I have an upset stomach now. What's up with this?

221
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,170
   

222
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,960
   

223
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,750
   

224
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,420
   

225
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,300
   

226
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,900
I should let Hyung Goo Gil know that he should just give up on Jeong Ae when I go back in time.

227
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,180
It's not meant to be but he is so obsessed over it.

228
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,960
Yes. When you do make it back,  please do  tell Goo Gil for sure.

229
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,270
Yes. I will let him know for sure.

230
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,610
Tell him to become even more courageous and just go for it again.

231
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,080
Pardon? You didn't mean for him to just give up?

232
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,070
I told you that it would never work out between him and Jeong Ae.

233
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:15,830
I also think that way, but who knows, right?

234
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,200
We don't know who Jeong Ae will choose in the end.

235
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,840
What do you think about your own situation?

236
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,730
Do you think Soo Jin will choose you?

237
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,530
Nobody knows that.

238
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,700
Of course, when it comes to love, nobody knows how it will end.

239
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,790
Anyhow, you absolutely can't do that to Goo Gil. Do not possess him no matter what.

240
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,670
He is stronger than Seok Tae so he's perfect for the job. Why not?

241
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,750
You're going to ruin him! No way!

242
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,160
Did you recommend Seok Tae because it's okay for him to be ruined?

243
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,650
Is Seok Tae my son?!

244
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,750
If you dare touch my son I'm never going to help you again.

245
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,420
Wow. You're such a selfish man.

246
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,640
Gosh darn it. Then who can I get to help me?

247
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,540
Power of love.

248
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:06,070
Why don't you believe in the power of love that goes beyond time and space?

249
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,250
 Are you... able to see me? 

250
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,090
 No. 

251
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,630
 I can feel you. 

252
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,460
Hey, I'm leaving.

253
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,760
Hey, I said I'm leaving!

254
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,810
Hey, open up your eyes properly, okay?

255
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,360
Girl, you still can't believe me, huh?

256
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,510
Do I look like a crazy person to you?

257
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,750
Yep, you look like a super crazy person.

258
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,640
There is no way to explain this! There's none.

259
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,910
He appeared in front of me like this!

260
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:05,550
Soo Jin, let's not think about anything tonight. You just try to get some good night sleep, alright?

261
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,300
I will make you my bomb booze. Will you drink it and fall asleep?

262
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,530
Forget it. I'm really alright.

263
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,590
Go do your job instead of worrying about me.

264
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:23,170
I'm going to hurry and get some sleep so I can go see Pil tomorrow.

265
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,510
Please do not go roaming around the streets like some crazy girl, okay?

266
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,120
I'm going to tell your dad to guard you like a hawk before I leave, okay?

267
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,200
Leave now! Call me, okay? Come visit me on the weekend.

268
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,930
Let's barbecue some meat.

269
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm off now.

270
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,880
Hurry up and leave so I can go to sleep.

271
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,630
- I'm leaving now.
 - Okay.

272
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,980
I should get some sleep right away.

273
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,050
How is she?

274
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,540
She was a bit strange earlier but I think she is fine now.

275
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,810
She was strange earlier but she's better now?

276
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,660
Could it be that something is really wrong with her?

277
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,460
Right! If she were strange, she should keep being strange.

278
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,180
Or if she were fine, she should keep being fine.

279
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,830
It's even weirder when a person changes constantly.

280
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,640
- There's something strange about this.
- Indeed there is!

281
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,080
Calm yourselves down so we won't end up crazy too.

282
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,480
It was a hard day for Soo Jin today so it's okay for her to act that way.

283
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,440
So all you have to do is watch over her the best you can.

284
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,120
- Okay. 
 - Alright, okay.

285
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,080
I wonder if I can sleep for at least two hours.

286
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,820
Oh, it's Jin Sook.

287
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,910
Why is she coming out from Soo Jin's house?

288
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,140
Hey. Be safe.

289
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,130
Wait a minute... can you feel me too?

290
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,520
I wonder if these kids have super powers or something.

291
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,060
Goodnight, Mother and Father.

292
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,580
By tomorrow, everything will be fine.

293
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,090
There's no time for you to sleep now.

294
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,100
You have to go keep an eye on Soo Jin.

295
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,540
How come I always have to watch her when you get to sleep?

296
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,460
- You were also the same a long time ago too! 
 - Ah, seriously!

297
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,530
Hey, Soo Jin.

298
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,080
Where is she going this late at night?

299
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,320
She should do some work on guarding her.

300
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,400
Hey! Soo Jin, where are you going?

301
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,200
I'm asking you, where are you going?!

302
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,020
Oh.

303
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,420
It's you, isn't it? Pil, it's you, right?

304
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,980
Hey.

305
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,430
- It seems like she's able to feel something.
 - What was that?

306
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,190
Wait a minute.

307
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,540
I have to talk to her.

308
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,890
Where are you?

309
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,610
Oh, okay.

310
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,830
Why aren't you sleeping?

311
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,650
As a public servant, your body is not your own.

312
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,540
Even if you can't fall asleep, you must do so because you have to do your job perfectly without a problem tomorrow.

313
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,330
Get some sleep.

314
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:03,590
Father, I wonder what happened to us last night.

315
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,030
Something that we are not able to comprehend is happening to us.

316
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,130
You have to be alert.

317
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,460
While you maintain your inner peace.

318
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,830
How dare he embarrass me like that at the hospital where there are a lot of people.

319
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,500
I will never forget the shame that Director Bong gave me.

320
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,770
I will clear my name once and for all.

321
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,620
Please do the same for me, Father.

322
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:40,010
I will do that. Revenge is all about thirst. Bring me some water now.

323
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,240
Okay, I will go get it.

324
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,820
What the? Where is that punk going?

325
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,860
I guess we ran out of water.

326
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,520
No, that's not it. I remember boiling a kettle full of water last night.

327
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,640
Seok Tae.

328
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,520
- Where are you going?
-  I'm going to go meet Pil for a bit.

329
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,400
You're Pil, right?

330
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,910
You...

331
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,840
You're able to recognize me, right?

332
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,500
Soo Jin.

333
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,490
What is this picture?

334
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,240
Hold on a minute. Hold on, hold on.

335
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,920
Are you even speaking Korean?

336
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,420
I can only speak Korean.

337
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,010
I have no idea what you're saying to me right now.

338
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,660
I have a hard time understanding that I'm talking to your soul right now.

339
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:00,000
You getting hurt is all a fantasy too? So the past six years, all of it?

340
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,780
That's right.

341
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,830
So you went back and forth using that manhole near the tunnel?

342
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:14,070
So you left at 12 o'clock midnight and came back at 12 o'clock in the afternoon?

343
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,250
Hey, does that even make any sense?

344
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,100
Are you Alice from  Alice in Wonderland  or something?

345
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,210
For Alice, it's a rabbit hole. For me, it's a manhole.

346
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,570
Hey, do you remember that?

347
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,850
When we were kids, we used to sit on that bench.

348
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,660
I don't remember.

349
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,460
Think about it carefully. We—

350
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,570
I don't remember. I don't remember. I'm telling you that I can't.

351
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,160
So that never existed at all? I thought it did though.

352
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,100
- For instance, back when we were in the third grade—
 - No, I told you to stop!

353
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:05,010
 Sitting here really makes me feel good. 

354
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:08,540
 Other kids don't know about this place. I discovered it. 

355
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,450
 - This spot belongs to you now.
 - Really? 

356
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,660
 Of course! I won't let the other kids sit here. 

357
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,900
I told you to stop!

358
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,570
So are you saying that never happened?

359
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,560
It did happen! Then what about back in the third grade?

360
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,840
Hey you! Do you even remember what picture you drew during art class that time?!

361
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,470
The other kids made fun of me because of that...

362
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,660
Back then, I thought that when a boy and a girl kiss, they are supposed to get married.

363
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,130
Oh yeah? Fine then.

364
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,060
- Let's get married.
 - Huh?

365
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,280
You said that you'd be normal again after you're able to go back through that manhole.

366
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,560
So let's get married.

367
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,760
What would I be once you go back to normal again?

368
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,630
Oh... oh.

369
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,810
Just... you'd be exactly the same.

370
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,440
You'll be waiting for me too.

371
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,510
You'll  also be preparing for the wedding as well.

372
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:48,050
♫  Since love came and knocked on my heart  ♫

373
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,990
My body feels so wobbly as if I'm drunk.

374
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,960
You okay? You sleepy?

375
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,430
You know that I can't stay awake when I'm sleepy, right?

376
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,160
Of course I know.

377
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,740
Oh, hey.

378
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,990
Get on my back. Get on my back.

379
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,260
- I'm fine! 
- It's okay. Hurry and get on my back.

380
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,290
I'm not going to wait too long for you.

381
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,460
Alright! Here I go!

382
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:23,130
♫   You are the so-called feeling. You are the small tremor  ♫

383
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,500
♫   Because you are my half which  ♫

384
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,790
♫   Fate gave to show affection for me  ♫

385
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:36,440
♫   Because you are the feeling that is love, this tremor is good  ♫

386
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,780
I don't know how I can pour out my heart to you.

387
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:48,270
I thought about you more than  three times a day everyday.

388
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,910
People say...

389
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,830
that this is love.

390
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:02,840
♫   Secretly entering, come beside me and excite me more  ♫

391
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,790
Are you listening to me?

392
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,440
♫   My heart which is on the tip of my tongue confesses to you always  ♫

393
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:16,250
Right. Every time I look for something to say, I'm never able to find anything.

394
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,660
But now you are sleeping while I'm spilling out everything to you.

395
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,170
I heard it all.

396
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,310
I'm glad you heard it all.

397
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,040
You'll probably forget it all once I go back through that manhole again.

398
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,840
At least I can remember everything so that's a good thing.

399
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,520
♫  That's good  ♫

400
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,530
Soo Jin, I have a favor to ask you.

401
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,530
If I don't go back to the manhole by 12 o'clock tonight,

402
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,190
everything might disappear forever. So...

403
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,660
You're being so loud.

404
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,030
Oh, sorry.

405
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,500
Are you sleeping?

406
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,310
Seok Tae is carrying Soo Jin now?

407
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,610
That's not possible.

408
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,530
There's no way that Seok Tae is blessed with such a fine girl like that.

409
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,740
Who exactly are you?

410
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,600
- So tired.
 - You...You!

411
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,460
Father, where have you been?

412
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,860
You told me to bring you water.

413
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,330
I did indeed.

414
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:49,520
Father, I went to go get water but the sun is up already.

415
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,840
That's strange. Ah, I'm so tired.

416
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,830
I guess he slipped out of there already.

417
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:30,160
♫  If we are like each other  ♫

418
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:39,170
♫  We can feel each other  ♫

419
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:45,660
♫  Now I know your pain  ♫

420
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,980
♫  When I see your tears flow  ♫

421
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:58,170
♫  It feels like even my heart is ripping apart  ♫

422
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:02,640
♫  Now both the pain  ♫

423
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,570
♫  And all the wounds  ♫

424
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:15,150
♫  Everything which has distressed my heart  ♫

425
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:23,140
♫  I want to entrust to you  ♫

426
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,880
 I've waited for you for so long. 

427
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:35,550
♫  I am someone who believed I could live alone  ♫

428
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:40,750
♫  Like a fool  ♫

429
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,120
What the?

430
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,780
You crazy!? Why are you wearing jackets in this summer heat? Hurry up and take it off.

431
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,560
I don't want to.

432
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,690
I don't want to either.

433
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,870
Next time say that you want money instead.

434
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,900
So they can bring some money with them instead of wearing those jackets.

435
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,780
They are both bums.

436
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,200
But how come you're only staring at one bum out of the two?

437
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,220
Because I like that one bum way better.

438
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,210
- Alright!
 - It's shaking over here.

439
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,570
I know what I'm doing man.

440
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,810
You remember what I told you, right?

441
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,210
Date someone who likes you.

442
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:48,070
Otherwise, you have to stare at the back of a man for the rest of your life.

443
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:54,370
You're saying that again. I'm not like you, Mom. You are not good at dating,

444
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,100
but I'm not like that at all.

445
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,780
Oh my.

446
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,630
I'm so thirsty.

447
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,350
Here's some water.

448
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,730
Thanks.

449
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,430
Wow, that's so refreshing.

450
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:35,960
Seok Tae, what are you doing in front of my company anyway?

451
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,000
Jin Sook, someone told me that I met with Soo Jin last night.

452
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,790
Soo Jin?

453
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,210
Wait a minute. If you met her, then you met her. But what's up with saying that someone told you about it, huh?

454
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,640
I can't remember again.

455
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,240
What are you talking about?

456
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,810
So you met with Soo Jin last night but you can't remember at all?

457
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:58,710
Yep, that's right.  But I was told that I was possessed by a ghost.

458
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,230
I wonder why the ghost didn't take you away. What a shame, I must say.

459
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,050
I'm not joking here. I'm being serious.

460
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:08,320
My father followed me around and saw me dating with Soo Jin.

461
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,450
And he told me that I even gave Soo Jin a piggy back ride and stuff.

462
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,900
At least your wish came true in your dreams.

463
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,780
Didn't you have a crush on Soo Jin since a long time ago?

464
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,850
No, not anymore. I gave up on Soo Jin a long time ago actually.

465
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,140
You should know that you're the one I like now.

466
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:26,230
- Ghost, please take him away. There's a crazy guy here. Crazy guy!
 - Hey!

467
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,130
Hey! I'm being serious here.

468
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,410
I came to see you because I'm truly scared.

469
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,990
What's up with all these kids?

470
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,670
They are not playing with me like "Hidden Camera" (TV Show), either.

471
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:42,160
Jin Sook, you have a very strong spirit and energy.

472
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,900
So you should protect me. Please?

473
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,720
Do you think you can stay with me tonight?

474
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,710
Wow...

475
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,240
Are you hitting on me now using ghosts as an excuse out of all things?

476
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,770
Seok Tae, you are such  a creative kid. You are amazing.

477
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,900
Jin Sook, you know what's the most amazing thing?

478
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,770
Soo Jin is constantly texting me now.

479
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,230
She keeps on asking me if I'm Pil or not.

480
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,690
I slept too much!

481
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,370
What the heck?

482
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,390
Hey, what took you so lo—

483
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,820
I didn't expect that you were waiting for me, Soo Jin.

484
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,080
I couldn't sleep at all last night.

485
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,770
Yesterday was a strange day for me.

486
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,590
Did anything happen to you yesterday, Soo Jin?

487
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,330
I lost my memory after I came here to visit you.

488
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,010
Did you drink yesterday?

489
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,440
I don't drink alcohol.

490
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,130
There's something strange about this.

491
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,170
There is something that we can't quite comprehend.

492
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:14,500
But we both had a good conversation yesterday before you left.

493
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,390
Maybe I became a weird person ever since I moved to this neighborhood.

494
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:24,910
You look a lot brighter now.

495
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,890
I took that advice you gave me.

496
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,000
You told me that I should keep my inner peace.

497
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,650
I am so confused right now.

498
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:41,840
I knew that you weren't ordinary since the day we met.

499
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,580
There was something about you that seemed fantastic and extraordinary.

500
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,720
I'm talking about the time when you were at that bus stop.

501
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:21,050
You looked like you were sitting there with a floating hat saying, "help me."

502
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:28,150
You looked so lonely, so tired, and so sad.

503
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,830
I think I was just standing there for like thirty minutes or so.

504
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:04,430
And do you remember the word that you spat at me?

505
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,840
"Thank you."

506
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,300
Yes, that's what you said.

507
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,790
You stole my soul just by saying those words.

508
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:22,480
I was having such a hard time because of a certain someone on that day.

509
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,030
That's why I was sitting there like that.

510
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,690
That guy?

511
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,270
Yes.

512
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:40,250
We probably wouldn't have met if it weren't for him.

513
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,530
We probably would have lived as strangers somewhere.

514
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,850
I should be grateful to him.

515
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,460
I'm sorry but...

516
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,490
We won't be able to go on because of him.

517
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,830
I'm sorry.

518
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:01,820
He's the only one for me.

519
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,570
Either way, I'm so glad that you look much brighter now.

520
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:22,550
Now, I feel like I am the person who is sitting on that bench spacing out.

521
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,550
While waiting for someone too.

522
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,490
I'm sure someone will come for you and be by your side, Jae Hyeon.

523
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,400
I'm off now.

524
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,920
I wonder why Pil isn't here yet.

525
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,450
- Bring me the equipment. 
 - Okay.

526
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,770
- Hurry and contact his guardians immediately!
 - Okay.

527
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,910
- One more time.
 - Okay.

528
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,350
Soo Jin.

529
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,220
Hey...

530
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,190
Why is this happening?

531
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,730
This isn't supposed to happen.

532
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,490
Hey, Soo Jin.

533
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:50,330
Hey, kid! What are you doing over here right now?

534
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,750
What did you do to make your soul suddenly so weak?

535
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,670
Ahjussi, something is wrong with me.

536
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,660
My body feels so weak, and Soo Jin can't even feel me.

537
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,750
Soo Jin is not the problem right now!

538
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,930
You are on the brink of death right now!

539
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,470
- Pardon?
 -  You've been out of your body for a little too long.

540
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,250
You have to hurry back to your body now!

541
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,170
If you don't, you will die for good, punk!

542
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,660
Why will I die?!

543
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,190
Soo Jin will come and save me.

544
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,670
I told her everything about the manhole.

545
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,250
I also told her that everything would go back to the beginning too.

546
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:28,380
Soo Jin is the only person who will be able to save me in the end,

547
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,890
but I didn't get a chance to ask her to help me.

548
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:35,080
Soo Jin doesn't know yet that I have to go back on to that manhole tonight. Hey, Soo Jin!

549
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,650
Hey kid, let's get back to the hospital for now.

550
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:42,130
I will think of another way. But we have to go back to the hospital for now. Hurry up!

551
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,810
Hey, Soo Jin.

552
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,720
 Please help me. 

553
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,490
 Soo Jin, please. Are you listening to me? 

554
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:18,090
 Soo Jin, please. Are you listening to me? 

555
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,520
What?

556
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:30,970
Pil. Oh, Pil!

557
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,720
Are you going somewhere?

558
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,060
Sook.

559
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,650
Hey, did something happen?

560
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:21,300
Hey soul, what's wrong with me?

561
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,760
If I go back in now, then I won't be able to come back out again.

562
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,230
Soo Jin, please.

563
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,160
How about his blood pressure?

564
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,090
It's not showing yet.

565
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,320
Oh!

566
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:53,140
- Hold on a minute.
 - It's showing now.

567
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:57,260
What's happening? What's going on here all of a sudden?

568
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:02,230
We were able to get over the crucial moment, but at this rate, tonight might be his final night to live.

569
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:05,030
So I think you might need to prepare your minds for it.

570
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,940
Oh Lord.

571
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,130
Are you leaving us at last?

572
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:37,820
So the person you met last night wasn't Seok Tae. It was Pil, right?

573
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,990
Fine then. Where is Pil now?

574
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:44,710
I don't know. I'm waiting for him to come.

575
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,420
I'm thinking about going over to see Seok Tae.

576
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,540
Leave Seok Tae alone. Seok Tae is doing fine on his own.

577
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,750
Wait a minute. What's with this whole manhole thing anyway?

578
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:57,660
So what you're saying is that Pil is time-traveling by going through that manhole in the neighborhood?

579
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,480
Seriously, you're driving me crazy here.

580
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,080
When Pil comes over, you can hear it from him yourself. He'll be here soon.

581
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,970
He told me that he has a favor to ask me tonight.

582
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:08,960
What favor?

583
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,690
I have no idea. I didn't hear it last night when we were together because I was too sleepy.

584
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:17,830
You are going to die in my hands tonight if Pil doesn't show up, alright?!

585
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:23,740
I think it's a text from Pil.

586
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:30,350
 Soo Jin, I don't think Pil will be able to make it beyond tonight. 

587
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:34,830
Hey, what is it?

588
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,750
Pil...

589
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,870
this might be his last night to live.

590
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:50,640
Taxi!

591
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,770
Hey, you should only talk about things that make sense.

592
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,740
Pil is in that condition, so how can his soul be roaming around?! Why are you saying such nonsense?!

593
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:04,620
It was definitely Pil. He surely remembered what only the two of us could remember!

594
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,310
Taxi!

595
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,190
Pil's soul is roaming around?

596
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,600
Alright, now things are starting to make sense.

597
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,750
Oh, Father. Are you just coming home from work?

598
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:44,880
Do you know who is to blame for us being so humiliated at the hospital like that?

599
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,620
Pardon?

600
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,310
That's the same moon from last night.

601
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,640
Last night was the moon of humiliation.

602
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:00,510
But today is the moon of revenge.

603
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,980
Let's go to the hospital now.

604
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:08,700
Jeong Ae, he is the one who scratched the chairs and the table.

605
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,940
He's the one responsible for the five sausages that disappeared from your fridge at home.

606
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,230
It's because my blood sugar level was low.

607
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,200
But you're still not supposed get into other people's fridge.

608
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,950
- Hey! What? What? 
 - But you ate it though.

609
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,770
- What are you talking about?! What? 
 - I saw it all.

610
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:22,060
- You ate five of them. Five.
 - Stop it!

611
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:29,310
What's this saying?

612
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:32,090
   I think something might happen to Pil tonight. 

613
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:34,600
 Please come and stop my father. 

614
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,940
Thank you for coming over, kids.

615
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,720
What do you mean he won't be able to make it beyond tonight, ma'am?

616
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:02,980
I even met with Pil last night, so I don't understand what you're saying.

617
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,520
What's with you?

618
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:14,430
I waited for you all day today. What's going on?

619
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,650
Hey!

620
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,010
Hey!

621
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,380
Hey!

622
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,090
Open up your eyes!

623
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,240
Pil!

624
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,040
No...

625
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:48,010
Pil!

626
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:38,800
   
   

627
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:47,260
 So you went back and forth using that manhole near the tunnel? 

628
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:52,420
 So you left at 12 o'clock midnight and came back at 12 o'clock in the afternoon? 

629
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:08,650
 Soo Jin, I don't think Pil will be able to make it beyond tonight. 

630
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,960
Mr. and Mrs. Bong, the doctor is looking for you.

631
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,890
We'll look after things here.

632
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:36,520
Okay. You guys look after things here for a moment.

633
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,080
Okay.

634
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,400
What are you doing right now?

635
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,450
Sook, let's save Pil.

636
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:04,170
He said he could go through the manhole at 12 o'clock. Then everything will go back to the way they were.

637
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:06,000
Get a hold of yourself, Kang Soo Jin!

638
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,500
He can't make it past tonight anyway. Today is the last chance.

639
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:14,280
I can't let Pil die like this. Either help me or get out of the way.

640
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,530
- Are you crazy? 
 - Yes. If anything happens to Pil, I'll die too.

641
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,000
How can I live without Pil?

642
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,230
I don't know about you, but I definitely can't do that.

643
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,450
Soo Jin!

644
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,990
Pil will be fine. Just like other times, he will be fine!

645
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:33,180
There's no time!

646
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,470
It's almost 12 o'clock. Then it really will be over.

647
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,830
You're not the only one who thinks of Pil.

648
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,380
I think of Pil as much as you do.

649
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:46,050
Then why can't you feel him? Why can't you feel Pil?

650
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:49,620
Then you! Why are you the only one who can feel him?

651
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:53,170
No one else can feel him, so why are you the only one who can feel him?

652
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:57,850
Stop with your nonsense. I'll call someone in here.

653
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,400
Pil knew.

654
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,360
He knew that there would be a fire that night at the beach.

655
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,670
Do you remember?

656
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:21,030
At the time, when we got there, he told us to go back.

657
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:24,560
He prepared a lot of buckets full of water all around us,

658
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,400
and he didn't even drink a sip of alcohol.

659
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:31,300
Now I understand why Pil was doing all that back then.

660
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:36,180
He knew that there would be a fire that night.

661
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:43,260
You asked why I feel him?

662
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:49,680
Because Pil thinks only of me

663
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,040
and loves only me.

664
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:06,080
Sook, I know that you like Pil.

665
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:14,040
I don't know if I was hesitant because of you,

666
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:20,070
but not anymore.

667
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,710
This time I have to protect him.

668
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:32,250
If we continue on like this, we'll never be able to see Pil again, Sook.

669
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:46,980
Soo Jin.

670
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:51,280
I don't know, maybe you're right.

671
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:57,020
Because Pil thinks only of you and loves only you.

672
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,620
They are coming again. Let me in, let me in!

673
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,680
Let me in!

674
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,630
Ah, screw it.

675
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:20,760
Why is it so hard to get in? Because they're people who studied a lot?

676
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,160
There's no time. Why can't I get in?

677
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,680
I have to possess hospital personnel in order to take him out easily!

678
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:36,070
Sook, let's get a taxi.

679
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:37,700
Okay.

680
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,960
I feel some kind of wicked energy lurking around!

681
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:53,660
You guys must not be the Soo Jin and Jin Sook that I know.

682
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,620
Ahjussi,  there's no time. Please get out of the way.

683
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:00,490
Hey, come to your senses! It's scary. What are you doing?

684
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,690
Between the two of you, which one is Pil?

685
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:07,370
The other should be Goo Gil's father.

686
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:08,980
I'm suddenly craving alcohol.

687
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,320
Get out of the way.

688
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,410
Father, by the way, isn't it strange that Pil is roaming around?

689
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:17,800
Do you still not know that even though you've gone through so much because of Pil?

690
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,760
Your body was taken by Pil again yesterday.

691
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,200
We can prove that we were possessed by ghosts yesterday.

692
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,380
I will prove it.

693
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:32,610
So I'll clear myself of yesterday's false accusation and get an apology from Director Bong—

694
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,590
What happened?

695
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,590
Let's go! There's no time!

696
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:44,680
Hurry, let's go!

697
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:49,480
Let's go. Hurry!

698
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,140
Hurry and hail a taxi.

699
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,560
Here you go.

700
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,160
Okay.

701
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,820
One, two.

702
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,190
Hey, what's going on?

703
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,520
What exactly are they doing?

704
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:21,360
D-Driver, stop! F-follow that taxi!

705
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:32,770
Hurry! Where is the manhole?

706
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:39,020
Here it is. We're here.

707
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:43,830
So you mean... you're Goo Gil's father?

708
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:48,190
Because of this rascal Pil, I can't even rest in peace.

709
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:51,190
Then... what will happen to Pil?

710
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:54,020
How should I know? We'll have to wait and see.

711
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:58,600
I can't even believe he's riding on a manhole and traveling.

712
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,020
- Huh? Someone is here? 
 - Huh?

713
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,150
Seok Tae!

714
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,020
Go over there.

715
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:29,460
 Pil, today won't be our last day together, right? 

716
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:35,740
 If I go through the manhole, you'll forget everything. 

717
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:40,110
 The things that you've said to me... everything. 

718
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,950
 It seems as if I'm sending you off forever. 

719
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:51,420
 If it's as you say, we'll meet again. 

720
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:58,190
 Don't forget me. If you do, you'll die by my hands. 

721
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:06,480
 Of course. No matter where you are, I'll find you. 

722
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,610
 Don't worry. 

723
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,400
Hey, over there!

724
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,410
Hey! Jo Seok Tae! You! You!

725
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,430
Hey! You! You!

726
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,550
Beat him up!

727
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:24,360
What's matter with you? Ah!

728
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,000
- Why are you doing this to me? 
 - Beat him up!

729
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,560
Stop! He's not Seok Tae! He's your father!

730
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,490
Do you need a beating too?

731
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:32,330
If you don't want to kick him, move aside!

732
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:33,660
Hey, hey, hey, stop it!

733
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,560
It's me! It's me!

734
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,160
It's me! It's me!

735
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,360
It's Seok Tae!

736
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:52,970
Pil, why weren't we together?

737
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:58,320
What was it that blocked us?

738
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,570
 12 o'clock. 

739
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:25,600
No... wait...

740
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,530
Pil.

741
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:32,460
What?

742
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:42,900


743
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:53,980
Whoa... I-Is this real?

744
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:57,030
Did you see?

745
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:58,890
Pil.

746
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:05,350
♫  I wanted to ask you again  ♫

747
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:10,890
 Don't forget me. If you do, you'll die by my hands. 

748
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:16,060
 Of course. No matter where you are, I'll find you. 

749
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:19,300
 Don't worry. 

750
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:24,200
♫  Everything will open up to you  ♫

751
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,490
♫  Now both the pain  ♫

752
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:33,120
♫  And all the wounds  ♫

753
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:39,300
♫  Everything which has distressed my heart  ♫
