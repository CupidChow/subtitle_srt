1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,750
   

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,820
Well...

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,780
What's wrong? Is something there?

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,360
Oh, it's nothing.

5
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,590
Let's go get some rest. I bet you're really tired today.

6
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,400
Okay, you can go first.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,250
You can go wash up first. I want to go change.

8
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,190
Why?

9
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,130
Are you planning to run away while I'm in the shower or something?

10
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,900
Huh?

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,440
Never run away from me again, Soo Jin.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,740
No matter what you do I'm going to find you anyway.

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,900
Got it?

14
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,180
Okay...

15
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,510
What the heck?

16
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:34,380


17
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,480
Soo Jin, let's go.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,410
Soo Jin!

19
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,650
Soo Jin...

20
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,120
Soo Jin...

21
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,880
Soo Jin, are you alright?

22
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,070
Soo Jin, wake up.

23
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,460
Pil.

24
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,740
No, you can't.

25
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,090
Pil, snap out of it. Please, Pil.

26
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,490
Pil, please don't.

27
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,120
Please open  your eyes.

28
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,900
Pil!

29
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,710
Man, why isn't Officer Bong picking up his phone?

30
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,690
 The person you're trying to reach is unavailable. Please leave a message after the beep. 

31
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,180
What did the people in charge tell you? Were they able to locate where Park Jae Hyeon is at right now?

32
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,240
Yes, sir. They were able to locate his whereabouts since his phone was turned on.

33
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,670
The police officers who are in the vicinity of the crime scene will be sent to where Park Jae Hyeon is located right now.

34
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,290
What a huge relief.

35
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,620
What's up with Officer Bong when he said that he's chasing after Park Jae Hyeon?

36
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,230
What are we going to do?

37
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,460
You're bleeding a lot.

38
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,560
I am fine.

39
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,320
Where is Park Jae Hyeon?

40
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,930
He must have run off.

41
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,920
I think we should take you to the hospital more than anything.

42
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,660
You cell.  Where is your cell phone?

43
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,350
No don't, I will do it for you.

44
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,790
Hello.

45
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,640
Hello? Isn't this Officer Bong's phone?

46
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,960
Oh, could you be Miss Kang Soo Jin?

47
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,030
Yes, this  is Kang Soo Jin.

48
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,230
Are you with Officer Bong by any chance? What happened to Park Jae Hyeon?

49
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:37,230
Jae Hyeon... stabbed Pil and then ran away.

50
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,190
Pardon?!

51
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,550
Pil is severely injured right now.

52
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,660
Yes, I will hurry up and send the ambulance there.

53
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,900
Officer Sin, Officer Bong has been stabbed.

54
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,800
Hurry up and call for the ambulance. STAT.

55
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,030
Yes, sir.

56
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,940
Man, this is driving me crazy.

57
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,010
Hello, this is Bora Patrol Center.

58
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,530
Park Jae Hyeon stabbed Officer Bong with a knife, and he is on the run right now.

59
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,040
It would be great if you could hurry it up.

60
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,020
Let's hurry it up since Park Jae Hyeon is on the run right now.

61
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,510
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,460
Oh, that car belongs to Park Jae Hyeon.

63
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,930
- Hurry up and chase it down.  
 - Yes, sir.

64
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,590
Hurry, hurry.

65
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,200
Please be patient, okay?

66
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,000
The ambulance will be here soon,

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,570
so everything will be okay.

68
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,880
Soo Jin.

69
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,060
You're not hurt anywhere, right?

70
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,630
I'm fine.

71
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,460
Pil, I'm so sorry.

72
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,350
If only I didn't turn on my phone,

73
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,280
then you wouldn't have a reason to come here.

74
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,520
Then you wouldn't have to be hurt like this.

75
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,030
It's all my fault.

76
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,970
Sorry.

77
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,840
Don't say such things.

78
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,320
Even if you didn't do that

79
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,360
I would've somehow came up with a way to find you anyway.

80
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,520
I was scared that you would be like this.

81
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,700
So, this is why I didn't want to see you again.

82
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,860
I was afraid you would run into trouble because of me

83
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,450
and this is why I didn't want to see you again.

84
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,510
And I made you go through something like this again.

85
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,310
If I couldn't save you,

86
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,030
then I would've probably become bitter towards myself for all my life.

87
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,910
That's even more difficult for me to deal with.

88
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,730
Pil.

89
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,570
Stay right there!

90
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,690
Hey!

91
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,550
Hurry it up.

92
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,850
Let go of me!

93
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,600
- Don't move. 
 - Let go!

94
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,760
Over there!

95
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,120
Pil, snap out of it.

96
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
Pil..

97
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,190
The stars are so beautiful.

98
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,840
That's true.

99
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,510
Soo Jin...

100
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,070
As I was time traveling,

101
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,760
at first...

102
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,250
I thought that only if you were by my side

103
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,260
that's all I needed.

104
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,150
But then

105
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,890
I thought about it for a bit

106
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,190
and in the end

107
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,860
you becoming happy

108
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,530
was the most important thing to me.

109
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,120
When you smile,

110
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,410
I can smile as well.

111
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,680
If you are doing well, then I will feel the same way.

112
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,330
So...

113
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,040
you must be happy.

114
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,400
That way I can become happy as well.

115
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,450
You got me?

116
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,290
Hey...

117
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,960
Why are you talking as if this is your last?

118
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,270
I will never again

119
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,000
be apart from you ever.

120
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,190
Even if you say no to me, I still won't leave you ever.

121
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,190
So don't die on me.

122
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,480
You must stay alive and be by my side. Okay?

123
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,540
Soo Jin.

124
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,320
Even if I die,

125
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,290
you must not think that I'm not by your side.

126
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,410
Even during the moments when you can't remember me,

127
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,620
I was always by your side, was I not?

128
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,170
No matter what you do,

129
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,280
no matter where you are,

130
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,570
and even in the future,

131
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,720
I'm always going to be beside you.

132
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,320
Why do you keep saying such things?!

133
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,890
Pil.

134
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,880
I still have a lot of things I haven't told you yet.

135
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,000
I still have a lot of things that I haven't done for you yet.

136
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,740
I can't let you go like this.

137
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,880
I absolutely cannot send you off like this, Pil.

138
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,100
♫  You and I  ♫

139
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,460
Soo Jin, I...

140
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,570
constantly have a hard time seeing your face now.

141
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,010
I can't let this happen.

142
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,350
My Soo Jin ...

143
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,010
 I can't do anything more for you  ♫

144

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,590
♫  You and I  ♫

169
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,780
   

170
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,000
Like this, just like this.

171
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,200
Hey, why are you sleeping like that when you need to get your makeup done?

172
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,800
I bet she couldn't sleep last because she felt so excited for this day.

173
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,400
You wench.

174
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,690
Jeong Ae... what am I doing here right now?

175
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,920
Are you still asleep? You were getting your bridal makeup done just now.

176
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,870
Bridal makeup?

177
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,150
Am I getting married today by any chance?

178
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:52,790
Is this the so-called "marriage blues" that we always hear about?

179
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,600
Soo Jin, are you having a hard time accepting reality because you'll be getting married soon?

180
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,030
Are you all right?

181
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,360
Pil, where is he right now?

182
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,840
I don't know. He's probably passed out somewhere all drunk.

183
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,220
Hey, your makeup came out really good today.

184
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,670
You're pretty to begin with, but you are even prettier today.

185
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,030
Look here.

186
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,300
I have to go and find Pil right now.

187
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,980
- Hey, hey, hey. Soo Jin!
 - What the heck is wrong with her?

188
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,130
- Kang Soo Jin! 
 - Soo Jin!

189
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,420
Hey, Soo Jin!

190
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,160
Hey!

191
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,970
Hey, Soo Jin!

192
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,680
I really don't want to go to the wedding to be honest.

193
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,700
We should still go though. We should go and at least show our faces.

194
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,130
I wonder if Pil is going to go to the wedding at all.

195
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,630
He didn't even come home last night. Where is he anyway?

196
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,240
Pil probably doesn't want to go to Soo Jin's wedding.

197
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,100
Perhaps it's better that way.

198
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,210
It would be a massive headache if he caused a scene like he did with that marriage gift-giving incident.

199
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,800
Pil! Pil!

200
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,600
Hey there, Soo Jin. What's up with you?

201
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,340
Where is Pil, Mrs. Bong?

202
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,970
Pil's not home right now.

203
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,640
Pil! Pil!

204
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,670
Hey! My goodness.

205
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,670
Pil!

206
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,530
What are you...?

207
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,300
Do you know where Pil is right now, Mrs. Bong?

208
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,750
I'm not sure. He didn't even come home last night.

209
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,190
Why are you looking for Pil with that wedding dress on?

210
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,710
- Is something the matter? 
- Well, that is...

211
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:31,300
I will explain it to you later on. Well, then.

212
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,920
I have to go.

213
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,800
Why is she looking for Pil when she's supposed to be at the wedding hall right now?

214
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,170
I was curious about that as well.

215
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:48,910
   

216
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,390
 Pil. 

217
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,940
 Pil. 

218
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,700
 Pil, open your eyes. Hey, Bong Pil! 

219
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,970
 Pil, where are you? 

220
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,560
 Please show yourself to me. 

221
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,750
 Pil. 

222
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,660
 Hey, Bong Pil. 

223
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,370
Doctor! The patient woke up!

224
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,830
Patient, where are you going? You shouldn't be doing that.

225
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,740
Patient, please don't do this. It's dangerous.

226
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,000
Please calm down, Patient.

227
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,600
- Patient, calm down.
- Patient, don't do this! It's dangerous.

228
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,740
 Pil, you're looking for me right now too, right? 

229
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,390
 Soo Jin, didn't I tell you? 

230
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,400
 I'll find you wherever you are. 

231
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,150
 I'll always be by your side. 

232
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,430
 Yes, I can feel it. 

233
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,210
 Even though we're in different timelines, 

234
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,550
 that we're together, that we're looking towards the same place. 

235
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:04,090
 Soo Jin, nothing can separate us. 

236
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,690
 I'll go to you whatever it takes. 

237
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,670
 Just wait a little bit. 

238
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,810
 Just a bit. 

239
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,280
You're here! Hey, Soo Jin!

240
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,190
Hey! Why did you come here in the middle of getting your makeup done?

241
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,340
I have to meet Pil.

242
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,490
What?

243
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,360
Why are you trying to meet Pil instead of your groom on the day of your wedding?

244
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,580
Pil will be looking for me, too. Where in the world is he?

245
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:14,320
Hey! Get a hold of yourself. Why does it matter where Pil is right now?

246
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,420
You're going to be late to your wedding at this rate. Let's go quickly.

247
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,000
Hey, this won't do. I'll hail a taxi, so quickly bring her over.

248
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,790
- Hurry, hurry. 
- Oppa. Jeong Ae. 
- Quickly bring her.

249
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,480
- Come quickly. 
- What are you doing at the manhole?

250
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,690
- Come 
- No, but I have to meet him...

251
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,690
What is this? What? Why am I like this?

252
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,170
What is this? This looks like Jin Sook's house.

253
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,720
Hey. Did you wake up?

254
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,600
Hey! What is this?

255
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,180
What do you mean?

256
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,950
Hey, don't think about doing something stupid and stay still like this.

257
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,180
Hey. Jin Sook, are we...

258
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,470
Are we married again?

259
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,230
Are you crazy, Pil? Why would I marry you?

260
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:29,180
Then what is this situation? Why am I, why am I tied up here?

261
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:34,210
Because you might go to Soo Jin's wedding and create havoc!

262
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:38,730
Hey, to- today's Soo Jin's wedding day?

263
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,300
Perhaps with that... pharmacist punk?

264
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,600
Are you still not fully sober? Or are you denying reality?

265
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,360
Hey... Then where is- where is Soo Jin right now?

266
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,660
Where would she be? She's at the wedding hall.

267
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:55,630
Hey. Until Soo Jin's wedding ends, stay still like this. Okay?

268
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,430
 Did Soo Jin not go through the manhole this time? 

269
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,310
 It seems like I came alone this time. 

270
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,230
Jin Sook, I'm here.

271
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,620
- You're here. 
- Hey, Seok Tae. Seok Tae.

272
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,080
Is this correctly tied?

273
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,450
Yeah, I tied it tightly.

274
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,980
Hey.

275
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,990
Aren't you guys too much?

276
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,020
How could you tie a person like this?

277
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,720
Do you think we want to do this?

278
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,780
It's because you keep causing unexpected trouble.

279
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,170
Today's a good day for Soo Jin, so don't think about causing chaos and stay still.

280
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,490
That's helping Soo Jin.

281
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,800
But it's Soo Jin's wedding. Shouldn't I- shouldn't I go?

282
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,360
I really won't do anything. So untie me.

283
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,890
Jin Sook, listening to Pil, he does have a point.

284
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,630
Should he attend the wedding?

285
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,040
No! Seeing what he did on the day of giving the bridegroom's wedding gifts...

286
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,630
Hey, no. No way!

287
00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,070
Hey... I am deeply repentant about that day.

288
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:05,030
I really won't do anything at the wedding hall. I'll just watch from a distance.

289
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,000
It's the most important day in Soo Jin's life.

290
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,650
I really want to congratulate her.

291
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,900
What should we do?

292
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,260
No. Seeing what he did on the day of giving the bridegroom's wedding gifts... No, he can't.

293
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,360
Hey, Seok Tae. Be strong. Let's go.

294
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,190
Hey. Hey! Hey!

295
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,890
Hey! Untie me right now!

296
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,740
Hey! Hey, Yoon Jin Sook! You're so hard-hearted!

297
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,070
Where did she go? The ceremony seems like it will  start soon.

298
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,650
She'll be here soon. Wait just a little longer.

299
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,530
The bride is here.

300
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,620
Soo Jin, where did you go? I was worried.

301
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,730
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

302
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,260
It seems that Soo Jin is really nervous.

303
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,070
Soo Jin, it's okay. Relax.

304
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,040
The ceremony will start soon. Groom, please stand by.

305
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,800
Okay.

306
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,670
Don't be nervous. See you in a bit.

307
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:36,070
- Go on. 
- We'll go.
 - Yes, Father.

308
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,700
Gosh, those mean, little...

309
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,870
Okay, that worked.

310
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,910
I have to go.

311
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,640
♫  Look at the sky, the dazzling sky  ♫

312
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,800
♫  My cloud which contains your smile  ♫

313
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:21,720
♫  All right, this feeling which is gradually growing bigger  ♫

314
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,960
♫  Look at me girl, I can't hide it  ♫

315
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,770
♫  The smile which engulfs me all at once  ♫

316
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:33,920
Okay then, we will start the wedding of groom Park Jae Hyeon and bride Kang Soo Jin.

317
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,830
Groom, enter.

318
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,630
♫  I think of it throughout the day  ♫

319
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,510
♫  I've fallen in love  ♫

320
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,330
♫  I want you. Stay with me.  ♫

321
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,150
♫  I wanna be with you  ♫

322
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,600
 Pil, why aren't you around? 

323
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,570
 You didn't get to time travel this time? 

324
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,590
 Perhaps, did I come by myself? 

325
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,510
Soo Jin. You're nervous, right?

326
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,850
It's okay.

327
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,890
Sending my only daughter...

328
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,390
I'm getting emotional because of it.

329
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,910
But... Dad...

330
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,140
I know, I know. It's okay.

331
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,660
Now the bride has to enter.

332
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,020
Okay.

333
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,500
Let's go, Soo Jin.

334
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,140
Now stand up.

335
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,590
Okay, let's go. It's okay.

336
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,020
Yes, our groom. Doesn't he look dependable?

337
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,670
Now we will invite the beautiful bride.

338
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,590
Bride, enter!

339
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,300
She's pretty!

340
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,500
   
   

341
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,700
   
   

342
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:18,990
Okay, do you, groom Park Jae Hyeon, take our bride Kang Soo Jin as your wife,

343
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,560
to love and respect her in all circumstances,

344
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,650
to truly take upon this duty as her husband, and to raise a happy family?

345
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,630
- Yes! I promise! 
- Yes, good.

346
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,820
And I ask this to our bride, Kang Soo Jin.

347
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:41,180
Do you, bride Kang Soo Jin, take our groom Park Jae Hyeon as your husband,

348
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,780
to love and respect him in all circumstances,

349
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,850
and to raise a happy family?

350
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,520
Uh... Bride Kang Soo Jin?

351
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,070
Say yes. Go ahead. Yes.

352
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,540
Why isn't she saying yes?

353
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,770
Answer yes.

354
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,310
Soo Jin!

355
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,690
♫  In case you are serious  ♫

356
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:41,660
♫  I wanted to ask you again  ♫

357
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:48,420
Uh... O-our, our bride... T-to o-our bride Kang Soo Jin, I will ask again.

358
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:54,660
Does our bride Kang Soo Jin take our groom Park Jae Hyeon as her husband?

359
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,590
No.

360
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,080
I can't marry this man.

361
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,700
That girl!

362
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,710
Soo Jin, what's the matter with you?

363
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,030
Park Jae Hyeon. Don't you show yourself in front of me ever again.

364
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,100
Got it?

365
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,280
♫  Everything which has distressed my heart  ♫

366
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:23,900
♫  I want to entrust to you  ♫

367
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,700
- Soo Jin! 
 - Pil.

368
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,160
You... went through the manhole, right?

369
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,160
Why are you late?

370
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,000
I was waiting so long for you.

371
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,450
I'm sorry for being late.

372
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,230
Let's go.

373
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,930
- What?
 - He can't do that!

374
00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:00,880
♫  Now I know your pain  ♫

375
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,250
♫  When I see your tears flow  ♫

376
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,030
- Hey Bong Pil! 
 - Hey!

377
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,800
♫  It feels like even my heart is ripping apart  ♫

378
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,170
♫  Now both the pain   ♫

379
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:21,430
♫  And all the wounds  ♫

380
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:29,600
♫  Everything which has distressed my heart  ♫

381
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,620
♫  I want to entrust to you  ♫

382
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:41,930
♫  Up to now, I've been keeping my heart shut  ♫

383
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,700
♫  I am someone who believed I could live alone  ♫

384
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,490
Oh, it's so beautiful.

385
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,440
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

386
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:55,490
Pil, the wound from getting stabbed with a knife. It's okay, right?

387
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:00,430
Yes. It's all fine after getting reset. Don't worry.

388
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,290
That's one good thing about time traveling.

389
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:09,650
I was so worried that something bad might have happened to you.

390
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,690
I was worried that you might not remember me again.

391
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:23,320
♫  Since love came and knocked on my heart  ♫

392
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,400
♫  It gently enters, comes beside me, and excites me  ♫

393
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:33,790
Pil. From now on, let's never separate.

394
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,390
Yes.

395
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:46,430
Wherever you are, whichever timeline you're in,

396
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,550
I will always be with you.

397
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,760
Don't worry.

398
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,430
♫  You are the so-called feeling  ♫

399
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:02,760
♫  You are the small tremor  ♫

400
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,090
♫  Because you are my half which  ♫

401
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:11,500
♫  Fate gave to show affection for me  ♫

402
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,860
♫  Because you are the feeling that is love  ♫

403
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,600
♫  This tremor is good  ♫

404
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:26,870
♫  Because you are the love that is always beside me, it's good  ♫

405
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:33,900
♫  I love you. I love you. Love for you  ♫

406
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,680
 I will confess my feelings a little later  ♫

407
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:45,580
♫  When you accept them, I will say I love you  ♫

408
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:52,360
♫  I must have fallen for you  ♫

409
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,790
♫  Because it's you, it must be good  ♫

410
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:01,130
♫  Because I want to hug you, because I want to give you everything  ♫

411
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,930
♫  I don't know anyone except you  ♫

412
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,400
♫  I must have fallen in love  ♫

413
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,340
♫  Because I love you, only you can be seen  ♫

414
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:22,560
♫  Even today, I'm falling more for you  ♫

415
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:28,490
   

416
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:12,510
Hey. Hey, Soo Jin. Are you okay?

417
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,920
I'm okay. I didn't get summoned yet.

418
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,930
Hey, I'm so nervouse that I can't handle it. I'll come over.

419
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,310
- Where? To my room? 
- Yes, I'm coming.

420
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,030
Hey. Hey, hey!

421
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,150
Hey, hey, hey!

422
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,510
Hey, what are you going to do if our parents wake up?

423
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,890
It's okay.

424
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,070
Hey, hey, hey! Are you crazy?

425
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,560
What are you trying to do?!

426
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,280
Hey, even if we get summoned, we have to go together. Come on, quickly.

427
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,040
Hey, hey, hey.

428
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,490
Hurry. Your hand.

429
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,570
You have to go once midnight passes.

430
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,160
Okay.

431
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,560
But...

432
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,940
What is this sound?

433
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,890
What?

434
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,640
This sounds like your heart beating.

435
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:32,310
It's not. It's your heart beating.

436
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,460
Is it?

437
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:41,470
Hey. But really... It's so nice to be like this.

438
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,090
I don't know... Just see what time it is.

439
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:49,120
Oh right. Wait a second.

440
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,160
It's 11:59.

441
00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:01,130
10 - 9 - 8 - 7

442
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,100
What are we going to do?

443
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:21,160
Hey. We didn't get summoned.

444
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,420
Another midnight passed safely without trouble.

445
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,800
Soo Jin.

446
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,180
Should I sleep over here?

447
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,430
What?

448
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,920
Soo Jin!

449
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,670
- Mom! 
- What are you doing, not sleeping? Who were you talking to?

450
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,930
No. I was talking to Sook on the phone.

451
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,890
Why do you have your windows opened when it's cold?

452
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:07,260
No, Mom! I'll close them.

453
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,630
Mom, good night. You must be tired.

454
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,600
Okay, sleep well.

455
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,740
Hey, this is so thrilling.

456
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,750
You know you drive me crazy.

457
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,010
Soo Jin, let's do this again tomorrow.

458
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,940
You little...

459
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:45,070
Honey, how long are you going to stay there like that?

460
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,750
We should move to another place or something.

461
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:55,280
All of the neighbors ask me about the broken marriage everytime I leave the house.

462
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,120
I just can't hold my head up and walk around freely without feeling embarrassed.

463
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,860
Just think of this as fate, Honey.

464
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,700
There's nothing we can do since Soo Jin didn't want to.

465
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,260
My poor fate, my poor fate.

466
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,830
I'll be back after going to the studio.

467
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:17,690
Are you able to work in this situation? Can you?!

468
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,940
Mom, why are you at it again?

469
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,200
Are you going to continue meeting Pil or not?

470
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,610
What's wrong with Pil, Mom?

471
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,930
Are you asking because you actually don't know?

472
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:30,360
He is unemployed for one, and he has absolutely nothing going for him!

473
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,230
What are you lacking that you're meeting someone like that?!

474
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:37,460
Wow, this is amazing! Did I pass?!

475
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,670
What kind of noise is this? Is that Pil's voice?

476
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,280
Mother and Father, I passed!

477
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:55,470
Honey, could it be that our Pil...? Pil.

478
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,940
Honey, where is he going?

479
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,290
He's probably going to see Soo Jin.

480
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,510
Soo Jin?

481
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,050
Hey Soo Jin, I passed the police academy entrance exam!

482
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,620
Pil, well done! I'm so proud of you, Pil!

483
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,790
This is all thanks to you.

484
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,010
So happy!

485
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,290
We are here too, you know.

486
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,750
What's with that crude behavior in the house?

487
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:27,800
Hello, Mother and Father. I... passed!

488
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,640
   

489
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,740
It's so unexpected that likes of you made it happen. But either way, congratulations, kid.

490
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,210
Thank you.

491
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,440
Pil, is it true? Is this really true?

492
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,030
It's really true, take a look at this here.

493
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:45,420
National Police Agency... oh my!

494
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,990
You did it! Wow, this is great!

495
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,950
Oh my boy, so proud of you.

496
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,970
This is so refreshing that the old stress from my body is all going away!

497
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:57,530
I'm now be able to walk around with my head held up high.

498
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:04,130
- Congratulations to you too. 
  - Thank you.

499
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,640
Congratulations. I guess something good always happens when you least expect it. He finally passed.

500
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,450
Pil was meant to make it one way or another. It's just that you were never able to see that in him, Mrs. Kang.

501
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,740
Pil, tell me whatever you want to eat. I will make some delicious food for you, okay?

502
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,610
Yes, Mother. Soo Jin, you have to go to work, don't you? Let's go. I will take you.

503
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,260
I'll see you later everyone.

504
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,620
- Bye for now. 
 - Let's go.

505
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,470
Okay, okay.

506
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,730
This is great!

507
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:33,670
It looks like they could make a good couple with that visual.

508
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,190
Don't you think so, folks?

509
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,490
That's so true.

510
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,610
Right, Honey?

511
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,760
   

512
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,950
Are you packing up already just because you passed?

513
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,550
I feel sad now.

514
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,410
Congratulations, buddy.

515
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:10,710
Congratulations, kid.

516
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:13,220
Thanks. I'm sure that good news will be coming your way too.

517
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,690
Either way, congratulations for passing. You should hurry up and get paid so you can treat us all.

518
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:19,660
Alright, just let me know if you want to go have a drink. I will treat you guys.

519
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,090
Alright! You better treat us, now.

520
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:24,340
- We will call you. 
 - I envy you.

521
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,180
   

522
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,730
Hello, Father.

523
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,910
Huh? Where to?

524
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,990
Excuse me, are you Mr. Jo Seok Tae?

525
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,950
Pardon? Me? Who are you?

526
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,850
I heard that you passed your civil service entrance exam.

527
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:52,280
Ah, yes.

528
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,990
I also got a job at the bank not too long ago.

529
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,230
Oh, is that right?

530
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:03,990
It's very fortunate that we both have very secure jobs. Don't you think so?

531
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:08,910
I don't know what you heard about me from my father,

532
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,530
but to be honest with you, I have a  person I like...

533
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,540
We are all done here.

534
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,630
Congratulations.

535
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,230
Thank you, it was a pleasure to meet you.

536
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,950
I better go. I have something to do at the head office.

537
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,770
Yes, bye now.

538
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,810
Hey, Seok Tae! What are you doing?

539
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:33,020
Oh, Jin Sook... Ah, well this is...

540
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,260
Are you Seok Tae's friend?

541
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,620
Yes. Who are you?

542
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,330
We're  having a blind date right now.

543
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,220
Oh, a blind date?

544
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,480
Oh, it's not that. Jin Sook, it's...

545
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,510
I had no idea that this was a blind date. Please excuse me.

546
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,640
Hey, good luck.

547
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,060
Hey, Jin Sook.

548
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:57,540
- I'm sorry but I have someone I like. 
 - Pardon?

549
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,140
I'm so sorry, so sorry about this.

550
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,270
Excuse me, Seok Tae!

551
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:14,550
He told me that I will be the only one he'll like for all his life, but I guess men are all the same.

552
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,730
Wow, what nice weather.

553
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,880
Jin Sook! Jin Sook.

554
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,700
What's up? Why are you here when you should be continuing on with your blind date?

555
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,510
The truth is, I didn't go to that blind date because I wanted to.

556
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:29,660
My father arranged it without even discussing it with me, so please don't misunderstand.

557
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,230
That's the excuse?

558
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,860
Why should I care if you go out and have blind dates or not?

559
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:40,370
How could you say that? You don't even care if I go and meet other women?

560
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,640
Nope, not at all.

561
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,540
And if you're  going to go meet someone,

562
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,490
why don't  you meet a girl that's super pretty while you're at it.

563
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,570
How could you not care?

564
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:54,090
It makes me furious when you're with another man.

565
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,390
Forget it, I'm going in!

566
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:59,140
Hey, hold up. Tell it to me straight, right now.

567
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,550
Am I just a friend to you? You never thought of me as a man?

568
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,930
Hey, why are you doing this? Let go of me.

569
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,600
No, I don't want to. I'm must hear an answer from you today.

570
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,760
Tell me now. Do you think of me as a man, yes or no?

571
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,040
Yes or no.

572
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,230
What does that even mean? So are you saying it's neither?

573
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,450
I'm saying there is a possibility, you nitwit. So let go of me! I'm going in now.

574
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,930
♫ You my dear.

575
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:36,300
♫ The person that I loved,

576
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,510
Oppa! Oppa!

577
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,690
♫ Jeong Ae.

578
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:42,670
- Huh? 
 - Nothing.

579
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,440
Pil passed his police academy entrance exam.

580
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,930
For real? Pil finally did it.

581
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,500
Seok Tae passed a few days ago too, and now Pil made it happen.

582
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,880
It feels so good to have reliable friends who are public officers, right?

583
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,020
That's true. I bet Soo Jin is the happiest, don't you think?

584
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,330
Soo Jin's mother wasn't happy about the fact that Pil was unemployed.

585
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:05,510
But her attitude towards him has changed 180 degrees after hearing that news.

586
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:10,330
I wonder if men have to be successful more than anything?

587
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:15,130
Don't worry, I will still like you even if you are not successful.

588
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,260
By the way, what is this?

589
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:24,140
My friend from middle school is getting married, so he sent me a wedding invitation.

590
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:29,160
All of your friends are getting married now... Aren't you going to get married too?

591
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,730
Jeong Ae, do you think marriage is the final goal for people who are in love?

592
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,060
Then what else could it be?

593
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,950
You want to be with the person because you love them, and you marry because you want to be with them. Am I right?

594
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:45,880
If you love someone, you can live with that person without even being married to them. Just like us.

595
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,110
Honestly, I feel a little scared.

596
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:52,490
I worry that you'll change your mind and leave me.

597
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:56,250
Even people who are married break up when it's meant to be that way.

598
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:01,260
Marriage is just a part of a system, not some kind of magic  that continuously connects two people in love.

599
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,480
That's true but still...

600
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,040
Jeong Ae, look at me.

601
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:15,080
I will never break up with you as long as you don't have a change of heart.

602
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,680
You can trust me, okay?

603
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,130
Okay, I will.

604
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,090
Come here.

605
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:32,970
Why did you call my name earlier anyway?

606
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,720
It was just a song.

607
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,750
You are taking your medicine, right?

608
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,400
Yes.

609
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,780
How have you been? Do you still go through severe emotional ups and downs?

610
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:54,090
I feel like it's better than before, but I still go through it from time to time.

611
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:59,940
Let me change your prescription to start with.

612
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:04,800
If you continue to receive psychological treatment like you are right now, it will get better.

613
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,850
So don't miss your treatment.

614
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:08,730
Okay.

615
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,990
How can I help you? I'm in the middle of a consultation.

616
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,320
I'm his guardian.

617
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,470
Let's go now, Jae Hyeon.

618
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,500
Pil, what time is it?

619
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,340
Wait a second.

620
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,520
It's 11:59.

621
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,100
Hurry, hurry.

622
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,150
Another midnight passed safely without trouble.

623
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:28,040
Soo Jin. I can't live like this because it's too much to handle each time.

624
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,460
Pil, should we block the manhole?

625
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:38,290
No. Instead of blocking the manhole, there's a better option.

626
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:39,870
What?

627
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:08,210
Soo Jin. From now on, wherever we are and whichever timeline we are in,

628
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:12,830
grant me permission to be by your side.

629
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,750
Hey.

630
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:20,020
So that the manhole won't be able to separate us anymore,

631
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:24,530
let me stay by your side forever and protect you.

632
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,080
Bong Pil.

633
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,800
Say it more definitely, more clearly, more easily so that I can understand.

634
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,380
I mean... You only need four words. If that's too long, three!

635
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,210
I love you.

636
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:54,390
I love you, Soo Jin.

637
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:58,630
♫  My feelings for you  ♫

638
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:00,250
Soo Jin.

639
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,480
♫  That I hid from you for so long might be all right  ♫

640
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,490
Let's get married.

641
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:10,360
♫  It must not be a one-sided love  ♫

642
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,370
♫  Tell me that you want me  ♫

643
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:15,840
♫  For you, I can do anything  ♫

644
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:21,410
Here. Before I change my mind.

645
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:23,540
Quickly put the ring on.

646
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,870
♫  Don't avoid it and show me your heart  ♫

647
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:33,980
♫  I hope that you will fall into my heart  ♫

648
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:37,930
♫  Woo~ Tell me  ♫

649
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:45,090
♫  Woo~ That you love me. Just like that  ♫

650
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:50,380
♫  If the growing love is the same as my heart  ♫

651
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:55,690
♫  Would you come one step closer to me?  ♫

652
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:59,920
♫  Wanna be with you  ♫

653
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,890
♫  Woo~ Look at me  ♫

654
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:10,870
♫  Woo~ Love me. Only you  ♫

655
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:17,450
♫  If the growing love is the same as my heart  ♫

656
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,920
   

657
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,360
Woo Ri.

658
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,120
Woo Ri, look here.

659
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,160
Look here.

660
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,320
Hey, hey.

661
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,880
Let's wear these.

662
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,080
Woo Ri.

663
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,990
Look, look.

664
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:40,490
Pil is good at watching babies.

665
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:43,260
That's right. Pil had this kind of talent?

666
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,800
It's quite impressive.

667
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,370
It's because I'm a ready husband-to-be. I do well with Woo Ri.

668
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:52,020
Woo Ri.

669
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,610
- You're here. 
- You came. 
- Yeah...

670
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:56,620
Woo Ri.

671
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,640
Woo Ri.

672
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,420
You wanted to see your dad, huh? I'm sorry for being late.

673
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:06,660
Jo Seok Tae, as a dad who left his baby in care, how could you come so late?

674
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,560
Hey, we couldn't help it. The line for lunch was so long.

675
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,000
Woo Ri, you wanted to see Mom?

676
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,290
When you guys have a child, Pil should be taking care of the baby.

677
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:16,230
He's unexpectedly good with babies.

678
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:21,340
Of course. Soo Jin, all you need to do is give birth.

679
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,020
I'll take care of raising the baby.

680
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,760
- We get it, so let's take a photo before he cries. 
- Okay, let's.

681
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,180
Gather together.

682
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,550
Woo Ri, look here.

683
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,060
He's not crying.

684
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,720
One, two, three.

685
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,640
Did you take them? Soo Jin, let's take one together.

686
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,620
- Come here. 
- Hurry.

687
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,970
Come here, quickly.

688
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:51,120
Alright.

689
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,200
One, two, three.

690
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,370
   

691
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:59,190
   

692
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:00,760
   

693
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,390
   

694
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:03,510
   

695
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,860
   

696
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,630
   

697
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:09,460
   

698
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,470
   

699
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,330
   

700
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:12,390
   

701
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,370
   

702
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:16,190
   

703
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:18,360
   

704
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:40,460
I wonder if Jeong Ae closed her shop for the day.

705
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,240
Jeong Ae. Did you close your shop?

706
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,910
Yeah. I did and went grocery shopping. I'm on my way home now.

707
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:00,760
Why did you call, Oppa?

708
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:05,250
Just because. I called just because.

709
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,900
Jeong Ae, are you hungry?

710
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,990
Should we meet at the street vendor at the intersection?

711
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,280
I'll buy udon.

712
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,280
Why would I eat udon with you? Dal Soo and I already decided to make ramen.

713
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,990
Hang up.

714
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:19,580
He's so weird.

715
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,910
No wait, Jeong Ae.

716
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:30,230
Right. Why am I talking about udon at this hour?

717
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:33,040
I'll just gain weight.

718
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,960
I should head home, wash my feet, and sleep.

719
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:48,430


720
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,590
What is this? Where am I?

721
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:00,310
Oh my!

722
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:03,650
What is this? What's going on?

723
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,860
Hey, hey!

724
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,050
Hey!

725
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:15,160
Time goes by so fast. It's already been a year since we got married.

726
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:22,010
Yeah. But seeing that we're no longer summoned, it seems like the manhole doesn't work anymore.

727
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,750
It seems so.

728
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:29,680
If I think about it, without the manhole we wouldn't be together.

729
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,680
I'm thankful to the manhole in some aspects. Right?

730
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,400
Hey! Hey! Hey! Please listen to me!

731
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,730
What's going on, Hyung?

732
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:47,260
I told this to the other guys, and they're all calling me crazy.

733
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,170
But you guys will believe me, right?

734
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,600
What is it?

735
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:58,670
Every time at midnight, I keep experiencing strange things.

736
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:03,290
I'm a  high school student, then I'm in kindergarten...

737
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:06,020
I'm going back and forth between past and present!

738
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:10,010
Hey, I went to the military again, too!

739
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:15,470
Really. I'm going through it right now! It's real!

740
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:18,400
Why are you laughing?

741
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,880
Manhole?

742
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,950
Man... hole?

743
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:26,480


744
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,430


745
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:32,460


746
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,530


747
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:38,680


748
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:42,050


749
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:45,300
