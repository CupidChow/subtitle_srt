1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:01,980
   

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,260
Here it is.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,280
I wonder what this is?

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:20,040


5
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,610
 He had on a black hat and a black mask at the time of the crime. 

6
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,410
 Did you know that Jae Hyeon has a criminal record for assault and a history of psychiatric treatment? 

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,810
It's not. It can't be.

8
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,130
It's not Jae Hyeon.

9
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,440
Soo Jin.

10
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,270
What's wrong?

11
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,710
Jae Hyeon...

12
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,790
What is this bag?

13
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,350
Oh, this?

14
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,690
This is my exercise bag.

15
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,320
Jae Hyeon...

16
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,960
What?

17
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,860
Why did you stop talking?

18
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,210
No, it's just... It's nothing really.

19
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,370
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

20
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,220
It's nothing really. It's just...

21
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,320
What are you thinking?  Your face has hardened up.

22
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,890
Oh... I-I'm s-sorry about that. I wonder why...

23
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,910
Let's go in.

24
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,930
 Like this, on the wrist. It was long. 

25
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,330
 It was a scar that looked like this. 

26
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:16,130
 The piece of an ornament from a keychain that was discovered at the crime scene happened to be the same as mine. 

27
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,100
 So it looks like he thinks I'm the culprit because of it. 

28
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,930
 He was wearing a black hat and a black mask at the time of the crime. 

29
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,340
Oh yeah, I had something to do in the kitchen.

30
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,530
What was it I needed to do now?

31
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,140
When we go to England,

32
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,550
let's go back to the place where we went out on a date.

33
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,690
We should go  to Hyde Park and take a stroll there.

34
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,130
And let's also  go to the Portobello Market, okay?

35
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,590
Okay, let's do that.

36
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,230
I'm certain that it will be a good time for the both of us.

37
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,500
Jae Hyeon, what time are we supposed to leave anyway?

38
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,670
I guess we should leave after we eat, don't you think? What should we eat before we leave?

39
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,210
If I knew that this was going to happen, I should've gone grocery shopping.

40
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,690
I will go right now.

41
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,070
We can just eat out on the way. So don't worry, alright?

42
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,710
I guess so, right?

43
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,710
Right.

44
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,190
We should at least do the dishes, right? I will do the dishes, yeah.

45
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,750
Where was it now?

46
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,720
- Should I help you a little?
 - No, don't! Jae Hyeon, I will...

47
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,570
I will just do it by myself, okay?

48
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,190
You should go wash up, Jae Hyeon.

49
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,520
How come you came right  back out when you went in to get a shower?

50
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,280
It will  be over a lot quicker if the two of us do it together.

51
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,850
You should pack more underwear and clothes that you'll be wearing in England,

52
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,600
once you get out of the shower.

53
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,750
I bet England is a lot cooler than here, right?

54
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,310
Pack some long sleeves and a pair of cardigans before you come back out, okay?

55
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,390
I will.

56
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,700
Soo Jin.

57
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,420
Soo Jin.

58
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,720
 You were the wrongdoer this time. Anyone can see that. 

59
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,990
 So go to Jae Hyeon and apologize to him. 

60
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,560
 And go apologize to Soo Jin as well. 

61
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,230
   

62
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,400
 Soo Jin, you can't trust this punk.  

63
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,610
 I'm telling you, this punk is a really dangerous man. 

64
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,860
   

65
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:04,290
 Pil, I don't think I can see you anymore. I mean, I don't want to see you ever again. 

66
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,240
What am I going to do now?

67
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,180
What should I do now?

68
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,940
Here is menu.

69
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,760
I'm ordering this.

70
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
I got it.

71
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,690
Oh Soo Jin, what brings you here?

72
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,060
Sook, can you have a chat with me?

73
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,820
Hey, is something the matter?

74
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,630
- Excuse me there! One extra bottle of sake please!  
- Yes!

75
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,130
Soo Jin, sit here for a bit. I need to go tend to the customers.

76
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,530
Just for a minute, okay?

77
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,220
Is everything okay?

78
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,200
Give a little more of this, please.

79
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,480
Here you are, enjoy now.

80
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,300
Huh?

81
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,860
- Mom, I'm home. 
  - Soo Jin, you're home? 

82
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,650
 Son-in-law Park, Soo Jin is here! 

83
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,170
 Yes,  Mother-in-law. 

84
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,890
Mister, please hurry.

85
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,100
Soo Jin.

86
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,740
   

87
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,870
Hello. Hey, Soo Jin.

88
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:44,120
Pil, please help me. I'm so scared right now.

89
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,430
Soo Jin, where are you right now?

90
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,820
Pil!

91
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,940
She is meeting that punk again?

92
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,020
Soo Jin!

93
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,850
Soo Jin, wake up. Soo Jin!

94
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:10,330
What the heck? D-Did I-I just hit Soo Jin...?

95
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,410
Soo Jin! Soo Jin!

96
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,390
Soo Jin. Soo Jin, I'm not going to leave you to die.

97
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,830
I will come up with a way to save you no matter what, okay?

98
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,670
Soo Jin, you can't die, alright? Soo Jin!

99
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,290
Guardian, stay here.

100
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,750
Soo Jin! Oh, Soo Jin! What happened to our Soo Jin?

101
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,340
She went into the operating room just a little while ago.

102
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,030
Huh? How badly is she hurt?!

103
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,540
She is unconscious.

104
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,170
I can't take this, Honey.

105
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,770
My poor Soo Jin!

106
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,600
It's alright, she'll be fine.

107
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,690
Mother-in-law, what do you mean she got into an accident? What's going on?!

108
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,070
Son-in-law Park, our Soo Jin just got into a hit-and-run accident!

109
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,670
She came by the house earlier but didn't even come inside.

110
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:32,170
She was on the way to meet him, and this is what happened!

111
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,500
You little bastard! You've been following Soo Jin around all your life

112
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,900
and you finally end up causing this disaster, little punk!

113
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,840
Bring Soo Jin back. I'm telling you to bring her back!

114
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,390
But why did Soo Jin go to meet you anyway?

115
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,400
Soo Jin called me.

116
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,250
But as soon as we met up, that happened right in front of my eyes.

117
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,600
Were you able to catch the hit-and-run criminal?

118
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,140
No.

119
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,820
What a bad punk! How dare this punk hit a person and just run away?!

120
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,320
That punk needs to be beaten to death!

121
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,290
Our poor Soo Jin, what are we going to do about her?!

122
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,510
Why isn't Soo Jin answering my call?

123
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,240
It looked like she really needed to tell me something when she came by earlier.

124
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,910
Jin Sook! Jin Sook!

125
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,670
Hey Seok Tae, what's wrong? What's the matter?

126
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,740
Soo Jin got into a hit-and-run accident.

127
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,160
What?!

128
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,070
We treated the physical injury, but the problem is that her consciousness isn't returning.

129
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,780
Let's watch over the progress of result after the surgery for now.

130
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,090
We can get going now.

131
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:38,790
Honey, what are we going to do about our poor Soo Jin? What are we going to do, Honey?!

132
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,440
Our Soo Jin will get up soon. I'm telling you that she will.

133
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,040
Honey, don't worry about her not getting up for now.

134
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,710
Let's be positive about this.

135
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:11,180
 Soo Jin, so why did you have to doubt me? 

136
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,480
 You should've trusted me when I told you I was not. 

137
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,350
Hey Pil!

138
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,510
How's Soo Jin doing? I heard that they already finished the surgery.

139
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,170
But she is still unconscious.

140
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,500
Our poor Soo Jin.

141
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,990
What kind of crap is this?

142
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,150
But why did you go to meet Soo Jin anyway?

143
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,270
Soo Jin called me to help her.

144
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,020
Why? For what?

145
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,230
I'm not sure, but it felt very urgent.

146
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:51,520
Soo Jin came to see me earlier, and her facial expression looked very dark.

147
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,870
I should've listened to her then.

148
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,580
This accident wouldn't have happened if I had held her.

149
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,740
I feel like it's all my fault.

150
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,800
It's not your fault. Don't think like that.

151
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,910
All of you are here.

152
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,520
Jae Hyeon, you are in quite a bit of shock, right?

153
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,660
I still can't believe it.

154
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,530
I was going to leave for England with Soo Jin tomorrow. How could Soo Jin go through this?

155
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,260
Jae Hyeon, Soo Jin will regain her consciousness soon.

156
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,200
Let's think positively about this.

157
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,480
Yes. We should.

158
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,270
Soo Jin needs her rest right now so you can come  inside in a little  bit.

159
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,510
Hey, Pil! Where are you going?!

160
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,850
What's wrong with him?

161
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,250
Hey kids, we should stop him before he does something reckless.

162
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,730
We should go too. Let's all go now.

163
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:03,260
♫  I know. I said perhaps I should let you go  ♫

164
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,920
Please, manhole!

165
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,330
Please take me to wherever I want to go!

166
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,230
♫  It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.  ♫

167
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:22,360
I have to go save Soo Jin right now! Please!

168
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,520
Take me to the time before the accident happened! Please!

169
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,130
♫  Unconsciously I will be hanging around you  ♫

170
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:41,630
♫  With you, I guess I was too young then  ♫

171
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:51,750
♫  If you, if only you  ♫

172
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,480
Why am I not summoned?

173
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,200
Please operate already! Please!

174
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,660
♫  How would it feel if I hugged you  ♫

175
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,440
Hey Pil!  Hey! Hey!

176
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,370
What are you doing? Seriously! Stop it.

177
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,840
Hey, what are you doing right now!?

178
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:16,130
Soo Jin is in that state but there is nothing I can do for her.

179
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:21,100
Soo Jin is on the brink of death in front of my eyes, but I can't be any help to her.

180
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,080
We are in the same boat too! You're not the only one who's feeling frustrated here!

181
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,620
Yes.  It would be better to catch the hit-and-run culprit instead of doing this.

182
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:32,220
What will catching him do?  Even if we do that, it won't get Soo Jin up.

183
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,540
Seok Tae, I won't be able to live if something bad happens to Soo Jin.

184
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,260
So please open this manhole for me.

185
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,490
Seok Tae.

186
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,340
Please allow me to save Soo Jin.

187
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,020
I beg you, Seok Tae.

188
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,610
I beg of you.

189
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,190
Hey, wait a minute here. Open up this manhole?

190
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,340
To save Soo Jin... What does this even mean?

191
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,790
I really beg of you.

192
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,540
What are we going to do about our poor Soo Jin?

193
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,310
I have to save my Soo Jin.

194
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,330
Seok Tae, please. What are we going to do about our Soo Jin?

195
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,750
Hello, Mr. Pharmacist. What brings you here?

196
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,900
You two are working so hard.

197
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,640
Did you get a grasp of who the hit-and-run culprit is?

198
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,070
The place where the incident occurred is too secluded, so there aren't a lot of CCTV out there.

199
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:52,670
We have been looking at the CCTV in other places from the same time frame but the traffic there is rather heavy.

200
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:55,950
So it's tough to find the hit-and-run car.

201
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,030
Is that right?

202
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,930
This particular incident has been forwarded to the police station, so I think we might have to wait for their investigation process.

203
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,390
We're also looking for an eyewitness, and we will give you a call as soon as we find one.

204
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,720
So don't worry too much. But ...

205
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,790
How's your wife doing by the way?

206
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,930
Not yet...

207
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,800
Oh, no it's okay. It's the thought that counts.

208
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,940
- Keep up the good work, Officers. 
 - Yes.

209
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,510
♫  In case you are serious  ♫

210
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:10,280
I told you that nothing would ever happen to you, yet...

211
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,100
♫  I wanted to ask you again  ♫

212
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,100
I should've been the one that got hit by the car instead of you.

213
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,680
♫  Because it comforts my heart  ♫

214
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,450
I should've saved you.

215
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,650
♫  Which hasn't opened up  ♫

216
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,420
♫  Although I'm scared and it's growing  ♫

217
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:35,230
Soo Jin, you can get angry at me.

218
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,760
You don't even have to consider me as your friend.

219
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,330
I mean, it's okay for you to say that you don't want to see me ever again.

220
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,540
All I want you to do is get up.

221
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,070
I beg of you.

222
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:57,050
♫  I want to entrust to you  ♫

223
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,190
What are you doing here?!

224
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:04,350
♫  Up to now, I've been keeping my heart shut  ♫

225
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,890
I came here to see how Soo Jin is doing.

226
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,720
It would be great if you don't come here from now on.

227
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,700
Soo Jin has me to be there for her now.

228
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,790
♫  Like a fool  ♫

229
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:32,450
Soo Jin called me last night and asked me to help her.

230
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,710
Is there anything that you're aware of?

231
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,090
How should I know that when you were the one she called?!

232
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,850
If Soo Jin called me to ask for help,

233
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,300
don't you think it's normal for the husband to know what's going on?

234
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:51,090
So are you picking on me  for not doing my job well as her  husband?!

235
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:56,940
In that urgent situation, Soo Jin asked me for help instead of you, her husband.

236
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,820
I find that rather strange.

237
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,630
I'm also curious about what kind of help she wanted from you when she called.

238
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,760
You should ask Soo Jin yourself when she wakes up.

239
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,800
Please get out.

240
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:12,060
 Seok Tae, I won't be able to live if something bad happens to Soo Jin. 

241
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,800
 So please open this manhole for me. 

242
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,190
 Seok Tae. 

243
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,950
 Please allow me to save Soo Jin. 

244
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,730
 I beg you, Seok Tae. 

245
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,380
 I beg of you. 

246
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,760
Chief, excuse me.  I have something to tell you.

247
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,030
What is it?

248
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:52,770
I wanted to tell you about the manhole in the rest park that we blocked three months ago.

249
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,700
So I was wondering if we can do some reconstruction.

250
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,000
What are you talking about all of a sudden?  Why, what's going on?

251
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:05,730
Well that is... I got civil complaints that they want the manhole to be dug up again.

252
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,930
So I was wondering if we can do some reconstruction.

253
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:11,400
The last time they wanted the manhole to be blocked, saying weird sounds were heard and ghosts were coming out of there.

254
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,100
And now they want it to be dug up again? For goodness sake.

255
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,060
I know, right?

256
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,570
Here.

257
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,150
So Seok Tae, so your chief said no?

258
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,230
Yeah, he said no.

259
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,870
What are we going to do about Pil?

260
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,820
He thinks the only way he can save her is to go through that manhole.

261
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,670
It's unbelievable  enough to agonize ourselves over this nonsensical thing.

262
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,690
But if Pil can really save Soo Jin by getting on that manhole,

263
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,050
then I'm even willing to dig up that hole for him.

264
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,070
You know, people hear out dead people's wishes,

265
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,020
so why shouldn't I do it for a living friend?

266
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,230
- Jin Sook, let's dig up the manhole ourselves. 
 - What?

267
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:03,300
I know this sounds crazy, but there's nothing we can do for Soo Jin right now, right?

268
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:08,800
When people desire something earnestly, they go pray at a temple or a church.

269
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,630
So let's pretend that we are crazy and just go for it.

270
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,640
Poor Soo Jin.

271
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,030
I had no idea that this was going on.

272
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,130
You should've contacted me.

273
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,030
I thought that you were no longer interested in our family affairs.

274
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:02,630
What kind of nonsense are you spewing? I'm part of the family too.

275
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,890
I heard that you got into an accident too.

276
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,450
- Are you alright? 
 - It doesn't look obvious to you?

277
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,030
It's been a while since I've been okay.

278
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,700
Everyone should live their lives happily.

279
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,660
Why does this kind of thing keep happening?

280
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:27,360
Hey, I heard that you bought juice cups to help with Jeong Ae's business.

281
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,330
Yeah.

282
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,470
Just because you bought a few juice cups from her,

283
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:37,170
you think what you did to Jeong Ae will automatically be forgiven?

284
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,710
I didn't do it to be forgiven.

285
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,970
What's the big deal about buying a few juice cups anyway?

286
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,710
Hey, let me ask you something.

287
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,160
Why did you abandon Jeong Ae?

288
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,400
It's because I felt like Jeong Ae would be unhappy for being with me.

289
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,520
As long as I'm my mother's son,

290
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,480
as long as I can't cut ties with the moral law of family relationship,

291
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,690
I realized that I wouldn't be able to make Jeong Ae happy like that.

292
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,860
That's just an excuse.

293
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,730
Your feelings for Jeong Ae is only that big.

294
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:17,930
You just ran away because you were scared.

295
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,180
That could be  it. You might be right.

296
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,760
If you were me, you would've probably been there for her till the very end.

297
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,250
I knew it for a very long time that you love and care for Jeong Ae more than I do.

298
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,360
I knew that Jeong Ae would be happier with you.

299
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,570
I don't think I will be able to make Jeong Ae happy in this life.

300
00:31:54,150 --> 00:32:00,170
So please make sure to make  Jeong Ae happy in my stead, okay?

301
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:06,840
♫  On a bridge in an unfamiliar city  ♫

302
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,920
♫  Both you and I will whisper this love  ♫

303
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,130
♫  Sweetly kiss, baby. We will share together  ♫

304
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,240
Jae Hyeon, you're here.

305
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,290
Jeong Ae didn't come here?

306
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,360
No, she didn't come.

307
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,280
You are really going through a difficult time right now.

308
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,550
It's nothing. This is what I'm supposed to do.

309
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,560
Jae Hyeon, I will stay here and take care of her.

310
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,100
You should go home and get some rest then come back.

311
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,160
Okay, thank you. Let me go home and get changed, then I will be right back.

312
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,110
You do that.

313
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,080
Soo Jin, I will be right back, okay?

314
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,420
Please take care of her for a little bit.

315
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,040
Hey, is it heavy?

316
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,070
I'm fine. It's as light as feathers, Jin Sook.

317
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,270
I'm so happy that I feel like a real woman now. Let's hurry up and go.

318
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,010
We're almost there, so please stop prodding, Jin Sook.

319
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,560
How many bowls of rice did you have earlier?

320
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,900
Hey, Pil! Are you still here doing this?

321
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,170
What brings you two over here? Aren't you guys supposed to be working right now?

322
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,790
Hey, we came here to help you do this crazy work.

323
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,070
Alright!

324
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,830
What is this?

325
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,760
I'm not helping you because I believe in what you said about you time traveling.

326
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,990
I'm doing this for you because I was so moved by how you want to save Soo Jin so badly, got it?

327
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,270
I came here prepared to be fired just do this for you.

328
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,970
He's right!

329
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:13,320
Hey, move away. Go over that way.

330
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,090
Man, how am I supposed to dig this up?

331
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,870
Shall we get started?

332
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:20,060
Hey, hey! Hurry, over here!

333
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,960
Why didn't answer my calls?!

334
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,740
Hyung!

335
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,250
I have something important to tell you.

336
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,330
- What is it? 
- Come this way.

337
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,970
What are you doing?

338
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,160
No, it's nothing. Hurry up and come over here.

339
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,780
What the heck? Hey Hyung, we have to dig this!

340
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,400
What the heck?!

341
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,100
Come over here.

342
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,960
What is it that you need to tell me?

343
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,290
I don't think this is something I should be saying in a situation like this...

344
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,530
I don't know if I should say this or not.

345
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,730
What is it?

346
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:57,010
Hey, you have to listen to me without getting too worked up.

347
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,070
I told you that the assault criminal had a scar on his wrist, right?

348
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,820
Yep.

349
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,830
Seriously, this is driving me crazy!

350
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,860
What is it, Hyung?

351
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,020
I accidentally got to  see Jae Hyeon's wrist today.

352
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,420
And he had that same scar as that criminal.

353
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,090
Really?

354
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,100
Isn't it true that every person has at least one scar on them,  right?

355
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:36,060
But of all places, why does he have the same scar on his left wrist?

356
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
It can't be, right?

357
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,750
But there is too much evidences for that.

358
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,100
A piece of that broken keychain. The scar on his wrist.

359
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,900
How can there be so many coincidences that overlap?

360
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,830
That's true but...

361
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,280
He is the culprit behind this. I am sure of it.

362
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,270
Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?

363
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,810
A bastard like that is by Soo Jin's side right now.

364
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,990
How can I just stand by idly?

365
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,560
Thanks, Hyung.

366
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,820
Maybe I shouldn't have told him.

367
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,360
Is he going to stir up trouble again?

368
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,270
What do you want now?!

369
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:20,760
You need to have a talk with me. Follow me.

370
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,060
What are you doing?!

371
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,060
You shameless bastard!

372
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,940
How dare you stick around by Soo Jin after doing all that?

373
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,900
What the heck are you talking about?!

374
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,340
The victim from the assault crime has testified that he saw that scar you have on your wrist.

375
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,010
Who said that? Did Yang Goo Gil tell you that?

376
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,460
Now all the  friends are conspiring against me to frame me as the criminal.

377
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,110
We just need to verify that.

378
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,160
I'm asking, what are you doing?!

379
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,820
What the heck happened here?

380
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,970
I got a hurt a little earlier, that's all. What's the problem?

381
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,100
Is getting a hurt a problem now?

382
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,850
You messed with it because you knew that Hyung Goo Gil saw your scar, right?

383
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:21,130
I have nothing to say to you.

384
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:27,060
I don't want to be played by your nonsense any longer, so think whatever you want to.

385
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,090
If you hit me again,

386
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,230
then you will go through more than just getting temporarily suspended.

387
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:39,530
Think carefully before you act.

388
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,800
You are a public servant.

389
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,820
You are talking about this type of thing when Soo Jin is on the brink of death right now.

390
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,860
You are so pathetic.

391
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,790
I understand why Soo Jin doesn't want to see you ever again now.

392
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,190
As a cop, you should bring valid evidence just like any other policeman.

393
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,360
The evidence that you're talking about

394
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,170
I will bring it and shove it in front of your face for you, so you just wait.

395
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:21,000
I will make sure to reveal your true identity.

396
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,270
Hey, Officer Bong, you are not allowed here.

397
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:38,440
There's no toilet paper in the bathroom—

398
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,100
Hey Officer Bong, what are you doing here?

399
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,800
Did you forget about what the Chief said?!  Did you forget about him telling you not to come to the patrol office until your suspension is over?!

400
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,370
Sir, we still have the CCTV video clip of the suspect for that assault incident, right?

401
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,660
Hey, Officer Bong!

402
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:56,340
Sir, I really need to catch that punk.

403
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,630
We are both policemen here. Are you the only policeman here in this office?

404
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,800
- Go wait at home. 
 - Sir!

405
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,240
Seriously, this bastard.

406
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,330
Please help me, Sir.

407
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:13,000
Seriously, you're making me feel weak.

408
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,000
 This bastard is that punk for sure. 

409
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,470
 Evidence. 

410
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,000
 I have to find the evidence that this punk is Park Jae Hyeon. 

411
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:53,260
I don't think the drill will work!

412
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,300
Why isn't anybody coming already?

413
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,040
Hey kids!

414
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,590
What the heck? Oh Dal Soo?!

415
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,230
Hyung, what brings you here?

416
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,830
I heard that you needed some help. It's been a long time.

417
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,320
Forget about that. But anyway, what are you guys all doing here?

418
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,560
Can't you tell that we are doing some drill work here?

419
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,540
- We are helping Pil's wish come true right now. 
 - What wish?

420
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,130
Time traveling?

421
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,800
Are you doing this because of what Pil told you?

422
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,120
You actually believe what Pil told you?

423
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,950
My goodness gracious.

424
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:44,230
We don't believe it but we're trying to, you idiot!

425
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:49,580
What would we know? We are willing to do anything if Soo Jin can get up again.

426
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,290
Hey Seok Tae, do you think this drill is enough?

427
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:56,330
Using this method to dig will take us about ten years.

428
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,550
Then what else can we do?

429
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,890
Hey, Dal Soo.

430
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,500
Honey. Honey!

431
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,540
Soo Jin just moved her fingers.

432
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,610
What are you talking about?

433
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,470
Soo Jin. Soo Jin.

434
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,860
Are you awake now?

435
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,540
Son-in-law Park, Soo Jin is awake now. She's finally awake!

436
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,040
Soo Jin, are you awake now?

437
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,750
Can you recognize me?

438
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,890
Soo Jin, can you recognize us?

439
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,500
But... where is this place?

440
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,480
Soo Jin, do you remember that you got into an accident?

441
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,340
A-accident?

442
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,900
No, I don't remember...

443
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,300
Alright, as long as you remember us, that's fine with me.

444
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,130
- Honey, go get the doctor. 
 - Yes, dear.

445
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,280
I'm glad that her senses have returned. I think you can go take it easy now.

446
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,960
All you need to do is make sure and watch that the operated spot recovers properly.

447
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,920
But it seemed like Soo Jin couldn't remember what happened during the accident.

448
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,480
Could it be that there could be other problems?

449
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,250
Occasionally, after a traffic accident, short term memory loss happens due to shock.

450
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:32,920
But a lot of the times the memory gradually comes back, so you don't have to be so worried about that.

451
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,190
Oh, is that right? I'm relieved.

452
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,790
Don't continuously arouse the lost memory,

453
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:41,830
and it's absolutely necessary to help her to become stable.

454
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,710
Yes, sir.

455
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,530
 Pil! 

456
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:45,280
Soo Jin.

457
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,270
Are you okay? Has your memory returned?

458
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,780
What about Mom and Dad?

459
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,410
I sent them away so they could get something to eat.

460
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,290
They haven't had anything to eat all day.

461
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:09,860
Oh, you did well.

462
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,750
But Soo Jin...

463
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:20,890
You don't remember anything that happened during the accident?

464
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,730
Yeah.

465
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,720
I don't remember.

466
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,030
Then what do you remember?

467
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:43,570
The thing about us planning a trip to England.

468
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,360
And...

469
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:55,100
Your suit in which I discovered some plane tickets.

470
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:01,720
Then you don't remember anything that happened after that?

471
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,500
Yeah...

472
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:10,750
Jae Hyeon, what in the world happened to me?

473
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:14,310
It's nothing. You don't really need to know.

474
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:16,950
Let's just erase all the bad memories.

475
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,390
Just get some good rest for now.

476
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:28,140
Okay, I will. Jae Hyeon, I need to get some sleep now.

477
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,330
I'm so sleepy.

478
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:33,060
Alright, get some sleep.

479
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,420
 That evidence that you're talking about 

480
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:58,180
 I will bring it and shove it in front of your face for you, so you just wait. 

481
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,690
 I will make sure to reveal your true identity. 

482
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:10,600
Patient! You can't be moving around right now. You have to go back to your room and lay back down.

483
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,410
What are you going to do when you just got your surgery?

484
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:19,520
Excuse me, I'm really sorry, but can I please use your phone?

485
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,120
This is urgent. This is really urgent.

486
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,090
- Hello? 
 - Pil.

487
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:38,270
Pil.

488
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,840
- Is this Soo Jin? 
 - Yeah.

489
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,370
I just got up.

490
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:47,440
I'm secretly making a call to you right now.

491
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,610
Please hurry up and come over here. I have something to tell you.

492
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:56,100
- Alright, I will go to your hospital ward right away. 
 - No, don't.

493
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,610
Just meet me in front of the hospital instead.

494
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,730
Okay, alright.

495
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,510
Hurry up and change already.

496
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,830
Ah, Soo—

497
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,030
Why is she out here?

498
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:05,320
Soo Jin.

499
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,680
Soo Jin, what's the matter with you?

500
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,050
Soo Jin! Kang Soo Jin!

501
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:11,630
   

502
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:13,720
Soo Jin!

503
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,050
Be careful.

504
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,680
Goo Gil, are you done yet? Hurry! People will start making complaints.

505
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,250
I got it.

506
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:07,680
When did Goo Gil learn how to do this?

507
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,560
Maybe he learned it in the army?

508
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,270
He sure has a lot of talents, don't you think?

509
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,620
Hey! Kang Soo Jin!

510
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:39,020
Don't come near me.

511
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:45,820
You... So you remember everything.

512
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:53,180
What happened before the accident, you remember it all.

513
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:59,260
Don't come any closer. Go away, Jae Hyeon.

514
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:05,220
But... why did you lie?

515
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,690
Why?!

516
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,820
I'll explain everything.

517
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,260
You're definitely mistaken about something.

518
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:25,680
Let us talk about it. Okay?

519
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:30,710
Soo Jin.

520
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:37,440
That's right. I remember everything.

521
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:50,740
Hitting me with the car, that was also your doing.

522
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:56,000
So go away.

523
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,950
I'm telling you to go away.

524
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,740
Don't come closer!

525
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,550
Soo Jin!

526
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:08,680
Pil.

527
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:16,940
Soo Jin, come here. Come to me.

528
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:30,990
We did it!

529
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:32,210
Yay!

530
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:34,050
It's done.

531
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,870
Hyung, it's finished. Good work.

532
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,870
Success!

533
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:44,120
Wait. What do we need to do after getting the the lid open?

534
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:47,850
Well...

535
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,680
- I don't know. Pil didn't tell me what's next. 
 - What?

536
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,580
Don't come any closer.

537
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,150
Let go of my neck!

538
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:02,690
Let her go while I'm still calm. Let Soo Jin go!

539
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:05,980
This is all because of you.

540
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,350
It wouldn't have come this far, if it weren't for you.

541
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:11,870
Get lost right now.

542
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:15,720
If you don't want to see something horrible happen to Soo Jin because of you.

543
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,940
I told you that I'll reveal who you are, didn't I?

544
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:23,550
So no matter what you do, it's over. So give it up.

545
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:28,270
Is that so? It's all over now?

546
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:32,720
Then, let's end this together.

547
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:39,070
Are you saying we've been digging this up together without knowing what's next?

548
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,820
You must know something.

549
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:45,210
I don't know either. I was asked to open this up but not what to do with it.

550
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:48,620
- Should I call him? 
 - Quickly call him up.

551
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,430
What the-

552
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:01,150
What is this?

553
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,420
Soo Jin!

554
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,030
Don't come closer.

555
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:22,680
If you come any closer, I'll jump from here.

556
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:27,160
No, Soo Jin. It's dangerous. Hurry up and come on down.

557
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:37,370
Don't come closer.

558
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,180
Don't come-

559
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:52,930
Did you see that?

560
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:55,120
What was it?

561
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,880
W-w-what is that?

562
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,350
Who saw that?

563
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:24,420
Hyung, did you see that?

564
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:29,320
What did we just see?

565
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:33,590
This is weird.

566
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,730
 Where is this? 

567
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:01,790
 What's this? I definitely went through the manhole, but— 

568
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,260
Soo Jin!

569
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:19,760


570
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:28,520
♫  With you, I guess I was too young then  ♫

571
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:36,040
♫  If you, if only you  ♫
