00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,170
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,210
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,110
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,390
Ha Neul.
How did you know I was here?

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,060
Don't tell me you came to see her
at this hour.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,060
Young Chae went to her place.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,060
Her place?

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,860
She's at our Yangpyeong villa.
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,570
No, I mean...

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,900
she is at her own place.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,470
Her own...

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,470
Right. That's my boy.

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,440
We must call
that girl Young Chae now.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,440
We just have to drill that
into our heads.

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,350
Goodness, I'm running on fumes.
Let's go inside and talk.

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,380
Actually...

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,580
There's something more pressing.

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,720
- What?
- You must handle this yourself.

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,960
Why? Is there another fire
to put out?

20
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,360
I'll explain on the way.
Let's go now.

21
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,430
Go where?

22
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,130
(Episode 22)

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,200
(The Crown Capital)

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,300
You said Young Chae was here.

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,110
I just got to the Yangpyeong Villa.

26
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,910
She went to the Villa.

27
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,010
That girl has completely
lost her mind.

28
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,780
Did she really tell Han Hye Ra
that she's Joo Young Chae?

29
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,250
It's not entirely
Young Chae's fault.

30
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,580
Then whose fault is it?

31
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,520
She fell for that loser
Park Kyung Shin...

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,020
and gave up everything for him.

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,920
She's the one
who handed it all over herself!

34
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,630
You're right, Young Chae started it.

35
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,130
She was wrong to use
her friend Cha Jung Won,

36
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,300
and try to steal her talent. But...

37
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,730
But what?

38
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,200
Even when she fails you,
you have to support her...

39
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,710
- She's pathetic.
- But she's still your daughter.

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,080
Is that all she is? Pathetic?

41
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,910
She lost to Cha Jung Won.

42
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,420
My daughter.

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,790
To see that worthless girl
join the Kunhyang Family...

44
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Do you think I'm enjoying this?

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,730
She's not upset
that she lost her place...

46
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,760
as Kunhyang's daughter-in-law.

47
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,730
She feels like you and I
abandoned her.

48
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,970
She's so weak.

49
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,270
Thinking that way is
what makes her weak.

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,140
I told her over and over
to be patient for a little while,

51
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,740
but she couldn't
and just blew it up? Why?

52
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,010
If she's patient for a little while,

53
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,780
do you plan on putting Young Chae
back in her rightful place?

54
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,950
Of course. She's my daughter.

55
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,450
But only when she's worthy
of being my daughter,

56
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,260
can she enjoy everything
that comes with that title.

57
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,030
And what does it take to be worthy?

58
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,830
To be the daughter
you want her to be?

59
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,230
- Stronger, more vicious, more...
- More!

60
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,740
Does Young Chae have to become
more evil?

61
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,840
Whatever it takes
for her to survive.

62
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,610
If she can have more, enjoy more,
and climb higher,

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
then whatever it takes.

64
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,000
That's enough.

65
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,000
I get it now.

66
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,540
Stop it, Mom.

67
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,180
Hey!

68
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,410
Tell everyone who you really are!
I can't take it anymore!

69
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,690
I hate you even more than Mom.

70
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,630
How can you defend Jung Won...

71
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,930
who stole your sister's life?

72
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,370
I told you, she didn't steal it.

73
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,640
You gave it away yourself,
like an idiot.

74
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,070
You've made a mess so tangled
it can't be undone.

75
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,410
Cha Jung Won,
this is all your fault.

76
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,910
I'm not letting it end like this.

77
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,020
I will take back everything
that was stolen from me.

78
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,820
No.

79
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,120
Cha Jung Won...

80
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,520
You're going to end up
in the gutter.

81
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,950
Eat this later if you get hungry.

82
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,790
My grandma used to say,
"Those who seek to live shall die,"

83
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,030
"but those
who are ready to die shall live."

84
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,330
Chef, are you psychic?

85
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,400
"Ready to die?"

86
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,610
How ridiculous.

87
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,210
I'm going to survive,
no matter what!

88
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
What did you say?

89
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,020
You're saying
you're not marrying Joo Ha Neul?

90
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,390
Goodness.
Is something wrong with my ears?

91
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,700
I must be hearing things.

92
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,600
You came after so long,
slept like a baby,

93
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,940
ate a delicious meal,
and now you're spouting nonsense?

94
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,370
Did you have a fight
with Mr. Hiccups?

95
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
That's enough.

96
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,610
Why are you dropping
a bombshell on us now?

97
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
I was wrong.

98
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,690
It was all a lie.

99
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,050
What?

100
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,060
What's gotten into her?

101
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,620
This seems fine, though.

102
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,860
What lie?

103
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,060
Cat got your tongue?

104
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,470
CEO Joo and I never dated,

105
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,540
let alone got engaged.

106
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,910
Then why did CEO Joo
buy me those shoes?

107
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,510
Why did he treat me
like his father-in-law?

108
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,420
I asked him to lie for me.

109
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,690
Why would you do a thing like that?

110
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,620
You really approved of CEO Joo.

111
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,730
You just assumed he was going to be
your son-in-law,

112
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,960
so I couldn't bring myself
to correct you.

113
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,660
And that made you lie?

114
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,330
And what does that make CEO Joo?

115
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,000
What does that make us
for falling for your lie?

116
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,770
Are we a joke to you?

117
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,950
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. I'm fine.

118
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,550
While you're at it, why don't you
come clean about everything?

119
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,420
That you're marrying some rich heir
who's better than Mr. Hiccups.

120
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Stop it.

121
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,030
I can't even think straight now.
Who could it be this early?

122
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,100
- It's been a long time.
- What are you doing here?

123
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,340
If you have a moment,

124
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,640
I'd like to speak with you.

125
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,610
I have nothing to say to you.

126
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,150
Who was that?
Why turn someone away at the door?

127
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,290
He looks familiar.

128
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,340
- You have Cha Ki Beom's number?
- Yes, Chairman.

129
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,140
Tell him I'll be waiting
at the cafe next door.

130
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,880
Who was that?

131
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,420
You don't need to know.

132
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,230
Jung Won,

133
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,660
we'll talk more about this later.

134
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,470
What is it?

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,170
I need to ask you a favor.

136
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,780
So, Chairman Gong has five villas
to her name?

137
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,880
Yes. The most secluded ones are...

138
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,150
- Namyangju and Yangpyeong.
- Have you sent people there?

139
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,820
What's the hold-up?

140
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,030
I'm investigating through faster
and more discreet channels.

141
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,530
I'll be expecting results.

142
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,560
Ma'am, there's one more thing.

143
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,470
It appears Chairman Jin is
at Cha Ki Beom's residence now.

144
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,350
Because of Cha Jung Won,

145
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,650
he went to see Cha Ki Beom?

146
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,790
In person?

147
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,840
Ha Neul?

148
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,540
You even know the passcode?

149
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,450
What are you doing here?

150
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,550
What are you doing here?
Did you know Noh Min Gu...

151
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,650
would be here?

152
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,290
It's a long story.

153
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,530
You're just getting here now?

154
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,630
Chairman Gong almost caught me.
I thought I was a goner!

155
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,930
I stopped her
before she could get to you.

156
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,770
No wonder.

157
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,070
But now,

158
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,040
I feel like I'm going to be beaten
to death or die from exhaustion.

159
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,410
Come on, you need to help me out.

160
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,080
Shut your mouth.

161
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,750
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

162
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,350
Please leave a message
after the tone.

163
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,050
Where's Young Chae?

164
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,620
Where has she been all night?
Why won't she answer her phone?

165
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,060
Wait, Young Chae's
at Chairman Gong's?

166
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,760
Noh Min Gu barged in last night,
and it really spooked her.

167
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,370
Why would she call you and not me?

168
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,170
She probably only wanted to show
her best side to her fiance.

169
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,940
But that bastard Noh Min Gu,
what was he doing here?

170
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,650
Didn't he work with Cha Jung Won
to have Park Kyung Shin locked up?

171
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,110
That's right.

172
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,620
But...

173
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,380
he says he escaped.

174
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,250
From where?

175
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,020
He won't say.

176
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,360
- Darn that bastard!
- Calm down.

177
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,530
That bastard. I've tried all night
but he won't talk.

178
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,870
If he helped kidnap Park Kyung Shin,
we should turn him in to the police.

179
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,740
You know we can't involve
the police.

180
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,640
A scandal about Park Kyung Shin's
kidnapping right before the wedding?

181
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,540
So we're just going to let
that bastard walk?

182
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,410
I plan to send him abroad.
Young Chae asked me to.

183
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,580
If anyone deals with him,
it'll be me.

184
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,750
Young Chae is my woman.

185
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,200
It's been a long time.

186
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,370
- It's been well over 20 years.
- Just get to the point.

187
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,100
The sight of your face
makes me sick.

188
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,470
You, me, and Hye Ra.

189
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,010
No. I'm not here
to discuss Young Sun...

190
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
Shut up!

191
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,580
How dare you even say her name!

192
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,630
Cha Jung Won.

193
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,360
Do you know
what your daughter is doing?

194
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
What's that supposed to mean?

195
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,800
While completely hiding the fact
that she's your daughter,

196
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,900
she's been impersonating
Joo Young Chae...

197
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,870
who's about to be
my daughter-in-law,

198
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,310
Joo Young Chae?

199
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,750
You mean her
ridiculously rich friend?

200
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,050
I heard they were friends
back in high school.

201
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,250
I believe that's correct.

202
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,860
But that's not all.

203
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,020
She conspired with
an ex-boyfriend...

204
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,130
and kidnapped a model named
Park Kyung Shin.

205
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,730
What? Am I hearing things?

206
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,910
Shall we go, Ms. Jo Mi Hyang?

207
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,620
My apologies, but I won't be able
to escort you home.

208
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,420
Wait, hold on!

209
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,060
Can we... I mean,

210
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,030
could we speak for a moment?

211
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,000
My Jung Won and her rich friend,
that Joo Young Chae, whatever.

212
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,840
No, that little...

213
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,240
No. That she pretended to be...

214
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,950
Is it true, what he said...

215
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,080
about Jung Won
impersonating her friend?

216
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,820
I mean... Is it true?

217
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,690
And what's all this
about kidnapping a boyfriend?

218
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,590
What's that about?

219
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,030
Please, you can speak freely.

220
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,460
What's with that guy?

221
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,300
He's not telling me
a single thing that matters.

222
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,940
Why would my Jung Won ever do
something like that?

223
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,270
Forget it!

224
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,690
My Jung Won impersonated
her rich friend?

225
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,320
What, kidnapping?

226
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,520
Say something that makes sense
if you want me to listen.

227
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,530
You put her up to it, didn't you?

228
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,730
- What?
- Like father, like daughter.

229
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,870
Don't you dare insult
my daughter again!

230
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,570
This is why you don't treat lowlifes
with any respect.

231
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,910
What?

232
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,280
You put Jo Mi Hyang's daughter on
your family register, didn't you?

233
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,780
I guess people become
similar over time.

234
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,790
Does that mean Cha Jung Won...

235
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,020
has a murderer's blood
in her veins too?

236
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,830
Jin Tae Seok, it was you.

237
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,130
You framed me
for murder, didn't you?

238
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,930
All so you could have
Han Young Sun for yourself!

239
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,700
- I had fun.
- You did?

240
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,920
Do you like your teddy bear?

241
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,160
Have you ever done this before?

242
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,830
Hold on tight.

243
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,480
Dad!

244
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,820
Are you okay, Su A?
Are you hurt anywhere?

245
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,950
It's okay. Come here.

246
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,730
What kind of driving was that?

247
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,200
Get out of the car!

248
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,870
Get out now!

249
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,800
I said, get out!

250
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,470
- All this noise.
- What's this guy's problem?

251
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,070
Just my luck.

252
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,580
I apologize for the disturbance.

253
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,660
- This should be enough, right?
- You think money solves everything?

254
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,660
You almost hit my daughter!

255
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,860
Not enough for you?

256
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,060
Here.

257
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,170
Who do you think I am, you punk!

258
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,170
- Dad.
- Darn it.

259
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,410
I treat you like a human once,
and you think we're equals.

260
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,540
Unbelievable.

261
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,010
You, give me a proper apology.

262
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,310
And not by throwing
your money around.

263
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,680
Hey, this guy's completely lost it.

264
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,650
Maybe you need a beating.
You son of a gun!

265
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,120
You pull one more stunt,
and I'm not holding back.

266
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,060
Mr. Joo.

267
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,490
Let's get going.

268
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,770
Where have I seen that guy before?

269
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,100
- Gosh, darn it.
- Dad!

270
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,670
Oh, Su A.

271
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,880
She's living with a lowlife
like him?

272
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,860
Kunhyang Group.

273
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,330
CEO Jin Tae Seok.

274
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,340
Why would a big shot like you...

275
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,540
come all the way here to visit me?

276
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,810
- Han Young Sun...
- You mean Su A's mother?

277
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,380
Han Young Sun will no longer be
Su A's mother,

278
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,350
and she won't be living with you
anymore either.

279
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,320
Han Young Sun has decided
to be my woman.

280
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,890
What the heck are you talking about?

281
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,960
Since when is my wife your woman?

282
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,390
Han Young Sun was always my woman
to begin with.

283
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,900
You've leeched off me long enough.

284
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,500
So just serve your time quietly
and disappear.

285
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,140
And take Jo Mi Hyang with you.

286
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,910
Leeched off you?

287
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,150
Did you give money to Jo Mi Hyang?

288
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,050
Unless you want to lose
your daughter Su A, as well,

289
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,920
you'd be wise to listen to me.

290
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,130
Don't you ever come near
my house again.

291
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,840
And keep my daughter Jung Won's name
out of your mouth.

292
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,310
Why don't you let go so we can talk?

293
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,010
And tell Han Young Sun
to stop coming around!

294
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,860
I'm impersonating Joo Young Chae?

295
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,060
And what's all this
about a kidnapper?

296
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,800
I was so shocked,
I thought I was going to pass out.

297
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,470
They say I kidnapped Kyung Shin?

298
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,700
Right! Park Kyung Shin was the name.

299
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,040
So when the Chairman mentioned
Cha Jung Won,

300
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,210
did he actually mean Joo Young Chae?

301
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,580
Honey!

302
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,980
- Did you two have a fight?
- Get inside.

303
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,490
Just you, Jung Won.

304
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,230
I want a straight answer.

305
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,270
The name of the friend you're living
with now is Joo Young Chae?

306
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,670
It's Joo Young Chae's house,
that's right.

307
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,540
But I'm not living with her.

308
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,580
If you're not living together,
then where is she?

309
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,310
Paris.

310
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,880
She took off with a guy.

311
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,220
So you've been going around
pretending to be her?

312
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,290
That's ridiculous.

313
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,130
Why would our Jung Won do
something so stupid?

314
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,390
Why can't you answer me?

315
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,400
Just once.

316
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,570
So she did do it.

317
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,370
It was Young Chae's idea of a joke.

318
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,670
To her friends who know her
as Victoria Shin,

319
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,170
the ones who studied abroad,

320
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,680
she said my name was Joo Young Chae.

321
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,080
Why would she pull such a stunt?

322
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,220
Because I'm so pathetic
and insignificant.

323
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,330
I never blatantly pretended
to be her.

324
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,060
It's just that other people...

325
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,200
mistook me for her
or got the wrong idea.

326
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,530
Then what about this
Park Kyung Shin guy?

327
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,800
Are you involved in this
whole kidnapping thing?

328
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,570
He's Young Chae's boyfriend.

329
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,940
He's the guy she went to Paris with.

330
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,110
Then why call it a kidnapping?
And why did your name come up?

331
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,610
I guess Young Chae's telling people
her name is Cha Jung Won.

332
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,750
What's she trying to pull?

333
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,690
Because I'm easy
to take advantage of,

334
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,060
and because I'm a pushover.

335
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,590
It's all...

336
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,700
because I'm a failure as a father.

337
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,770
Don't say that.

338
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,800
Joo Young Chae,
she's the awful one here.

339
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,110
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

340
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,990
I can't believe Jung Won would tell
such an outrageous lie.

341
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,260
I never would have imagined it.

342
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,000
To hide one lie,
she had to tell another,

343
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,400
and now she's trapped
in a web of lies...

344
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,030
she can't escape.
That's Cha Jung Won.

345
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,140
Ha Neul said the same thing.

346
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,640
He said it was like quicksand.

347
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,070
Like a mire you can never escape
once you fall in.

348
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,410
It's Ripley's Syndrome.

349
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,650
Ripley's Syndrome...

350
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,550
This goes beyond her
just being a simple liar.

351
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,820
She might not even remember...

352
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,860
that she was lying
in the first place.

353
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,400
Why do you think
she ended up like that?

354
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,670
Because she wants to be more,
but reality won't let her.

355
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,230
And eventually,

356
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,170
she must have wanted to be like you.

357
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,440
So I was the cause of it all.

358
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,180
I'm the one who made
Jung Won feel small...

359
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,980
and crushed her self-esteem.

360
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,120
It's not your fault, my dear.
It's that Cha Jung Won herself...

361
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,850
couldn't accept who she was.

362
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,890
I'm so sorry.

363
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,030
I just keep causing
all these problems.

364
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,400
You have such a good heart.

365
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,140
Instead of resentment,
you pity her and blame yourself.

366
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,310
You don't have to do that.

367
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,130
Are you trying to run away?

368
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,740
How did you untie the ropes?

369
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,480
I prayed really hard for a lifeline.

370
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,710
Guess you didn't pray hard enough.

371
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,180
- Seeing as I caught you.
- Young Chae, please, let me go.

372
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,080
And if I let you go,
do you have anywhere to run to?

373
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,020
I'll go far away.
I swear, I'll go really far away.

374
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,560
There's nowhere you can hide
from Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

375
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,990
No matter how far you go,

376
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,660
you'll be caught eventually.

377
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,440
- You're dead if my mom finds out.
- Don't be ridiculous.

378
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,370
I will survive!

379
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,440
- I'll do anything to escape!
- I'm trapped here too!

380
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,980
It's not like I want
to be here either.

381
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,410
Don't you get it?

382
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,020
You...

383
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,750
are finished.

384
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,230
Young Chae is trying to dump me.

385
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,660
But I can't live without her.

386
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,840
I'm in love with Park Kyung Shin.

387
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,110
I said, I'm in love with him!

388
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,350
Young Chae, please let me go.

389
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,920
I don't want to have to hurt you.

390
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,600
You got Noh Min Gu?

391
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,600
Where is he now?

392
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,870
You don't need to know.

393
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,780
Noh Min Gu helped Cha Jung Won
confine Park Kyung Shin.

394
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,910
Why would you take such a big risk?

395
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,080
I'm considering sending him abroad.

396
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,750
Just thinking about it.

397
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,580
What do you mean
you're "thinking about it?"

398
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,350
It's amusing.

399
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,860
- Toying with a guy like that.
- Se Hoon.

400
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,190
Just kidding.

401
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,230
I've got him locked up in my suite
at Kunhyang Hotel.

402
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,030
You're going to send him away,
right?

403
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,600
Far, far away.

404
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,900
Of course.

405
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,560
To hide one lie,
she had to tell another,

406
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,760
and now she's trapped
in a web of lies...

407
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,070
she can't escape.
That's Cha Jung Won.

408
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,300
Ha Neul said the same thing.

409
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,800
I just don't think a lie
should become a swamp.

410
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,610
A swamp?

411
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,970
You mean the more you struggle,

412
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,410
the deeper you sink into it?

413
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:56,510
At least, from one of the families,

414
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,250
you must get out
of this swamp of lies,

415
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,620
This goes beyond her
just being a simple liar.

416
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,960
She might not even remember...

417
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,760
that she was lying
in the first place.

418
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,590
I'll make this fiction my reality.

419
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,930
Because I am Joo Young Chae.

420
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,460
(A Graceful Liar)

421
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,530
My dear.

422
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,160
- Are you free next Friday?
- That's your wedding day.

423
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,070
Can't have a wedding
without the bride, now can we?

424
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,070
What? Who?

425
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,370
- He's dead?
- Kyung Shin tried to kill me first.

426
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,640
The Chairman made a move herself.

427
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,770
Something terrible
must've happened at the villa.

428
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,540
Park Kyung Shin is dead.

429
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,080
I'm the one who killed him.

430
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,850
Nothing happened.
Young Chae, you didn't do a thing.

431
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,020
Gong Nan Sook is behind this.

432
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,420
Worried for Cha Jung Won, though
she's not his biological daughter?

433
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,790
Drop whatever scheme
you’ve got in mind.

434
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,920
If you go any further,

435
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,630
the Han Hye Ra that you've
so carefully crafted,

436
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,030
will vanish.

437
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,900
