1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,140
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,040
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,880
They couldn't even tell
two people submitted the same book.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,550
That's how sloppy the hiring
at Kunhyang Group was.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,190
Designer Joo Young Chae,
is this true?

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,490
No.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,060
I think
there's been a misunderstanding.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,630
But as for you, Cha Jung Won,

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,630
why do you have
such a vendetta against Kunhyang?

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
What?

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,110
Look at this.

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,040
Cha Jung Won here even leaked
this story to the press.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,720
("Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra's
Hidden Daughter")

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,720
("Her History and Path
to Kunhyang Revealed")

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,560
Are you out of your mind?

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,090
What do you take Kunhyang Group for?

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,200
I believe this kind of corruption
and unfairness has to stop.

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,570
Se Mi, what do you think
you're doing?

20
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,310
This isn't
how it was supposed to go...

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,380
Are you okay, Cha Jung Won?

22
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,190
I told my boss
that the hiring process was unfair,

23
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,190
and she slapped me.

24
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,390
It would be weirder
if I were okay, right?

25
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,130
Unfair hiring process?
What's this about?

26
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,240
I hope you'll look into it as well,
Vice President Jin.

27
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,140
I can explain, Se Hoon.

28
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,980
I mean, Vice President Jin.

29
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,280
No. I need to hear the explanation
directly from Designer Cha Jung Won.

30
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,650
What are you thinking?
(Episode 62)

31
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,160
Did you put on a suicide vest
to take down Kunhyang with you?

32
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,030
This is a workplace.
Please keep it professional.

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,630
The article...

34
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,430
Jung Won, did you...

35
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,440
I mean, you published it,
Designer Cha, right?

36
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,040
- I did.
- What did you think you were doing?

37
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,910
Do you even have a plan?

38
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,010
Charging in headfirst
won't solve anything.

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,050
That's not your concern, sir.

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,290
Just make sure you properly handle
the fraudulent blind hiring case.

41
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,590
That's all I ask.

42
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,970
She's made up her mind
to reveal the whole truth.

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,670
She's dead set on
shaking up Kunhyang.

44
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,870
I think she's telling me to take
responsibility for my choice.

45
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,780
And that she'll take responsibility
for hers.

46
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,450
This implies the Kunhyang family
was involved in Cha Ki Beom's death.

47
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,480
But it's true. I...

48
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
No. You killed Cha Ki Beom.

49
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,350
Hye Ra.

50
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,720
You know Gong Nan Sook
has proof, don't you?

51
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,630
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

52
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,930
There's no proof.

53
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,030
You're suspecting me
based on Gong Nan Sook's lies?

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,470
You and Gong Nan Sook
are behind everything.

55
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,200
The two of you conspired
to frame an innocent person,

56
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,170
and you framed me
for Cha Ki Beom's murder.

57
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,270
- That's not true.
- Was that all you did?

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,050
You even made Se Hoon believe
that I killed his birth mother.

59
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,310
I told you, that's not true!

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,050
If it's not true,
then bring me proof.

61
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,120
I swear I will find proof
that you did it...

62
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,990
no matter what.

63
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Were you two arguing
because of the article?

64
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
What is it?

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,140
Do you have a report
for Vice Chairman Han?

66
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,110
I've received a report
on an issue...

67
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,010
in the Design Team's
blind recruitment process.

68
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,150
The Design Team is your area.
You handle it.

69
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,960
Who wrote this report?

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,960
Cha Jung Won.

71
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,480
What brings you here?

72
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,650
- Are you here to see me?
- I came to see Vice Chairman Han.

73
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
Why would you meet her?

74
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,390
It's a matter I must discuss
with her in person.

75
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,650
Go ahead.

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,760
We'll talk later.

77
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,500
Why are you meeting
with the Vice Chairman?

78
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,860
At a time like this?

79
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,900
Is it because of the article?

80
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,770
Are you Cha Jung Won's lawyer now?

81
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,070
If my business was with you,
I wouldn't need to see her, would I?

82
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,740
I heard she rejected you.

83
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,680
Love is a luxury,
or so I hear from Jung Won.

84
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,020
You rushed things.

85
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,660
Confessing already?

86
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,760
No, it's been long overdue.

87
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,100
Because I've loved her
since high school.

88
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,130
So now you can cross the line?

89
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,670
Se Hoon.

90
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,370
You're the one crossing
the line right now.

91
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,570
Whoever Jung Won dates or loves,
even if it ends up being me,

92
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,740
it's none of your business anymore.

93
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,950
Have you ever stopped to think
about how I feel?

94
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,820
How upset I must feel.

95
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,390
The woman I love is in front of me,
but I can't have her.

96
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,060
A woman I don't even love
has suddenly become my wife.

97
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,430
Things have become a total mess,
and it was all out of my control.

98
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,030
Get a grip, Jin Se Hoon.

99
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,500
- What?
- I don't have time...

100
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,770
for your whining right now.

101
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,040
The woman I love is standing
at the edge of a cliff.

102
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,540
One little push and she would fall.

103
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,510
And she's rejecting my love.

104
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,080
I'm going crazy worrying
that she'll freeze out there alone.

105
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,850
What on earth is this?

106
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,590
Did you really think
she'd just fall into your arms...

107
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,160
like she was waiting for it
after breaking up with me?

108
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,960
Don't kid yourself!

109
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,060
I don't have time for this.

110
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,240
I saw the article.

111
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,180
You seem less surprised
than you were about the first one.

112
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,550
Because I realized
that I'm the one you're aiming for.

113
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,680
- And I know what you want.
- What is it that I want?

114
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,220
To strip me bare.

115
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,290
As a mother
who abandoned her daughter...

116
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,230
and the wife who betrayed
and killed her husband...

117
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,160
after he'd been framed for murder,
a heartless, cold-blooded woman.

118
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,200
- You want the world to turn on me.
- Are you afraid?

119
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,240
Do you think a few measly articles
are going to accomplish that?

120
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
I...

121
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,850
spent 25 years clawing my way...

122
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,850
to be Kunhyang's matriarch
and the Vice Chairman.

123
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,560
I'm wearing armor
that your attacks can never pierce.

124
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,330
So a nobody like me can't beat you,
is that it?

125
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,100
- You're not just up against me.
- I know.

126
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,000
You have Chairman Jin Tae Seok
by your side,

127
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,300
and next to him is someone
with cunning and chilling schemes,

128
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,810
- Chairman Gong Nan Sook.
- That's right.

129
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,440
Unless you have a sharper,
more sophisticated blade,

130
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,680
you'll never be able to beat them.

131
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,010
Forget my heart,

132
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,920
it'll feel like a tickle in my palm.

133
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,320
And that's not all.

134
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,760
You'll be consumed by pain and fear
more terrifying than the fiery pit.

135
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,530
Are you worried about me right now?

136
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,630
Worried?

137
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,400
You naive child.

138
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,170
This proves you don't understand
the world or how people work.

139
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,670
Do you think
however recklessly you act,

140
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,670
I'm going to protect you?

141
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,780
"You're my mother.
Blood is thicker than water."

142
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,750
"You wouldn't dare
do anything to me."

143
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,550
That's what you're thinking,
isn't it?

144
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,480
Do you believe
that as long as you're my daughter,

145
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,220
Chairman Jin Tae Seok
won't harm you?

146
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,920
Or that as long as
he forbids it, Gong Nan Sook,

147
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,430
- won't be able to touch you?
- You're dead wrong.

148
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,200
You have far too much to lose,

149
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,530
so you must be terrified
of the truth coming out.

150
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,040
But I'm different.

151
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,210
I have nothing left to lose.

152
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,880
You should know someone...

153
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,180
with nothing to lose
is the most dangerous.

154
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,020
And don't you expect me...

155
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,650
to show any hesitation...

156
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,050
just because you're my mother.

157
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,260
That's enough, Jung Won.

158
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,470
I expect a thorough investigation
into the blind hiring corruption.

159
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,230
Have a seat.

160
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,270
I apologize
for stopping by unannounced.

161
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,840
Not at all. You’re welcome anytime,

162
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,770
CEO Joo.

163
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,010
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

164
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,220
What do you think
you're doing in my chair?

165
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,590
Nice and roomy.

166
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,320
It's about time...

167
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,730
you started preparing to move to
the Vice Chairman's office, right?

168
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,290
Excuse me?

169
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,130
Don't you have any ambition?

170
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,000
Who isn't ambitious?
But what do you mean, Vice Chairman?

171
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,310
With Han Hye Ra in so much trouble,
do you really think the board...

172
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,970
is just going to let her
stay on as Vice Chairman?

173
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,580
But the Chairman strongly backs her.

174
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,680
Then we'll force a majority vote.

175
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,480
But wouldn't
the Chairman's decision matter more?

176
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,250
If he's forced to choose...

177
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,590
between Kunhyang
and the Vice Chairman...

178
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,220
the Chairman would naturally
choose Vice Chairman Han.

179
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,990
Nothing's forever.
Isn't that how the song goes?

180
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,830
It's human to change,
and it's in love's nature to change.

181
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,300
You of all people should know that.

182
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,740
This isn't my decision to make.

183
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,040
So Jung Won hasn't
accepted your feelings,

184
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,580
has she?

185
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,150
You gave me a ring,

186
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,150
but I haven't been able
to give it to her.

187
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,990
Are you going to give up?

188
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,360
No, of course not.

189
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,660
I believe
she feels the same way I do.

190
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,900
She may be pushing me away
right now,

191
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,630
but I know
she'll come around eventually.

192
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,000
She must be going through a lot
right now,

193
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,540
so why is she insisting
on fighting this all on her own?

194
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,650
Did you do something...

195
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,650
so that CEO Joo and Jung Won
wouldn’t end up together?

196
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,820
No.

197
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,120
It's cute that Se Mi
would even think that.

198
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,190
Maybe there's another reason
why Jung Won...

199
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,030
can't bring herself
to accept your feelings.

200
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,230
What do you mean by that?

201
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,440
She probably just doesn't have
the emotional bandwidth for it now.

202
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,510
If you're patient with her, CEO Joo,

203
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,480
she might eventually come
to appreciate your feelings,

204
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
don't you think?

205
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,410
You care about Jung Won so deeply,

206
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,880
so why do you hide it?

207
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,890
The more I show how I really feel,

208
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,420
the more danger Jung Won will be in.

209
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,090
What if Chairman Jin
stops trusting me?

210
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,370
What if he starts to believe
I would do anything for Jung Won?

211
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,300
But if you keep hiding
your true intentions like this,

212
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,370
Jung Won's anger and resentment
toward you will only grow.

213
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,810
That's a risk I have to take.

214
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,950
Until I can be the one
to tell Jung Won,

215
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,580
I need you, CEO Joo,

216
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,650
to keep this secret.

217
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,390
I understand.

218
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,720
This latest news article...

219
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,560
could be damaging to you.

220
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,860
How do you plan to respond?

221
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,030
Let's say something were to happen
to my position.

222
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,800
Could you...

223
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,240
step in and take my place?

224
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,750
So Cha Jung Won was the one
who exposed the blind hiring issue?

225
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,580
Yes. Where does she get her nerve?

226
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,080
She's counting on your mother.

227
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,590
Then shouldn't she be buttering up
Mom instead of backstabbing her?

228
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,460
The Vice Chairman was in charge
of the blind hiring process.

229
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,630
Dad.

230
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,500
Call me Chairman.

231
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,400
Yes, Chairman.

232
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,070
Her reputation will take a huge hit.
Is she going to be all right?

233
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,770
Oh, my.

234
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,380
Bless your heart.
Se Mi, you're a devoted daughter.

235
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,510
You showed up unannounced again.

236
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,180
You and my Ha Neul
would make such a great couple.

237
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:11,320
Thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

238
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,090
- I'll let you two talk.
- All right, dear.

239
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,030
Goodness, how did she turn out so...

240
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,870
pure and polished,
without a single flaw?

241
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,770
How on earth did you end up
with a daughter like her?

242
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,210
She's the apple of my eye.

243
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,280
I never saw that look on your face.

244
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,350
Let me ask you one thing.

245
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,450
If Han Hye Ra and Se Mi
were drowning,

246
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,120
who would you save first?

247
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,460
What kind of childish question
is that?

248
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,560
You're hesitating.

249
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,400
Of course, I'd save them both.

250
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,770
Are you a good swimmer?

251
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,300
Are you kidding?
Why would I have to jump in myself?

252
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,310
I'd just get two good swimmers
to save both Hye Ra and Se Mi.

253
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,850
What if there are no good swimmers?
What if it's just you and only you?

254
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,050
Are you going to keep
talking nonsense?

255
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,950
Your anger makes me more curious.
I thought your heart was Hye Ra's,

256
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,060
and that she filled it completely,

257
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,660
but I forgot
you’re soft on your daughter.

258
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,360
- Let me ask you one, then.
- What?

259
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,400
If Joo Young Chae and Joo Ha Neul
were drowning, who'd you save first?

260
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,770
Hey, why are you copying me?

261
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,340
Let me guess.
Joo Young Chae, your own daughter?

262
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,570
You're wrong.

263
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,040
Save them?
I'd just see who survives...

264
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,740
while I sit back and watch
with some popcorn.

265
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,510
The only things I care about
are my life and my money.

266
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,680
Kids? What good are they anyway?

267
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,120
Come on. Just get to the point.

268
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,190
What are you talking about?
You want me to become Vice Chairman?

269
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,760
Let's just call it
a contingency plan.

270
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,230
The board of directors
won't just let this situation slide.

271
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,300
That is absolutely not
going to happen.

272
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,340
My influence may be limited,

273
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,970
but as a major shareholder,
I am entitled to a vote.

274
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,480
I will do everything in my power
to protect your position.

275
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,010
This is why I need you, CEO Joo.

276
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,580
You're steadfast,
righteous, and honest.

277
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,650
And your actions match your words.

278
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,990
And...

279
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,460
for my Jung Won,

280
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,230
you'll love her unconditionally.

281
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,200
What exactly are you planning?

282
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,940
Are you planning to
give everything up?

283
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,280
What?
You want to oust the Vice Chairman,

284
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,780
and put Se Hoon in her place?

285
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,380
Believe me,
I wanted to just snatch...

286
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,480
the vice chairman position
for myself,

287
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,390
but I thought better of it.

288
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,320
After all,
the title isn't what matters.

289
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,130
So you can pull Se Hoon's strings
from behind the scenes.

290
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,130
What are you talking about?
You're still calling the shots.

291
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,130
Can I really control all of Kunhyang
with just Se Hoon?

292
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,430
No. I have to protect Hye Ra.

293
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,540
Who said you have to decide now?
Just think about it.

294
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,070
There's nothing to think about.

295
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,710
For your beloved Han Hye Ra,
her daughter, Cha Jung Won,

296
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,510
has just dropped like a bombshell.

297
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,250
That's nothing. A candle in the wind
as long as I'm standing guard.

298
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:32,290
Did it ever occur to you
that you're the candle in the wind?

299
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,590
- What?
- You’re hopeless in love.

300
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,730
What if Han Hye Ra changes her mind
and gives it all to Cha Jung Won?

301
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,740
Han Hye Ra manages your slush fund,
doesn't she?

302
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,370
Never trust a woman too much.

303
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,210
Stop wagging that venomous tongue
of yours.

304
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,550
The word on the street is
that Han Hye Ra...

305
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,180
is desperate to pair Cha Jung Won
with my Ha Neul.

306
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,450
My heart breaks for poor Se Mi.
What will become of her?

307
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,960
Looks like she'll be left out
in the cold.

308
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,230
Or will she?

309
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,070
The Vice Chairman was in charge
of the blind hiring process?

310
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Yes.

311
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,040
The truth is,
I was the one who made the call.

312
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,380
What?

313
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,450
You can't ignore their education.
Especially for designers.

314
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,710
Besides creativity,

315
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,350
they need some background knowledge
to understand you.

316
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,720
How can I work if I must teach them
every little thing from A to Z?

317
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,660
Se Mi, listen to me very carefully.

318
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,630
The fact
that you made that decision.

319
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,540
Keep it secret from the Chairman
and the Vice Chairman.

320
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,410
- Why?
- You like Ha Neul, don't you?

321
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,640
So who was wronged
by the unfair blind hiring?

322
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,950
Cha Jung Won...

323
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,550
No! If Ha Neul finds out
that I'm the reason...

324
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,590
Cha Jung Won was rejected,
he'll be so disappointed in me.

325
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:13,090
Just report to me what's happening
in the Design Team.

326
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,060
I'll handle the rest
and make sure you don't get hurt.

327
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,300
What if Mom gets hurt?

328
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,030
We have the Chairman on her side.

329
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,930
Don't worry.

330
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,640
Okay.

331
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,410
You should get going.

332
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,510
Ha Neul should be out of
the Vice Chairman's office by now.

333
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,680
Is Ha Neul here?

334
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,020
Why is Ha Neul
with the Vice Chairman?

335
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,290
(Kunhyang Group)

336
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,360
Ha Neul!

337
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,470
- Se Mi.
- Stay for a cup of tea.

338
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,320
You and Mom...

339
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,490
I didn't know
you two were close enough...

340
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,490
for a private meeting.

341
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,960
We had some business to discuss.

342
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,430
Don't you usually handle business
with Se Hoon?

343
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,600
Stop being so nosy, kiddo.

344
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,230
Seriously...

345
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,100
Were you hurt? Come here.

346
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,070
Let me see. It's not swollen...

347
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,240
Stop messing around.

348
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,850
- You hit me?
- Good grief.

349
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,060
By any chance,

350
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,830
did Dad say anything to you?

351
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,440
Like what?

352
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,670
After hearing you and Cha Jung Won
didn't work out,

353
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,880
I thought Dad might have...

354
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,050
What are you talking about?

355
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,050
I guess not?

356
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,950
Se Mi, what did you tell
Chairman Jin?

357
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,060
What do you want me to do,
my dear Se Mi?

358
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,530
Break apart...

359
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,930
Cha Jung Won and Ha Neul for me.

360
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,070
It's just that I told him
I'm serious about you,

361
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,470
and Dad said that guys don't really
like women who come on too strong.

362
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,110
He told me to slow things down.

363
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
Is it true?

364
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,750
What is?

365
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,520
That you stole Cha Jung Won's
design book to get this job.

366
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,650
And you believe her?

367
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,220
I went to
the New York Royal Art School.

368
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,020
You think I'd steal a sloppy design
from a high school graduate?

369
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,830
And how did you get into
the New York Royal Art School?

370
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,530
You stole Jung Won's design book
back in high school, didn't you?

371
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,370
Are you out of your mind?

372
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,540
Kim Sung Hee.

373
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,310
Do you want to be sued
for defamation and false rumors?

374
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,050
That's enough.
The truth will come out.

375
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,620
Ahn Ji Na,
you and I are in the same boat.

376
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,490
Don't you forget it.

377
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,400
I'll have to see for myself
how low you'll sink, Joo Young Chae.

378
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,970
Let's get back to work.

379
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,800
And stop wasting time
on useless speculation.

380
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,340
The nerve of her.

381
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,080
Sung Hee.

382
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,920
What's wrong?

383
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,550
I'm fine.

384
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,620
I'm going to the restroom
to wash my face.

385
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,170
Joo Young Chae stole
Cha Jung Won's design book?

386
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,630
Not just for the designer position
of Kunhyang Fashion,

387
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,840
but to get into
the New York Royal Art School too?

388
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,570
However, that hasn't been confirmed.

389
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,380
That's the claim from Cha Jung Won
and Kim Sung Hee.

390
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,250
They're not the type
to make up stories.

391
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,180
Did Joo Young Chae
really do such a thing?

392
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,650
There's no way to know.

393
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,320
Not without confirming the truth.

394
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,020
I want you to find out
what the truth is, Ji Na.

395
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,630
- Excuse me?
- Didn't you agree to be on my side?

396
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,100
I'm not quite sure what you want.

397
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,130
Whether you're on Director Jin Se Mi
and Joo Young Chae's side,

398
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,540
or...

399
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,170
if you want to support
Designer Cha Jung Won.

400
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,440
I thought you said
our relationship was the priority.

401
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,210
That's true.

402
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,950
But why should it matter
whose side I'm on?

403
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,280
This is a Kunhyang Family matter.

404
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,050
I'm just worried I'll get in trouble
by getting involved.

405
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,660
I'm sure I've told you before.

406
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,890
Just report the facts.

407
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,060
I know that you were hurt...

408
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,900
after your engagement
with Se Hoon ended...

409
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,570
and that you unwillingly
became competitive...

410
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,770
and are prone to jealousy.

411
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,800
But...

412
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,080
at least as a designer,
I trust that you're a professional.

413
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,610
Whether it's Joo Young Chae
or someone else,

414
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,850
stealing someone else's
design book...

415
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,250
and using it to advance
one's education and career...

416
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,860
is unforgivable, don't you think?

Our handsome CEO Joo
looks so troubled.

420
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,710
Is it because Jung Won
turned you down?

421
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,380
Did you really get rejected?

422
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,580
Even after you sang her
that love song?

423
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,720
Slow down. I know you're upset,
but you'll get sick drinking fast.

424
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,390
Maybe he sang it too well?

425
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,730
- That could be it.
- Why get rejected for singing well?

426
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,570
- It makes you look like a player.
- No, that's not it.

427
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,100
Or...

428
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,110
did you say in front of a big crowd,
"Please accept my love"?

429
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,580
- Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

430
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,350
May I love you?

431
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,750
- It was something like that.
- And then what?

432
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,990
Jung Won just ran off somewhere.

433
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,550
That's it. She was embarrassed.

434
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,990
I handled that so poorly.

435
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,630
I should have confessed
somewhere quiet and calm.

436
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,760
Enough already!

437
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:03,170
Jung Won was here yesterday,
moping around too.

438
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,040
Jung Won was?

439
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,800
Even if she's the one who ended it,
she didn't mean it.

440
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,270
I raised her for 25 years.
I know how my daughter feels.

441
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,040
So Jung Won does like me, right?

442
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,210
Even to another man,
you seem so kind and dependable.

443
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,480
There isn't a woman alive
who'd turn you down, CEO Joo.

444
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,220
Cha Jung Won must have
some other reason...

interfered again?

448
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,860
I'm not sure. It's just that...

449
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,500
Chairman Jin's daughter, Se Mi...

450
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,930
The one who's the director
of the Design Team?

451
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,140
She's Jin Tae Seok's daughter?

452
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,410
- Then she's Han Hye Ra's daughter?
- That's right.

has feelings for CEO Joo.

Oh my goodness. Then Jin Tae Seok
must have been scheming.

Knowing Chairman Jin,
for Miss Se Mi's sake,

457
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,890
he's more than capable...

a harsh warning.

The Vice Chairman's alleged
involvement in blind hiring...

468
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:06,120
has been confirmed as true
by the internal audit.

470

is now also an issue.

The company's credibility
has taken a serious hit.

472
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,300
The allegations of blind hiring
are exaggerated.

473
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:19,100
It's an issue we can easily clear up
with better internal communication.

Holding the Vice Chairman to account
will only escalate the chaos.

So whoever destroyed
the company's reputation...

484
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,630
should take responsibility.

right this second.

517
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,070
creating portfolios with the exact
same composition?

518
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,080
A similar layout
is entirely possible.

519
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,310
You'll soon find out
who's telling the truth.

520
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,450
- You have to pay for what you did.
- That's never going to happen.

521
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,980
We should have focused on restoring
the group's reputation first.

522
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,290
But that doesn't mean
you should've just quit!

523
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,990
Watching Han Hye Ra's downfall...

524
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,390
is more entertaining
than making money.

525
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,530
Did you hear something
from Chairman Gong Nan Sook?

526
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,760
Tell him you'll make him
the vice chairman...

527
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
only if he loves me.

528
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,100
If Se Hoon becomes
the interim vice chairman,

529
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,630
he'll come for your position.

530
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,670
It's going to be me.

531
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,240
I'm the heir to Kunhyang Group.
