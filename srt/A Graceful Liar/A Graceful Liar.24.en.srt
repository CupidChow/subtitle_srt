00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,170
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,840
(in this drama are fictional.)

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,110
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,150
(Episode 24)

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,250
Breakfast is late today.

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,850
Because Chef Hong was preparing
something for you...

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,320
to build up your strength.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,490
You know I don't usually
eat breakfast.

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,790
- This is too heavy.
- You need a full stomach for today.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,430
The cold and the loneliness.

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,940
Mother, may I have a word with you?

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,040
Why is there
only one drumstick in mine?

13
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,510
Did you sneak a bite, Chef Hong?

14
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,280
Mine has three drumsticks.

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,450
Young Chae, please eat up.
You'll need your strength.

16
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,820
Here, Young Chae,
have some of this too.

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,290
Have another drumstick.

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,930
What's going on?
Why is everyone acting so weird?

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,000
Do I look like
I haven't eaten in days?

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Eat up.

21
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,380
Mom, are you going on a work trip
or something?

22
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,880
Not me. You.

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,420
Where are you sending me?

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,020
You're not, are you?

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,260
Just go and get some rest
until I can clean up this mess.

26
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,190
Are you abandoning me? Mom?

27
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,060
Abandon you? You're my daughter.

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,160
This is exactly what
abandoning me looks like.

29
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,700
For your business
and your own selfish gain,

30
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,540
you'd cast aside your own child?

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,900
Is that what a mother does?

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,070
I told you you'll understand later.

33
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,210
This is for your own good.

34
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,150
Take her.

35
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,420
No, let go of me! Ha Neul!

36
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,220
Do you really have to go this far?

37
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,020
Then do you have a better idea?

38
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,260
I'll find a good place for her.

39
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,330
Ha Neul!

40
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,330
Stay out of it!

41
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,370
To rein in a wild horse,
that's the only place to do it.

42
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,140
My dear daughter-in-law.

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,510
Are you free next Friday?

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,880
I'm sorry?

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,250
That's your wedding day.
Next Friday.

46
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,090
Can't have a wedding
without the bride, now can we?

47
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,890
I'll clear my schedule, Mother.

48
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,130
For guests, just from our side,
I'm thinking four or five hundred?

49
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,200
Ask Chairman Gong
how many guests from her side.

50
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,530
We need to know
so we can book the venue.

51
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,370
Why?

52
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,570
Are you worried
you'll have too many guests?

53
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,810
Why don't you just broadcast
the wedding on national TV?

54
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,310
I'd like to have a small wedding.

55
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,420
My dear Young Chae is just
being incredibly modest.

56
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,460
We don't have to go overboard,
but a small wedding?

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,260
That's even worse.

58
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,300
For rich kids, planning a wedding
is like waging a war.

59
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,070
And from a social perspective,

60
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,370
it would set a great example.

61
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,240
I'll discuss it with Chairman Gong.

62
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,940
Mother, Father,
please, you don't need to be formal.

63
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,480
Shall we?

64
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,020
You've never got a proper tour
of the house, have you, my dear?

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,970
It's beautiful.

66
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,610
The Kunhyang family.

67
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,840
This is my world now.
The world of Joo Young Chae.

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,920
It's magnificent.

69
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,950
Your room is even more splendid.

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,660
There's no comparison.

71
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,970
A gift.

72
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,240
Open it.

73
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,410
It's absolutely beautiful.

74
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,780
There. Perfect.

75
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,150
It's stunning.

76
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,620
It's perfect.

77
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,860
If Su A were still alive,

78
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,730
she'd be just as graceful and lovely
as you.

79
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Mother.

80
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,780
It reminds me of raising Se Hoon.

81
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,880
To think he's now old enough
to welcome such a beautiful bride...

82
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,880
makes me so pleased and proud.

83
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,550
I'd like to give you a gift as well.

84
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,760
But I need your help with it.

85
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,090
(Naeil Care Hospital)

86
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,260
No!

87
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,470
Hey, open the door!
Please, get my mom!

88
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,740
(Cha J Won)

89
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,750
(Cha J Won)

90
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,250
This feels awkward.

91
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,290
I can stop if you're uncomfortable.

92
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,520
No, draw it for me.

93
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,290
I want to show it off.

94
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,630
"A portrait drawn
by my daughter-in-law."

95
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,900
I dare any other to say the same.

96
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,270
I wouldn't call it a portrait.
I'm not that good.

97
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,440
It's more of a caricature, really.

98
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,440
What are you smiling about?

99
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,480
I'm happy this painting is an excuse
to see you more often.

100
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,980
I'll have to draw it
very slowly, then.

101
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,260
You'll finish it
before the wedding date, right?

102
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,820
Depends on how the model behaves.

103
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,030
Deal!

104
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,040
I was gifted some fine Pu'er tea
and brought it for you.

105
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,680
It smells wonderful.

106
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,010
It's from a tree over 100 years old.

107
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,050
I should've known you have the best,
Chef Hong.

108
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,020
Young Chae...

109
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,920
will get through this.

110
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,260
Are you sure about that facility?

111
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,690
Sending her abroad might be better.

112
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,860
Keep your friends close,

113
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,730
and your enemies closer.

114
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,200
Young Chae is my daughter,
not my enemy.

115
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,870
Hasn't anyone who stood in your way
become your enemy? Daughter or not?

116
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,880
So why did she have to kill someone?

117
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,410
You're the one who killed him.

118
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,450
What did you say?

119
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,250
Did I say something?

120
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,760
Would you like another cup of tea?

121
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Young Chae!

122
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,730
Okay, I get it.

123
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,610
Nothing happened.

124
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,340
Young Chae, you didn't do a thing.

125
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,380
Mom will take care of everything.

126
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,450
It's okay.

127
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,250
Manager Gu!

128
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,390
Get rid of Park Kyung Shin,
and take Young Chae home.

129
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,160
Should I take Young Chae first?

130
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,030
- What about the body?
- Take Young Chae first.

131
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,390
Yes, ma'am.

132
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,260
- Go on.
- Let's go.

133
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,330
Go with Manager Gu.

134
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,790
You brought this on yourself.

135
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,900
Please let me live.

136
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,580
Grandma, what am I going to do?

137
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,180
Why ask me when you've already
made up your mind?

138
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,450
This old lady is going to sleep now.

139
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,590
Young Chae did it.

140
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,500
It's for the best.

141
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,290
You don't have to hide it, honey.

142
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,890
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:52,400
It's just when our daughter-in-law
offered to paint my portrait,

144
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,970
and it reminded me of her.

145
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,570
You don't have to keep it
locked away in a safe.

146
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,470
Look at the drawing
whenever you want.

147
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,280
And if you miss Su A,
let yourself miss her.

148
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,520
Thank you.

149
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,770
You want me to go see Young Chae?

150
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,470
You should be the one to go, Mother.
She must be having a very hard time.

151
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,410
It's better she hears it from you
rather than from me directly.

152
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,420
What's the message?

153
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,350
(Naeil Care Hospital)

154
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,300
The senior of the Kunhyang Family?

155
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,600
I wanted to introduce you to her.

156
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,290
Did Mom send you to get me?

157
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,560
She did, right?

158
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,860
The whole thing's been handled,
right?

159
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,200
If you want to get out of here...

160
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,400
If she wants to leave
the care facility,

161
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,440
she needs to live as Cha Jung Won,
not Joo Young Chae.

162
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,770
Live as who?

163
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,940
What do you mean, I'm Cha Jung Won?

164
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,010
There can't be
another Joo Young Chae.

165
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,050
Ha Neul!

166
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,380
That's CEO Joo to you.

167
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,220
Actually,

168
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,420
"Mr. Joo" wouldn't be so bad either.

169
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,590
You're all insane.

170
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,890
Both you and Mom are
out of your minds.

171
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,290
How could you do this to me?

172
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,530
Cha Jung Won can't live
as you forever.

173
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,970
When that time comes,

174
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,140
your name, your position,
your life...

175
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,540
- You can get it all back.
- And when is that?

176
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,380
How long do I have to live
as Cha Jung Won?

177
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,910
Mom will be the one to decide.

178
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,420
Let me see Mom.

179
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,830
Mom, this is the woman
I'm going to marry.

180
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,930
Isn't she beautiful?

181
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,010
She has a heart of gold.

182
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,240
She's smart
and has her head on straight.

183
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,540
I...

184
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,150
I can't live without her.

185
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,890
Say hello.

186
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,660
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mother.

187
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,090
My name is Joo Young Chae.

188
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,600
She's been unconscious
for ten years.

189
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,700
Not long after
she and my father divorced,

190
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,270
she had a bad fall.

191
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,940
At first,
she could still talk a little...

192
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,110
and move her arms and legs,

193
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,240
but then,
as a secondary complication,

194
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,880
she developed Parkinson's disease.

195
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,130
Medically,
she's considered unresponsive,

196
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,100
but maybe it's just me...

197
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,700
because I feel like she's happy
when I come to visit.

198
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,840
See?

199
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,040
Her face is even brighter today.

200
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,380
I think she approves of you.

201
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,990
I'll take great care of him, Mother.

202
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,220
I'll make sure Se Hoon
is never lonely.

203
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,900
Once you've made up your mind
to live as Cha Jung Won,

204
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
she'll agree to see you.

205
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
What if I refuse?

206
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
Ha Neul...

207
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,520
Please, you have to help me.

208
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,960
Help me get my life back,
I'm begging you.

209
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,660
Call me when
you've made up your mind.

210
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,770
Ha Neul! I can't do this!

211
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,670
Take me with you!

212
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,940
I have to get out of here! Ha Neul!

213
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,110
Ha Neul!

214
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,120
My goodness.

215
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,360
This place is practically a palace.

216
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,290
If Jung Won marries a rich heir,

217
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,360
I bet she'd get to live
in a place like this.

218
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,570
We're home.

219
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,270
Goodness.
Every hallway looks the same.

220
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,380
I can't tell which way is which.

221
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,920
Isn't that my Jung Won?

222
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,590
Let me enter the passcode.

223
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,520
Look at her,
all lovey-dovey with that rich heir.

224
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,290
What's the big deal?

225
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,100
It is a big deal.
It's my way of staking my claim,

226
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,830
- like getting your approval.
- Go on, press it.

227
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,870
Really?

228
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,400
For today only,
I, Joo Young Chae, will let you...

229
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,070
enter the passcode.

230
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,240
Why is my Jung Won...

231
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,140
calling herself Joo Young Chae?

232
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,100
While completely hiding the fact
that she's your daughter,

233
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,260
she's been impersonating
Joo Young Chae...

234
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,570
who's about to be
my daughter-in-law.

235
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,430
That was true?

236
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,040
When Jung Won spoke with Ki Beom,

237
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,840
she swore she denied it.

238
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,710
What are you mumbling about
over there?

239
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,540
Did you see Jung Won?
Did you give her the wedding invite?

240
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,680
When Jung Won was here last time,

241
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,680
didn't you say you confirmed it?

242
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,050
Confirmed what?

243
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,450
When that gentleman
you slammed the door on...

244
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,060
said Jung Won was
pretending to be her rich friend...

245
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,130
- and spouting all that nonsense...
- That was just that one time.

246
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,700
What was that
rich friend's name again?

247
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,430
- Was it Joo...
- Joo Young Chae.

248
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,600
That's it.

249
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,470
Apparently, at some get-together,

250
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,240
her friend introduced Jung Won
as Joo Young Chae,

251
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,510
and that's what caused
all the confusion.

252
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,310
Jung Won has become an expert liar.

253
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,790
Why are you bringing that up
out of the blue?

254
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,420
Hey, Manager Kim.

255
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,830
Now you listen to me carefully
and give me a straight answer.

256
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,900
(To our beautiful daughter,
Jung Won)

257
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,840
I wonder if
she didn't get to see Jung Won.

258
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,780
Is it true that Jung Won is marrying
someone from a rich family?

259
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,420
I thought Jung Won
already told you that.

260
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,480
So it's true.

261
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,820
Well then, does that rich heir...

262
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,120
know that Jung Won is
a dry cleaner's daughter?

263
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,490
Then why is that rich heir...

264
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,700
calling Jung Won "Joo Young Chae?"

265
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Answer me.

266
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,170
I'm sorry.
You should ask Jung Won yourself...

267
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,430
That little brat, Jung Won.

268
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,940
She's lying and pretending to be
Joo Young Chae, isn't she?

269
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,310
Honey...

270
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,440
What did you say about Jung Won?

271
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,880
What is this nonsense
you're spewing?

272
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,620
I'm asking you.

273
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,150
Is Jung Won still pretending...

274
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,350
to be Joo Young Chae
or whatever her name is?

275
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,220
And what's this about
her marrying some rich heir?

276
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,590
Cat got your tongue?
Start talking, right now!

277
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,930
Are you just going to let me yell
while you play deaf and dumb?

278
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,100
Fine. I'll go ask Jung Won myself.
Darn it.

279
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,340
Ki Beom, calm down.

280
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,180
Let go! You're pulling my pants!

281
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,250
Just listen to what I have to say
and calm down for a minute.

282
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,410
Then hurry up and talk.
I'm about to lose it.

283
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,420
Promise me, no matter what I say,
you won't go running to Jung Won.

284
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,820
I'll tell you if you promise.

285
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,320
Fine, I promise.

286
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,820
You really mean it?

287
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,490
You're talking to Cha Ki Beom.
Don't you know me?

288
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,860
I live and die by my promises.

289
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,160
A man among men. You know that.

290
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,830
Honey,

291
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,270
Jung Won is...

292
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,470
She's marrying
into a conglomerate family...

293
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,580
by pretending to be someone else?

294
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,110
That'll happen over my dead body!

295
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,680
You promised!

296
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,810
You said you'd leave Jung Won alone
if I told you the truth.

297
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,950
Whatever.

298
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,860
Thank you...

299
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,860
for coming with me
to meet my mother.

300
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,260
It can't have been easy...

301
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,730
accepting Vice Chairman Han
as your mother.

302
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,630
Because I'm not
some rebellious son...

303
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,170
acting out against his stepmom?

304
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,840
No, you just seemed to care
genuinely for each other.

305
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,510
It wasn't long after
my dad divorced my mom...

306
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,110
that he brought Vice Chairman Han
into our lives.

307
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,050
This pretty woman hugged me,

308
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,820
and she smelled so wonderful.

309
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,790
I thought that even I
would like this woman...

310
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,690
better than my own mother.

311
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,500
And in that moment,
I totally understood my dad.

312
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,100
I was a terrible son, wasn't I?

313
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,440
That's because Vice Chairman Han
is such a wonderful person.

314
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,780
When I was a kid,
I used to think Vice Chairman Han...

315
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,840
might be some kind of witch...

316
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,810
who cast spells on people.

317
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,920
When your mother got sick,

318
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,850
did you ever think it was
Vice Chairman Han's fault?

319
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,790
And now?

320
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,730
They both...

321
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,430
were just living their own lives
as best they could.

322
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,530
If there's such a thing as success
or failure in marriage,

323
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,840
then Vice Chairman Han's marriage
was a success,

324
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,640
and my mom's was a failure.

325
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,340
Try to see it as
having two great mothers.

326
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,910
At least your birth mother...

327
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,320
didn't just abandon her child.

328
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,020
I just hope my mom...

329
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
can finally be at peace now.

330
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,390
This coffee is amazing.

331
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm better than the average barista,
right?

332
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,000
Right. My mom's portrait is
for today, right?

333
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,970
We should go together.

334
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,810
- I'm not sure about that.
- Why not?

335
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,840
(Mother Jo Mi Hyang,
Jung Won, is it true?)

336
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,610
(Are you pretending
to be Joo Young Chae to marry...)

337
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,620
A small wedding?

338
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,580
You know the saying,
"like mother, like daughter?"

339
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,120
It certainly doesn't apply to you
and your daughter, Chairman Gong.

340
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,390
I thought you would want them to wed
on a luxury cruise ship.

341
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,030
I was the one who wanted
a small wedding.

342
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,130
But why?

343
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,100
They're not celebrities.
The paparazzi are a hassle.

344
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,740
And can you imagine the headlines
about an over-the-top wedding?

345
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,840
And most of all, the guest list.
It's a headache to put together.

346
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,110
Exactly. Then you have to deal with
who got an invite and who didn't.

347
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,380
And don't even get me started
on the seating chart.

348
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,850
You took the words right
out of my mouth.

349
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,890
Guests complaining that someone
"beneath" them got a better table.

350
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,220
Let's not even go there.
We should keep it simple.

351
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,960
After so long, Chairman Gong,
we're seeing completely eye to eye.

352
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,830
After all, you and I have been
through thick and thin...

353
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,800
for nearly 30 years.

354
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,740
The fact that nothing has changed
between us in three decades...

355
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,510
means we're a real family...

356
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,280
I have to take this, it's urgent.

357
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,210
Let's talk later.

358
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,650
(Kunhyang Group,
Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

359
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,920
Family? Coming from
a low-life loan shark?

360
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,250
Hello? Hello...

361
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,660
What could possibly be more urgent
than their wedding?

362
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,160
As if I can't see her scheme
to marry off her daughter...

363
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,660
to get in with my family.

364
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,870
And what happened to when you were
dying for the cash in my safe?

365
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,500
You're so transparent.
I see right through you.

366
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,310
A "small wedding?"

367
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,810
I think you like my mother
more than I do.

368
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,450
I'm getting a little jealous.

369
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,060
I'm off.

370
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,230
See you later.

371
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,870
Dad.

372
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,700
Jung Won, what in the world
have you been doing?

373
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,370
Are you even my daughter?

374
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,180
My Jung Won is kind, considerate,
and honest! Is that you?

375
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,450
You said it was just that one time!

376
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,150
You said it was just a joke
from your friend, Joo Young Chae?

377
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,750
Didn't you say you weren't...

378
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,590
blatantly pretending
to be your rich friend?

379
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,030
Was it all a lie?

380
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,330
It was a lie.

381
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,030
Then is it true...

382
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,440
you're pretending
to be Joo Young Chae...

383
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,810
and marrying
into a conglomerate family?

384
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,850
Have you lost your mind?

385
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,980
You're not Joo Young Chae!

386
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,890
- You are my daughter, Cha Jung Won!
- No, I'm not!

387
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,820
I am Joo Young Chae!

388
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,590
You!

389
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,590
You brat!

390
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,000
How dare you say that
to your father?

391
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,030
How could you?

392
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,330
What about Joo Young Chae's parents?
Does her family know?

393
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
They know.

394
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,370
What?

395
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,280
Young Chae's mother wants this
more than anyone.

396
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,580
She's desperate to be in-laws
with a conglomerate family.

397
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,580
How can she call herself
a human being?

398
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,580
And she calls herself a mother?

399
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,350
Where is that woman?
Take me to her, right now!

400
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,960
(Death to the killer's family)

401
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,630
You've never had to worry
about money, have you?

402
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,170
Is it really that sweet?
Living as Young Chae?

403
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,070
It's absolutely intoxicating.

404
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,510
No.

405
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,850
Meeting Young Chae's mother
won't change anything, Dad.

406
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,650
I'm the problem.

407
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,850
I want to keep living
as Joo Young Chae.

408
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,490
Were you that ashamed of me
as your father?

409
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,860
I wasn't ashamed.

410
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,490
I'm still not.

411
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,200
But...

412
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,670
I can't spread my wings and fly!

413
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,970
Not as long as I'm your daughter.

414
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,840
And what is "flying" to you?

415
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,140
Using a fake name
and a fake family...

416
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,480
to marry into a conglomerate family?

417
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,450
- That's right.
- It's a dream you'll wake up from.

418
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,120
That place and life are not yours!

419
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,190
It's all going to come
crashing down.

420
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:00,660
Stop this now. Please, Jung Won.

421
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,890
It's too unfair not to even try
just because I might fail.

422
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,430
That rich heir...

423
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,600
doesn't know you're Cha Jung Won,
does he?

424
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,800
Se Hoon loves me.

425
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,840
He would love me
even if I weren't Joo Young Chae.

426
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,310
But he thinks you're someone else.

427
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:17,610
Is that really love?

428
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,640
What about you? Do you love him?

429
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,550
He's not bad.

430
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
No, I do like him.

431
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,150
The adoring look in his eyes,

432
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,620
his expression, and his smile.

433
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,990
That feeling is not real love,
Jung Won!

434
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,030
I don't care!

435
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,230
Does love have to be passionate?

436
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,560
All that passion does
is burn you out.

437
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,870
I prefer a comfortable warmth.

438
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,770
As long as it brightens
my future and life,

439
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,640
and gives me wings.
That's all I need.

440
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,670
Wrens should live like wrens.
Why are you trying to be a stork?

441
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,010
I'm not a wren!

442
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,680
Just because you're a wren,
don't you dare treat me like one!

443
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,480
I'm a stork!

444
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,720
I don't need to be your daughter!

445
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,120
No, I don't want
to be your daughter!

446
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,590
How dare you!

447
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,530
This is my fault.

448
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,130
It's because I'm a failure.

449
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,510
He may not understand now,

450
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,710
but someday he'll see
why I did this.

451
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,190
(A Graceful Liar)

452
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,220
I almost forgot to breathe.

453
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,920
I didn't tell you to stop breathing.

454
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,630
Which doll is your favorite?

455
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,660
Seeing the wear and tear
on this one,

456
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,300
is it a special doll?

457
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,200
My daughter's life is at stake.

458
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,370
I must know
how she got involved in this.

459
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,270
Joo Young Chae is my sister.

460
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,140
You pretended to be my son-in-law
to fool me?

461
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,110
You really don't know
your own daughter, do you?

462
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,240
Why would I let someone
as cunning as Cha Jung Won...

463
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,210
marry into the Kunhyang Family?

464
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
Shut up!

465
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,850
Being the daughter of a murderer...

466
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,980
must've been worse
than death for her.

467
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,280
He may not understand now,

468
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,050
but someday he'll see
why I did this.

469
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,320
Rather than be a father
who ruins his own child's life,

470
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,260
I'd rather end my own life.

471
