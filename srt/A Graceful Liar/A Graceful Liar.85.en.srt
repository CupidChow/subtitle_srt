1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,340
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,340
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,280
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,890
That was delicious.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,160
Is sushi really enough for you?

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,530
More than enough.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,290
You've been through a lot,
haven't you?

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,100
It's a burden I'll have to carry
for the rest of my life.

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,570
Our Jung Won.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,510
Accept her as your daughter.

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,610
- What?
- Then I'll go back to how I was.

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,780
Your sweet and lovely wife.

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,050
A picture-perfect woman...

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,550
who is yours and yours alone.

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,020
If I'd known you were
my own flesh and blood,

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,520
I never would have done
those things.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,620
I know that you already knew.

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,260
I wasn't sure.

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,260
And it's not like Gong Nan Sook
is a trustworthy person.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,060
Why were you...

21
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,470
so desperate to kill me?

22
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,740
I don't know what came over me.

23
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,010
Jung Won.

24
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,350
Can't you forgive your father?

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,090
I don't really know
what forgiveness means,

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,930
but the fact that you're my father
doesn't change, does it?

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,500
Jung Won,
if you want to beat Jin Tae Seok,

28
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,740
you have to treat him
like your father.

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,640
That monster who tried to kill
his own daughter multiple times?

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,310
That's the only way
you can rip out his heart.

31
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,320
You know what I mean, don't you?

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,230
Good.

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Let's...

34
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,970
try to get along.

35
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,860
Please give this to Madam Gong.
And don't tell her it's from me.

36
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,260
Why don't you give it
to her yourself?

37
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,930
Did you come back
just to give this to her?

38
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,600
No, I just came back
for some papers I forgot.

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,980
Oh my gosh, this is so delicious,
Manager Gu.

40
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,480
How could you be so thoughtful?

41
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,220
Were you that heartbroken
to see me sick?

42
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,290
Come on.

43
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,030
You're not even going to ask
for a bite?

44
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,930
Come on, just act normal.

45
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,230
- Do you want some? I'll share.
- I wouldn't want any from you.

46
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,570
This lunchbox is something...

47
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,070
you must eat all by yourself,
down to the last grain of rice.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Fine, I will.

49
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,940
I have absolutely no appetite,

50
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,610
but for your sake, Manager Gu,
I will scrape this bowl clean!

51
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,120
It was you, wasn't it?

52
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,450
You're the one who was nursing me
all night, right?

53
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,660
- What?
- The fever made my vision blurry.

54
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,990
People kept fading in and out.

55
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,800
I fought to keep my eyes open,
but they kept shutting on me.

56
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,200
It's like my son Ha Neul was there,
and at the same time, he wasn't.

57
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,640
Anyway, that's what it was like.

58
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,640
Yes, that was me.

59
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,210
- I'm used to handling my pet.
- I knew it!

60
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,410
I thought it was my Ha Neul,

61
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,920
and I was so touched
I almost cried a river.

62
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,990
You think
I have nothing better to do?

63
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,460
I didn't even know you were sick.

64
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,660
Right, who said you did?

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,800
Would you just eat up already?

66
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,100
What's gotten into him
all of a sudden?

67
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,940
He's worried about me right now,
isn't he?

68
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,240
He sounded more angry
than worried to me.

69
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,710
"Just eat up, will you?"

70
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,520
Have you two lost your minds?
It's miserable enough being sick.

71
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,550
Unbelievable.

72
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,520
This doesn't suit you.

73
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,390
Why would someone like Gong Nan Sook
get sick?

74
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,630
You're not someone who would crumble
over a mere tax audit, are you?

75
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,480
All right, Manager Gu.

76
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,720
Just keep on admiring me.

77
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,390
Who knows?
You might win the lottery.

78
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,720
Should I go buy you a ticket?

79
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,140
Dad, you really decided to accept
Jung Won as your daughter?

80
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,710
No way.

81
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,420
This is all an act, isn't it?

82
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,150
Is that even possible?

83
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,990
After everything you did
to Jung Won...

84
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,720
We've decided to put it behind us.

85
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,090
Right?

86
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,990
Yes.

87
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,000
Mom.

88
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,560
Your father is right.

89
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,040
From now on, the people here
are the only real family we have.

90
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,610
I hope we can stop
hurting each other.

91
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,240
My dear Jung Won,
let's try to get along.

92
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,280
I hope we can get along too.

93
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,120
Dad.

94
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,180
Tomorrow evening,

95
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,220
at the Kunhyang Association gathering,

96
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,220
I'm going to formally introduce
my daughter, Jung Won, to them.

97
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,700
What's their game?

98
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,070
And to think they were just
at each other's throats.

99
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,070
My father sure knows how
to make someone look like a fool.

100
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,710
I never thought he
would pull something like this.

101
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,280
He kept telling you
to get rid of Cha Jung Won.

102
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,510
He did.

103
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,020
Then, he'd give me the password
for the Swiss bank account.

104
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,450
The Swiss bank account?

105
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,820
What's that?

106
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,750
Did I not mention that?

107
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,960
It's my father's slush fund.
There're probably billions in there.

108
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,030
He promised you the password
if you got rid of Cha Jung Won.

109
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,500
And now he's playing
the doting father?

110
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,740
You think your mom's behind this?

111
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,310
Chairman Han?

112
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,120
Mom, was it you?

113
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,550
Did you ask Dad to accept Jung Won?

114
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,990
And Dad actually agreed?

115
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,130
He is her father too, after all.

116
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,900
I understand your reasoning, Mom.

117
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,270
If I were in your shoes,
I would've asked him the same thing.

118
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,000
But...

119
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,640
I don't understand Dad.

120
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,470
He's acting so warm and welcoming
on the surface,

121
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,180
but what if he secretly...

122
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,150
tries to pull something
against Jung Won?

123
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,120
That won't happen again.

124
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,180
You can trust me on that.

125
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,260
Does Ha Neul know?

126
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,230
What?

127
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,300
Mom, do you still hope
Jung Won and Ha Neul get together?

128
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,430
My poor girl.

129
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,070
I just don't want
to see her get hurt.

130
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,190
What is it? Is something wrong?

131
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,240
The aroma is so rich.

132
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,250
You look much better.
That's a relief.

133
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,510
Thank you.

134
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,650
I know it's hard pretending
to get along with Jin Tae Seok.

135
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
The sight of his face
makes my blood boil.

136
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,490
Just hearing his voice...

137
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,230
makes me feel like
my heart’s breaking.

138
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,770
But you know...

139
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,440
- you have to see this through.
- I know.

140
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,470
I'll endure it.

141
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,710
No.

142
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,870
I'm going to nail this.

143
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,610
I'll do so well
that not only Jin Tae Seok,

144
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,810
but even I will believe it's real.

145
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,220
Have you reviewed the files
from Manager Hwang?

146
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,220
There's no end to his corruption.

147
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,590
The files show Jin Tae Seok...

148
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,930
bribed politicians
of both parties, prosecutors, cops,

149
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,930
and paid off dozens
of high-ranking officials regularly.

150
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,000
He kept meticulous records of names,
delivery dates, and methods.

151
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,610
And he used those connections
to avoid prosecutor investigations,

152
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,740
or tax audits. He dodged them all.

153
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,780
Jin Tae Seok.

154
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,750
He's really done every awful thing
he's ever wanted.

155
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,180
When we make our move,
it has to be one decisive blow.

156
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,650
Leave him no way out.
We have to get this right.

157
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,540
- Ms. Gong Nan Sook.
- "Miss?"

158
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,110
This is unbelievable. How dare you?
Do you have any idea who I am?

159
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,810
Sorry. You just look so young
for a prosecutor.

160
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,020
I forgot myself for a moment.
My apologies.

161
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,850
- Do you know MO Consulting?
- What's that?

162
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
Never heard of them.

163
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,560
Then why did Crown Capital send them
hundreds of thousands every month?

164
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,660
That?

165
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,500
Those are
legitimate consulting fees.

166
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,800
But it's a company with no office,
just an address.

167
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,740
They are in the middle of relocating,
so it's just temporary.

168
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,310
You know a lot for someone
who said you'd never heard of them.

169
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,120
This is all a setup to frame me.

170
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,020
In all my business dealings,

171
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,460
I have always acted
with a clear conscience.

172
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,690
That's how I operate.

173
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,960
I see you also have an ad agency
and an entertainment company.

174
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,430
Those are just passion projects.

175
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,900
I'm working on quietly on the side.

176
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,100
The more we talk,

177
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,840
the more I realize
how deep your misunderstanding runs.

178
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,880
We'll summon all the company heads
for questioning.

179
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,080
Should we have them all
confront you?

180
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,420
Go right ahead.
I assure you, I have no secrets.

181
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,720
If you're found guilty of concealing
and disguising criminal proceeds,

182
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,290
you'll face five years in prison.

183
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,460
Wait, what?

184
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,590
What was that? Five years?

185
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,700
Assets confirmed as crime proceeds
will be confiscated in full.

186
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,130
Confiscated?

187
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

188
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,980
Come on, eat up!
Just like you always do.

189
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,280
Are you actually letting me
eat here now?

190
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,350
Eat quickly. I have to go somewhere,
and you're coming with me.

191
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,450
- My moonlighter, Part-Timer Hwang.
- Yes, ma'am.

192
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,890
All done.

193
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,930
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

194
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,730
- Should we get some beer?
- Okay, let's.

195
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Sounds great.

196
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,470
This is the place
Mi Hyang Mom runs...

197
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,610
That's right.
I've been there with you before.

198
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,480
I recommended that place to my aunt,

199
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,680
and she wanted to open her own.

200
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,850
Ji Na, you're here.

201
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,150
Auntie.

202
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,720
This is Cha Jung Won from the design team.
She’s a colleague of mine.

203
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,820
It's nice to meet you.

204
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,090
Yes, I've heard so much about you.

205
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,720
Jung Won, you made it.

206
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,500
Mi Hyang Mom,
what are you doing here?

207
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,700
Manager Hwang, you're here too?

208
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,010
Please, have a seat, Manager Hwang.

209
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,980
No, that's all right.
I'm just Ms. Jo's assistant today.

210
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,950
I'm at your service.

211
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,990
Part-Timer Hwang.

212
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,230
- Bring out the meat.
- Right away.

213
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,820
This is my first business.
Thank you for being so helpful.

214
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,750
It's no trouble at all.

215
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,360
My Jung Won said
Ji Na helped her a lot,

216
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,960
so I'm just returning the favor.

217
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,560
But are you really giving her
all your trade secrets for free?

218
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,300
Let's just say
I've made a good friend.

219
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,830
That's more important than money.

220
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,770
- Friends?
- We've decided to be friends.

221
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,670
- Count me in as a friend, too.
- Stay out of it, Part-Timer Hwang.

222
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,440
Yes, ma'am.

223
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,310
Let's be friends too.

224
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,090
We're around the same age
and in the same line of work.

225
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,050
Even though you
can be insufferable at times,

226
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,560
we’re still on the same page
professionally.

227
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,730
What do you say?

228
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,990
Okay.

229
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,980
Prison? Okay.

230
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,120
I can do time. That's not the issue.

231
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,350
But...

232
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,490
they'll take my hard-earned money?
Who do they think they are? Darn it.

233
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,730
Chairman. Please, don't worry.

234
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,000
- There's always a way out.
- That's right.

235
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,440
It'll take a lot more than this
to bring me down.

236
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,640
What are your orders?

237
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,340
Should we
have that prosecutor drowned?

238
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,810
Watch your mouth.

239
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,480
If someone heard,
they'd think I was a mob boss.

240
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,790
You've only ever pretended
to have someone drowned.

241
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,190
- You've never done it, have you?
- "Pretended?"

242
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Hey.

243
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,360
Whatever.
I can't even think right now.

244
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,070
I'm a complete wreck right now.
I've lost the will to fight.

245
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,700
You're just going to let them
ruin you?

246
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,670
I won't.

247
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,640
Did you just come here to check...

248
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,810
whether I'm dead from rage or alive?

249
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,110
You're the infamous Gong Nan Sook,

250
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,050
and you're worked up
over this tax audit?

251
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,980
Worked up?

252
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,180
It's so easy for you to talk
since it's not your problem.

253
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,450
You have such a lovely way
of putting things.

254
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,260
If you were making such a mess,
you should've had a backup plan.

255
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,830
What plan? I just paid people off
to keep their mouths shut.

256
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,100
So if someone stronger than you
shows up,

257
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,930
there’s no way
you could handle them.

258
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,040
Enough with the truth bombs.
You're making my blood boil.

259
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,410
Manager Gu, gather all my front men
and start shutting them up...

260
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,840
before the prosecutors
start their investigation.

261
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Yes, ma'am.

262
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,580
Will keeping them quiet be enough?

263
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,920
Once prosecutors get a hold of them,
someone's bound to sing.

264
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,690
You have a plan, don't you, honey?

265
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,430
Kunhyang Group can't bail you out.

266
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,600
The only way is to sway
Jin Tae Seok.

267
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,130
Didn't you say you have Jin Tae Seok
so wrapped around your finger,

268
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,740
you could have
Jin Tae Seok groveling?

269
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,770
So if you're going to help,
then help me properly.

270
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,810
We'll have to get
the Kunhyang Association involved.

271
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,450
Then do it. Quickly.

272
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,950
As you all may know,

273
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,620
I'll entrust Kunhyang's assets
and the gallery's operations...

274
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,430
to my daughter,
Director Cha Jung Won.

275
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,730
I'm Cha Jung Won.

276
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,300
A great daughter from a great mom.
Come on, everyone, let's applaud.

277
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,570
No one's clapping.

278
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,740
I heard you've already
been hard at work.

279
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,410
- Congratulations, Director Cha.
- Thank you.

280
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,680
I would appreciate your support.

281
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,610
The press is also very interested
in your appointment.

282
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,350
A young director is guaranteed
to create a lot of buzz.

283
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,750
- But...
- It's just that Director Cha...

284
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,290
isn't exactly on the best terms
with Kunhyang,

285
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,660
so it seems a lot of people
are concerned.

286
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,600
Concerned, my foot.

287
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,430
I mean,
it's a mom helping her daughter.

288
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,100
- So why is everyone so nosy?
- Chairman Gong.

289
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,770
I heard you've been busy
with some unpleasantness.

290
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,480
You look much more haggard
than usual.

291
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,940
Are you having a hard time?

292
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,710
Well, it takes more than that
to get me down,

293
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,150
but given the gravity
of the situation,

294
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,250
I wanted to use this chance to...

295
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,600
Chairman Gong Nan Sook is
in a bit of a predicament right now.

296
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,300
If we all pitch in,

297
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,530
we can help Chairman Gong
who tries so hard...

298
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,000
to stay on the right path...

299
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,070
Come on, everyone.
Just help me out already.

300
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,680
You all know I'm not the type
to live and die by loyalty, right?

301
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,380
What's that supposed to mean?

302
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,020
But you know if someone owes me,
I'll chase them to the very end...

303
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,490
and crush them.

304
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,790
You're all well aware of that.

305
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,130
What is it you want from us?

306
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,300
We need you to use your influence.

307
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,800
So you want us to stop...

308
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,440
Chairman Gong's firm
from going under?

309
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,800
It's not like
we have that kind of power.

310
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,510
That's why we all need to pitch in.

311
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:36,380
Honestly, if they really want to,
what company survives a tax audit?

312
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,280
My family has ties to some bigwigs
in politics,

313
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,090
so I'll discreetly ask around.

314
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,390
My husband's family has been in law
for three generations.

315
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,360
I'll see what I can find out.

316
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,260
My uncle has deep ties
to the National Tax Service.

317
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,660
I guess I can make a call.

318
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,930
But I wonder if that kind of thing
still works these days.

319
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,440
It's better than doing nothing,
don't you think?

320
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,510
Alright, everyone.
I'll repay you, Gong Nan Sook style.

321
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,840
I'm politely asking for your help.

322
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,020
Dinner should be ready.
The Kunhyang family is joining us.

323
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,720
Let's eat first.
My goodness, I'm feeling faint.

324
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,290
Let's go. Where did my purse go?

325
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Let's go.

326
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,630
Enjoy your meal, everyone.

327
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,270
Chef Hong, it looks like...

328
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,600
you practically live
at the Kunhyang house.

329
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,540
Come on, you know I'm moonlighting.

330
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,940
I meant...

331
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,750
I brought busy Chef Hong
to treat you to a delicious meal.

332
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,920
It's wonderful to see
the house so lively.

333
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,450
Please, enjoy the food.

334
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,020
You said you had
an announcement to make?

335
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,930
I've brought you all here today...

336
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,760
to put an end
to a long period of confusion...

337
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,300
and to celebrate the return
of my eldest daughter.

338
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,600
Your eldest daughter?

339
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,670
Se Mi?

340
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,640
Now, everyone, listen up.

341
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,410
Listen carefully.

342
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,540
Jung Won...

343
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,680
is Han Hye Ra's and my daughter.

344
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,810
Oh, my goodness.

345
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,680
What in the world?
I can't keep track of this family.

346
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,950
First she was introduced
as the daughter-in-law,

347
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,160
then as Chairman Han's daughter,
and now...

348
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,230
Yes. My father
is Honorary Chairman Jin Tae Seok...

349
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,260
and my mother
is Chairman Han Hye Ra.

350
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,630
That means Jung Won
is my biological sister.

351
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,670
We've confirmed it with a DNA test.

352
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,680
- How long have you known?
- I only found out recently.

353
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,110
I felt it was time
to reveal the truth.

354
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,710
I saw no reason to hide it.

355
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,290
We wanted the Kunhyang Association
to be the first to know.

356
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,020
Life is truly unpredictable,

357
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,720
and doesn't that make it beautiful?

358
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,490
Wouldn't you agree, Chairman Gong?

359
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,530
This is quite a surprise.

360
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,900
So that's why everything at Kunhyang
has been so chaotic.

361
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,440
You all must have been
through so much.

362
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,380
Thank you for understanding.
Today is a happy and meaningful day.

363
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,280
As the eldest daughter
of the Kunhyang family,

364
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,750
and as the executive in charge
of Kunhyang's assets,

365
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,690
I hope Jung Won
will fulfill her duty.

366
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,220
Everyone, a toast.

367
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,880
Goodness, my head is spinning.

368
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,150
Do you think the ladies understood
what was really going on?

369
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,220
I think they'll all pitch in.

370
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,590
There you go again!

371
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,190
Han Hye Ra, you're getting a kick
out of messing with me, aren't you?

372
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,500
- It's exhilarating.
- What?

373
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,030
I've got you, Gong Nan Sook,
wrapped around my little finger.

374
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,540
They say
if you're patient three times,

375
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,070
you can avoid committing murder.

376
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,110
But to deal with you, I'd have to
be patient at least ten times.

377
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,710
You're too much for me.

378
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,610
You were even questioned
by the prosecution.

379
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,380
It's not going to be easy.

380
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,920
- You get it?
- Pitching in, I get it.

381
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,250
Okay, fine.

382
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,830
- What is it?
- I need to talk to you.

383
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,830
I'm just so frazzled right now.

384
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,800
You brat, seriously...

385
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,170
Let go!

386
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,610
Where's your husband?

387
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,410
He's probably in the shower.

388
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,710
Goodness, at this time of night,
a couple should be together.

389
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,010
So why are you cornering me
for a talk?

390
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,580
Dad declared that Jung Won
is his daughter...

391
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,120
to the Kunhyang family.

392
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,520
That was your scheme,
wasn't it, Mom?

393
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,390
My scheme?

394
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,960
My own daughter won't comfort me
during my difficult tax audit.

395
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,660
What do I even expect from you?
This is just my lot in life.

396
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,460
Is it that bad?

397
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,630
Those Kunhyang Association ladies...

398
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,670
I mean, without Han Hye Ra's help,

399
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm on the verge of losing
absolutely everything.

400
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,510
So you better be
on your best behavior.

401
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
Wait a minute.

402
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,880
Don't tell me he found out.

403
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,580
What are you talking about?

404
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,450
What could be more important
than you going bankrupt?

405
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,020
The fake pregnancy
and miscarriage...

406
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,290
Walls have ears, you foolish girl.

407
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,210
It was fake?

408
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,240
- What? What was?
- Young Chae...

409
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,910
Was the pregnancy fake?

410
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,150
Se Hoon, how can you say that
so casually?

411
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,720
Just answer my question!

412
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,220
Young Chae.

413
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,660
The pregnancy and miscarriage...

414
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,690
Were they all lies?

415
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
No.

416
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,260
If Se Hoon finds out,
he'll leave me.

417
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,530
No. Absolutely not.

418
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,310
I can finally breathe again.

419
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,950
It's a citron herbal tea.

420
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,420
You had a really tough day,
didn't you?

421
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,490
I'm trying to forget
what a tough day even means.

422
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,390
You remember, right?

423
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,030
The 72-hour deal
we offered Jin Tae Seok.

424
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,170
It's almost time.

425
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,700
It's time to get started.

426
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,290
You have exactly two hours left.

427
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,500
Out of the 72 hours.

428
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,970
So it was you all along.

429
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,100
You were the one who sent me
the threatening letter?

430
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,370
So you don't think it was a threat?

431
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,440
How disappointing.

432
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,580
Just answer my question!

433
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,390
Young Chae.

434
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,920
The pregnancy and miscarriage...

435
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,490
Were they all lies?

436
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,960
What are you talking about?

437
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,400
You’re hurting the feelings of
our sweet A Reum, who passed away.

438
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,300
Joo Young Chae.

439
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,940
How could you do
something like that?

440
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,260
Se Hoon can't find out.

441
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,530
Mom's in a crisis,

442
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,860
and if the fake pregnancy
is revealed,

443
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,860
I'll be thrown out
of the Kunhyang family.

444
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,540
It would be a mistake to think
this is all just for show.

445
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,340
Honorary Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

446
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,010
Joo Ha Neul,
what could you possibly do?

447
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
You're nothing
but Gong Nan Sook's stepson.

448
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,620
And you don't have the video, right?

449
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,110
So you did steal the video
Gong Nan Sook had.

450
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,840
Gong Nan Sook's fate
is in my hands now,

451
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,250
and you,
kind and fragile Joo Ha Neul,

452
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,780
are going to release this video
to the world?

453
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,420
It'll be released simultaneously
to newspapers and on social media.

454
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,660
The fact that you, Jin Tae Seok,
are a monster.

455
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,830
Joo Ha Neul.

456
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,570
No, you're the one
who's going to die by my hand.

457
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,150
(A Graceful Liar)

458
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,440
The pregnancy was a lie.
So was the miscarriage.

459
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,140
Get out right now!
You will not be my daughter-in-law.

460
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,280
I resent Chairman Gong Nan Sook.
I curse her.

461
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,650
It's all your fault
I ended up like this!

462
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,950
Young Chae,
are you mocking our family too?

463
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,390
Gong Nan Sook,
you're under arrest for tax evasion.

464
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,820
If we do nothing,
she'll go to a detention center.

465
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,760
And after her trial and sentencing,
she'll go to prison.

466
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,200
Gong Nan Sook's fate is in my hands.

467
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,060
The fact that your mother
killed Se Hoon's birth mother.

468
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,430
I'll expose that, too.

469
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,070
