1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,010
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,440
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,380
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,490
Did you enjoy your dinner?

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,830
Mother, I should have told you
that Se Hoon and I were eating out.

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,700
- That was thoughtless of me.
- Or are you just overthinking it?

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,910
- What do you mean?
- Are you nervous...

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,380
that Su A
suddenly appeared, Young Chae?

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,920
But that's no excuse
to slander your sister-in-law.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,790
Slander her?

11
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,490
The Kunhyang Association meeting
will be held here tomorrow evening.

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,730
It's where we'll formally introduce
our Su A.

13
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,070
Young Chae, I'm counting on you.

14
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,600
I should be the one asking you that,
Su A.

15
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,880
Let me have a look at you.

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,550
Please wait a moment.
Ma'am, please wait just a moment.

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,720
- Sir, Chairman Gong is...
- For goodness' sake. How annoying.

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,290
Oh, my, hello.
The Kunhyang home looks the same.

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,960
My dear,
I know I'm dropping by unannounced,

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,160
but I do hope I'm not intruding.

21
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,530
What brings you here at this hour?

22
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,240
In-laws don't need an appointment
to see each other, do they?

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,110
It's for our Young Chae,
to help her conceive.

24
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,940
I brought some herbal medicine.
An expensive one, at that.

25
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,950
What do you think you're doing?

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,190
You must be thrilled to see your mom
after all your in-law troubles.

27
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,130
You're just beaming.
Why don't you show me your room?

28
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,060
Mother, I need to have a quick word
with my mom.

29
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,370
This way? See you all later.

30
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,180
(Episode 42)

31
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,910
Is this it?

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,880
All right, let's have a look.

33
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,750
Gosh, I can smell
the newlywed bliss in here.

34
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,450
This is rich!

35
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,790
Have you already forgotten
what you said...

36
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,390
when I signed the contract
to live as Joo Young Chae?

37
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,960
Sign it.

38
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,330
You can't get pregnant. Ever.

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
You're on birth control, aren't you?

40
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,870
Look at you. Have you forgotten?

41
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,340
Your number one rule
as Joo Young Chae is...

42
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,440
not to get pregnant ever.

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,810
That's not exactly up to me.
We're married.

44
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,380
Just try getting pregnant.

45
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,910
Just know that it'll be the death
of you and that baby...

46
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,910
if that happens.

47
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,550
How could I possibly forget that?

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,880
What's your game?

49
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,420
Medicine to help me conceive?

50
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,820
Or did you bring me something
to make sure I don't get pregnant?

51
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,890
Hey, I'm not that evil.

52
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,890
How much worse do you have to be
to qualify as evil?

53
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,630
I don't think you could
possibly get any worse.

54
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,370
Look who's talking.

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,540
Lately, you're outdoing me.
You always take it one step further.

56
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,170
The things you do
give even me the chills.

57
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,940
That's the only way
to get what I want.

58
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,010
You're right about that.

59
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,750
We both have our reasons to be evil.

60
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,180
So it's all about the justification?

61
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,350
It's crush or be crushed.

62
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,320
If you're not wicked,
you can't survive.

63
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,190
My justification is survival.

64
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,160
- And yours is revenge. Right?
- I may be desperate and driven,

65
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,830
but your justification
is just plain greed.

66
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,340
- Revenge is greed. It ends in ruin.
- I don't care.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,670
Whether the end is greed or ruin,

68
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,040
as long as I can
bring down Han Hye Ra.

69
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,510
Exactly.

70
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,510
And to bring down Han Hye Ra,

71
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,350
wouldn't we need an heir
for Jin Se Hoon?

72
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,520
It looks like
you've changed your tune.

73
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,050
Let's just call it Plan B.

74
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,090
Plan A is to make Young Chae the fake Su A
to go after Han Hye Ra,

75
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,130
and Plan B is for me to have
Jin Se Hoon's baby...

76
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,860
to take over Kunhyang Group?

77
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,730
- Exactly.
- I'll take your words to heart.

78
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,370
I guess I'll have to work hard
on having a baby from now on.

79
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,310
Three times a day... No, twice.

80
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,910
Make sure you take your medicine
without fail, my sweet daughter.

81
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,310
Stop with the concerned mom act.

82
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,280
You think
being your fake mom is easy?

83
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,950
It's killing me, you little brat.

84
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,420
I've already put things in motion
with Madam Sa.

85
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,190
Han Hye Ra is in for a show
at the Kunhyang Association meeting.

86
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,130
I should get the food ready.

87
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,400
I can ask Chef Hong for help, right?

88
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,640
About earlier, I overreacted.

89
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,810
Actually, now's the time
you should be overreacting more.

90
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,380
Young Chae...

91
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,250
- She's on the edge of a cliff.
- Is it because of Su A?

92
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,650
- But I'm there for her.
- Can you really protect her?

93
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,420
Even if Su A, the Chairman,
and Vice Chairman Han come after her,

94
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,060
- can you protect her to the end?
- You don't trust me?

95
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,290
Do I look like a guy who can't even
protect his own woman?

96
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,860
It takes more than good intentions,
Se Hoon.

97
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,900
Aren't you a little overprotective
of your sister?

98
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,310
Maybe it's time you got married.

99
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,610
Does that medicine
really help her get pregnant?

100
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,920
- How crude.
- What if she really gets pregnant?

101
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,660
Su A, you don't hold back, do you?

102
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,530
You can't say whatever you think.
Not as part of the Kunhyang family.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,230
I'll be more careful.

104
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,930
I didn't realize
you felt that way, Su A.

105
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,400
I'm just worried
that having a baby...

106
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,870
might take away
the fun of newlywed life.

107
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,110
I totally agree.
Who has kids right away anymore?

108
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,140
It's so old-fashioned.

109
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,960
This melon is very sweet.

110
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,100
Look at her laying it on thick.

111
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,210
Look at that little brat's face.
Darn it.

112
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,350
You two look so lovely together.

113
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,550
Anyone could tell at a glance.
It's written all over your faces.

114
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,760
A beautiful mother-daughter pair
who are each other's spitting image.

115
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,930
Thank you, Chairman Gong.

116
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,600
Give me a break.

117
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,700
We're a look-alike
mother-daughter pair too.

118
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,440
How should I put it?
Like a sexy type...

119
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,840
and a simple one.

120
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,610
Give me a break.

121
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,650
You little...

122
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,050
- Chairman Gong, can we talk?
- Me?

123
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,090
Sure.

124
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,960
Excuse me.

125
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,730
Were you itching to see
how the pretend play is going?

126
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,100
I set the stage,
so I have to check on the show.

127
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,700
Aren't you worried at all?

128
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,670
Your daughter, Young Chae,
is really struggling right now.

129
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,440
I have proof Young Chae
wrote the anonymous post.

130
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,810
What is it?

131
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,250
That fake Su A has got some nerve.

132
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,620
No. She's cunning.

133
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,250
What has Su A done now?

134
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,490
She stole Young Chae's phone.

135
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,220
That's the smoking gun.

136
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,890
- Brilliant move.
- What?

137
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,660
The fake Su A just stabbed
your daughter in the back.

138
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,200
You still don't know me very well,
do you?

139
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,770
To me, business comes before blood.
I don't care about means or methods.

140
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,270
I'm on whichever side is winning.

141
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,410
My own daughter is no exception.

142
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,110
Even animals protect their young.
You're something, Gong Nan Sook.

143
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,220
You're too much, even for me.

144
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,990
You're not going to cast
Young Chae aside, are you?

145
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,590
That's an interesting question.

146
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,960
If it's proven Young Chae
tarnished my wife's reputation,

147
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,000
I may have to kick her out
of this family.

148
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,100
That makes me curious too.
I wonder how I'd react.

149
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,770
If you plan on kicking
my Young Chae out,

150
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,580
you'd better be prepared
to kiss our business goodbye.

151
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,580
No matter how heartless a mother
I may be.

152
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Of course, we'd never let it happen.
Absolutely not.

153
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,390
What's your game?
Is this about Jung Won?

154
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,130
You don't want Joo Young Chae to be
kicked out of the Kunhyang family?

155
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,300
Why did you blackmail Chairman Jin?

156
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,440
Were you eavesdropping?

157
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,170
Unbelievable.
You'll do anything, won't you?

158
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,570
Just answer my question.

159
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,580
Blackmailing is nothing.
I'm prepared to do much worse.

160
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,010
Do you know what I had to go through
to get the fake Young Chae...

161
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,750
marry to Jin Se Hoon?

162
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,050
If she gets kicked out,

163
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,650
three percent of my shares
will go down the drain, you fool.

164
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,790
It's always about the stocks
with you.

165
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,560
Stop making me repeat myself.

166
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,860
So what now?

167
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,890
You found Young Chae's phone?

168
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,360
And you gave it to Jin Tae Seok?

169
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,360
In the annex, there's a room
Cha Jung Won uses by herself.

170
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,570
- That's where I found it.
- And you're sure it's Young Chae's?

171
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm telling you it's hers. Goodness.

172
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,340
She must think she really is
the daughter-in-law of a rich family.

173
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,340
It looks like
she has multiple phones.

174
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,710
- It'll be exposed soon.
- I can hear you...

175
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,280
calculating in your head.

176
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,020
Just a second. Let me think.

177
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,960
At the Kunhyang Association meeting,
drop a bombshell.

178
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,710
What did you talk about...

179
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,440
with Gong Nan Sook?

180
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,510
It was nothing.

181
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,580
I bet you said our daughter-in-law
has become a real handful.

182
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,220
I told her she's on the verge
of being thrown out.

183
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,850
Honey.

184
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,820
Gong Nan Sook was already prepared.
She didn't seem surprised at all.

185
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,660
She acted like what Su A did
was a good thing.

186
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,160
What did Su A do?

187
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,170
You see...

188
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,910
What are those two plotting again?

189
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,450
I'm telling you it's hers.

190
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,350
She must think she really is
the daughter-in-law of a rich family.

191
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,050
It looks like
she has multiple phones.

192
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,920
It'll be exposed soon.

193
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,220
I can hear you
calculating in your head.

194
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,560
Okay. At the Kunhyang Association meeting,
drop a bombshell.

195
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,700
So the Kunhyang Association meeting
is their D-Day.

196
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,300
Here, drink up.

197
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,610
Your mother worked hard
to get this fertility medicine.

198
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,940
It should be the perfect temperature
to drink.

199
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,010
Young Chae. What are you...

200
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,820
I'm sorry. I acted without thinking.

201
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,120
Don't you...

202
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,790
want to have my child?

203
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,120
That's not true. I want one too.

204
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,620
It doesn't seem that way to me.

205
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,190
I'm going to bed.

206
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,170
So, Young Chae...

207
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,800
wrote the anonymous post
with a separate phone?

208
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
And that phone...

209
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,740
was found by Su A?

210
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,680
- Would Young Chae really do that?
- I'm almost positive.

211
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,980
I suspected it, but...

212
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,950
So you hate me now, don't you?

213
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,220
You despise me
for abandoning my daughter...

214
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,420
and for betraying my ex-husband
and running away?

215
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,820
I can't say you're wrong.

216
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,660
- If I were Su A...
- If you were Su A?

217
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,530
I would never forgive you. Ever.

218
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,230
I...

219
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,800
I needed to be worthy of you.

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,210
I had to change my name
and my entire background.

221
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,940
I made you that way.
It's all my fault.

222
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,710
You're right, I did blame you.

223
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,250
But...

224
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,480
I wanted it too.

225
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,720
Hye Ra, don't blame yourself.

226
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,890
Why does our daughter-in-law want
to drag me down to the gutter?

227
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,320
That might not be the case.

228
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,690
Are you sure?

229
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,400
Young Chae.

230
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,170
I can't forgive her.

231
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,780
Medicine to help me conceive?

232
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,980
I bet it's poison.

233
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,850
I'm surrounded by enemies.

234
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,650
Even Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

235
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,020
doesn't pretend
to be on my side anymore.

236
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,760
If even Se Hoon shuts me out...

237
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,530
Did you hate the medicine
your mother brought so much...

238
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,830
that you threw the whole thing out?

239
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,230
Or...

240
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,700
does this mean you don't want
to have my child that badly?

241
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,510
- You used to be sincere with me.
- And now,

242
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,480
you don't think so anymore?

243
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,680
- If you want my child, then why...
- Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

244
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,220
I'm done being my mom's puppet.

245
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,490
So because it was medicine
from your mother,

246
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,290
you refused to take it?

247
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,190
This is about our child.
I want us to conceive out of love.

248
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,670
I'm sorry. I misunderstood.

249
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,470
No, I'm sorry...

250
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,240
for upsetting my sweet husband.

251
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,480
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

252
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,350
Hello.

253
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,320
Why did you want to see me
all of a sudden?

254
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,730
What do you mean, why?

255
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,060
I just wanted to have
a nice, private chat with you.

256
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,600
Just the two of us, ma'am?

257
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,000
He should be here by now.

258
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,070
You wanted to see me?

259
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,180
- Se Mi.
- Ha Neul?

260
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,550
- Did you call her here?
- I thought we could eat together,

261
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,710
just the three of us.

262
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,320
Our reservation is soon. Let's go.

263
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,850
Let's go, Ha Neul.

264
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,100
Devein the prawns using a skewer.

265
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,740
Miss, you can't be so careless.

266
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,810
Just do it for me, Chef Hong.
You always do.

267
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,310
Have you forgotten who you are?

268
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,080
- You're Su A.
- Gosh, whatever.

269
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,120
I've never cooked before.

270
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,220
A dish contains the heart
of its cook.

271
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,220
But you cook with much care,
Ms. Young Chae.

272
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,130
Thank you, Chef Hong.

273
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,300
At the Kunhyang Association meeting,
drop a bombshell.

274
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,950
The beef omakase was delicious.

275
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,850
Thank you for the meal,
Chairman Gong.

276
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,850
You barely touched your food.

277
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,790
You were too busy
staring at CEO Joo.

278
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,030
That's enough, Mother.

279
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,230
- What? What did I do?
- Why do you keep pushing Se Mi...

280
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,830
- and me together?
- But I wouldn't mind that.

281
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,040
Oh, my, Se Mi, you're adorable.

282
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,640
Isn't she, CEO Joo?

283
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,610
Let me be clear. I have
no personal feelings for Se Mi.

284
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,880
I won't rush you, Ha Neul.

285
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,220
Right, it's not like we're asking
for a commitment right now.

286
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,150
Just meet up for a meal and a chat
every now and then, like today.

287
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,220
What's not to love?

288
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,220
That reminds me. There's
a Kunhyang Association meeting...

289
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,130
at the Kunhyang house today, right?

290
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,190
That's right.

291
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,760
I wonder if I should eat dinner
before I go...

292
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,300
It would be perfect
if you two went together.

293
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,870
- You want to go with me, Ha Neul?
- It's not my place to go.

294
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,810
This is Young Chae's first event
as the family's new daughter-in-law.

295
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,810
It's her debut
as the Kunhyang family's host.

296
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,410
It'd mean a lot if you were there
as her brother.

297
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,510
It would be so reassuring for her.

298
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,850
Mom.

299
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,520
I'm leaving soon. I'll be there
before the meeting starts.

300
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,660
I'm just thinking
about who to go with.

301
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,600
Young Chae and Su A are about to
have a knock-down, drag-out fight.

302
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,500
I'm dying to see who wins.

303
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,070
Oh, my.

304
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,740
I don't know which one to pick.
You look so good in all of them.

305
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,010
- You choose, Su A.
- You pick for me, Mom.

306
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,110
You want me to?

307
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,650
How about this one, Mom?

308
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,320
It's too flashy.

309
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,860
Mom...

310
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,660
Now, what about jewelry?

311
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,700
You can do this.

312
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,370
You're today's star, Young Chae.

313
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,640
Today's star is you, Su A.

314
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,110
Let me see.

315
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,580
- It's a bit much, isn't it?
- You can wear what you want, Su A.

316
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,180
You look so beautiful.

317
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,680
So do you, Mom.

318
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,750
- I do?
- Yes.

319
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,820
Welcome.

320
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,190
It's a pleasure to see you all,
Madam Sa, Director Kim, and CEO Ko.

321
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,930
Oh, my. I had no idea
you'd be here, Chairman Jin.

322
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,200
It's an honor.

323
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,070
I hope I'm not intruding.

324
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,510
You should just join
the Kunhyang Association, Chairman.

325
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,110
I'd love that.

326
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,350
And she is our host for the evening.

327
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,050
My daughter, Su A.

328
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,960
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
I'm Jin Su A.

329
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,090
She's beautiful, isn't she?
My daughter, Su A.

330
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,600
You're so beautiful.

331
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,430
She's every bit as beautiful
as they say.

332
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,700
You're too kind.

333
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:29,670
Please have a seat and chat.
Dinner is almost ready.

334
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,010
How have you all been?

335
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,840
Vice President Jin,
you look even greater.

336
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,550
It's all thanks to
my dear Young Chae.

337
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,550
Thank you for all your hard work.

338
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,360
Dinner is served.

339
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,930
So, Su A, what do you do?

340
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,530
I'm a fashion designer.

341
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,270
I'll be starting at the Design Team
at Kunhyang Fashion soon.

342
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,210
You got a little help from your mom?

343
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,840
Just the Design Team?

344
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,810
From what I hear,
she was abandoned as a child...

345
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,020
She just reunited
with her long-lost mother.

346
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,320
If I were in her shoes, I'd want
the entire Kunhyang Group...

347
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,630
Madam Sa, you still have...

348
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,290
a fun and dramatic way
of putting things.

349
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,530
As if Kunhyang Group is
some mom-and-pop shop.

350
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,470
Su A's designs were a huge success
in Paris and Milan recently.

351
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,610
What?

352
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,240
I don't believe
I've ever heard the name Jin Su A.

353
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,810
She was working anonymously.

354
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,510
She wanted to be recognized
for her talent alone.

355
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,150
I wanted to test my talent alone
on the world stage.

356
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,190
With my designs?

357
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,050
That witch.

358
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,730
Trying to be mysterious these days
just gets you buried.

359
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,730
You need to
promote yourself aggressively.

360
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,800
You're really bold.

361
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,370
It must be because she's your daughter,
Vice Chairman Han.

362
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,240
Blood is thicker than water, right?
Her beauty, talent, and character.

363
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,570
She takes right after
our Vice Chairman Han.

364
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,480
You're so incredible, Chairman Jin.
I don't know how you can bear it.

365
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,950
At an official gathering
such as this,

366
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,050
I've introduced Su A as my daughter.

367
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,820
Let that be my answer to you.

368
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,790
Such a romantic, as always.

369
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,060
I'm so envious of you,
Vice Chairman Han.

370
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,900
There's something else
I'm curious about.

371
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,940
About that anonymous post.

372
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,710
Falsifying your academic record
is one thing,

373
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,840
but rumor has it
you stole paintings...

374
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,450
from the artist, Hwang Mi Soo.

375
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,550
What's the real story?

376
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,990
What good would it do
to just deny it?

377
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,290
Time will tell.

378
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,460
That's what I thought.

379
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,700
You would never do that,
Vice Chairman Han.

380
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,730
Of course not.

381
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,300
I wonder who would spread
such ridiculous fake news.

382
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,140
Just tell them you did it, Jung Won.

383
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,420
All right, selfie time!

384
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,560
- Mom, let's treasure this moment.
- Should we?

385
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,520
One, two, three.

386
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,130
Just the two of us?

387
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,560
One, two, three.

388
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,160
It came out great!

389
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,070
Let me see.

390
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,170
That's got to be Ki Beom.

391
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,840
That chowhound is probably asking
what's for dinner.

392
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,150
What is this?

393
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,450
That shameless little brat.

394
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,720
She sent these
just to rub it in my face.

395
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,530
Darn it.

396
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,130
They're probably stuffing their faces
at some huge feast.

397
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,070
I have half a mind to storm in there
and flip the whole table.

398
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,270
You called for me, Chairman Gong?

399
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,910
- Manager Gu, are you going deaf?
- No, ma'am.

400
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,380
It's just that...

401
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,080
When you're hungry,

402
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,220
- you have trouble hearing me?
- You hit the nail on the head.

403
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,150
- You're something else. Sit down.
- I'm sorry?

404
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:40,460
I hate eating alone.
Sit here and let me vent at you.

405
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,230
I'm honored.

406
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,330
How crude.
Were you starving or something?

407
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,310
You should come sit down too, honey.

408
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,410
That's where a daughter-in-law
should be.

409
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,780
For the first year of marriage,

410
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,350
she's not allowed to sit
with the guests.

411
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,390
I thought being a daughter-in-law
in this family was a grand position.

412
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,360
You must have it so tough.

413
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,590
I'm fine, Su A.

414
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,800
Then I'll stand. Come here.

415
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,430
Jin Se Hoon.

416
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,940
- What about your mother's position?
- If she's seen bothering my wife,

417
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,370
all these ladies
will start to gossip.

418
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,240
You should be the one
looking out for her.

419
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,680
Isn't that right, Mother?

420
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,650
I told you, I'm fine.

421
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,420
Se Hoon, please, just sit down.

422
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,020
Oh, my, Vice President Jin.

423
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,950
I could just fall for you.

424
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,490
He's so sweet. Don't you all agree?

425
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,020
He really is.

426
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,730
Go on, have a seat.

427
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,060
Is the main dish ready?

428
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,460
Oh, yes.

429
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,950
What's wrong with these prawns?

430
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,400
How can we serve food like this
to our guests?

431
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,770
Oh, no.

432
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,440
I think Young Chae
added the wrong ingredient.

433
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,710
Did you cook this yourself,
Young Chae?

434
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,610
I'm sorry, Mother.
It was my mistake...

435
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,320
This sharp tang
is actually wonderful.

436
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,750
Oh, my, the birth of a new recipe!

437
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,660
As head of the kitchen,
the mistake was mine.

438
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,230
I've remade it
with the greatest care.

439
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,470
We ask
for your generous understanding.

440
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,940
Now, this is
how it's supposed to taste.

441
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,950
For a moment there,
I thought Vice Chairman Han...

442
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,550
had ruined it with vinegar
on purpose.

443
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,080
Say that again, Manager Hwang.

444
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,550
The anonymous post was made
directly from this phone.

445
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,950
We found traces
that the records were then deleted.

446
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,390
So you're saying
it's 100 percent certain?

447
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,690
That's correct.

448
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,420
Honey.

449
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,070
It is time for the Kunhyang Association
members to head home.

450
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,540
Will you be all right?

451
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,710
Go on in. I'll get going.

452
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,410
Come on, do you really have to be
like this?

453
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,550
- You can just pop in for a second.
- It's Kunhyang Association meeting.

454
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,620
Why would I go in there?
With you, of all people?

455
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,120
Let's not add fuel
to the ridiculous rumors.

456
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,390
We can make it the truth.

457
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,860
What?

458
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,460
I really like you, Ha Neul.

459
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,600
Se Mi.

460
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,780
CEO Joo, are you two dating?

461
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,010
- Yes, we are!
- No, sir, we're not.

462
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,230
You called for me, Mother?

463
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,500
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

464
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,870
- Pardon?
- To embarrass me...

465
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,600
before the members
of the Kunhyang Association,

466
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,270
you tampered with the food?

467
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
It was a mistake.

468
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,080
- I'm sorry.
- Shut it!

469
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,420
A mistake is still my fault.

470
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,380
I'll be careful to make sure
it never happens again...

471
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,460
We found you wrote...

472
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,630
the anonymous post using that phone,
and then deleted the history.

473
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,600
Your father-in-law
confirmed it himself!

474
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,280
This is Han Hye Ra.

475
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,450
Come and get your daughter,
Chairman Gong.

476
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,790
Young Chae is no longer
a daughter-in-law...

477
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,020
of the Kunhyang family.

478
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,230
(A Graceful Liar)

479
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,900
They say you can't hide your roots.

480
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,500
I thought you were a bear cub,
but you turned out to be a fox cub.

481
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,640
Mom, it's all my fault.
She tampered with the food...

482
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,440
and wrote that anonymous post
on a separate phone.

483
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,540
That's because I showed up
out of the blue.

484
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,510
Please forgive Young Chae.

485
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,650
Stay away from my daughter!

486
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,450
But it's true!
Mother lied about her entire past!

487
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,320
Why is she still here?
Get that out of my sight now!

488
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,820
It's only right to stop now.

489
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,820
It's my life.

490
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,990
You can't order me around, CEO Joo.

491
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,490
Don't tell me you have feelings
for Cha Jung Won.

492
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,060
Whatever it is you want,
I'll take care of it for you.

493
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,660
To me,

494
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,860
you're a woman.

495
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,230
