1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,170
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,440
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,310
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,920
Here's a little scoop for you.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,090
Grace Han's art style is identical
to that of a disappeared artist.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,790
There was an article about it back then,
but my editor killed it.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,230
"The Vanished Artist, Hwang Mi Soo,"

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,140
"and Strange Parallels
with Grace Han."

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,110
"Artist Han Hye Ra's style
is drawing comparisons..."

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,810
"to Hwang Mi Soo, who suddenly
vanished from New York's art scene."

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,750
"Hwang Mi Soo was
a prolific artist,"

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,120
"but all traces of her vanished
in the early 2000s."

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,950
"Some are even claiming that
Hwang Mi Soo's works..."

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,360
"are identical to those
of Han Hye Ra."

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,560
(The Vanished Artist, Hwang Mi Soo,
and Strange Parallels with Grace Han)

16
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,930
Grace Han?

17
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,070
Are you an even bigger fraud
than I am?

18
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,610
When you learn
that the daughter you left...

19
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,040
is now your daughter-in-law,

20
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,650
will you still be able to wear...

21
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,680
that same beautiful, gentle smile?

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,660
What are you doing in here so late?

23
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,770
(Ha Neul)

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Ha Neul?

25
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,620
What's up at this hour?

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
Is it about Se Mi?

27
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,120
I was just thinking
I might've painted you wrongly.

28
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,090
Now that it's finished,
you don't like it?

29
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,830
I should've captured what was hidden
even deeper inside you.

30
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,230
Do I seem like I have
a lot of secrets?

31
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,730
Doesn't everyone have secrets?

32
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,970
- It's just...
- Just what?

33
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,940
I was hoping we could share them.

34
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,110
I'm afraid it would be too hard
on you.

35
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,120
Just call me Young Chae
like a daughter.

36
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,890
A daughter-in-law is a daughter
in a way.

37
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,190
I wish I were your real daughter.

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,530
What?

39
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,030
A mother's heart is like a tree
that's weathered many years, right?

40
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,500
Even if it's chopped down
and buried,

41
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,310
they say it endures
to wait for its child.

42
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,940
Like tree rings, it watches them
from beginning to end.

43
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,340
That's a mother.

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,010
Even if you're uprooted,
you have to run to your child.

45
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,220
If it means you can save your child,

46
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,420
you'd gladly give your own life.

47
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,590
That's what a mother is.

48
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,490
But what about you?

49
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,200
Why weren't you a mother like that?

50
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,970
I want to paint it again.
I didn't quite capture your heart.

51
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,470
What are you doing?
That's my painting now.

52
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,410
Mother, you should come see this.

53
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,080
You too, Young Chae. Hurry.

54
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,590
(Episode 34)

55
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,790
Se Mi.

56
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,390
What's wrong? Was she drinking?

57
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Yes.

58
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,260
She likely drank too much
with her friends.

59
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,660
Where's her room?

60
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,130
Se Hoon should be the one
to take her.

61
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,040
She's old enough to know better.

62
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,210
Why is she acting
so out of character?

63
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,750
I wonder what's bothering her.

64
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,160
To help Se Mi with her hangover
tomorrow,

65
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,620
I should make some bean sprout soup
in the morning.

66
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,190
With some octopus.

67
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Mom.

68
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,560
Don't abandon me.

69
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,410
Mom.

70
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,440
Don't abandon me.

71
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,650
She showed up at your office, drunk?

72
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,620
Did Se Mi confess her love to you
or something?

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,260
She said something a little strange.

74
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,860
Did she say Mother had
another daughter or something?

75
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,300
Se Hoon.

76
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,300
You heard that too, Se Hoon?

77
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,130
Is she having a second puberty?

78
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,270
My mother's been busy,
so Se Mi gets less attention now.

79
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,270
She's throwing a huge tantrum.

80
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,680
But it felt like more than that.

81
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,950
Since her brother married
and I'm here,

82
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,620
she must feel left out.

83
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,250
Don't worry,
I'll take good care of Se Mi.

84
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,600
It's about Se Mi.

85
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,200
She seems very interested in
Ha Neul, doesn't she?

86
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,270
She's just comfortable with him,

87
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,440
like family,
since he's Se Hoon's friend.

88
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,710
Se Mi has no plans
to ever get married.

89
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,050
But you can't control
matters of the heart.

90
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,820
Someone like Joo Ha Neul
wouldn't be a bad match for Se Mi.

91
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,250
But becoming in-laws twice over
would be a problem.

92
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,450
The main problem is that
he's Chairman Gong's son.

93
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,160
As for that family,

94
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,090
Joo Young Chae is more than enough
for us to handle.

95
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,730
Gong Nan Sook.

96
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,170
You called her by her name.

97
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,100
From "our daughter-in-law"
to just "Joo Young Chae."

98
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
Did I?

99
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,350
Who touched my painting?
Did Young Chae do this?

100
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,290
What's going on?

101
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,390
What's wrong?

102
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,530
You said you wanted to repaint it,

103
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,970
and this is what you did to it?

104
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,440
Mother, why are you suspecting
Young Chae?

105
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,280
She was painting you as her model.
Why would she ruin it?

106
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,410
I did it.

107
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,320
You may have been the model,
but it's my painting.

108
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,820
If I'm not happy with it,
I can erase it or toss it out.

109
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,160
Without even a single word to me,

110
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,030
did you even think about
how hurt I would be?

111
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,560
Did you ever consider
your mother-in-law's perspective?

112
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,930
You were my model
before you were my mother-in-law.

113
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,630
Did you do this on purpose?

114
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,300
- Mother.
- Honey.

115
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,210
I want to paint it again.

116
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,370
It only showed your
dignified and gentle surface.

117
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,550
The true maternal love of a mother
who'd give her life for her child.

118
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,050
That's what I want to capture.

119
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,020
Would you like to go work out
together? It’s been a while.

120
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,690
It'll be a good change of pace.

121
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,430
- Go by yourself.
- Come on...

122
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,970
I'm asking you on a mother-son date.

123
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,730
If you say no, I'll pout.

124
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,070
I'll go get changed
and be right out.

125
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,690
How can you sit there drinking tea
after upsetting your mother-in-law?

126
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,730
You're Gong Nan Sook's daughter,
as expected.

127
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,930
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,830
I looked at the painting again,
and it just wasn't good enough.

129
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,840
That's artists for you.
Their work is theirs alone.

130
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,300
Even if she's your mother-in-law,
as your model,

131
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,870
she can't tell you what to do.

132
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,370
Exactly.

133
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,080
You'd be very successful
in business.

134
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,450
Thank you for understanding, Father.

135
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,350
Find a moment and apologize
to the Vice Chairman.

136
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,490
Not as an artist,
but as her daughter-in-law.

137
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,730
It's so refreshing.

138
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,340
It clears my head
of all the clutter.

139
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,410
You were upset with Young Chae,
weren't you?

140
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,380
She's just very attached to her art
and takes great pride in it.

141
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,480
So please, try to be generous
and understand.

142
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,620
We came here to work out,
so let's just work out.

143
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,450
I guess it's been a while.
My muscles must be in shock.

144
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,220
I figured as much,
so I came prepared.

145
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,830
What is it?

146
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,290
Ta-da!

147
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,830
It's a health supplement I take
when I play tennis or go jogging.

148
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,870
You haven't taken yours lately,
have you?

149
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,140
You're so thoughtful.

150
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,810
Make sure you take yours.
Worry about yourself for a change.

151
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,840
What about you?

152
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,680
I've got mine too.

153
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,450
At the same time?

154
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,780
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

155
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,900
Let me get that.

156
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,870
Don't skip it because you're young.
Make it part of your routine.

157
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,130
You too, Mother.

158
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,070
You need to keep your legs strong
so you can run with me again.

159
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,010
Ready to run again, son?

160
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,410
Let's start together...

161
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,490
I barely slept a wink last night.

162
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,330
My handsome husband,
you've aged ten years overnight.

163
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,500
Mi Hyang, look at you.
Your dark circles reach your chin.

164
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,930
She kept going in and out all night.

165
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,070
And why was she blasting
her music so loud?

166
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,800
I was so desperate
that I woke the guy...

167
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,170
at the furniture store
to make an order.

168
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,810
Is she still in the shower?

169
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,740
She's been in there
for over an hour.

170
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,380
Does she think this is a spa?

171
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,580
What's she doing,
exfoliating her body?

172
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,790
What's wrong?

173
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,990
Breakfast?

174
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,460
I'm not a breakfast person.

175
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,200
Seriously, I slept curled in a ball
all night, and my whole body aches.

176
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,500
I feel like I need a massage.

177
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,700
You'll sleep like a baby tonight.

178
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,370
So the rest of us
can finally get some sleep.

179
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,710
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

180
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,640
Go on, take a look.
Your wish has been granted.

181
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,710
Go on.

182
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
A bed?

183
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,150
Ta-da!

184
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,360
- Only a mattress...
- You'll sleep well on this, right?

185
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,290
- It's like a football field, right?
- But where's the bed frame?

186
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,930
You call this thing a bed?

187
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,760
You really have a way with words.

188
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,530
We went to all this trouble for you.

189
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,100
So your grand gesture is
about the size of a soy sauce dish.

190
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,570
Soy sauce?

191
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,670
Fine. I'll show you just how good
soy sauce can be.

192
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,610
Follow me.

193
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,220
That's a bit much.

194
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Here.

195
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,090
Mix it in with the rice and try it.

196
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,730
Just eat it and stop complaining.

197
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,630
It's so good, you wouldn't notice
if someone died next to you.

198
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,630
Here.

199
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,500
Just have one bite. It's so good.

200
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,630
When you came over
with Jung Won back in high school,

201
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,230
you loved this soy-marinated crab.

202
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,000
I did?

203
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,830
See? Your taste hasn't
changed a bit.

204
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,920
Who eats marinated crab
for breakfast?

205
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,350
It's so fishy.

206
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,020
Jung Won is such a pain,
and her family annoys me too.

207
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,360
(Diploma, Name: Hwang Mi Soo)

208
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,800
The school she attended...

209
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,270
is the same as
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra's.

210
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,740
Apparently, Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
didn't actually graduate from there.

211
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,580
We couldn't find a diploma,

212
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,250
and she wasn't
in any of the yearbook photos.

213
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,450
- Are you sure?
- I've been after her past...

214
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,480
for ten years.

215
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,150
It's just that every article
I write gets buried.

216
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,890
What about Hwang Mi Soo?

217
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,730
That's the thing.
There's no trace of her.

218
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,500
I looked for her for three years
while I was after Han Hye Ra,

219
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,530
but I gave up.

220
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,270
It was tough just trying to get by.

221
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,730
What else do you have?

222
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,740
Well, there is one
very interesting piece of intel.

223
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,440
A member of Hwang Mi Soo's family...

224
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,880
is an insider
in the Kunhyang family.

225
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,880
That's all for today.

226
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,820
An insider in the Kunhyang family?

227
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,050
Who could it be?

228
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,800
You again? What is it now?

229
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,000
(Kunhyang Group)

230
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,470
Who was that rookie designer
I was looking for?

231
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,800
The director of a gallery
in Le Marais, Paris,

232
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,370
sent us a photo.

233
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,170
It was Cha Jung Won.

234
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,510
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

235
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,620
I need to meet her.

236
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,090
Cha Jung Won could be Su A.

237
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,890
Are you Su A?

238
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,990
- The music box owner.
- What?

239
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,630
Me? Su A?

240
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,670
Who's that?

241
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,210
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
had another daughter.

242
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Her name is Su A.

243
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,550
I'm Vice Chairman Han's
daughter-in-law.

244
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,750
How could you even come
up with that? Seriously.

245
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,850
You've got quite the imagination.

246
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,420
Or are you so lost
in your own lies...

247
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,790
that you can't tell
what's real anymore?

248
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,090
You were just agonizing over...

249
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,690
how I stole your name, life,
and your mom,

250
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,300
and now you're saying
I'm my mother-in-law's daughter?

251
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,000
Give me a break.

252
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,240
What if the mother who left you
was Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra?

253
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,610
Isn't that a thrilling thought?

254
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,940
If I were her real daughter,

255
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,240
why would I bother pretending
to be Joo Young Chae?

256
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,610
Kunhyang Group...

257
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,480
would be mine for the taking.

258
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,320
But if Chairman Jin Tae Seok
finds out before then,

259
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,890
you and your mother would both
be thrown out of Kunhyang.

260
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
Are you really concerned...

261
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,320
about a mother and daughter
in your imagination now?

262
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,990
If I'm Vice Chairman Han's
real daughter,

263
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,830
then what about you?

264
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,530
You couldn't even pretend
to be Cha Jung Won anymore.

265
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,510
Would you have to go back
to being Joo Young Chae?

266
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,410
Is that even possible?

267
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,680
Or will you just vanish
into thin air?

268
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,870
- Is Young Chae causing trouble?
- Don't even get me started.

269
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,010
She demanded a bed in her room.

270
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,670
She said she wouldn't eat breakfast,

271
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,980
but then she gobbled up
the soy-marinated crab in no time.

272
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,180
- But she's such a picky eater.
- That's not important right now.

273
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,990
Young Sun found out.

274
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Found out what?

275
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,760
She came in the middle of the night
and slapped your dad's face.

276
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,460
She asked why he let everyone think
her living child was dead.

277
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,300
Dad said I was alive?

278
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,940
Could this girl...

279
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,810
be Su A?

280
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,280
Have you had a chance
to look over my portfolio?

281
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,750
Of course.

282
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,050
I thought this was a good sign since
you suggested meeting me in person.

283
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,130
"The rookie designer making waves
in Paris and Milan fashion circles."

284
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,700
"She moves freely..."

285
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,000
"between design, street art,
and painting,"

286
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,670
"breathing life into her work."

287
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,040
Am I right, Ms. Cha Jung Won?

288
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,140
You've certainly done your research,
Vice Chairman.

289
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,480
I'm not a fan of the limelight,
so I've been keeping a low profile.

290
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,780
You're more than qualified...

291
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,920
to be a designer
at Kunhyang Fashion.

292
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,650
Designer Cha Jung Won.

293
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,060
We'll set a start date later.

294
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,660
But there's something
I'd like to ask.

295
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,300
By any chance,

296
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,330
have you heard...

297
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,070
of a girl named Su A?

298
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,610
You told her that Su A got married
and went to study in the US,

299
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,910
and that you adopted Cha Jung Won?

300
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,750
Why on earth would you
tell such an absurd lie?

301
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,480
Then, was I supposed to tell her
that Su A is you,

302
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,590
and that you're now Joo Young Chae
and are her daughter-in-law?

303
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:14,960
Did she believe what you said?

304
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,730
She didn't buy a single word of it.

305
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,860
She's going to find out
who I am soon enough.

306
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,340
What are we going to do?
Chaos is going to break loose.

307
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,270
That woman will want
to hide me again.

308
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,770
If my existence comes to light...

309
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,110
and Chairman Jin Tae Seok finds out,

310
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,910
Han Hye Ra's life
will come crumbling down too.

311
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,180
She'll just abandon me again.

312
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,120
- Brutally.
- No, surely not...

313
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,960
I'm telling you, she was crying
and begging to see you.

314
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,860
I will never let her do that.

315
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,960
She can apologize a million times,
but I won't forgive her.

316
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,530
I'm going to be the one
who leaves her.

317
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,200
I'll push her right off a cliff.

318
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,380
She'll wish she were
in the abyss instead.

319
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,180
And I'll make her regret it dearly.

320
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,050
I'll stake my entire life on it.

321
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,350
Did you and my Su A...

322
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,720
spend time together
when you were kids?

323
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,060
Cha Jung Won...

324
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,260
Are you my Su A?

325
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
Su A?

326
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,940
I did change my name to Jung Won
when I was a kid.

327
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,710
I wonder if my name
was Su A back then.

328
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,210
I can't really remember.

329
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,650
It's weird, isn't it?

330
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,150
Whenever I see you,

331
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,360
I'm reminded of my mom
who left me when I was seven.

332
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,060
- Why?
- I don't know.

333
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,930
She promised she'd come back soon.

334
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,600
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a moment.

335
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,350
I have to find out...

336
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:18,950
if Cha Jung Won is actually Su A.

337
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,530
My phone!

338
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,160
What if my mom or brother calls?

339
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,100
She could find out
I'm not Cha Jung Won.

340
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,370
(Kunhyang Group)

341
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,540
A man who is so powerful...

342
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,710
that he could pluck a bird
from the sky...

343
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,580
and crush anyone
who gets in his way.

344
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,080
That's the Jin Tae Seok I know.

345
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,250
So why are you such a gentle lamb
only when it comes to Han Hye Ra?

346
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,350
Are you jealous?

347
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,320
Because I'm capable of devotion
and you're not?

348
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,590
Devotion, my foot.

349
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,600
You gave up on that nonsense
a long time ago, Chairman Gong.

350
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,770
It's easier to live that way.
You go on about love and devotion,

351
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,770
and end up with some useless kid.
It gives me a headache.

352
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:18,340
Stop beating around the bush
and get to the point.

353
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,710
You know who Su A is,
don't you, Chairman Jin?

354
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:26,180
- Aren't we informal?
- Let's drop titles and make a deal.

355
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,490
What are you scheming now?

356
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,560
Have you found
Han Hye Ra's daughter?

357
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,790
Cut the nonsense!

358
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,260
Fine, have it your way.

359
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,760
I'll just have to find her myself.

360
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
And when you do?

361
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,310
It will stay between us forever.

362
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,180
You really are something else,
Gong Nan Sook.

363
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,580
Listen before you laugh,
Jin Tae Seok.

364
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,720
We need to create
something together.

365
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,020
A fake Su A.

366
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,020
Go on.

367
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,360
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

368
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,270
What brings you here?

369
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,070
Why would you even ask that?

370
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,440
Can't a mother visit
her son's office?

371
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Would you like some tea?

372
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,910
No. Everywhere I go,
someone's offering me a drink.

373
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,250
Just today, I've had coffee,
Pu'er tea, herbal tea...

374
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,620
I must've downed about a dozen cups
on an empty stomach.

375
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,050
Come on, sit down.

376
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,060
So, how's business?
Did you get Jin Tae Seok's approval?

377
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,330
The presentation is almost finished.

378
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,300
That's all just a formality anyway.

379
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,240
I've got Jin Tae Seok
right in the palm of my hand.

380
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:00,480
So you can soar to success
with the Kunhyang family's backing.

381
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,680
I'll handle it myself,
Chairman Gong.

382
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,750
Don't tell me you're still sulking
about what happened last time.

383
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,220
A mother gives her child tough love
to help them succeed.

384
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,490
Why are you still so hung up
about it?

385
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,890
If you want what's best for me,
just watch from the sidelines.

386
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,730
So I can learn to stand
on my own two feet.

387
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,500
Fine. I'll just sit back and watch.

388
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,410
Ha Neul, sorry about yesterday...

389
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
Hello.

390
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,410
Goodness, Se Mi.

391
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,750
So, what brings you
to Ha Neul's office?

392
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,290
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

393
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,400
Jin Se Mi likes Ha Neul?

394
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,030
I knew it. The skies are on my side.

395
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,570
I'm in such a great mood!

396
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,740
We're in big trouble.

397
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,340
I was finally in a good mood.
What's all this about trouble?

398
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,350
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
thinks I'm Su A.

399
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,820
Calm down and tell me
exactly what happened.

400
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,680
Han Hye Ra took the teacup
you drank from?

401
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,850
She's definitely planning
to run a DNA test.

402
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,520
So Han Hye Ra really thinks
you're Su A.

403
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,090
The test will obviously show
that it's not me.

404
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,020
Then we need to make a move
before the results come out.

405
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,990
This has my toothbrush...

406
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,860
and a teacup with Cha Jung Won's
lipstick stain on it.

407
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,460
Min Jung.

408
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,470
You want me to get a DNA test?

409
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,870
I need to find out
if Cha Jung Won is Su A.

410
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,340
Wondering and worrying
about her every move isn't enough.

411
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,450
I can't take it anymore.

412
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,020
Simply feeling guilty
isn't enough anymore.

413
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,820
I'll ask your physician, Dr. Kim,
to handle it.

414
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,590
Make sure he's discreet.
And you get the results yourself.

415
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
What's this?

416
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,630
(A Graceful Liar)

417
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,800
Why did you hide the fact
that you had another daughter?

418
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,930
I'll heal her pain of abandonment.

419
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,670
No, I'll give her the world.

420
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,270
Where's Su A?

421
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,340
She'll turn up soon enough.

422
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,640
Who are they saying is Su A?

423
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,780
Who will they set up as an imposter?

424
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,580
How did you mess up 25 years ago?

425
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,210
She was Jo Mi Hyang's daughter!

426
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,720
Are you the daughter
that Han Hye Ra abandoned...

427
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,990
because she was so desperate
to be with Jin Tae Seok?

428
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,920
Did you come clean to Jung Won that
Han Young Sun is looking for her?

429
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,320
Don't worry.

430
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,460
There's no way Vice Chairman Han
will ever find out...

431
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,260
that Jung Won is Su A.

432
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,400
