1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,410
(All characters, locations, organizations,
and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,910
(This production followed all guidelines
for young actors.)

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,690
Are you okay?

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,910
Do you live around here?

6
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,150
Would you like to have some tea?

7
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,460
Where were you coming from?

8
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,730
I'm sorry to impose.

9
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,370
It's kind of a long story.

10
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,240
Oh, about the umbrella...

11
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,080
You've already paid me back.

12
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,350
But it looked like an expensive umbrella.

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,990
Let's use that as an excuse
to see each other more often.

14
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,160
Here, put your number in.

15
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,580
I'm Han Hye Ra.

16
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,140
Go on, save it.

17
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,950
(Episode 3)

18
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,600
Oh, right. This is Young Chae's house.

19
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,610
Young Chae, come and eat!

20
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,780
I don't usually eat breakfast.

21
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,680
At least have some soup.
It'll help with your hangover.

22
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
This is nice.

23
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,530
You need to marry a man
who can make you a good hangover soup.

24
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,760
Whatever.
The housekeeper will do that for me.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Then again,
you and I live in different worlds.

26
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
I forgot.

27
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,900
What?

28
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,270
We're at the same table in the same house,
having brunch.

29
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,740
How are we not in the same world?

30
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,840
Come on, you know.

31
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,550
We live in a world
where money determines your class.

32
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,880
Hey, there's no class system
between friends.

33
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,360
- The cheese, please.
- Sure.

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Here you go.

35
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,400
Want me to make some more coffee?

36
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,180
It's the middle of the day,
and there's still no food on the table.

37
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,780
Are you still in bed?

38
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,110
If you're so hungry, make it yourself.

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,680
Gosh.

40
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,230
Just heat this up for 30 minutes
before you eat.

41
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,900
This kid.

42
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,890
What? Goodness!

43
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,620
Oh my gosh, what is all this?

44
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,690
Did a secret angel come by
and cook all this?

45
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,840
Is there anything Jung Won can't do?

46
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,020
May you two be together
until your hair turns old and gray...

47
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,790
No, until your gray hair turns all white.
May you be together all of your days.

48
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,920
So stop worrying about me...

49
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,830
and just hurry up
and get married already, okay?

50
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,130
Oh, goodness.

51
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,160
I wonder who raised her so well.

52
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,270
Let's do it. Let's get it over with.

53
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,470
Get it over with?

54
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,740
You mean we should get married?

55
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,510
Yes.

56
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,120
Hey.

57
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,550
(Kunhyang Group)

58
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,330
I'm back from Changwon.

59
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,060
What did you find?

60
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,860
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,900
You said that her name was Cha Su A,
and she was 32.

62
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,640
And that her father runs a laundromat?

63
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,770
That wasn't her.

64
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,940
Her name was Cha Soon Hee.
She changed it as it sounded dated.

65
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,740
Her father passed away three years ago.

66
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,010
I've worked for you for over ten years,
ma'am.

67
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,220
If it was meant to be,
she'd have been found.

68
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,750
She could've studied abroad or moved away.
Or something else could have...

69
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,920
She's alive. I know she is.

70
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,530
I'll continue the search.

71
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,800
If I could have given up,
I would have done so already.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,370
You're still looking for Cha Ki Beom
and Jo Mi Hyang, right?

73
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,810
- Yes, ma'am.
- They may not run the laundromat anymore.

74
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,340
She might be living with them.

75
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,750
If not, they have to know
where my Su A is.

76
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,420
That saying, "It's a small world?"
It's a complete lie.

77
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,760
How can I not find her
after all these years?

78
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,100
No one else can know about this.

79
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,170
Understand?

80
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,440
You can trust me.

81
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,520
(25 years ago)

82
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,520
At that time of the murder,

83
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,920
Su A and I were out buying your ring.

84
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,860
They don't believe me. No...

85
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,460
They won't even listen to me.

86
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,870
- But the jeweler can be your witness.
- He said I was never even there.

87
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,940
He's lying.

88
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,240
There's no way out.

89
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,210
I'm completely trapped.

90
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,120
What about you?

91
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,080
You believe me, right?

92
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,860
The world doesn't care...

93
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,190
about the truth.

94
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,990
I don't care what anyone says,

95
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,730
as long as you believe me.

96
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,870
I believe you.

97
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,740
In you...

98
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,210
and in our Su A.

99
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,320
By 9:00 p.m. on the 25th.

100
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,790
Meet me at the Yangpyeong Villa.

101
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,730
If you're not there by then,

102
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,440
Young Sun,
I won't ever look for you again.

103
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,620
I must be crazy.

104
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,520
I must be losing my mind.

105
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,660
There's no way out.

106
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,230
I'm completely trapped.

107
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
I can't live my whole life
as the wife of a murderer.

108
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,500
And Su A...

109
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,370
I can't let her grow up
as a murderer's daughter.

110
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,510
I have to take her.

111
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,150
Su A!

112
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,480
Come on, wake up.

113
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,860
Just stay at Mi Hyang's for three days.

114
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,660
Mommy will come get you, I promise.

115
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,090
In just three sleeps?

116
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,770
Promise?

117
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I promise.

118
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,180
Mommy,

119
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,580
just three sleeps.

120
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,040
Su A. Let's go inside and eat now.

121
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,750
Su A, I'm hungry.

122
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,230
She and Ki Beom were so head over heels
for each other.

123
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,690
I can't imagine how frantic she must be.

124
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,000
She must be running all over town for him.

125
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,070
Once I get Tae Seok's permission,

126
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,940
I'll go get you, Su A.

127
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,640
Tae Seok...

128
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,010
will accept Su A, too.

129
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,850
After all, she's my daughter.

130
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,510
What are you doing?

131
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,780
What's up? Do you need something?

132
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,780
You still haven't given up
on being a designer?

133
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,620
It's just...

134
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,790
the only thing I'm good at.

135
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,760
Get me a coffee, will you?

136
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,290
An espresso?

137
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,300
With an extra shot.

138
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,700
Jung Won's just a high school graduate
who only dabbled in design.

139
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,230
She has no design career to speak of.

140
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,030
I went to the Royal Art School, so why?

141
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,140
Seriously, why?

142
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,250
You're invited to the NY Alumni mixer.

143
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,780
August 8, 6 p.m.,
at the Kunhyang Hotel Club.

144
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
From Ahn Ji Na.

145
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,220
What's this?

146
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,390
It doesn't look like spam,
but I've been getting these for days.

147
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,830
It's not like there's a shortage
of alumni from New York.

148
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,730
Ahn Ji Na?

149
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,000
(Ahn Ji Na)

150
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,940
(Ahn Ji Na,
Daughter of Assemblyman Ahn Jung Soo)

151
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,510
(Hudson grad prepares
for domestic fashion show.)

152
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,140
(Ahn Ji Na's shocking breakup
with Kunhyang Group heir Jin Se Hoon...)

153
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,110
Oh.

154
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,580
Jin Se Hoon's ex-fiancée?

155
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,220
And she's interested in me.

156
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,760
Should I tell her or not?

157
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,360
Young Chae, your espresso is ready.

158
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,500
Bring it to my room.

159
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,610
Where are you going?

160
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,940
Let's go out.
I thought you didn't have work today.

161
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,880
- I still have things to do...
- Who said you had to do chores?

162
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,010
We can just hire someone.

163
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,550
Cha Jung Won. You're my guest.

164
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,180
My equal.

165
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,990
Your equal?

166
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,290
First, let's find an outfit for tonight.
Let's go.

167
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,470
(Kunhyang Group,
Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

168
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,340
I'm glad your mother likes
Gong Nan Sook's daughter.

169
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,040
It's a relief, isn't it?
For the sake of the company.

170
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,840
You mean for your sake, Father.
No, Mr. Chairman.

171
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,110
You little brat...

172
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,550
- It's too early to celebrate, Dad.
- It's Mr. Chairman.

173
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,590
Right. Mr. Chairman.

174
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,160
Is there a problem?

175
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,000
I posted a picture of Joo Young Chae
in our NY Study Abroad chat for fun...

176
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,070
and called her my "future sister-in-law."

177
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,240
I guess his ex-fiancée, Ahn Ji Na, saw it.
And now things are blowing up.

178
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,180
Did you write her name?

179
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,250
The people at the party
replied with her name already.

180
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,410
I'm telling you, my phone's blowing up.

181
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,980
Look. Ten missed calls from Ahn Ji Na.

182
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,360
You don't still have ties to her, do you?

183
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,460
No. I have no feelings for her whatsoever.

184
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,960
- It's a clean break.
- Then handle this quietly.

185
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,300
Make sure that woman Gong Nan Sook
doesn't get wind of this.

186
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,200
Yes, I understand.

187
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,220
Joo Young Chae. So it is her.

188
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,620
Kunhyang's crown prince's second fiancée?

189
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,320
Is she that desperate for money?

190
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,160
I thought she was rich, though.

191
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,560
If I had her money,
I'd be living it up as a queen bee.

192
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,260
He could have a truckload
of girls just like her.

193
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,130
Mark my words.
He'll dump her in six months, too.

194
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,470
So, Ahn Ji Na is back in the country?

195
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,540
About a week ago.
She says she's staying for a month.

196
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,750
Ahn Ji Na is hosting a party tonight.

197
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,350
I'm sure she invited Joo Young Chae.

198
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,360
Hey.

199
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,230
Are you free tonight?

200
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,900
Welcome, Ms. Victoria.

201
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,500
We've prepared the new arrivals...

202
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,310
from the 2025 Fall, Winter collection
for you.

203
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,380
They're for Joo Young Chae.
She's the guest of honor tonight.

204
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,650
As for the payment...

205
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,980
Put it on my Black Card.

206
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,480
Understood.

207
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,960
So? Not bad, right?

208
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,860
- Why are you messing around?
- Because it's fun.

209
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,670
I feel like you're just messing with me.

210
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,770
Enjoy it while it lasts, Cha Jung Won.

211
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,540
Or should I say, Joo Young Chae?

212
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,620
She didn't even ask
what kind of tea I'd like.

213
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,690
She's so inconsiderate.

214
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,230
You've raised your daughter...

215
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,830
so well.

216
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,600
She's so polite, graceful,
and very respectful of her elders.

217
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,070
What on earth is she talking about?

218
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,880
Young Chae didn't mention anything to me.

219
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,510
We've run into each other twice by chance.
Your daughter doesn't know who I am.

220
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,390
I thought I'd formally introduce myself
after she'd met my son, Se Hoon.

221
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,220
So, let me get this straight.

222
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,430
You, Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra,
ran into my daughter twice...

223
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,200
and were sizing her up
as a potential daughter-in-law,

224
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,600
while my Young Chae had no idea
you could be her future mother-in-law.

225
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,770
That's like being sized up
while you're stark naked, isn't it?

226
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,710
That's not a very fitting analogy.

227
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:27,080
In any case, I'm relieved
that you think highly of her,

228
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,310
but I have to say, I'm not exactly pleased
about this situation.

229
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,380
Especially as a mother myself.

230
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,220
This tea is so cloyingly sweet.
What's wrong with it?

231
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,660
I should have prepared a different tea.

232
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,900
I just served the one
I've been drinking lately.

233
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,770
Just get me a coffee.

234
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,540
I'm afraid I don't drink coffee.

235
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,540
Then just give me whatever you have.
Anything.

236
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,080
A glass of cold water, please.

237
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,920
Are you telling me to drink this
and cool my head?

238
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,700
I thought there would be a lot to discuss
about the wedding,

239
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,770
so I asked to see you.

240
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,850
(NY Alumni Association)

241
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,160
Young Chae isn't here?

242
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,070
Did he just blatantly ignore me?

243
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,080
Ji Na dated and was even engaged
to my brother.

244
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,750
I've known him for over 20 years,
but he always feels like a stranger.

245
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,950
The guy who came in with Jin Se Hoon?

246
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,220
Who is he?

247
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,720
He's the man who crushes my ego
every time I see him.

248
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,730
I thought you were committed
to being single.

249
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,600
But if it were Joo Ha Neul,

250
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,940
I once thought I wouldn't mind
the idea of marriage.

251
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
He's an impenetrable wall.

252
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,940
Joo Young Chae?

253
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,350
- We meet again.
- It's good to see you.

254
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,350
- How have you been?
- Yes, I've been well.

255
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,390
Ji Na. Don't do anything.

256
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,460
- Nothing's been decided.
- Joo Young Chae!

257
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Here.

258
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,950
Gosh, this is totally photorealistic.

259
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,550
Every single strand of hair looks alive.

260
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,280
Makes you want to piggyback on this,
doesn't it?

261
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,190
Are you short on money? Or experience?

262
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,520
Why me?

263
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,400
The Kunhyang Group name.

264
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,840
This becomes "A hot new startup
that has Kunhyang's attention."

265
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,210
Bingo.

266
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,880
Se Hoon, Young Chae is here,
and Ji Na has completely lost it.

267
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,850
What do you think you're doing? How rude.

268
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,090
You're Joo Young Chae, right?

269
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,800
That's right. I'm Joo Young Chae.

270
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,400
I think Ahn Ji Na's lost it.

271
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,000
She and Jin Se Hoon broke
the engagement, right?

272
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,740
Yes, but why is she acting like that?

273
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,740
Do I know you?

274
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,240
Have I done something to you?

275
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,980
You have. My man, Jin Se Hoon.

276
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,680
I heard you stole him
and were going to marry him.

277
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,040
Are you crazy?

278
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,180
Now we're even.

279
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,120
She's got this.
We don't need to get involved.

280
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,550
Hey!

281
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,360
You want some more?

282
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,130
From now on,
I won't stop at just getting even.

283
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,970
If you hit me once, I'll hit you twice,
no, three times.

284
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,100
I'll always pay you back more.

285
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,600
Are you okay with that?

286
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,180
Ji Na. Calm down.

287
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,020
Come on, you're killing the mood.

288
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,590
Let go!

289
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,370
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm just going to clean this up.

290
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,880
Ji Na.

291
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,750
Today's ally is tomorrow's enemy.

292
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,620
In this family, they'll backstab you
the second they see an opening.

293
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,230
You just might survive in this family,
Joo Young Chae.

294
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,330
You did well.

295
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,070
Right now, I'm Joo Young Chae,
not Cha Jung Won.

296
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,710
No one will underestimate me.
No. They won't dare. Ever.

297
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,550
It's a good thing it was me.

298
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
What would've happened...

299
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,050
if Young Chae got slapped
and had wine thrown in her face?

300
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,160
Ahn Ji Na clearly mistook her for someone.
Why did you just stand by and watch?

301
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,900
You said she was your friend.

302
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,070
I know, but even if you do
have the same name...

303
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,240
The same name?

304
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,650
Your friend is also Joo Young Chae, right?

305
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,110
Who told you that?

306
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,250
What's your Korean name?

307
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,620
Joo Young Chae.

308
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,670
Give people with nothing an inch,
and they'll take a mile.

309
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,070
Does she think me playing a little joke
is the same as her impersonating me?

310
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,770
She needs to learn her place.

311
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,610
- What do you mean, impersonating?
- You don't remember?

312
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,710
She used to come over sometimes
back in high school.

313
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,550
Cha Jung Won, the laundromat's daughter.

314
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,320
The one who was so sweet and graceful?
The talented artist with sparkling eyes?

315
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,860
Lying was wrong.

316
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,620
I have to apologize.

317
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,660
Turns out she was even pretending
to be rich to her boyfriend.

318
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,130
Really? She didn't seem like the kind
of person who would do that.

319
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,670
Jung Won's boyfriend came to my house.

320
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,900
How else would I know?

321
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,040
So what did you tell him?

322
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,980
You know I can't lie. I told him.

323
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,680
- That she comes from a poor family.
- Young Chae.

324
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,180
It was for her own good.

325
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,280
He knew she was a high school graduate
and worked part-time jobs,

326
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,820
but he never even asked about her family.

327
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,850
Neither about her father.

328
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,360
You told him?
You told her boyfriend about him?

329
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,520
Yes.

330
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,290
- That's the most important part.
- Hey!

331
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,460
It's only true love if he accepts her
after knowing what her father is like.

332
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,370
She's not being honest about it
and is just dreaming he'll propose to her.

333
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,970
It was so obvious to me.
How could I not say anything?

334
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,810
- She's my friend.
- That's not your call to make.

335
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,740
Does she know that you told him?

336
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,840
Why would I tell her?
It's better if she doesn't know.

337
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,010
She'll be hurt if she finds out.

338
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,580
Hurt? Why would she be hurt?
She should be grateful.

339
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,450
I saved her from total disaster
at the last second.

340
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,590
(Kunhyang Fashion Application,
Position: Fashion designer)

341
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,800
Jung Won, how could you just leave
without me?

342
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,400
And you ignored all my calls and messages.

343
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,440
Still, I'm glad to see you're home
safe and sound.

344
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,070
You're such a good girl, Jung Won.

345
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,610
You had a rough day covering for me.

346
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,980
I don't have time for your games
right now.

347
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,480
Are you busy?

348
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
Another application?

349
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,760
Apply all you want, but you'll never
get a full-time job with your background.

350
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,100
Kunhyang Fashion?

351
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,300
(Kunhyang Fashion Application,
Position: Fashion designer)

352
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,640
What about it?

353
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,100
So someone like me can't even dream
of working at Kunhyang Fashion?

354
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,110
It's a blind application process.

355
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,110
- As long as I have the skill, I can...
- Skill?

356
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,810
Are you naive or just stupid?

357
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,780
Even if it's a blind process,

358
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,290
do you really think they'll hire
a Hangang University fashion dropout?

359
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,690
Even if your portfolio is decent,

360
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,830
mark my words, your application
won't even make it past the first round.

361
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,430
- Young Chae.
- Although there is a way.

362
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,670
Use my name.

363
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
What?

364
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,140
If you apply under my name,
you'll pass the screening, no problem.

365
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,540
But it's not like I need a job, anyway.

366
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,950
How can you be so arrogant?

367
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,980
It doesn't matter
if you have a top education...

368
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,750
and interned for a top designer.

369
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,860
You won't make it if you don't have
the skills to back it up.

370
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,960
Money and connections are talent.

371
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,460
Why do you think Royal Art accepted me?

372
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,960
Why would I...

373
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,630
submit a design piece
to the recruitment under your name?

374
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,330
You're the one who passed me off
as Joo Young Chae at that party.

375
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,440
But you seemed to be enjoying it,
pretending to be me.

376
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,010
Am I wrong?

377
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,780
Just look at how you used my name
in front of my brother.

378
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,380
I didn't see the point of giving
my real name to a customer...

379
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,650
That was the only time.

380
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,620
But my designs are different.

381
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:52,030
I know I can get recognition
based on my skills and my work alone.

382
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Want to bet?

383
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,700
- A bet?
- Yes.

384
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,240
Let's both enter the new designer contest
at Kunhyang Fashion.

385
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,870
And what would that prove?

386
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,640
To see what the world really values.

387
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,850
Talent,

388
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,020
or background?

389
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,560
(A Graceful Liar)

390
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,580
She's biting off more than she can chew.

391
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,750
Who says our Jung Won
can't hit the jackpot?

392
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,520
- Who's that?
- My future mother-in-law,

393
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,890
the Vice Chairman of Kunhyang Group.

394
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,120
I lied to you.

395
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,420
I'm not Joo Young Chae.

396
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,390
You're Cha Jung Won.
I thought that compared to my sister,

397
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,730
you were the one with so much more.

398
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:03,200
It looks like a true blessing
will marry into the Kunhyang family.

399
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,630
Joo Young Chae has entered...

400
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,870
the Kunhyang Fashion
new designer recruitment competition.

401
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,340
- These are my designs.
- Swallow your pride.

402
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,180
Think about your family's situation.

403
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,980
Joo Young Chae,
were we ever really friends?

404
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,650
