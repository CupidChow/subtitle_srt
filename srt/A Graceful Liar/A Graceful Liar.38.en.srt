1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,340
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,680
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,040
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,950
So, Su A went to the Kunhyang house
to introduce herself?

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,880
The fact that my mother has
another daughter...

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,320
is hard enough to accept.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,660
But do you know who this Su A is?

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,130
It's Cha Jung Won.

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,900
Did you know?

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,570
Chairman Gong Nan Sook told me.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,570
So it's true what they say.
She has eyes and ears everywhere.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,040
She doesn't miss a thing
when it comes to the Kunhyang family.

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,880
The Kunhyang family's two elders
are no different.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,780
I bet they know everything
about our family's affairs too.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,980
That's the future for you and me.

16
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,050
- We have to...
- Reach even higher.

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,920
Let's just not become bad people.

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,030
So, how does it feel
to have a new little sister?

19
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:59,600
The official line is I'm happy
my mom found her long-lost daughter.

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,400
I want to wish them all the best.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Off the record?

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,770
I want to teach her
just how brutal it is...

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,770
to survive in the Kunhyang family.

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,340
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,710
I'm just happy
to have another pretty sister.

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,250
- It's just...
- Just?

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,920
It's just awkward and confusing,
that's all.

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,520
You've had a bit too much to drink.
Where's your car?

29
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,490
I sent my driver home
to have a drink with you.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,830
Mr. Park, can you have the car ready
in about 30 minutes?

31
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,940
Joo Young Chae.

32
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,210
You're about to see
the hideous true face...

33
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,310
of the Han Hye Ra
you think you know.

34
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,260
The number you have called
is currently unavailable.

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,290
Leave a message...

36
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,590
(I'll wait out here for you
until you come out.)

37
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,100
I'll wait out here for you
until you come out.

38
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,640
I'm in front of the Kunhyang house
right now.

39
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,080
Your dad's in front
of the Kunhyang house?

40
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,510
What should we do?

41
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,150
How did Dad find this place?

42
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,220
Does he know I married
into the Kunhyang family?

43
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,020
And that I'm taking
Young Chae's place?

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,490
No, he doesn't know that.

45
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,630
Then why did Young Sun
call that brat Su A?

46
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,260
- When did you see that?
- After you stood me up,

47
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,600
I chased after you
up to the Kunhyang house.

48
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,930
What about Dad?

49
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,370
He saw it.

50
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,670
What is going on?

51
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,780
Don't ask me anything right now.

52
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,640
And Dad can't find out
anything else.

53
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,980
It's dangerous.

54
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,910
All right.

55
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,820
That hag Gong Nan Sook barged in
and threatened me.

56
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,850
I'm already scared to death
as it is.

57
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,060
Why isn't Ki Beom
answering his phone?

58
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,700
(I'll wait out here for you
until you come out.)

59
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,900
(I'm in front of
the Kunhyang house now.)

60
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,650
- Jung Won.
- Let's go talk over there.

61
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,450
We'll talk right here.

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,990
What are you doing behind my back?

63
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,520
- I told you, not here.
- Why not? What are you afraid of?

64
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,430
This is the Kunhyang house, right?

65
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,560
Why are you living in Han Hye Ra
and Jin Tae Seok's house?

66
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,130
And what's with Joo Young Chae?

67
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,800
Why did Han Young Sun call her Su A?

68
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,900
Explain yourself. Now!

69
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,310
Please, not now. I'll come home.
I'll explain everything there.

70
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,010
Are you pretending to be
Joo Young Chae...

71
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,510
and married Jin Se Hoon?

72
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,820
I could've just borrowed your car.

73
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,680
It's faster for me
to just drop you off.

74
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,420
Hey, get a grip.

75
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,060
It's Young Chae.

76
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,900
Who's that older man with her?

77
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,740
You're going to fall.

78
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,210
Jin Se Hoon? Do you mean
the son of Kunhyang Group?

79
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,540
Which means
he's Han Young Sun's son.

80
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,650
That's not it, is it? It can't be.

81
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,550
- It's...
- Young Chae.

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,420
Who's this young man?

83
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,830
Jin Se Hoon...

84
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,870
(Profile: Jin Se Hoon)

85
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,570
- Jin Se Hoon?
- Do you know me?

86
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
You should go now.

87
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,180
I'll come by later
and explain everything...

88
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,210
about Jung Won.

89
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
Who was that?

90
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,050
Jung Won's father.

91
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,520
- Let me just say hello...
- No, don't.

92
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,160
He'd be uncomfortable.
You can formally greet him later.

93
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,130
Go on inside. I'll see him out.

94
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,340
I was right.

95
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,880
The Kunhyang Group...

96
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,980
She married Jin Se Hoon.

97
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,850
Sir.

98
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,060
When did you go out, Se Hoon?

99
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,560
Have you been drinking, son?

100
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,400
I had a drink with Ha Neul.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,730
Good night, Father, Mother.

102
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,810
So when is Su A moving in?

103
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,680
We were supposed to meet
with Su A's parents first...

104
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,250
Is Su A's father
your ex-husband, Mother?

105
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,750
Se Hoon...

106
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,620
How dare you say that
to your mother?

107
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,390
Show some respect.

108
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,390
But Mother brought
her ex-husband's daughter...

109
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,990
and tried to make her my sister.

110
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,330
- And that's okay?
- You little punk!

111
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,930
How dare you run your mouth
like that?

112
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,500
He's right.

113
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,110
I introduced Su A on my own
without discussing it with anyone.

114
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,080
And I pressured you all
to accept her into the family.

115
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,310
How is that pressuring us?

116
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,480
You were just asking for
a little understanding.

117
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,350
I was just curious about
what else she could be hiding.

118
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,290
I don't want to feel like
I've been stabbed in the back again.

119
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,690
What has gotten into you?

120
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,990
Come on. Let's get you to bed.

121
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,360
You can apologize to Mom tomorrow
when you're sober.

122
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's go now.

123
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,470
Why did he...

124
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,440
I'll apologize for him.

125
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,650
I'm going to drink this
in the study.

126
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,960
Did you want to see me?

127
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,290
Do you think Ki Beom
and Mi Hyang will let Su A go?

128
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,800
They raised her
as their own for so long.

129
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,130
Snatching her away overnight...

130
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,930
feels like I'm stealing her.

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,870
Su A is over 30.
She's old enough to leave the nest.

132
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,970
But Su A and I have longed
for each other,

133
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,710
starved for affection.

134
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,810
I want to live with her.

135
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,810
If you offer them
sufficient compensation...

136
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,990
They may not have much,
but I can't just pay them off.

137
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,860
- Isn't there any way?
- I'll find one.

138
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,130
What is it?

139
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,030
Say it.

140
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,330
Are you really sure about this,
Hye Ra?

141
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,770
Min Jung.

142
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,940
What are you so worried about?

143
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,810
You still don't remember...

144
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,210
what you ordered me 25 years ago?

145
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,080
You said it was the only way
to get to then-President Jin...

146
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,150
Quiet!

147
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Shut your mouth.

148
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,560
- I'm sorry.
- That incident...

149
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,060
was a figment of your imagination.

150
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,960
It had nothing to do...

151
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,060
with Han Hye Ra.

152
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,850
Unbelievable.

153
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,180
She acted like
she wasn't even my daughter.

154
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,490
Did you tell them you won't marry
Jin Se Hoon?

155
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,420
And she even lied to me.

156
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,930
Sir.

157
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,940
Do you know your sister, Young Chae,

158
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,640
is posing as Su A, don't you?

159
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,550
You know Jung Won...

160
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,450
is Han Young Sun's...

161
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,050
I mean,
Han Hye Ra's daughter, Su A, right?

162
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,620
And Jin Se Hoon?

163
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,760
He's Han Hye Ra's son.

164
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,630
So why on earth did Jung Won
marry into that family?

165
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,780
In the coming storm,

166
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,140
you and your father...

167
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,680
will have to fight
a lonely, difficult battle.

168
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
And I...

169
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,420
must become a shield
that can stop anything...

170
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,890
if I want to face the spear
of the Kunhyang family...

171
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,260
that can pierce through anything.

172
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,840
Why do you treat your mother
like that?

173
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,310
This is sweet.

174
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,910
Are you mad you saw Jung Won's dad?

175
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,250
Why did he come here?
What did he want with you?

176
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,820
He asked...

177
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,350
if the Kunhyang family had found out
that Jung Won was Su A.

178
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,720
So Cha Jung Won hasn't told them
yet?

179
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,460
She's Su A.

180
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,830
I'm still not used to it.

181
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,660
It'll be a huge shock to the parents
who raised Su A when they find out.

182
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,930
Then again,

183
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,900
they might desperately want...

184
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,240
to take advantage
of the Kunhyang family.

185
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,600
Se Hoon!

186
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,640
Do you think all poor people
just want to leech off the rich?

187
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,940
"Desperately?"
What do you take them for?

188
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,280
Why are you getting so worked up?

189
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,520
It's as if I were insulting
your parents.

190
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,790
I've met Jung Won's parents
a few times.

191
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,590
They're warm, kind,
and wouldn't hurt a fly.

192
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,930
The complete opposite of my father,
then.

193
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,500
He thinks he's above the law.

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
And it's not just
that he's ruthless,

195
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,640
he's a hopeless romantic.

196
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,670
Enough to steal my mother
from her husband,

197
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,940
though he was married himself.

198
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,140
Jung Won's father...

199
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,210
served time for murder.

200
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,310
He was wrongfully convicted.

201
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Murder?

202
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,690
You don't think your father
framed Jung Won's father...

203
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,760
to have your mother for himself,
do you?

204
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,860
What are you saying?

205
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,390
I went too far, didn't I?
That was way out of line.

206
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,630
My mother...

207
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,300
had a fall and went into a coma...

208
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,940
shortly after the divorce.

209
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,240
I doubt...

210
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,370
your father was behind that.

211
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,790
I was so close to getting out
of this place.

212
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,060
Mom, when can I move in?

213
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,960
I wish you could move in today.

214
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,130
I don't think that's wise, Mother.

215
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,040
She probably hasn't told
her parents yet.

216
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,910
That tramp, Cha Jung Won!

217
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,280
What are you doing?
You're not just a brat, you're nuts!

218
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,810
Mind your own business.
I'm in no mood to deal with you.

219
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,120
What are you scheming?

220
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,080
Why did Han Hye Ra call you Su A?

221
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,720
And why were you crying so hard
in her arms?

222
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,700
When did I do that?
I've never met Vice Chairman Han,

223
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,700
and I've never claimed to be Su A.
You're delusional!

224
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,410
I saw it too. I was with Mi Hyang.

225
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,540
If I had seen that alone,

226
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,040
she'd have made me seem
like a crazy, delusional woman.

227
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,510
Now start talking!
What's your scheme?

228
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,880
I thought you were just simple folk,
but you're nothing but thugs.

229
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,980
How dare you speak
to your elders like that?

230
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,190
- Apologize to Jung Won's mother!
- "Jung Won's mother"? What a joke.

231
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,520
The one raising Jung Won
is her mother!

232
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,690
Do you have to give birth
just to be a mother?

233
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,660
Young Chae, why are you pretending
to be Han Young Sun's daughter?

234
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,530
Is Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra's
real name Han Young Sun?

235
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,370
Is that what matters right now?
Just answer the question!

236
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,110
It was your mother, Gong Nan Sook,
who put you up to this, right?

237
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,380
Before you start pointing fingers,
you should worry about Jung Won...

238
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,150
Jung Won has become
the Kunhyang family's daughter-in-law.

239
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,550
And she's posing as you, Young Chae.
Isn't she?

240
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,790
Now do you see why I'm stuck
living in this shoebox?

241
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,830
Is it true? Are you positive?

242
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,430
I don't know.

243
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,000
What now?

244
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,440
Ki Beom.

245
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,980
You still haven't moved
into the Kunhyang house?

246
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,050
She actually thinks...

247
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,420
she's the real daughter-in-law
of the Kunhyang family.

248
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,920
She said she had to see
Cha Ki Beom and Jo Mi Hyang...

249
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,950
before I moved into the house.

250
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,790
Didn't Han Hye Ra want you to stay?
Did she say to return in a few days?

251
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,430
What if I never move into
the Kunhyang house?

252
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,830
Good grief. Don't jinx it.

253
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,100
Haven't you ever heard you shouldn't
speak things into existence?

254
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,140
As long as she thinks you're Su A,
there's no way that will happen.

255
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,770
That girl, Jung Won, will keep
getting in my way.

256
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,980
It's obvious what her game is.

257
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,250
She's after Jin Se Hoon
to become the lady of Kunhyang.

258
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,920
But she hates your act as Su A.
That's what it is, isn't it?

259
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,620
I won't let that happen.

260
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,860
You can't let her push you around.
Use your head!

261
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,260
You're my daughter. You can do it.

262
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm sure.

263
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,000
The ice-cold Chairman Gong,
who threw her heart away ages ago.

264
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,440
That's right. And your blood...

265
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,470
should run green, not red!

266
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,610
Cha Su A... No, that's not right.

267
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,710
Jin Su A.

268
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,050
(Kunhyang Group)

269
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,280
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

270
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,360
- You wanted to see me?
- There's something I need to check.

271
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,460
Please, go ahead, sir.

272
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,230
It's about Cha Ki Beom,
Su A's father.

273
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,930
I understand he served time
for murder.

274
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,310
You already ran a background check
on the chairman's orders, right?

275
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,880
- That's correct.
- Don't gloss over the details,

276
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,780
and don't even think about lying.

277
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,150
Manager Hwang Jung Guk.

278
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,390
Twenty-five years ago, he was jailed
for murdering Joo Sang Cheol...

279
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,360
and was released after five years.

280
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,520
Joo Sang Cheol?

281
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,530
Chairman Gong's ex-husband
and CEO Joo Ha Neul's father?

282
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,710
Goodness, Se Hoon.

283
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,580
I stopped by because I was curious
about something, Mother.

284
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,520
What has you so curious?

285
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,590
Ask away. But please, be gentle.

286
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,930
Did you see my dad home last night?

287
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,870
So you're not just playing the part
of Kunhyang's daughter-in-law.

288
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,640
You didn't even flinch
in front of your own father.

289
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,670
What was I supposed to do?

290
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,010
Run up and call him "Dad"?

291
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,110
Should I have brought him
into the Kunhyang house...

292
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,280
and introduced him to everyone
as my father?

293
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,580
He figured it all out.

294
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,620
And he was deeply hurt.

295
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,860
I told him not to do anything,
but...

296
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,090
I'm so confused.
I don't know how to fix this.

297
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,060
I try to steel myself,

298
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,600
and I tell myself over and over
that I can do it, but I'm terrified.

299
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,970
If you're that scared,
it means you're on the wrong path.

300
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,300
It's a sign
to stop this dangerous gamble.

301
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,970
You know your father...

302
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,240
won't just sit back,
no matter who tries to stop him.

303
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,780
I'll convince him.

304
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,350
I won't let anything happen
to my dad.

305
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,920
Yes, Mother.

306
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,930
Lunch with Su A?

307
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,200
Yes, I'll be right there.

308
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,170
Joo Sang Cheol,
who was my ex-husband...

309
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,670
and Ha Neul's father,
was killed by Cha Ki Beom.

310
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,670
That's right.

311
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,640
- So what?
- And his daughter is Cha Jung Won.

312
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,450
And you know she's Vice Chairman
Han Hye Ra's daughter, Su A?

313
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,780
So what if I do?
Does that change anything?

314
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,720
How could you let the daughter...

315
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,750
of the man who killed your ex-husband
be Young Chae's friend?

316
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,720
It's not like I could run checks
on all of her high school friends.

317
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,730
By the time I found out,
they were living their own lives,

318
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,330
and when they reconnected...

319
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,830
You know how it was.

320
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,170
Cha Jung Won posed as Young Chae
and acted so oddly.

321
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,670
So you already knew back then.

322
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,040
That Cha Jung Won was actually Su A.

323
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,550
Se Hoon, what's gotten into you?
No matter how resourceful I am,

324
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,980
if I'd known all the sordid details
back then,

325
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,520
I honestly wouldn't have let
Young Chae marry you.

326
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,920
Just think about it.

327
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,390
Your mother's ex-husband is the one
who murdered mine,

328
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,930
and Young Chae would have...

329
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,200
to treat that murderer's daughter
as her in-law?

330
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,540
And that's not all.

331
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,070
Are you so sure the real culprit
who murdered my ex-husband...

332
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,110
was Cha Ki Beom?

333
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,080
You never know.
What if your father, Jin Tae Seok,

334
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,950
framed Cha Ki Beom
just so he could have Han Hye Ra?

335
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,390
Watch what you say.

336
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,560
Is that any way
to talk to your mother-in-law?

337
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,530
Look into it properly.
Don't just brush it off.

338
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,600
What are you trying to say?

339
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,870
I'm talking about your birth mother.

340
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,640
The one who had
a mysterious accident...

341
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,310
and is now in a nursing home.

342
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,540
That's enough!

343
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,180
Just because I love Young Chae...

make up lies like these?

begging for your help...

Why did Jung Won
marry Jin Se Hoon...

when she knew
Han Hye Ra was her mother?

452
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,660
Their aim is to rock Kunhyang Group
to its foundation.

453
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,360
I can't believe they thought
such a ridiculous lie would work.

454
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:42,600
So you think the post is a lie,
Young Chae?

455
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,040
Wouldn't you need a lie this big
to be Vice Chairman of Kunhyang?

The source of the anonymous post?

457
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,140
It was traced to the area
around the Kunhyang house.

458
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,140

that you can't see.
