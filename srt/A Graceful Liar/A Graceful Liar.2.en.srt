1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,040
(All characters, locations, organizations,
and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,340
(This production followed all guidelines
for young actors.)

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,260
One second.

5
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,440
Are you hurt?

6
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,870
I'm fine.

7
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,210
First, let's take care of that heel.

8
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,820
Two people,

9
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,350
but only one umbrella.

10
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,660
Here, take my umbrella.

11
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,370
No, please.
I can't let you get wet because of me.

12
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,670
Now there's no reason to say no, is there?

13
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,280
Do you know me?

14
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,350
What makes you say that?

15
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,920
Kindness from a stranger
makes me uncomfortable.

16
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,730
Of course you should be wary.
And don't be so quick to thank me.

17
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,870
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

18
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,170
Then I'll just have to charge you
for the umbrella next time.

19
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,470
I'll see you again, then.

20
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,650
If I'd been dressed poorly,

21
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,820
she wouldn't have offered me
even the smallest kindness.

22
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,090
That's just how the world works.

23
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,660
Do you know her?

24
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,930
This is the first time
I've seen her in person.

25
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,000
So you knew who she was,
but you'd never seen her in person.

26
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,270
Could it be...

27
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,210
Joo Young Chae?

28
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,390
(Episode 2)

29
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,050
Hey, you made it.

30
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,450
What took you so long?

31
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,050
- Have you been waiting long?
- No, not at all.

32
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,420
- That's a relief.
- Have you eaten yet?

33
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,820
- Not yet.
- Want to go grab a bite?

34
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,520
- That sounds great.
- Hold on.

35
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,820
You look amazing.

36
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,590
You think so? Oh, stop.

37
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,030
Let's go.

38
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,900
Will you marry me?

39
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,190
So, about your interview...

40
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,730
Hey, don't worry about it.

41
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,570
Something better will come along.

42
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,980
Jung Won.

43
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,480
My mom back home. She's really sick.

44
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,020
She needs surgery soon.
I think I have to go take care of her.

45
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,960
My sister's got her hands full
with the kids.

46
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,630
- And my older brothers...
- Just stop.

47
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,500
- What?
- I'm breaking up with you.

48
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,240
Jung Won.

49
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,370
Can you throw our love away that easily?

50
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,840
I couldn't force myself to ask you
to come. It's tearing me up inside.

51
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,350
If you had even an ounce of sympathy,
you wouldn't end things so coldly.

52
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,650
- So we shouldn't break up, then?
- What?

53
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,690
No, that's not what I meant.
I'm just saying...

54
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,900
Hey, Jung Won.

55
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,660
You jerk.

56
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,200
You're the one who broke up with me.
How dare you call me a jerk?

57
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,370
To think I gave my heart
to a woman like this!

58
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,040
Why?

59
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,650
What does she have that I don't?

60
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,220
The right to get a proposal?

61
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,320
Do I have to slap you to get you to talk?

62
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,760
No, wait. Are you psychic or something?

63
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,490
- How did you...
- I saw you.

64
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,630
With my own two eyes.

65
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,630
So spare me the excuses.

66
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,670
Then why did you pretend to be rich...

67
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,840
when you're nothing but a poor girl?

68
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,670
I never pretended to be rich.

69
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,610
Then what about where you lived
in high school?

70
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,410
That huge, fancy mansion.

71
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,680
That was Young Chae's house.

72
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,620
And what about our dates?
We always met at hotels and large stores.

73
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,320
That's because we met after
my part-time jobs there.

74
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,000
Did you only date me because
you thought I was rich?

75
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,530
Well, what did you expect?
That I thought you were dirt-poor?

76
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,700
I told you I am a college dropout
and work part-time to get by.

77
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,700
Oh, I heard you loud and clear.
With my own two ears.

78
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,470
Then why?

79
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,410
Many rich kids don't bother graduating.

80
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,780
I heard they work part-time just for fun.

81
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,550
Good thing I checked up on you
before I gave you a ring.

82
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,020
I really dodged a bullet there.

83
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,920
Who are you to be yelling at me,
you two-timing scumbag?

84
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,990
Scumbag?

85
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,960
Talk about the pot
calling the kettle black.

86
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,360
Your mom walked out on you
when you were seven, right?

87
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,670
A proper upbringing is so important.

88
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,240
My mom would never approve of that.

89
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,510
How could you conveniently leave that out?

90
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,440
But forget that.

91
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,340
You know what really gets me?

92
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,380
Your father.

93
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,530
I was a total outcast in high school.

94
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,170
I never would have made it through
without Jung Won.

95
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,270
An outcast? Why?

96
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,740
Because I was a spoiled brat
with nothing but money.

97
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,980
What about Jung Won?

98
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
The one thing she didn't have...

99
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,010
was money.

100
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,350
Even though she was dirt-poor,

101
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,050
she was always brave
and held her head high.

102
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,390
Dirt-poor?

103
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,790
So what?

104
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,930
She has the biggest heart in the world.

105
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,370
Even after her mom left her at seven,
she still held her head up high.

106
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,970
She's amazing.

107
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,500
Her mom just ran away? Why?

108
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,410
I guess she hasn't told you yet.

109
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,810
I guess I can't blame her.
It's not an easy thing to talk about.

110
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,950
What is it? What happened?

111
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,290
I need to know to understand her better
and be there for her.

112
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,330
You're right.
I can tell your love is real, Min Gu.

113
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,360
There's nothing
you wouldn't understand, right?

114
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,400
It's about Jung Won's father.

115
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,140
The real deal?

116
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,140
Jung Won.
Can't you pick a better guy than that?

117
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,210
She can't do anything right
unless I'm there to look out for her.

118
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,750
Some things never change.

119
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,550
What? Did I gain weight?

120
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,620
No, that can't be it.

121
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,560
I'll just give this to Jung Won.

122
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,330
There you are.

123
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
What are you doing here?

124
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,270
I thought you were busy with the show
and couldn't make it until next week.

125
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,970
I was dying to see you.
What was I supposed to do?

126
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,650
This is just great!

127
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,220
Mom.

128
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,330
Get out! You worthless little parasite!

129
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,230
I'll see you next time, Mother.

130
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,600
"Mother?"

131
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,130
"Mother?" I ought to rip
that brat's tongue right out of his head!

132
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,740
Mom, please, just stop.

133
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,310
- I'm in love with Park Kyung Shin.
- You're what?

134
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,840
- I said, I'm in love with him!
- Love?

135
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,310
My goodness.

136
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,890
Honestly...

137
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,190
Good grief.

138
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,500
All right, listen to me.

139
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,430
Fine, fool around.
If you want to play, then go right ahead.

140
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,800
Forget all about being with a decent man.

141
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,940
And just marry Jin Se Hoon.

142
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,780
That's how you'll get your hands
on Kunhyang Group.

143
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,680
You're going to do as I say, aren't you?

144
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,820
And what if I say no?

145
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,490
Do you know why no one has any idea
what happened to your birth father?

146
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,660
The rumor is...

147
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,000
that I secretly had him buried at sea.

148
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,830
Curious?

149
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,010
If you're curious, keep seeing that punk.
Then I'll be happy to show you.

150
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,380
Hurry and get dressed!
Your brother will be here any minute.

151
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,620
You'll catch a cold.

152
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,450
Stop crying.

153
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,800
Young Chae, I know you love the sushi
from the Kunhyang Hotel.

154
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,940
Your brother got that especially for you.
The least you can do is pretend to eat.

155
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,980
Young Chae, slow down.
You'll make yourself sick.

156
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,690
Here.

157
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,120
Here, drink some water first.

158
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,470
It's so delicious.

159
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,570
I'm eating yours too.

160
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
Mother.

161
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,770
Did something happen?

162
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,180
She's just throwing a fit
because she can't control her temper.

163
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,960
Once they get going,
there's no stopping either of them.

164
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,860
Is there anywhere good to eat
besides the hotel?

165
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,470
I also need to pick up
some casual clothes.

166
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,170
Excuse me.

167
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,440
Need a hand?

168
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,630
How may I help you, sir?

169
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,960
Well...

170
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,700
I do need help,
but are you sure you're okay?

171
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,470
Yes.

172
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,840
I'm back after a few years and feel lost.
Do you offer a personal guide service?

173
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,540
I'm a part-timer, so I can book for you,
but I can't personally accompany you.

174
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,650
I can request one for you
from a full-time concierge.

175
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,550
Alice.

176
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,950
I'd rather have you help me, Alice.

177
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,690
I can speak to the General Manager
about it.

178
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,360
You were right. This place is great.

179
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,600
And I got some great shopping done,
thanks to you.

180
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,770
Sir, were you satisfied
with the service today?

181
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,580
What is it?
Was something not to your satisfaction?

182
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,880
No, not at all.

183
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,310
It's just you're so formal and polite.

184
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,290
It's our duty to provide excellent service
to guests of the Kunhyang Hotel.

185
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,990
- Of course, being polite is...
- I'm glad to hear it.

186
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,930
Besides, you seem to be
in a much better mood, Alice.

187
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,430
I'll have your handkerchief laundered
and returned to you, sir.

188
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,670
Well...

189
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,410
(Joo Ha Neul)

190
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,950
It's Joo Ha Neul. That's my name.

191
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,820
Mr. Joo Ha Neul.

192
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
It's only fair
that I know yours too, Alice.

193
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,860
What's your Korean name?

194
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,300
Come on, 90 percent of them
are fake anyway.

195
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,660
Why bother telling them the truth?

196
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,870
Just to get yourself humiliated?

197
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,740
Joo Young Chae.

198
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,410
I mean, Joo Young Chae. That's my name.

199
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,750
(Joo Young Chae)

200
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,820
(Missed call)

201
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,520
I should be going now, sir.

202
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,220
I mean, Mr. Joo Ha Neul.

203
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,830
Please enjoy the rest of your stay
at the Kunhyang Hotel.

204
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,730
Wait.

205
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,400
I mean...

206
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:30,570
It's only fair that you give me
your contact too, Ms. Joo.

207
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,670
It's against policy to exchange
personal contact information with guests.

208
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,740
I'm the type of guest who only wants
service from staff I like.

209
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,480
Let's just say
I'm a rather difficult guest.

210
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,660
(Joo Young Chae 2)

211
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,830
See you again, Ms. Joo Young Jae.

212
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,700
Why aren't you answering my calls?

213
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Please, come over to my place.

214
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,600
I think I'm going to lose my mind.

215
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,980
Young Chae!

216
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,180
Young Chae!

217
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,450
Let go! I said, let go of me!

218
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,160
Stop it, Young Chae.

219
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,960
I hate it so much.

220
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,030
I hate my mom so much.

221
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,840
This should warm you up.
It'll help you feel better too.

222
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,380
Did something happen with your mom?

223
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,520
My mom...

224
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,020
She's like a witch out of a fairytale.

225
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,690
How can you say that?

226
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,560
- I'm sure she loves you an awful lot.
- And that's what's so awful.

227
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,070
- What?
- I need her permission for everything.

228
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,700
My clothes, my friends,

229
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,370
even the guys I date.

230
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,280
It feels like I need her permission
just to breathe.

231
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,220
She said there'd be hell to pay
if I see Kyung Shin again.

232
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,750
She'll drown me. Just like my real dad.

233
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,530
What am I going to do?

234
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,130
I can't be alone right now.

235
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,670
I'm so scared and lonely.

236
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,340
But what about you?

237
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,300
Are you okay?

238
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,240
I heard you and Noh Min Gu broke up.

239
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,710
Jung Won.

240
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,480
Why don't you come stay here with me?

241
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,020
We can live together. Please?

242
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,310
Why are you packing? What is it this time?

243
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,610
We'll just see how great your life is
without me in it!

244
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,280
This is getting old.

245
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,820
Always threatening to leave,
packing your bags...

246
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,450
You're like the boy who cried wolf...

247
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,420
Or in your case, the woman who cried wolf.

248
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,220
The woman who cried wolf?

249
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,530
We'll see who's crying wolf.

250
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,500
- Goodness.
- I'm home.

251
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,200
Ma'am.

252
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,640
That goes for you too, Jung Won.

253
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,770
To you, I'll always just be "Ma'am."
Forever!

254
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,740
She's furious.

255
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,510
What good is it being her mother on paper?

256
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,520
To you and your father,

257
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,950
I'll always just be "ma'am,"
no matter what.

258
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,690
After putting up with it for 20 years,
here you go again.

259
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,690
Do I have to have physically given birth
to you to be a mom?

260
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,960
Would it kill you to call me Mom?

261
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,670
I'll call you Mom. From now on...

262
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,910
Say that again, Jung Won.

263
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,210
Mom.

264
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,590
That's my beautiful daughter.

265
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,160
For a long time,

266
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,530
you've been a mother to me.

267
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,310
I'm moving out.

268
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,750
What?

269
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,920
So you got yourself in trouble
that night you stayed out.

270
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,650
- Is he asking you to move in with him?
- We broke up.

271
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,190
Why?

272
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,020
He's a lost cause.

273
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,220
And he's completely full of himself.

274
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,460
You found someone else already?

275
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,860
You can't just jump to the next guy
right after a breakup.

276
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,300
Where's the money to move out coming from?
Is this new guy rich?

277
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,040
There you go again, making it about money.

278
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,010
You hate my nagging
about marriage and money.

279
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,240
You hate every word I say, don't you?

280
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,710
I'm going to stay with a friend.

281
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,810
Why would you impose on them?

282
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,450
It's fine. She's loaded.

283
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,290
- She's loaded?
- She is?

284
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,390
- How loaded?
- How loaded?

285
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,920
All she has is money. Or so she says.

286
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,790
My mind is made up.

287
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,660
You two are the ones who need to get
some independence from me.

288
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:17,110
Must be nice to be so carefree.
How can you possibly be asleep?

289
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
All right.

290
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,950
Fine, let's do it.

291
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,550
The wedding.
What's the big deal about some ceremony?

292
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,660
Let's just get it over with.

293
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,990
Really? Honey, are you serious?

294
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,470
My gosh!

295
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,100
I'm going to lose my mind!

296
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,770
My gosh!

297
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,010
Goodness!

298
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,390
Sleep well, my sweet girl.

299
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,670
I've been looking for you for a long time.

300
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,140
I thought I could just get by,
that life would go on.

301
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,710
I threw myself into my work like a madman.

302
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,910
I preferred being anywhere but home.

303
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,120
I slept in the study
instead of our bedroom,

304
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,350
and I just told myself that was normal.

305
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,420
Now I get it.

306
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,820
I finally understand why.

307
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,390
The only woman for me...

308
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,430
is you.

309
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,700
Tae Seok.

310
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,740
If you'll have me,

311
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,970
I want to start over.

312
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,710
That's insane.

313
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,480
You have...

314
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,920
a wife and a son,

315
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,260
- and I have a husband and a daughter...
- Leave them.

316
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,760
I'll get a divorce too.

317
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,930
Be a mother to Se Hoon.

318
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,680
If you'll have me,

319
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,950
I want to start over.

320
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,010
You're going to burn a hole
right through that.

321
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,350
Oh, my!

322
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,550
Oh, no.

323
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,920
I've ruined this expensive blouse.

324
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,820
Look at that.
Even Ms. Perfect can make a mistake.

325
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,860
That makes you seem more human.

326
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,930
It's a much better look on you.

327
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,300
But this must have been expensive.

328
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,800
Come on. It's just a piece of fabric.
What could it possibly cost?

329
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,880
It's okay, really. I'll take care of it.

330
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,310
You just stick to what you do best.

331
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,820
Making and tailoring beautiful clothes
to perfection, all right?

332
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,490
Okay. Got it.

333
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,930
I'm on my way to get you now.

334
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,100
From your mom? Of course it's a secret.

335
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,770
Yes.

336
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,340
Who are you going to meet
that you're all smiles?

337
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,540
Just someone who puts a smile on my face.

338
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,550
I'll be an hour or two.

339
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,780
I'll be back for dinner.

340
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,830
Like we don't know you're picking up Su A.
Always making such a big fuss.

341
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,970
- I had fun.
- You did?

342
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,180
Do you like your teddy bear?

343
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,530
Have you ever done this before?

344
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,130
Hold on tight.

345
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,940
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

346
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,670
- Happy birthday, dear Mommy
- Happy birthday, dear Mommy

347
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,840
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

348
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,040
Clap!

349
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,180
Here you go.

350
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,790
Here's your birthday present!

351
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,270
I'll get a divorce too.

352
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,300
Be a mother to Se Hoon.

353
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,360
Mom, are you crying?

354
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,600
Getting all emotional
over a little gold ring.

355
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,670
You're such a sweetheart.

356
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,940
She gets it from me.

357
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,370
No, silly. You're sweet like your mom.

358
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,410
That's right.

359
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,010
The man I was meant to be with
is Cha Ki Beom.

360
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
It can only be you.

361
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,990
Yes?

362
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,890
- Who is it?
- Are you Cha Ki Beom?

363
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,800
On August 23 at 7:40 p.m.,

364
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,700
you're under arrest
for the murder of Joo Sang Cheol.

365
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,430
Murder?

366
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,340
No, it wasn't me. Who is Joo Sang Cheol?

367
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,670
Honey.

368
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,140
There has to be some kind of mistake.

369
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
It wasn't me.

370
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,150
I didn't do anything.

371
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,250
You have the right to remain silent.

372
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,250
Anything you say can be used against you.
You have the right to an attorney.

373
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,190
Dad!

374
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,330
It's okay, Su A. Don't worry.
I'll be back soon.

375
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,200
My dad didn't do anything wrong.

376
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,100
He was right here with me the whole time.

377
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,800
Please, believe me.

378
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,570
Please.

379
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,740
Dad!

380
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,780
Dad!

381
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,220
Dad!

382
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,580
Dad!

383
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,050
Dad!

384
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,560
Dad!

385
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,690
Dad!

386
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,430
Dad!

387
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,280
Dad!

388
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,820
Dad!

389
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,840
(A Graceful Liar)

390
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,030
You said her name is Cha Su A,
and she's 32.

391
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,330
If it was meant to be,
you would've met by now.

392
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,000
How could I not find her
after all these years?

393
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,240
I'm Han Hye Ra.
Let's see each other often.

394
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:11,110
Enjoy it while you can, Cha Jung Won.
Or should I say, Joo Young Chae?

395
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,180
Joo Young Chae!

396
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,780
Jin Se Hoon is my man.

397
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,710
And I hear you're planning to steal him
and get married?

398
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,780
What do you think you're doing?
How dare you!

399
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,120
Ahn Ji Na was obviously mistaken,

400
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,020
so why did you just stand there
and take it?

401
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,820
Right now, I'm Joo Young Chae,
not Cha Jung Won.

402
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,790
No one will dare look down on me.

403
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,760
