00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,540
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,910
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,010
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,270
Today is your health checkup.

5
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,340
I'm here to escort you.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,040
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

7
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,780
That idiot Manager Gu
won't pick up his phone!

8
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,590
Is she someone who owes me money?

9
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,530
Gosh!

10
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,400
So, what did you want to tell me?

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,240
Your mother from the laundromat
was here looking for you.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,910
Does she know I'm getting married?

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,950
I'm sorry. She just wouldn't let up.

14
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,550
Does she also know it's today?

15
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,150
- What about Dad?
- So now you're worried?

16
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,160
You reckless little brat.

17
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,790
Are you crazy?

18
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,860
Did you completely lose it?

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,570
Manager Kim, please go to the venue
ahead of us.

20
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,510
- Jung Won, you...
- Say no more.

21
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,980
I'm Joo Young Chae right now.

22
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,280
What if your dad finds out?

23
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,130
What are you doing?
The guests are already here.

24
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,930
I can't find Se Mi anywhere.

25
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,970
Is she the one getting married?
I'm sure she'll show up eventually.

26
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,340
Let's go.

27
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,890
Se Mi.

28
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,590
Oh, you have company.

29
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,290
And you are?

30
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,860
This is Manager Kim's aunt...

31
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,460
from the Kunhyang Department Store's
luxury goods department.

32
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,630
You're close with
Manager Kim's aunt too?

33
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,800
Manager Kim...

34
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,310
No, my niece, Sung Hee.

35
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,570
The bride has taken
such good care of her,

36
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,480
so I wanted to come thank you
in person.

37
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,380
What a sweet aunt.

38
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,460
Yes, Mom.

39
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,760
Right now? The bridal suite.

40
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,260
Got it. I'll stay out of the way.

41
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,500
See you later, Young Chae.

42
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,670
Bye.

43
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,710
- Gosh, my heart almost stopped.
- Let's talk somewhere else.

44
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,760
- Where's the bride?
- I swear she was here a moment ago.

45
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,440
Here comes the groom!

46
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,560
Our son looks
particularly dashing today.

47
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,400
Look at that boy,
grinning from ear to ear.

48
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,200
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

49
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,600
The bride will enter now.

50
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,440
Please welcome her
with a big round of applause.

51
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,080
Here comes the bride!

52
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,980
The bride has disappeared.

53
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,480
Something must have happened
to the bride.

54
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,760
Get me CEO Joo.

55
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,760
Chairman Jin would like a word.

56
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,500
Chairman Jin.

57
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,010
Why isn't Chairman Gong here?

58
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,810
She definitely came with me.

59
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,820
We have all these guests waiting.

60
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,250
Some people just have no manners.

61
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,850
The bride's mother should be the one
to look after her...

62
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,890
at a moment like this.

63
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,520
- I'll go check the bridal suite.
- I'll...

64
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,130
go check.

65
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,390
(Ha Neul)

66
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,490
And where on earth is Madam Gong?

67
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,510
She didn't...

68
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,010
get cold feet
about the wedding, did she?

69
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,280
She probably just stepped out,
seeing how she left her phone here.

70
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,220
- What if she had an accident?
- No, that's not it.

71
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,820
How do you know?

72
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,790
I'm telling you, I saw her here.

73
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,460
Some woman was with her too.

74
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,700
Congressman Kang,
if you could please wait a moment.

75
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,730
I have another important wedding
to attend in an hour,

76
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,440
so please give my regrets
to Chairman Jin.

77
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,110
Excuse me, the ceremony will be
starting shortly.

78
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,010
- It will begin momentarily.
- Please remain in your seats.

79
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,080
Just one moment, please.

80
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,190
Just one moment, please.
We will be starting shortly.

81
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,290
Wait...

82
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,230
What's Gong Nan Sook trying to pull?

83
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,330
She has some nerve, embarrassing me.

84
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,440
Am I that embarrassing to you?
Why did you run off like that?

85
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,710
You think I'm embarrassed of you?

86
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,540
- Go on, before you're seen.
- Must you go through with this?

87
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,710
I am...

88
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,610
marrying into a rich family.

89
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,110
You're supposed to be happy for me.

90
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,380
You brat.

91
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,990
At first, I was over the moon too.

92
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,390
I thought
my life would finally take off...

93
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,360
thanks to my daughter.

94
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,520
I'd jolt awake in the dead of night,
wanting to shout for joy.

95
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,630
So what changed?

96
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,860
It's all a lie! You're an impostor!

97
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,070
Let's say you go through this.
How long do you think it will last?

98
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,400
It's better than
living a pathetic life...

99
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,710
even if it's fake.

100
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,580
Even if it's a lie.

101
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,480
I'll decide my own path.

102
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,350
Please just look the other way.

103
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,610
I'm begging you.

104
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,920
Absolutely not. Let's go home.

105
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,720
Your dad will kill us
if he finds out!

106
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,250
I'll die before that!

107
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,390
What? What did you say?

108
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,660
- You'll die?
- There's something I must do.

109
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,100
Besides becoming a daughter-in-law
of a rich family?

110
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,570
- There's something more?
- It's more important than that.

111
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,810
(Mr. Hiccups)

112
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,240
Why is CEO Joo looking for me?

113
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,180
(Naeil Care Hospital)

114
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,920
Darn it. They lost her?

115
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,850
This is just so sloppy.

116
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,290
Maybe I should just
burn the whole place down.

117
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,530
I'm so sorry. My phone died.

118
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,710
Yeong Soo.

119
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,980
My money put food on your table
and clothes on your back.

120
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,450
I paid for your education,
and when it was time to pay me back,

121
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,720
you said you couldn't repay the debt
and you would work it off instead.

122
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,150
That's when you came to me.

123
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,590
When was that again?

124
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,860
It's been 13 years
since I began serving you, Chairman.

125
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,160
When they were spending my money,

126
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,330
they treated me
like a queen and royalty.

127
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,070
Once it was time to pay up,

128
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,310
they acted like I was some kind of
blood-sucking monster after them.

129
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,540
But you were different.

130
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,310
You were quite practical
and calculating, I guess?

131
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,320
And what I especially like is that
you don't try to pull any fast ones.

132
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,920
Because even if I did,
you'd see right through it.

133
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,090
Exactly.

134
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,800
Are you in your mid-30s?
You're in your late-30s, right?

135
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,500
You're still as charming.

136
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,730
- I've always had a baby face...
- If you're simple-minded,

137
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,300
do you not even get old?

138
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,270
I'm sorry.

139
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,620
You know something, don't you?

140
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,650
Do you know where Young Chae is?

141
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,690
- Did you sneak her out?
- Of course not. Why would...

142
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,960
a dimwit like me ever
pull off something like that?

143
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,300
So, what were you apologizing for?

144
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,600
The baby face thing... No.

145
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm sorry for being a dimwit.

146
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,870
That's right.
You don't have the gall...

147
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,370
to backstab me.

148
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,880
Of course not.

149
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,580
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

150
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,950
Looks like Jin Tae Seok
is really starting to panic.

151
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,290
Of course he is.

152
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,560
How can they get married without me,
the bride's mother?

153
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,660
- Let's go.
- Yes, ma'am.

154
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,800
(Jo Mi Hyang)

155
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,370
Yes, if you're with the bride...

156
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,540
Where are you?

157
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,510
(Mr. Hiccups)

158
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,720
Instead of the groom,
you're calling Mr. Hiccups?

159
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,820
From now on, call me at this number.

160
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,490
- Don't tell Dad.
- You changed your number too?

161
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,840
Should I just leave
like Jung Won told me to?

162
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,080
Goodness!

163
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,640
Gosh, what am I going to do?

164
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,480
I can't just barge into the hall
and cause a scene.

165
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,850
Manager Kim's aunt?

166
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,490
What?

167
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,130
Hold on!

168
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,060
What am I going to do?

169
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,170
Where is Young Chae right now?

170
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,110
Who are you talking about?
I don't know.

171
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,340
I'm telling you, I don't know.

172
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,680
But you thanked Young Chae
for looking after Manager Kim.

173
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,350
The bride!
I saw her go that way a minute ago.

174
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,280
I've got to run.

175
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,290
They seemed pretty close.

176
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,700
Right now, we need
to find Young Chae first.

177
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,440
What do you think you're doing?

178
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,950
You thought I ran away?

179
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,580
The ceremony's already started.
How can the bride not show up?

180
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,290
I'm sure everyone was shocked.

181
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,020
Is Chairman Gong here yet?

182
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,720
It seems
she went to the care hospital.

183
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,390
Not yet.

184
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,900
Wait.

185
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,900
Your hesitation.
Is it about the care hospital?

186
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,640
You said you had something
to check on.

187
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,310
You're here because
you confirmed it, right?

188
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,310
You know what?

189
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,410
Stop right here.

190
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,980
Don't go through with this marriage.

191
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,350
Ha Neul.

192
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,050
And this whole brother-sister act?
Let's end it.

193
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,320
What's gotten into you
all of a sudden?

194
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,530
After all this time as
Chairman Gong's loyal puppet.

195
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,600
Because this might be
your last chance.

196
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,370
If you take
one more step up those stairs,

197
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,970
there's no turning back for you.

198
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,140
I'm going to the top.

199
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,170
And when you get there?

200
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,650
There's nothing at the top for you.
Don't you get it?

201
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,780
I don't care.

202
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,120
I will climb higher and higher.

203
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,650
I want to see where the top is...

204
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,820
and what's at the end of the sky.

205
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,590
I'm going to see it
with my own two eyes.

206
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,790
I don't need stairs...

207
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,630
because I'm going to fly.

208
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,520
Thank goodness.

209
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,700
I'm almost there. So close.

210
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,070
Kunhyang is as good as mine.
It's all mine.

If it means I can destroy you,

216
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,690
I'm willing to be an impostor.

217
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,390
I have to become Joo Young Chae.

218
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,630
No. I am Joo Young Chae.

219
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,610
Honey, are you almost ready?

220
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,910
Goodness.

221
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,350
You look like a fairy.

222
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,890
- You should wear your hanbok too.
- No, I'm good.

223
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,650
It's our first time paying respect
since our honeymoon.

224
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,890
We have to be formal.

225
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,630
It's such a hassle.

226
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,630
I'll help you get dressed.

227
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,530
Really?

228
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,370
Gosh, bad timing. Do it again!

229
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,880
Oh, dear.
A sister-in-law receiving a bow?

230
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,350
That's just not right.

231
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,680
Not unless the whole world
has been turned upside down.

232
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,590
What's one little bow
to avoid a nightmare sister-in-law?

233
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,050
Should I give you
a proper bow as well?

234
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,620
Hey, don't spoil her.

235
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,930
She's a big enough handful as it is.

236
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,300
You're trash-talking me
to my face now?

237
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,330
I'm not going to go easy on you.

238
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,640
Please go easy on me.
Or I might just have to pout.

239
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,910
Thank you for becoming
part of the Kunhyang family.

240
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,610
I'll do my very best
to make you proud...

241
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,150
as your daughter-in-law.

Han Hye Ra.

243
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,400
You abandoned me to become...

244
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,700
the matriarch
of a conglomerate family.

245
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,130
And I will never forgive you for it.

246
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,840
I will make your life a nightmare.

247
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,570
I swear on my life.

248
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
What is it?

249
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,390
You still can't believe the wedding
is the day after tomorrow?

250
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,120
You're right.
It still feels like a dream.

251
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,990
Why has Jung Won been so hard
to get a hold of?

252
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,700
My goodness.

253
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,870
She said she's been swamped.

254
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,600
Too busy to answer her dad's call?
Give it to me.

255
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,410
At this rate, she'll tell us
she can't even make our wedding.

256
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,880
Don't be silly.
Of course she'll come.

257
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,010
I'll handle it.
I'm her mother, after all.

258
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,510
Fine.

259
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,890
Goodness.

260
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,270
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

261
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,570
My gosh.

262
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,770
This is the new number she gave me.
Why isn't she answering?

263
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,170
She should be back
from her honeymoon by now.

264
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,110
Is she trying to give me
a heart attack?

266
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,590
Any news on Young Chae yet?

267
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,490
I apologize.

268
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,060
How about the fake doctor and nurse?
You haven't found them either?

269
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
No, ma'am.

270
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,130
Are you expecting someone?

271
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,770
There's nothing on your schedule.

272
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,810
Do I have to report everyone I meet
to you, Manager Gu?

273
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,240
Of course not, ma'am.

274
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Hey.

275
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,390
Ahn Ji Na. Have a seat.

276
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,770
How do you know who I am?

277
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,470
Why wouldn't I?
We've spoken on the phone too.

278
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,410
You visited the care hospital,
didn't you?

279
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,310
How did you know that?

280
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,140
You signed the visitor log.
Ahn Ji Na.

281
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,390
You checked yourself, Chairman?
Why didn't you have me do it?

282
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,820
You didn't even answer my call.

283
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,990
What are you standing there for,
fidgeting like you have to pee?

284
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,190
Get out.

285
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,930
Yes, ma'am.

286
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,340
You'll have some tea, won't you?
You're my guest, after all.

287
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,210
How much did you get paid?

288
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,210
Excuse me?

289
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,250
Paid? What are you talking about?

290
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,860
From some girl?
I can't tell if she's...

291
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,960
Cha Jung Won or Joo Young Chae.

292
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,460
Is that what she said?
Did she say she's Joo Young Chae?

293
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,030
- She isn't?
- You fell for that little trick...

294
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,700
and sneaked her out?

295
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,340
It wasn't me.
Why would I do something like that?

296
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,710
What do you think you're doing?
This is assault!

297
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,810
Assault?

298
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,090
You've never heard
of Gong Nan Sook...

299
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,390
or what I'm capable of?

300
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,220
I've heard the stories.

301
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,630
That even a bird in flight...

302
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,820
So, are we ready to talk now?

303
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,220
I swear, I don't know anything.

304
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,660
- Please believe me.
- If you're the one hiding her,

305
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,890
then go and tell her this.

306
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,530
Tell her, "Do not anger
Gong Nan Sook any further."

307
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,570
"Show your face now! If you don't,"

308
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,100
"I won't show you any mercy."

309
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,220
Oh, my goodness!

310
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,590
What an incredible feast.

311
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,920
Let me see. Hold on.

312
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:45,460
How many side dishes are there?
Nine? Twelve?

313
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,090
And all these greens. Let's see.

314
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,630
It's seasoned perfectly.

315
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,660
Grandma wanted me
to make it for you.

316
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,230
Did she?

317
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,070
- What else did Grandma say?
- She's tired of all your questions.

318
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,470
What are you talking about?
My grandma thinks I'm the greatest.

319
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,080
She absolutely adores me.

320
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,410
She said to ask just one question.

321
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,810
And do it gently.

322
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,220
She's such a joker.

323
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,150
Where is my Young Chae right now?

324
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,990
I'm worried sick.

325
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,320
That's a lie.

326
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,260
- Excuse me?
- You're just furious.

327
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,130
Grandma is a great mind reader.

328
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,570
You're right. I'm mad at that brat.
What am I supposed to do?

329
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,870
She'll be here soon.

330
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,810
Soon? How soon?

331
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,840
Just shut it and eat.

332
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,840
Gosh. Grandma!

333
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,110
Your soup has gotten cold.

334
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,980
I'll reheat it for you, Chairman.

335
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,180
Unbelievable.

336
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,170
Mother, we're here.

337
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,540
My goodness!
My sweethearts are here!

338
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,010
Let me see.

339
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,810
Come here.

340
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,920
You've been through so much,
my dear daughter, Young Chae.

341
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,680
(A Graceful Liar)

342
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,410
We meet again, Mr. Cha Ki Beom.

343
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,840
You're Gong Nan Sook, aren't you?

344
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,110
The wench who seduced Jung Won
into chasing foolish dreams.

345
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,450
Only one of us is making it
out of here alive!

346
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,520
You old hag!

347
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,380
She's definitely not a pushover.

348
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,550
- She's just toying with Young Chae.
- You pick on her for being good.

349
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,920
I'm never going back.

350
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,220
No matter what tricks you try,

351
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,190
I have no intention of going back
to the way things were.

352
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,690
Happy now that you're me?
Experience it yourself.

353
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,200
Joo Young Chae is
Gong Nan Sook's puppet.

354
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,530
The vice chairman has assigned me
to assist you, ma'am.

355
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,140
So she's assigned me a watchdog.

356
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,640
The daughter you abandoned
was only seven.

357
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,570
And Dad was in prison,
framed for murder.

358
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,540
- How detestable.
- I found this in the trash.

359
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,110
Who would do such a thing?

360
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,720
I'm so sorry.
I should have been more careful.

361
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,280
Whoever did it,
I'm sure it was a mistake.

362
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,790
I'm just getting started,
and she's already taking the bait.
