(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,580
According to the analysis,

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,920
the two designs were created
by two different people.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,450
Drawing one is a match
with Cha Jung Won's design book,

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,620
and drawing two is a match
with Joo Young Chae's design book.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,230
You're saying...

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,230
(A Few Hours Ago)

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,100
Chairman Gong told you
to falsify the appraisal results?

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,300
I'm in a really tight spot.

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,200
You know how Chairman Gong reacts
if I don't cooperate.

13
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,740
Then why are you giving me a heads-up?

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,440
- I know you don't like me.
- But I'm a designer, too.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,650
I hate switching sides
just to save my own skin.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,420
Delivering a fake report...

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,420
That's not my style.

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,690
You have to keep your self-respect
as a designer.

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,220
I just don't know what to do.

20
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,260
Manager Gu is going to show up
the second the results are out.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,340
What if we do this?

(Korean Association

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,720
- This is the original report.
- You made a copy, right?

24
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,890
It's a perfect copy.
They'll never be able to tell.

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,890
Manager Gu isn't here yet.

Hello, Manager Gu.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,440
I'm in front of
the Kunhyang Group building now.

30
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,820
Hand it over.

31
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,720
What are you, a debt collector?

32
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,340
(Based on the findings above,
both are created by Cha Jung Won.)

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,370
This is the one you need to submit.

34
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,010
And I assume...

35
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,350
the results are
in Joo Young Chae's favor, right?

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,810
That's the truth now.

37
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,290
Chairman Gong.

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,860
So, even she can slip up.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,100
First, we need to meet with
former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra.

40
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,870
She'll be at the Kunhyang house.

You're certain, right?

43
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,680
You must accept the result,
whatever it is.

44
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,870
Did you show it to her?

45
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,800
But why make me show the fake report
to Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra?

46
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,770
We have the real one right here,

47
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,580
so we could've just told her
the truth.

48
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,380
I was curious.

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,280
I wanted to see if she'd believe me
after seeing the fake report.

50
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Also,

51
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,350
if Chairman Gong finds out...

52
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,160
you gave Vice Chairman Han
the original report,

53
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,860
she wouldn't let it slide.

54
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,430
Consider it your alibi.

55
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,260
You two have
a complex mother-daughter relationship.

56

57

58
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,770
You go on ahead.

59
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,080
There's no way Jung Won
would've lied.

60
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,520
Do you think I lied?

61
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,190
That's what the analysis says.

62
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,360
I can't believe you're letting
a single piece of paper sway you.

63
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,960
Then what am I supposed to believe?

64
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,230
I thought you knew...

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
I would never sink that low.

66
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,970
Even though you didn't raise me
or watch over me,

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
can't you listen to me
just this once...

68
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,440
and show me a little faith?

69
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,740
You lied about
who you really were...

70
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,350
and even became my daughter-in-law.

71
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,350

you've been looking for.

Which one is real?

75
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,580
Was Jung Won trying
to test my faith in her?

76
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,990
No matter where you try
to hide the truth,

77
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,630
I've learned that
it will always come to light.

78
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,340
Designer Cha Jung Won.

79
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,940
You framed an innocent person
and threw the company into chaos?

80
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,280
I don't accept these results.

81
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,010
Designer Joo Young Chae is the one
who stole my design.

82
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,980
That's enough, Cha Jung Won.

83
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,680
This is just pathetic,
don't you think?

84
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,150
I knew you had a victim complex,

85
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,120
but now it's just pitiful.

86

88
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,900
It worked out perfectly.

89
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Manager Gu gave you this?

90
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,280
Chairman Gong sure is resourceful.

91
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,650
I can't believe
how perfect this fake is.

92
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,380

Stop it.

95
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,360
Fine, I get it.

96
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,940
A designer like you
has no place here.

97
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
Submit your resignation.

98
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,270
What do you mean, resignation?

99

What are you talking about?

100

Are you saying Designer Cha Jung Won
framed Designer Joo Young Chae?

101
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,090
Both for the Royal Art School admission,

102
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,320
and the designer position
of the Kunhyang Design Team,

103
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,090

her design book was stolen?

About Jung Won's Design Book.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,330
That's right. I stole it.

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,810
For your admission to the Royal Art,
and the recent designer competition,

107
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,510
did you steal her design book
and submit it as your own?

108
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,740
Did Jung Won...

109
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,880
snitch to you?

110
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,480
Just tell me if it's true or not.

111
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,950
It's true.

112
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,790
Just pretend you don't know.
My whole life is on the line.

113
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,490
And you'd make Jung Won a liar
just to cover your tracks?

114
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,360
The analysis is wrong.
I will find out the truth.

115
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,170
Stop making a scene, Designer Cha.
This is mortifying.

116
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,340
You've ruined the reputation
of Kunhyang's Design Team...

117
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,310
That's out of line, Director Jin.

118
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,470
Ha Neul...

119
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,810
I mean, Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul.

120
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,320
This proves it, doesn't it?
What more proof do you need?

121
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,380
We have conflicting claims.
We need to cross-check everything.

122
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,020
The credibility
of Kunhyang's hiring process...

123
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,060
is also at stake.

124
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,420
Is it because you have a soft spot
for Designer Cha Jung Won?

125
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,130
Do you really think
that's appropriate?

126
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,100
I'm doing this to responsibly
see my duties through.

127
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,530
Everyone, you're dismissed.

128
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,640
Designer Joo Young Chae,
stay behind for a moment.

129
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,010
So the analysis of
Joo Young Chae's design book...

130
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,780
came back as her own work?

131
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,720
- For now.
- You're sure the results are fake.

132
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,150
Because I have nothing to hide.

133
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,490
I believe you,
Designer Cha Jung Won.

134
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,230
The truth will come out soon.

135
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,830
Then what will happen
to Joo Young Chae?

136
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,870
You and Joo Young Chae.

137
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,170
How long are you two going
to be trapped in this vicious cycle?

138
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,680
If I can't avoid it,
I believe I have to face it head-on.

139
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,810
You've changed.

140
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,480
If there's nothing else,
I'll be on my way.

141
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,860
Joo Young Chae...

142
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,130
What am I going to do with you?

143
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,770
You stole Jung Won's design book,
didn't you?

144
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,200
Please, pretend you don't know,
Ha Neul.

145
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,270
It's Vice Chairman.

146
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,010
- So high and mighty for a temp.
- Joo Young Chae.

147
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,170
I just barely got out of this mess,
and now you, Ha Neul...

148
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,710
I mean, if you reveal it, Vice Chairman,
what's supposed to happen to me?

149
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,090
- Did you fake the analysis results?
- It wasn't me.

150
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,630
Then was it Madam Gong again?

151
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,660
Isn't it obvious?
I'm a daughter-in-law of Kunhyang.

152
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,400
If it's revealed that I stole
Jung Won's design book...

153
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,130
and faked my credentials,

154
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,900
it'll be a smear
on the Kunhyang Group's reputation.

155
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,040
- That's enough.
- What do you think...

156
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,310
will happen to you now that
you're the new Vice Chairman?

157
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,640
Imagine if your sister's reputation
is dragged through the mud.

158
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,880
You'll have a hard time holding on
to even your temporary position.

159
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,680
Why do you think
I'm in this position?

160
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,390
It's to handle problems impartially,
despite family or personal ties.

161
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,130
They need someone objective and fair
who won't compromise or look away.

162
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,130
They needed someone who could lead
Kunhyang through this crisis.

163
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,700
And that person
is supposed to be you?

164
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,570
So, don't even think about trying
to pull the wool over my eyes.

165
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,000
And make this perfectly clear
to Madam Gong.

166
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,210
As long as I'm in this chair,

167
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,140
lies and deceit will never work.

168
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,780
Do you think the analysis was faked?

169
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,890
- Yes, sir.
- Gong Nan Sook must be behind this.

170
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,620
I'm sure she was.
What should we do about Young Chae?

171
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,500
We'll have to teach her
a lesson, of course.

172
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,830
What?

173
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,000
Are you saying we tell the world
that Kunhyang's daughter-in-law...

174
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,140
stole someone else's designs?

175
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,910
- We can't let it come to that.
- Then what?

176
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,710
We need to make sure she can never
pull a stunt like that again.

177
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,450
Young Chae is supposed
to support the heir to Kunhyang.

178
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,220
And am I really the heir
to Kunhyang?

179
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,720
Do you have any intention
of helping me save face?

180
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,890
Your reputation is my reputation.
And it's Kunhyang's reputation.

181
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,290
You lost the interim Vice Chair job.
Is it the end of the world?

182
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,960
Stop whining.

183
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,000
What? Even after the analysis reports
were swapped,

184
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,700
you're telling me
you can't get out of this?

185
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,140
Ha Neul is acting like
some crusader for justice.

186
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,910
He acts like
Cha Jung Won's personal bodyguard.

187
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,150
Who exactly knows you stole
that Cha Jung Won's design book?

188
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,720
Cha Jung Won, Ha Neul...

189
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,590
Add Jin Tae Seok and me to the list.
It's easier to count who doesn't.

190
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,990
What about Han Hye Ra?

191
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,260
I don't think she knows.
Not yet, anyway.

192
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,330
What if Han Hye Ra
and Joo Ha Neul team up?

193
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,340
Did you already know?

194
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,310
Jung Won brought me
the original results.

195
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,710
And you believe it's true?

196
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,920
I should have just believed her,
no questions asked.

197
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,850
I already knew.

198
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,290
Young Chae told me about it herself.

199
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,100
What do you intend to do now?

200
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,830
You're the Vice Chairman right now.

201
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,170
You're also the chief officer
of the Design Team.

202
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,340
What do you want to do?

203
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,880
How does it feel to step down
as Vice Chairman, even for a bit?

204
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,280
It feels great, actually.

205
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,750
I feel like
I should have done it sooner.

206
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,590
- You need to come back soon.
- Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul...

207
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,660
will do a fine job.

208
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,930
I'd like to see how he does
for a while.

209
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,400
What if he gets comfortable
and decides to stay?

210
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,800
If he earns it,
then that wouldn't be so bad.

211
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,440
Are you serious?

212
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,270
What about Se Hoon?

213
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,110
He must know the vice chairman position
shouldn’t be taken for granted.

214
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,950
Won't that push him to try harder?

215
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,580
You want to use Joo Ha Neul...

216
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,320
to light a fire under Se Hoon?

217
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,150
Not a bad idea.

218
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,650
(Disciplinary Hearing on
Design Team Member's Misconduct)

219
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,720
What happened?

220
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,190
They found out the report was fake.
She should just resign.

221
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,300
Whatever about the other stuff,
stealing a design book is too far.

222
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,570
Director Jin Se Mi,
please make your announcement...

223
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,800
regarding the disciplinary action
against Designer Joo Young Chae.

224
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,840
Disciplinary action?

225
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,110
What did I do wrong?

226
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,210
You still don't know
what you did wrong?

227
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,840
I will now announce the results.

228
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,050
The recent analysis report
has been proven to be a forgery.

229
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,420
After resubmitting the items
to multiple appraisal agencies,

230
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,760
it's confirmed both design books
were created by the same person,

231
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,260
and that person is
Designer Cha Jung Won.

232
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,200
How can this be?

233
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,800
Those are my designs!

234
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,940
The disciplinary verdict
for Joo Young Chae.

235
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,010
Tell us, Director Jin.

236
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,910
Only a forced resignation will do.

237
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,980
Will you shut up?

238
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,410
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul,

239
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,450
who has final authority
for the Design Team of Kunhyang,

240
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,520
and the rest of the executive board
have reached a decision.

241
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,920
Joo Young Chae.

242
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,250
You've been placed on suspension.

243
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,060
This is ridiculous.

244
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,860
For the team lead position
on next year's new product line,

245
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,230
Cha Jung Won will be taking over.

246
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,150
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

247
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,350
Suspension?

248
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,220
Joo Ha Neul.
Wasn't stealing my job enough?

249
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,490
(Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul)

250
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,800
As your first act as Vice Chairman,

251
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,300
you put your own sister
on suspension?

252
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,230
I do regret that. However,

253
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,340
you brought this on yourself.
Protocol dictated your termination.

254
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,570
So you should've fired me,
but you went easy on me instead?

255
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,380
I wouldn't say I went easy on you.

256
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,120
Let's just say this decision
is to recognize your potential.

257
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,250
Ha Neul!

258
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,390
Didn't you see this coming?

259
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,620
You were wrong
from the very beginning.

260
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,890
Ever since you stole that design book
for the Royal Art School,

261
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,800
you've been making one wrong choice
after another.

262
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,200
Save that lecture for Cha Jung Won.

263
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,440
You may leave now,
Ms. Joo Young Chae.

264
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,840
You've got some nerve, Joo Ha Neul.

265
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,890
You're just an interim
and already flexing your power...

266
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,720
against my wife?

267
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,190
Where's my desk?

268
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,700
Employees on suspension
are temporarily relieved of duty.

269
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,500
Meaning she can't work
as a designer.

270
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,970
You're still required to report
to your designated work location.

271
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,940
Then where am I supposed to go?

272
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,280
This way, please.

273
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,660
This is your spot, Joo Young Chae.

274
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,600
Am I a joke to you? You're just
an interim Vice Chairman,

275
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,810
but do you really think
you're my boss?

276
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,680
Vice President Jin Se Hoon,

277
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,110
watch what you say.

278
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,820
Does my temporary status
give you the right...

279
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,550
to disrespect the Vice Chairman,
who is your supervisor?

280
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,290
- Joo Ha Neul!
- That's Vice Chairman to you!

281
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,850
What do you two think you're doing?

282
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,330
I wasn't expecting you
to be best friends.

283
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,400
But for two of my top executives
to be shouting like this in here?

284
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,760
I'm sorry, Chairman.

285
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,470
You knew about this,
didn't you, Chairman?

286
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
About Young Chae...

287
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,100
I mean, about Designer Joo
being put on suspension.

288
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,170
I'm the owner of Kunhyang Group.
Of course I knew.

289
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,140
The final decision...

290
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,980
was made by Vice Chair Joo Ha Neul
And I didn't object.

291
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,750
How could you let this happen?

292
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,650
I appointed Vice Chairman Joo
instead of you,

293
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,020
to avoid claims the Kunhyang family
protects its own.

294
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,930
The decision fit his post.
The matter is closed.

295
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Tomorrow, Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul
will bring you a document.

296
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,940
It's about placing Designer Joo Young Chae
on suspension.

297
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,940
Putting Young Chae on suspension?

298
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,880
Is that really necessary?

299
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,980
We'll say
it was Joo Ha Neul's decision.

300
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,020
You need to back him up for a while.

301
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,190
This will send a message
to Se Hoon as well.

302
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,710
What? Suspension?

303
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,780
My son-in-law Jin Se Hoon,
whom I support,

304
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,250
has been pushed out
of the Vice Chairman’s seat.

305
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,120
and now my daughter
is on suspension?

306
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,720
Ha Neul must have lost his mind.

307
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,890
Ha Neul wouldn't have done this
on his own.

308
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,900
Jin Tae Seok must have
signed off on it.

309
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,060
Then what am I supposed to do?

310
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,230
Just sit and rot
in the corner of a break room?

311
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,400
The one behind Jin Tae Seok is...

312
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,840
must be that little vixen,
Han Hye Ra.

313
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,310
Where's Han Hye Ra? Hey, Han Hye Ra!

314
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,680
Well, look who it is.

315
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,490
Chef Hong, you came alone, right?
Grandma isn't with you, is she?

316
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,690
Please let go of me.
Vice Chairman Han...

317
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,860
politely asked me to take
over the Kunhyang kitchen for a while,

318
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,430
so I couldn't say no.

319
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,230
My goodness.
Is she poaching my chef now?

320
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Where is Han Hye Ra?

321
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,710
- She just lay down for a nap.
- A nap?

322
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,840
My blood is boiling right now,

323
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,950
and I'm about to go up in flames,

324
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,250
and she has the nerve
to be sleeping like a baby?

325
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,450
Go wake her up this instant!
No, on second thought, I'll do it.

326
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,490
Please just give her 20 minutes.
She hasn't rested like this in ages.

327
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,500
I haven't slept a wink.
And you're telling me to wait?

328
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,500
I've prepared a light snack for you.

329
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,340
What is it?

330
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,140
This has put many in a tough spot.
Jung Won, Young Chae,

331
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,510
and Director Jin Se Mi, too.

332
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,980
If it weren't for you, sir,
no one would have stepped up.

333
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,410
I'm really starting
to feel the weight of this position.

334
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,890
You've worked at Kunhyang
for a long time.

335
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,090
What's been the hardest part?
Do you have any regrets?

336
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,390
Why do you ask that?

337
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
It's just...

338
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,760
I feel like I might be asking
for too much.

339
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,030
And I'd also like your advice,
Manager Hwang.

340
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,730
Is this about Cha Jung Won?

341
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,470
The more I'm honest
about my feelings,

342
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,580
the more selfish I feel.

343
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,180
Why the long face?

344
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,790
Vice Chairman Joo is torn up
over Jung Won.

345
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,620
Just go for it.
I'll back you up all the way.

346
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,720
You think just going for it
is the answer?

347
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,890
Why are you hesitating
when you've got a clear shot?

348
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,870
At my house, you only serve me...

349
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,210
those bland, tasteless, long,
boring rice cake-things,

350
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,280
but for the Kunhyang family,
you serve dim sum?

351
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,020
The shrimp is so perfectly plump
that it's just dancing in my mouth.

352
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,820
She has a very small appetite,

353
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,860
so I try to prepare things
that are small but flavorful.

354
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,260
So you're saying since I eat a ton,

355
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,660
you only give me big
and tasteless junk?

356
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,360
Is that what you're trying to say?

357
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,830
Please. Your complaining
is getting a little old.

358
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,470
I'm starting to regret calling you
the world's most beautiful woman.

359
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,110
You're Chef Hong now,
and not Grandma!

360
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,170
Well, you know it.

361
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,280
Don't hog it all for yourself!
Share some!

362
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,880
For goodness' sake.

363
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,780
You're right. It's not like
I'm the only one with a mouth.

364
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,020
Here, you have one
of these small but flavorful things too.

365
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,490

Thank you, ma'am.

Don't get emotional.
You'll choke. Drink some water!

371
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,580
She'll see you now.

372
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,990
Her Highness will see me now.
Is she the Queen Mother now?

373
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,790
Unbelievable.

374
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,260

382
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,490
Don't be so nice to me.
I'm not a good person.

383
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,220
- What did you just say?
- I should be going now.

385
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,800
What was that all about?

386
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,070
Han Hye Ra, you did this, right?

387
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,210
Is it a copy? I suppose so.

388
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,270
Since I have the original, right?

389
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,040
Are you playing games with me?

390
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,350
This is your fault
for raising your daughter so poorly

391
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,780
You have some nerve
lecturing me about parenting.

392
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,250
You're the one who walked out
on your own seven-year-old daughter.

393
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,760
And you have the nerve to talk?

394
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,390
You need a reality check.

395
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:55,400
If you provoke me, your daughter
Joo Young Chae will suffer.

396
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,500
What are you going to do?

397
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,740
Just because she married
into the Kunhyang family,

398
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,510
do you think
that makes her some big shot?

399
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,940
And for that, you put her
on suspension?

400
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,810
Look on the bright side.

401
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,120
She needs to be careful
early in her pregnancy anyway.

402
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,020
And it just so happens
I'm taking a break myself.

403
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,320
I'll teach her what it takes

404
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,990
to be a daughter-in-law...

405
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,260
of the Kunhyang family step-by-step.

406
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,960
So you'll be tough on her?

407
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,000
That depends on how Young Chae acts,
doesn't it?

408
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,870
If she causes any more trouble,

409
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,570
will she only be placed on suspension?

410
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,510
You...

411
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,540
have already experienced
your fake daughter being cast out.

412
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,710
Do you want your real daughter...

413
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,780
to be cast out too??

414
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,480
Oh my goodness. To be cast out...

415
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,150
You sure love that expression.

416
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,390
I should get a truck of watermelons...

417
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,760
and smash them all over this house!

418
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,400
Listen, you witch.
You think I'll take this lying down?

419
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,270
Go on, cast my daughter out.
And I will absolutely ruin yours.

420
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,480
Chairman Gong?
What are you doing in my house?

421
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,820
If you want to keep the peace,
you and I need a little chat.

422
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,990
Hye Ra threatened
to cast out Young Chae?

423
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,060
You fell for Han Hye Ra's tricks
and suspended her, didn't you?

424
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,260
Be honest with me.

425
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
Wait.

426
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,330
This is all for Se Hoon's future.

427
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,500
Think of it as his final training
to be a proper successor.

428
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,640

Han Hye Ra has Young Chae
in a chokehold...

430
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,540
is all because of that girl,
Cha Jung Won.

and do nothing anymore.
