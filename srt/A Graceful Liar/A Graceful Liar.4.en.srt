(Episode 4)

5
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,950
Want to bet?

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,750
- A bet?
- Yes.

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,720
Let's both enter the new designer contest
at Kunhyang Fashion.

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,790
And what would that prove?

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,590
To see what the world really values.

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,690
Talent,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
or background?

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,700
I'm desperate.

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,540
And is this fun for you?

14
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,340
Half for fun,

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,510
and the other half...

16
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,270
And the other half?

17
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,910
Maybe to show a naive girl like you
how the world really works.

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,880
I'd completely forgotten.

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,990
I've been too busy just trying to survive.

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,420
Even back in high school,

21
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,290
you were always trying to teach me
a lesson about the world.

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,190
- What?
- Don't tell me you forgot...

23
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,630
how you got into the Royal Art?

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,640
Young Chae.

25
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,070
I'm so jealous.

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,610
You even got into the Royal Art
in New York.

27
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,610
That's supposed to be impossible.

28
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,450
That's awesome! Excellent!

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,110
I heard their portfolio requirements
are insane, right?

30
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,580
How long did you work on it?

31
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,050
Did you do it all yourself?

32
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,490
It's just raw talent, you know?

33
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,890
Not much to prepare for.

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Look at this.

35
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,960
You couldn't even imitate this
if you tried.

36
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,230
A piece with fabric patched onto a canvas.

37
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,970
A painting made with melted candle wax.

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,430
A guitar made out of junk?

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
What?

40
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,180
Those are my pieces.

41
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,150
- Let's talk about this later.
- No, right here, right now.

42
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,350
Tell everyone what you did.

43
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,190
What's with the tension?

44
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,490
- Young Chae didn't create it?
- For real?

45
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,060
Oh, I'm not sure.

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,960
I guess she didn't make it after all.

47
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
I knew it.

48
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,860
I'm begging you.

49
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,570
Please, Jung Won.

50
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,870
Did the soul sisters have a fight?

51
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,880
A fight? Of course not.

52
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,010
Jung Won is just upset that I'm going
to study abroad without her.

58
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,450
must be so devastated.

59

Jung Won!

60
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,350
What is all this?

61
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,790
Remember when we went shopping?
You couldn't take your eyes off this bag.

62
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,790
It's a limited edition.

63
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,500
It'll look perfect on you
when you're not in uniform.

65

They're so you.

66
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,740
Go on, try them on.

67
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,080
- What are you doing?
- You think you can buy my silence...

68
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,080
and I'd just cover for you?

69
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,990
You want money instead?

70
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,550
Fine. Name your price.

71
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
What?

72
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,420
Young Chae, I can't believe you...

73
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,030
Swallow your pride.

74
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,860
Think about
your family's financial situation.

75
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,500
Just tell me how much you need, and...

76
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,210
- Cha Jung Won.
- Is "I'm sorry" so hard to say?

77
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,980
I'm doing this by the book.

78
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,680
I'm going to tell everyone
what you did wrong...

79
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,750
and how badly you hurt me.

80
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,450
I'm going to reveal everything.

81
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,390
You naive fool.

82
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,530
The truth doesn't matter.

83

What's the point of renting it out?

87
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,650
We don't have the money to give.

88
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,520
It's all my fault.

89
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,790
Just when things start looking up,

90
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,820
I get slapped with that "murderer" label.

91
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,030
Don't do that.

92
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,730
Ki Beom, none of this is your fault.

93
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,270
You don't avoid trash out of fear.
You avoid it because it's filthy.

94

This darn money is the root
of all our problems.

95
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,340
If only a pile of money fell from the sky,
how great would that be?

96
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,030
What did you just say?

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,770
Say that again.

98
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,410
I need money.

99
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,080
How much?

100
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,910
How much can you give me?

101
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,820
However much you need.

102
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,390
Any amount you want.

(Kunhyang Group)

104
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,350
Father, why did you hit me?

105
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,650
Why?

106
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,450
I had to apologize to her so many times.

107
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,660
Why are you still giving her a reason
to hold on when it's already over?

108
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,190
I'm telling you, she'll only let go of me
when I'm dead.

109
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,660
Then there's only one solution.

110
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,030
What?

111
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,500
You said it's only over when you're dead.
Then you'll just have to die.

112
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,170
Wait, what are you saying...

113
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,900
- No, Father!
- Oh, trying to dodge, are you?

114
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,240
Stop! That's enough!

115
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,980
Is this company your personal playground?

Joo Young Chae has entered...

119
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,820
the new designer contest
at Kunhyang Fashion.

120
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,090
How admirable.

121
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,160
She won't use her mom's connections.
Isn't that impressive?

122
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,300
Our Kunhyang family is getting a real gem
for a daughter-in-law.

123
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,510
I know we only met because
of the concierge escort service,

124
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,480
so you must be wondering
why I asked to see you.

125
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,150
You're Young Chae's older brother,
aren't you?

126
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,080
Oh, you knew?

127
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,390
I also know why you asked to meet me.

128
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,990
I lied.

129
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,060
I'm not Joo Young Chae. My name is...

130
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,160
Cha Jung Won.

131
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,070
I apologize.

132
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,040
I know you must think
I was impersonating your sister.

133
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,840
No, I didn't ask you here
to get an apology.

134
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,040
But...

135
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,350
I have to admit, I was curious.

136
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,410
Why did you say your name
was Joo Young Chae?

137
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,790
Because the world is kinder.

138
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,560
The name Joo Young Chae...

139
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,090
shines so much brighter than Cha Jung Won.

140
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,100
Because she has...

141
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,570
so much more.

142
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,200
That's not necessarily true.

143
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,710
To be honest, back then, I thought...

144
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,440
you had much more than Young Chae did.

145
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,180
You were more radiant.

148
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,230
Get in.

149
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,170
Pretty good, right?

150
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,740
No!

151
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,910
It's not just good.

152
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,040
It's amazing.

153
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,350
I was nineteen. She was my first love.

154
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,850
Cha Jung Won was my first love.

155
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,460
It was so long ago,
I didn't recognize you.

156
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,230
Same here.

157
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,700
You seem so different now.

158
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
That day,

159
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,340
it seemed like you got into trouble
for Young Chae.

160
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,480
- As her brother, I wanted to apologize.
- Apologize?

161
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,250
If anyone should apologize,
it should be Young Chae.

162
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,250
That's something Young Chae and I
need to sort out.

163
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,990
It's between the two of us.

164
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,600
I have to get to my part-time job.

165
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,970
- I'll return your handkerchief next time.
- You don't have to...

166
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,670
Well...

167
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,740
Just give it back
whenever it's convenient for you.

168
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:58,160
Young Chae, open up!
I said, open the door!

169
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,830
Don't you know the passcode?

170
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,940
I think she changed the code.
It's not opening.

171
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,440
She's not answering her phone either.

172
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,820
So she really did change it.

173
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,990
And who are you to know the code
to Young Chae's place?

174
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,960
Let's just say I'm a friend.

175
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,760
Young Chae is trying to dump me.

176
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,230
But I can't live without her.

177
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,140
Young Chae.

178
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,300
I wonder if your man is the real deal.

179
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,510
How much do you love Young Chae?

180
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,680
More than your own life?

181
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,880
Of course. I love her more
than my own life.

182
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,650
Well, then, you have nothing
to worry about.

183
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,650
Young Chae's mom said...

184
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,890
that if you two keep seeing each other,
she'd have someone drowned.

185
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,590
Who? Me? Or Young Chae?

186
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,460
You, of course.
Young Chae is her daughter.

187
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,470
Then again, knowing her mom,
she might do it to her own daughter.

188
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,170
Put your number in.

189
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,590
If you love Young Chae enough
to die for her,

190
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,490
enough that you wouldn't mind
being drowned,

191
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,490
then contact me.

192
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,990
I'll help you.

193
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,030
Should I have stopped there?

194
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,730
If I had, would Young Chae and I...

195
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,800
have kept our fates...

196
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,000
from becoming so horribly tangled?

197
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,840

198
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,410

- Outside your place. What's the code?

202
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,130

207
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,780
No. It's just cold out here.

Please open up, Young Chae.
Park Kyung Shin is gone.

- Why are you so upset all of a sudden?
- Who's upset?

210
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,190
I was just suddenly reminded
of when we were in high school.

211
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,700
High school?

212
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,030
What about it?

213
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,800
That was so long ago. Why bring it up now?

214
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,270
You're right. It's all in the past.

215
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,980
You're always so good to me, Young Chae.
You're helping me shine again.

216
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,950
So, what about Park Kyung Shin?

217
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,720
Did he say anything?

218
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,390
He said he'd even give his life,
if it was for you.

219
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,030
He really said that?

He's the real deal, your man.

221
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,400

222
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,770

224
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Pretty impressive, right?

225
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,250
- Isn't this meant to be a blind review?
- That's the rule, yes.

226
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,690
- So "every rule has an exception"?
- Wrong.

227
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:56,360
The design team head brought this to me,
saying a captivating portfolio came in.

228
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,000
He said this is a talent
we can't afford to lose.

229
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,230
So securing talent took priority
over the blind review process?

230
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,640
But then you saw the résumé,
and it turned out to be Joo Young Chae.

231
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,940
She's a great catch,
both as a daughter-in-law and a designer.

before the final interview, right?

- That wasn't a compliment, was it?
- How did you guess?

You got "threat" out of that?

use this dinnerware. It's so darn fancy.

Did I ask for a diamond ring?

259
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,660
Did I ask for a designer bag
that costs thousands?

260
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,630
All I'm asking for as a wedding gift
is one little dinnerware set.

You were begging and pleading for that.

Now it's a European royal dinnerware set?

264
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,600

351
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,950
Has she seen you before?

352
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,580
I don't know. We've never met.

353
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,850
But...

354
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,450
why are you so curious?

355
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,290
Here, take my umbrella.

356
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,670
Let's use that as an excuse
to see each other more often.

357
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,040
Here, put your number in.

358
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,910
She thought I was Joo Young Chae.

359
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,840
And that's why she was so kind.

360
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,120
Jung Won, I passed the first round...

361
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,620
for the new designer position
at Kunhyang Fashion.

362
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,490
You made it, too, right?

363
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,360
Wait, don't tell me you didn't make it.

364
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,700
You weren't expecting this?

365
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,140
Of course, I wasn't.

366
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,810
I never thought someone as talented as you
would get rejected.

367
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,740
Especially since it was a blind review.

368
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,950
Even if it's a blind process,

369
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,680
do you really think they'll hire
a Hangang University fashion dropout?

370
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,490
Even if your portfolio is decent,

371
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,390
mark my words, your application
won't even make it past the first round.

372
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,890
Didn't you say that with blind process,
judges check the applicants' credentials?

373
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
I said that?

374
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,630
As if a huge company like Kunhyang Fashion
would ever break its own rules.

375
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,640
So what you're saying now is...

376
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,770
because it was a blind review,

377
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,510
they didn't check
the applicants' credentials...

378
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,040
and passed people based on design alone?

379
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,080
Of course. That's what "blind" means.

380
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,350
Did you think I was trying to teach you...

381
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,190
that background and connections
are more important...

382
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,660
than actual skills?

383
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,200
Oh, you've got it all wrong.

384
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,630
Listen, Jung Won. In this world,

385
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,840
your family, credentials, or connections
don't matter.

386
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,810
Without the skills to back it up,
you'll never be truly recognized.

387
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,810
Talent that can pass a blind screening.

388
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,380
That, and that alone,

389
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,650
is the only weapon you need
to survive in this world.

390
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,990
Understand?

391
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,530
When it came to design,

392
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,870
I've always believed I was talented...

393
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,540
ever since high school.

394
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,330
Jung Won, I'm so sorry.

395
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,570
That was awful of me.

396
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,240
What are you sorry for?

397
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,210
I didn't stop to think how upset you'd be.

398
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,910
I was just so happy that I got in...

399
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,980
when I couldn't care less
whether I got in or not.

400
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,980
For you, the one thing...

401
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,890
you were most proud and confident in
wasn't validated.

402
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,130
And I didn't even think about
how much that would hurt.

403
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,030
I was being so thoughtless.

404
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,730
No. I'm the one who should be sorry.

405
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,700
You got in on your own merit, Young Chae,

406
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,870
and I didn't even congratulate you.

407
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
You're right.

408
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,310
I want you to congratulate me, Jung Won.

409
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
What?

410
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,590
Even back in high school, I never cared
if a hundred other people praised me.

411
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,850
"You're doing great, Young Chae."

412
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,130
Just one word from you made me feel
like I was on top of the world.

413
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,500
What's so special
about hearing it from me?

414
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,230
What do you mean?

415
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,870
You were my favorite person in the world.

416
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,540
No, you still are my favorite...

417
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,110
friend.

418
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,790
Jung Won.

419
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,030
I passed round two...

420
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,500
for the new designer contest
at Kunhyang Fashion.

421
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,730
What?

422
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,230
Congratulations.

423
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Do you mean it?

424
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,940
Of course.

425
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:55,970
Thanks.

426
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,350
The 21st. That's the final interview.

427
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,880
That's only a few days away.

428
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,050
Why would I go? I just did it for fun.

429
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,120
It would've been so much better
if you'd gotten in instead, right?

430
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,830
You know to wash the whites
separately, right?

431
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Then again, as a dry cleaner's daughter,
I'm sure you know what you're doing.

432
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,210
Joo Young Chae.

433
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,540
Were we ever really friends?

434
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,920
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

435
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,190
Thank you...

436
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,760
for entering the new designer contest
at Kunhyang Fashion.

437
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,070
Ma'am, actually...

438
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,700
Young Chae, your design captivated me.
"Innovative" doesn't begin to cover it.

439
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,140
You have such a strong
and distinct vision.

440
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,980
(A modern take on a matador's suit)

441
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,420
(Ornate baroque patterns
meet a modern suit silhouette)

442
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,490
(A fusion of classic and contemporary)

443
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,960
(Profound, luxurious, and dramatic)

444
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,200
It's just raw talent, you know?

445
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,900
Not much to prepare for.

446
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,470
Let's talk about this later.

447
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,490
(A Graceful Liar)

448
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,410
Can you promise you'll love Young Chae
no matter what?

449
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,820
I have to save my man.
So you have to save me.

450
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Jin Se Hoon?

451
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,620
Joo Young Chae?

452
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,720
Face death to survive.

453
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,860
Only when you're ready to die
can you truly live.

454
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,630
Timing is everything.

455
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,790
Buy me some time, Jung Won.

456
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,930
Wedding preparations will be fast-tracked.
And they'll set a date before we know it.

457
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,470
Keep smiling brightly like that.

458
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Like sunshine.

459
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,710
I'll protect this love of yours.

460
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,280
I'm the one who loves you most
in the world.

461
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,510
I'm your best friend, after all.

462
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,150
