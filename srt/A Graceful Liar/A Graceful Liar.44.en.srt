1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,870
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,610
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,210
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,310
Su A...

5
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,550
Our Jung Won...

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,880
The girl you have now
isn't our daughter.

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,720
What...

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,320
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,390
She is pretending to be Su A.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,920
What do you mean, "pretending?"

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,930
Then who is she?

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,130
Then where's our Su A?

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,300
Is it my mother this time?

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,040
Cha Ki Beom.

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,280
You came to my office last time
spouting nonsense,

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,250
and Young Chae and Su A showed up
and cleaned up your mess.

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,120
You still haven't given up?

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,820
Now you're involving my mother?

19
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,050
Start making sense.

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,820
What do you mean,
Cha Jung Won isn't our Su A?

21
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,030
Su A is...

22
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,590
Cha Jung Won,

23
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,900
- my daughter.
- That's right. Our Su A...

24
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,470
is her, right?

25
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,230
Ki Beom,
what on earth are you trying to say?

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,870
Don't listen to a word he says,
Mother.

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,270
Just listen to me!

28
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,370
How can you be
so cruel to a mother...

29
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,310
who's finally found her daughter
after desperately searching for her?

30
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,710
My daughter is...

31
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,820
You really can't tell?

32
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,490
How can you not recognize your child
when she's right under your nose?

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,460
That's enough. Please leave.

34
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,030
As the father who raised her,
the Kunhyang family...

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,060
will ensure you're compensated.

36
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,200
Please let us do that, Ki Beom.

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,700
Forget that.
I'm not here for a handout.

38
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,040
I think it's best you leave now.
I'll escort you.

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
You'll put us in a difficult position
if you continue this.

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,830
I guess he feels like his daughter
has been completely stolen from him.

41
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,610
How dare you abandon her
when you knew she was my daughter?

42
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,910
Jin Tae Seok,

43
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,080
I would've never
let you get away with it...

44
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,210
if she had been my real daughter.

45
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,880
You're saying
she's not your daughter?

46
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,590
You're lying, right?

47
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,150
That brat is not my daughter.

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,190
She's Han Hye Ra's daughter.

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,430
Do you mean Su A
is our daughter-in-law?

50
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
What are you talking about?

51
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,300
Do I need to bring you a DNA test
of her and Han Hye Ra...

52
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,740
for you to believe me?

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,400
Gong Nan Sook,
you knew this all along, didn't you?

54
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,410
I had no choice.

55
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,110
Young Chae left me no choice...

56
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,710
after she ran off
with the model she fell for.

57
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,250
- You mean Park Kyung Shin?
- Yes.

58
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,680
So it wasn't a kidnapping?

59
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,820
So you helped
the real Young Chae and him escape?

60
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,250
What else could I do?

61
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,590
I told her that love was good
for nothing,

62
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,220
but would she listen?

63
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,790
And do you think that's all?

64
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,890
Han Hye Ra and Jin Se Hoon
thought Cha Jung Won was...

65
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,330
my daughter, Young Chae,
and totally fell for her...

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,200
before I could step in.

67
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,630
Cha Jung Won?

68
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,400
Isn't Cha Jung Won the fake Su A?

69
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,140
No. After Jo Mi Hyang's daughter,
Jo Jung Won, died,

70
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,470
there was that girl she adopted.

71
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,840
What was her name? Cha Ji...

72
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,110
Whatever! How can I remember
all these names?

73
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,750
Gong Nan Sook, what have you done?

74
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,180
Is the Kunhyang family
a joke to you?

75
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,550
How dare you play me for a fool!

76
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,300
That girl...

77
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,200
- is pretending to be Su A.
- What do you mean, "pretending?"

78
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,540
My daughter is...

79
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,540
You really can't tell?

80
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,110
How can you not recognize your child
when she's right under your nose?

81
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,120
Why would Ki Beom say
something so strange?

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,990
I told you, don't pay it any mind.

83
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,050
But he's not one to talk nonsense.

84
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,290
Mother, I don't think you should be
saying that in front of your son.

85
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,190
Sorry.

86
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,060
That must have been uncomfortable
for you to hear, Se Hoon.

87
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,730
Hearing you say my name...

88
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,240
feels warmer than
hearing you call me "my dear son."

89
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,840
And I don't mind the informal tone.

90
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,770
Are you waiting
for Young Chae to call?

91
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,240
She called, but I didn't pick up.

92
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,310
I saw you meeting with Cha Ki Beom
and got worried.

93
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,880
You were worried about me?

94
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,120
Who's going to worry about you
if I don't?

95
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,090
Now,

96
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,290
I have to go take care of my woman.

97
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,950
So he's here for Jung Won.

98
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,690
Even though we're always fighting,

99
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,120
you and I are
like the croc and the plover.

100
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,690
Why are you
revealing everything now?

101
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,600
- I'm tired of playing pretend.
- What?

102
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,870
Knowing she was my daughter,

103
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,130
you kicked out the girl
named Cha Jung Won.

104
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,240
Why should I have to protect her?

105
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,110
So you plan to suck her dry
and toss her out?

106
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,310
What a thing to say.
I've become quite dignified lately.

107
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,510
Give me a break.
You being dignified?

108
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,850
I'll strip the real Su A bare
and abandon her in the wilderness,

109
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,320
and leave her there to see...

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,420
if she can survive on her own
or freeze to death.

111
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,930
You think you can fool me?

112
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,400
You want to see the girl
tell Han Hye Ra...

113
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,760
that she's her daughter
and get revenge on her.

114
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,100
Isn't that it?

115
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,200
That's why we're a perfect match.

116
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,310
She married into this family
to get revenge on Han Hye Ra.

117
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,680
You may not believe it,
but I tried desperately to stop her.

118
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,580
But that girl is
one very nasty girl.

119
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,880
That's why she leaked stories
about Han Hye Ra,

120
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,820
fabricating her past
and stealing paintings, right?

121
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,590
Now I finally understand
why she went to such lengths.

122
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,460
What are you going to do?

123
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,430
I'm dying to know.
It’s driving me crazy.

124
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,430
You really shouldn’t
get any crazier.

125
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,530
What?

126
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,670
What if I just burn it all down,
our business and all?

127
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,940
My family is the main shareholder
of Kunhyang Group.

128
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,880
If you cross me,
not only will it be Han Hye Ra,

129
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,780
but I could also have you
removed as chairman.

130
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,150
Maybe so.

131
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,020
But do you think
Kunhyang will falter...

132
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,350
just because you try to shake it?

133
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,790
But what if Han Hye Ra falters?

134
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,290
- What?
- So will Jin Tae Seok.

135
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,390
Like this.

136
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,300
I have to protect Hye Ra
no matter the cost.

137
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,370
You can't have the real Su A
meeting Han Hye Ra and saying,

138
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,700
"You're my mother,"

139
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,640
or anything like that, can you?

140
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,440
Why?

141
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,810
Are you afraid
I might do something to Su A?

142
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,920
(Jin Se Hoon)

143
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,290
- The number is unavailable...
- He's not answering my calls.

144
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,130
Please leave a message
after the tone.

145
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,520
(A Quiet Spark That Shivers)

146
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,090
(Mom hugs me from behind.)

147
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,560
(I give Mom a piggyback ride, too.)

148
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,430
(Taken by Young Chae
on her 19th birthday)

149
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,770
This was Young Chae's birthday
when we were in high school?

150
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,180
Why do you have this picture?

151
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,050
I didn't even know
it was tucked in the poetry book.

152
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,920
You look better in person.

153
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,070
Darn it.
If only I'd been one second faster.

154
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,310
Seeing that Jin Se Hoon is
here himself,

155
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,150
he must be here to take Jung Won
to the Kunhyang house.

156
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,790
Hey, where are you, Ki Beom?

157
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,130
Se Hoon has finally come.

158
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,030
To get me.

159
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,470
Didn't you miss me?

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,810
A night apart felt like a decade.

161
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,810
You'd make me wait a decade?

162
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,710
Any longer
and I'd die of a broken heart.

163
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,420
You don't believe me.

164
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,820
Look.

165
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,420
I missed you so much that
my heart has burned to cinders.

166
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,460
You...

167
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,530
don't trust me, do you?

168
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,330
What?

169
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,530
When you said you'd leave
the Kunhyang house,

170
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,830
I tried to stop you.

171
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,000
But the truth is,
I was really moved.

172
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,870
I thought,
"He'd choose me over Kunhyang."

173
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,780
"He'd be on my side no matter what."

174
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,650
Was I wrong to think that?

175
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,290
When I saw you leaving with Ha Neul,
I thought I might be in the way.

176
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,460
Why would you think that
about Ha Neul and me?

177
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,760
Don't tell me...

178
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,860
If you want me to,
I'll leave the family too.

179
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,330
That's not what I mean.

180
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,500
I'm asking what you truly feel.

181
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,400
I can't be without you.

182
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,670
Changing your parents' minds
has to come first.

183
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,110
They won't change
their minds easily.

184
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,140
But I'll find a way...

185
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,950
I'll be the one
to change their minds.

186
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,720
No matter how long it takes.

187
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,760
- You're here.
- We need to talk.

188
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,400
Between siblings
who aren't even blood-related,

189
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,300
I can understand certain feelings
as growing pains.

190
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,870
But when you're well into your 30s,

191
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,240
how could you, when your sister
is now your friend's wife?

192
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,610
Do you think that little of me?

193
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,850
You don't see ...

194
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,850
Young Chae as my wife, do you?

195
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,680
You have no idea
what your wife is going through.

196
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,520
- The pain she's in...
- And you do?

197
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,790
She's in more danger than you know.

198
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,160
Young Chae's on the edge of a cliff.

199
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,290
I'll be the one to protect her.

200
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,660
I'll pull her back
from that cliff...

201
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,270
and bring her back
as Kunhyang's daughter-in-law!

202
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,200
I'm not letting her go back
to the Kunhyang family!

203
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,270
What gives you the right?

204
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,640
Can't you get over
your adolescent crush?

205
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,310
Do you want to steal her from me?

206
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Or...

207
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,580
is it just because she's mine?

208
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,710
You've secretly wanted to one-up me,
haven't you?

209
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,190
It's not that simple.

210
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,820
This is driving me crazy.

211
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,390
Enlighten me, then.

212
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,060
What problem could
Young Chae have...

213
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,760
besides being kicked
from the Kunhyang family?

214
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,700
Se Hoon, it's not a problem
you can solve.

215
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,170
I wish you could. I really do.

216
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,340
Don't you dare act or talk
like you know her better than I do!

217
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,870
But I do know her better
than you do.

218
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,870
That's why it pains me more,
and why I want to protect...

219
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,580
Ha Neul!

220
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,780
Se Hoon, what are you doing?

221
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,520
Ha Neul has feelings for you.

222
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,090
Se Hoon, you're mistaken.
It's a misunder...

223
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,290
No, it's not a misunderstanding.

224
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,760
Just stop it. Please.

225
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,560
Jin Se Hoon, you listen to me.

226
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,200
Not just as a member of our family,
or as her older brother, or rather,

227
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,870
I'm warning you as a man
who's not related to her by blood.

228
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,770
If the wife standing beside you
isn't the woman you think she is,

229
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,940
and isn't the woman
you believe loves you,

230
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,550
can you protect her regardless?

231
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,580
What does that even mean?

232
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,060
My poor daughter.

233
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,760
What can I possibly do for her?

234
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,630
How can I tell Han Young Sun
that her daughter, Su A,

235
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,370
is her daughter-in-law?

236
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,970
How?

237
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,160
You know what they say.
Kids never turn out how you want.

238
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,990
Even if you go and tell
Young Sun everything,

239
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,690
will that heal the deep wound
in Jung Won's heart?

240
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,960
So I should just stand by and watch?

241
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,330
As her father,

242
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:52,200
I have to stop
and fix this at any cost.

243
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,040
If you tell Young Sun everything,
what happens next?

244
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,010
What if Jin Tae Seok
decides to hurt our Jung Won?

245
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,210
That jerk Jin Tae Seok...

246
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,520
- I'll crush him with my bare hands!
- Don't!

247
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,620
If you do, you'll endanger
yourself and Jung Won.

248
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,490
Before that happens,
I'll get to Jin Tae Seok...

249
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,760
If something were to happen
to you and Jung Won,

250
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,460
how could I go on living?

251
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,200
Don't get the wrong idea.

252
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,410
You and I are married. Okay?

253
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,970
Ha Neul said he was a man...

254
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,010
who was not related to you by blood.

255
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,610
It's true we're not blood-related.

256
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,680
Does that mean I'm not his sister?

257
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,850
Ha Neul is just confusing himself.

258
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,420
That's not something
he gets confused about.

259
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,260
He's just angry about...

260
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,760
this arranged marriage
between our families...

261
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,930
and me being kicked out of Kunhyang.

262
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,100
You're only staying out
for a little while.

263
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,360
Why say you were kicked out?
It hurts me to hear that.

264
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Let's go back.

265
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,800
We'll go and plead
with my mother and father...

266
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,070
I don't want to be humiliated.

267
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,810
I'm not just going to wait
until they come for me.

268
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,440
At the very least,

269
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,210
I'll go back when they accept me
as their daughter-in-law.

270
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,650
Just give me a little time.

271
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,420
I'll take care of it.

272
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,320
To cheer you up, I asked Manager Kim
at the luxury goods section...

273
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,890
to have a few outfits ready for you.

274
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,760
You need to shine even brighter
at times like this.

275
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,190
You should get going.

276
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,760
You have a lot of work to do.

277
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,020
(Jo Mi Hyang)

278
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,090
(Kunhyang Group)

279
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,230
(Vice Chairman's Office)

280
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Mom?

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,110
Did you ask me here for lunch?

282
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,210
Cha Ki Beom.

283
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,180
What was your relationship
with him like?

284
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,880
We were very close.

285
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,320
Why do you ask?

286
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,220
How so?

287
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,420
Tell me the details.

288
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,760
If you're going to impersonate me,
at least do it right.

289
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,500
That's your job for now.

290
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,930
Don't be ridiculous.

291
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,040
I'll become Su A on my own terms.

292
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,600
The daughter Vice Chairman
Han Hye Ra loves...

293
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,670
more than anyone else in the world.

294
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,750
Do you even know
what I liked as a kid?

295
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
Croaker.

296
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,380
And riding bikes with my dad.

297
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,890
If you don't want to get caught,
you'd better listen closely.

298
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,890
When you were little,

299
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,060
what was your favorite thing
to do with your dad?

300
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,630
Riding bikes.

301
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,470
And at bedtime?

302
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,240
I loved sleeping on Mom's lap.

303
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,540
I loved sleeping with my head
in your lap.

304
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,170
Mom.

305
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,380
Are you doubting me?

306
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,850
Did someone say something to you?
That I'm not Su A?

307
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,750
- No, Su A.
- Then why are you wavering?

308
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,590
Why are you looking at me like that?

309
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,360
Mom, look at me.

310
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,830
I'm Su A. Your daughter.

311
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,600
We even did a DNA test.

312
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,170
How did you know about that?

313
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,310
The Kunhyang family...

314
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,710
wouldn't have taken me in...

315
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,080
without checking my bloodline first,
obviously.

316
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,830
Why did you do that?

317
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,460
I saw everything.

318
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,240
What do you think you're doing?

319
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,680
I'm sorry.

320
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,410
This is all my fault.

321
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,020
What's going on? What's happening?
What's wrong?

322
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,860
Why would you do such a thing, Su A?

323
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,020
It's because...

324
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,730
I hated Young Chae.

325
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,170
Ever since high school,
on the surface,

326
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,570
she acted like my best friend
but treated me like her maid.

327
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,700
She was one of those girls
who was born with everything.

328
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,470
Designer clothes, designer bags...

329
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,640
She'd toss me her castoffs
like it was a favor.

330
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,980
And the more I took,
the more I wanted.

331
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,580
But it just made me
feel more pathetic.

332
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,290
And Young Chae would see that...

333
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,320
and feel superior.

334
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,520
Why would Young Chae
do something like that?

335
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,230
Because even though I had nothing,

336
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,660
I had a certain spark.

337
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,930
Exactly.

338
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,140
It was a toxic friendship
between Young Chae and me.

339
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,170
Even though she had so much more
than I did,

340
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,910
she always felt like
something was missing.

341
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,150
That's why she always wanted...

342
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,510
to take away anything
that was precious to me.

343
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,050
Even the men in my life.

344
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,860
- She wanted to take them from me.
- So you messed with the food,

345
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,660
ripped your own necklace off,

346
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,530
and slapped your own face?

347
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,190
I was wrong, Mom.

348
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,500
I'll never do it again.

349
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,330
No, I'm more to blame.

350
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,500
If you had grown up with me
from the start,

351
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,070
you would've been so much more
poised and proper.

352
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,950
You would've had a gentler heart.

353
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,620
- I'm so sorry.
- I swear I'll never do it again.

354
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,490
I won't let you down.

355
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,020
And what about
how disappointed I am?

356
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,490
Se Hoon.

357
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,330
- I can explain everything.
- Su A, stay out of this.

358
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,730
This is between my mother and me.

359
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,620
Han Hye Ra will take my side
no matter what.

360
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,920
Jin Se Hoon, as long as she thinks
I'm Su A, you're powerless.

361
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,640
The phone used in
Young Chae's anonymous post...

362
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
was registered under Cha Jung Won?

363
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,710
- That's correct.
- Then just as Gong Nan Sook said,

364
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,910
my daughter-in-law is Cha Jung Won,
which means she's Su A.

365
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,310
She married
into our family to get revenge...

366
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,850
on her mother, Hye Ra,
and wrote that anonymous post.

367
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,620
What? What are you talking about?

368
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,750
I told you not to think, didn't I?

369
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,020
And don't get curious.

370
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,990
Understood, sir.

371
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,430
I need to run a DNA test on...

372
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,330
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
and my daughter-in-law.

373
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,160
- Find a way to do it.
- Yes, sir.

374
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,670
If my daughter-in-law
really is Su A...

375
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,400
Then what happens to the fake Su A?

376
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
I'll handle it.

377
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,480
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

378
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,950
You wanted to see me, Father?

379
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,090
Have a seat.

380
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,930
Su A was the one
who messed with the food,

381
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,130
and she framed Young Chae for it,
didn't she?

382
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,000
And you knew that,

383
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,500
but you were still that cruel
to Young Chae?

384
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,340
Why did you do that?

385
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,650
She's the one who anonymously posted
my secrets online...

386
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,950
and leaked the story
about Su A to the press.

387
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,320
Young Chae is guilty of that.

388
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,650
So, because you were angry,
instead of reprimanding Su A,

389
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,090
you backed Young Chae into a corner
and threw her out?

390
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,990
- I'm only human.
- Is Young Chae not human?

391
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,360
Then why would she do
something like that?

392
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,930
Do you have any idea how much
this damaged Kunhyang's reputation?

393
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,270
Mother, are you telling me
you really didn't do those things?

394
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,070
Are you absolutely positive...

395
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,140
you never plagiarized Hwang Mi Soo
and fabricated your past?

396
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,080
Did you want to be the lady
of the Kunhyang family that badly?

397
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,410
- Se Hoon.
- And what about my mother?

398
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,380
Did you force her out?

399
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,060
Did you beg my father to have her
locked away in that nursing home?

400
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,960
- Mother.
- Is that what you think of me?

401
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,070
I always worried about how much
you were hurting over your mother...

402
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,140
and how hard it was to accept me.
I patiently tried to win you over.

403
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,940
But now you're calling me a villain
who forced her out to replace her?

404
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,240
I'm sorry.

405
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,110
I shouldn't have said that.

406
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,750
Young Chae's actions
and what happened to your mother...

407
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,850
are separate matters.

408
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,680
Don't torture yourself linking them,
Se Hoon!

409
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
How long...

410
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,390
will you make Young Chae stay
with her parents?

411
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,060
I need time.

412
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,800
Can I care for her like a daughter,

413
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,000
not just a daughter-in-law,
like I used to?

414
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,370
I don't know if I can.

415
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,070
I can't...

416
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,110
live without her either.

417
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,140
Please try to understand
how I feel, too.

418
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,020
You said you were a designer, right?

419
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,820
Yes, Dad.

420
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,730
Did you minor in acting
or something?

421
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,630
Excuse me?

422
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,330
When Chairman Gong Nan Sook
made you play Su A,

423
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,370
you must've known I was in on it,
right?

424
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,710
You're playing your part well.

425
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,680
Even Hye Ra thinks
you're the real Su A.

426
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,450
I don't understand
why you're being like this.

427
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,650
Father, I'm Cha Su A...

428
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,820
No, I'm Jin Su A.

429
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,920
You even had a DNA test done.

430
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,090
Good. That's the spirit.

431
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,160
Gong Nan Sook certainly
picked someone just like herself.

432
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,630
From now on,

433
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,170
just keep doing what you're doing.

434
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,370
Su A.

435
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,440
(Kunhyang Department Store)

436
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,210
Jung Won.

437
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,550
Look at you, you're wasting away.

438
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,190
Is it true you got kicked out
of the Kunhyang family?

439
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,590
Didn't Jin Se Hoon take you back in?

440
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,290
Let's enjoy
our mother-daughter date today.

441
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,630
- Let's go.
- Where to?

442
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,670
It looks great on you.

443
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,570
Do I look like a queen or what?

444
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
A queen.

445
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,650
I shouldn't be letting you buy me
such expensive clothes right now.

446
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
It's okay.

447
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,250
You look so beautiful.

448
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,120
I think that's enough shopping.

449
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,630
Besides, I need to talk to you,
and my whole body aches.

450
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,200
Mom, make sure you take this.

451
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,170
Oh? Isn't this what Mr. Hiccups...

452
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,640
I mean, the one CEO Joo Ha Neul
brought as a gift?

453
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,280
This will give you energy to shop
and strengthen your legs too.

454
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,760
I already feel more energetic.

455
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,030
They say you have to be proactive
about your joint health.

456
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,330
You're right, I should.

457
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,000
I should give some to Ki Beom, too.

458
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,770
Ki Beom says he's less exhausted
since he started taking this.

459
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,710
A healthy body means a healthy mind
and a happy life.

460
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,010
You and Dad should take these
and even go on trips together.

461
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,050
Okay.

462
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,720
(Father-in-law)

463
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,520
- It must be important. Go ahead.
- But we haven't finished our talk.

464
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,090
Just answer your phone already.

465
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,630
I'll call you later.

466
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,840
Hello, Father.

467
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,940
Han Hye Ra checked
if you're truly Su A?

468
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,680
I barely managed to talk my way out of it,
but I'm anxious.

469
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,780
Anxious? Really?

470
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,310
Do you actually wish you were
Han Hye Ra's real daughter?

471
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,420
My gosh, look at her.

472
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,620
You're not even denying it.

473
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,590
I did wish I were her daughter.

474
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,320
Should I just disown you right now?

475
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,890
Even if she got past it this time,

476
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,760
Vice Chairman Han will get
suspicious again and again.

477
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,100
This whole fake Su A charade
should be stopped now.

478
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,070
She'll have to keep going.

479
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,830
What are you talking about?

480
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,200
What if they learn that Jung Won
is pretending to be Young Chae...

481
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,170
and is actually
Han Hye Ra's daughter?

482
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,540
I already spilled everything
to Jin Tae Seok.

483
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,580
- Mom, are you insane?
- Why would you do that?

484
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,920
Because I want to turn
the Kunhyang family upside down.

485
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,150
- Mom!
- Mother!

486
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,550
Right about now,
I bet Jin Tae Seok...

487
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:06,720
is putting Cha Jung Won
through the wringer.

488
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,560
I wonder if she'll make it
out of there alive.

490
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Joo Young Chae.

491
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,210
How dare you fool me into believing
you're Gong Nan Sook's daughter?

492
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Jung Won, please...

493
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,450
What should I do with you?

494
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,690
You think I'm going to let you live?

495
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,890
Cha Su A.

(A Graceful Liar)

497
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,080
If Chairman Jin Tae Seok found out
I was Su A,

498
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,810
you knew he could hurt me.

499
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,450
If the odds are 49 to 51,
I'm taking 51.

500
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,080
Be ready to go back to your place.

501
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,480
That's why I wanted to see you.

502
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,520
Your act as
Kunhyang's daughter-in-law will be over.

503
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,850
It will be over
between you and Jin Se Hoon.

504
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:47,120
I'm Han Hye Ra's daughter.
That's my rightful place.

505
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,460
They'll find out I'm the fake Su A
any day now.

506
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,060
Why don't you make a play
for Jin Se Hoon?

507
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,500
You know what they say.
Dripping water wears down a stone.

508
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,470
Gong Nan Sook was right about Su A.

509
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,330
She's our daughter-in-law,
the fake Joo Young Chae.

510
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,670
- Promise you'll keep Jung Won safe.
- And if I refuse?

511
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,240
Then I'll become your most powerful
and terrifying enemy.
