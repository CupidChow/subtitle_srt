1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,870
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,270
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,180
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,420
(Reporter Ma Sang Ki)

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,650
Yes, Reporter Ma.

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,020
I'm holding a press conference
tomorrow at 2 p.m.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,560
Please run the story
right after the press conference.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,190
Got it.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,130
A press conference?

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,580
I have to restore my father's honor.

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,810
Do you really think that's possible?

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,650
If Chairman Jin Tae Seok
or Madam Gong finds out,

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,180
they'll stop it before it starts.

14
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,050
If you always assume
things won't work out,

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,150
you'll never get anything done.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,460
I'm doing it.

17
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,690
No matter what happens.

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,030
What? Cha Jung Won is holding
a press conference at 2 p.m.?

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,000
That's correct, sir.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,100
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,300
- And Hye Ra?
- She's at the Kunhyang house.

22
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,170
I'm sure she already knows.

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,170
Secretary Yoon must have
already informed her.

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,180
And yet, she's not doing anything?

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,750
My poor Jung Won.

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,990
There's nothing I can do
for you as your mother.

27
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,730
If I could just tear out
my own heart for you,

28
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,530
I would do it in a heartbeat.

29
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,810
Jung Won, I'm so sorry.

30
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,910
I'm even more sorry
that I can't say it to your face.

31
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,290
I haven't done a single thing
for Jung Won.

32
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,120
If Vice Chairman Joo could at least
be the one to love her...

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,490
I hate that even more.

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
Se Mi.

35
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,070
I will never let Cha Jung Won
take Ha Neul...

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,170
or you from me.

37
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,980
Hye Ra has been deceiving me
all this time.

38
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,260
She said when it comes to Kunhyang,
even family is the enemy.

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,560
But deep down,

40
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,330
she aches for Cha Jung Won...

41
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,200
more than she does for our Se Mi.

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,970
I can't just leave this...

43
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,500
to Gong Nan Sook.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,770
I'll have to deal with...

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,010
Cha Jung Won myself.

46
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,280
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

47
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,360
Yes, this is Joo Ha Neul.

48
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,470
The press conference
is about to start.

49
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Where is Jung Won?

50
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:18,970
She's not here yet.

51
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,570
She should be here any minute.

52
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,840
Jin Tae Seok and Gong Nan Sook
won't just stand by.

53
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,710
I will protect her with my life.

54
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,320
I'm counting on you,
Vice Chairman Joo.

55
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,160
The number you have dialed
is not available.

56
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,430
Transferring to voicemail.

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,930
This is the audio
from the chairman's office.

58
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,030
I think you need to hear this.

59
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,070
I can't just leave this
to Gong Nan Sook.

60
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,170
I'll have to deal with...

61
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,370
Cha Jung Won myself.

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,440
No. Jung Won...

63
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,610
I was just told Chairman Jin is
on his way to the press conference.

64
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,050
We have to stop him.

65
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,090
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

66
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,820
Manager Gu, go take care of it.

67
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
Me?

68
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,990
But what do you mean
by "take care of it?"

69
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,830
I mean, bring her to me secretly.

70
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,930
- I'll do it.
- What?

71
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,570
I'll get rid of Cha Jung Won.

72
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,570
You stay out of this.
I told you I'd get my hands dirty.

73
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,540
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

74
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,480
Chairman Jin, where are you?

75
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,050
The press conference?
You went there in person?

76
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,590
You're not up to something stupid,
are you?

77
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,660
You said you'd handle Cha Jung Won,
didn't you, Gong Nan Sook?

78
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm just going to watch the show.

79
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,040
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

80
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,540
Manager Gu,
get her out of there without fail.

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,350
No one can find out I'm behind this.
Got it?

82
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,180
Understood.

83
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,020
Don't worry, Mom.

84
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,290
I'm sure Manager Gu will handle it
just fine now.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,540
I'll help you, Manager Gu.

86
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,440
That is absurd.

87
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,480
- No, you can't.
- Then I'll just go with you.

88
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,480
You really mean it?

89
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,750
I'm so touched.

90
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,720
We can't exactly kidnap Cha Jung Won
if we don't meet her first, can we?

91
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,690
Right.

92
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,980
The article published by Kunhyang...

93
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,790
has defamed the honor
of my late father.

94
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,920
The father I knew growing up...

95
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,530
was the furthest thing
from a violent man.

96
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,130
He was the warmest person
I've ever known.

97
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,970
To do this to my father,
who died unjustly,

98
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,600
is to kill him all over again.

99
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,940
There is only one thing I want.

100
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,210
To set the record straight...

101
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,610
and restore my father's...

102
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,080
honor.

103
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,920
(Joo Young Chae)

104
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,020
Joo Young Chae?

105
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
What's going on?

106
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,600
You want to meet
before the press conference?

107
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,070
And you know who wrote
Kunhyang's official statement?

108
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,740
I only have half an hour.

109
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,210
Where?

110
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,180
Chairman, I just got an urgent call.

111
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Take the call and catch up.

112
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,150
Yes, sir.

113
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,860
(Cha Jung Won)

114
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,730
The number you have dialed
is not available.

115
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,130
Transferring to voicemail.

116
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,010
- Where's Jung Won?
- She'll be here soon.

117
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
Jung Won is in danger.

118
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,850
Chairman Jin went after
Cha Jung Won.

119
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
No!

120
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,990
What are you planning to do?

121
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,430
We'll have to at least knock her out
and take her.

122
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,300
I mean, you will, Manager Gu.

123
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,070
And I'll just watch the show.

124
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,770
Me?

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,170
Understood.

126
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,370
I guess it can't be helped,
Manager Gu.

127
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,440
Madam Gong will have to have you
sleeping with the fishes.

128
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,210
No. I'll do it.

129
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,880
- Just follow my lead.
- Yes.

130
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,920
Grandma. Hurry up and come out.

131
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,790
Come on. I'm dying out here.

132
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,200
Will you stop your whining?
Do you want me to go back in?

133
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,270
You're Chef Hong, right?

134
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,530
Why are you speaking to me
so casually?

135
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,570
I ought to...

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,070
For goodness' sake.

137
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,040
Look at you getting all sensitive.
You pout over everything lately.

138
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,580
All right. I'll keep my mouth shut.

139
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,180
Just tell Grandma to hurry up,
will you?

140
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,880
Oh my, what am I going to do?

141
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,220
The sky is about to fall.

142
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,260
My poor, sweet girl. It's so unfair.

143
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,760
Grandma, are you crying?

144
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,100
Wait, if you mean "my girl,"
that's me. And I'm perfectly fine.

145
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,600
I'm completely fine.

146
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,000
She's on the brink of death.

147
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,770
And no one can stop it.

148
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,510
If my sweet girl dies like this,
how will I ever get over this?

149
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,450
Oh, dear. Who's dying now?

150
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,020
Did Manager Gu go too far?

151
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,350
No, that can't be it.
He's not the sharpest tool,

152
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,420
but he's not the type
to actually hurt someone.

153
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,160
This is all your fault, you witch!

154
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,830
If only you hadn't egged them on!

155
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,730
No mother would do that to her kid!

156
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,160
May you burn in the underworld!

157
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,640
Grandma, have you gone senile?
I didn't do anything.

158
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,310
I might have run my mouth a little.

159
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,040
"No mother would
do that to her kid?"

160
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,380
Then it can't be Manager Gu.

161
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,580
Will Han Hye Ra do something
to Cha Jung Won?

162
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,720
I feel so faint. My sugar's low.

163
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,650
Goodness. Have some candy.

164
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,390
Watch your sugar at your age.
Go on, eat up.

165
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,060
- It's Chef Hong now.
- Why you...

166
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,060
Always at the most
critical moments...

167
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,100
Anyway, I should probably go too,
don't you think?

168
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,800
Grandma says you are not to go.

169
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,700
- Why not?
- Obey Grandma,

170
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,140
or you'll die!

171
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,280
So something big is about to happen.

172
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,580
I might die, but I wouldn't be myself
if I just did nothing.

173
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,650
I'd better go.

174
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,950
Oh, dear. Grandma,
what are we going to do?

175
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,530
Chairman Jin.

176
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,540
What are you doing here?

177
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,470
It's a beautiful view.

178
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,510
And the weather is perfect.

179
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,880
It's quite high up.
It makes your head spin.

180
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,950
Are you here to stop
my press conference?

181
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,850
Or...

182
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,950
are you here to do something to me?

183
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,190
I can't go easy on you anymore.

184
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,060
- This will be your grave.
- Then you might as well kill me.

185
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,000
- What?
- I said, end my life right now!

186
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,140
- Aren't you afraid of dying?
- I'm already dead.

187
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,650
I died the moment I found out
that Han Hye Ra was my mother,

188
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,410
and that woman...

189
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,620
was the one who killed my father.

190
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,690
Why isn't she here yet?
She's not coming.

191
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,430
Is this a joke?

192
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,950
Let's check over there, too.

193
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,620
That's right,
Hye Ra killed your father.

194
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,150
Actually,

195
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,360
it might just be easier
for you to believe that.

196
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,530
Are you saying Han Hye Ra
wasn't the one who did it?

197
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,730
You want to know?

198
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,760
Tell me the truth.

199
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,130
Was it you?

200
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,740
Hye Ra's mistake was
trusting me too much.

201
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,640
I never even called 911.

202
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,510
My dad was alive?

203
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,180
That whole time?

204
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,980
That's right.

205
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,580
Cha Ki Beom was very much alive.

206
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,080
Cha Ki Beom.

207
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,190
Life is so unfair, isn't it?

208
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,950
This is your fate.

209
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,360
To die at Han Hye Ra's hands...

210
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,030
before I could deal with you myself.

211
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,430
What's wrong?

212
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,830
You're not dead yet?

213
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,470
I can't die like this.

214
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,270
Jin Tae Seok.

215
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,010
You're a monster.

216
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,260
They say people cling to life.

217
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,660
After he fell and his head bled,
he was still alive.

218
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,670
Do you have any idea
how terrified I was?

219
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,440
This is the first and last time
I will ever tell you the truth.

220
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,340
So now, you have to disappear,
don't you?

221
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,020
You monster!

222
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,090
I'm not the one who deserves to die.
You are!

223
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,760
Letting a monster like you live...

224
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,390
would be the greater sin!

225
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,570
You're a feisty one.

226
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,340
- Were you recording this?
- My word alone isn't enough.

227
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,340
They will only believe
a confession straight from you.

228
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,570
Mother!

229
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Yes?

230
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,210
I heard Cha Jung Won
was holding a press conference?

231
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,710
That's the least of our worries.
Something awful is about to happen.

232
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,400
(Cha Jung Won, Surgery in progress,
Emergency)

233
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,910
(Operating Center)

234
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,390
She fell from the rooftop?
What are you talking about?

235
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,890
Where's my Jung Won?

236
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,230
She's in surgery right now.

237
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,060
How did this happen?
How could she just fall?

238
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,570
You did this, didn't you?

239
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,570
You tried to hurt her...

240
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,080
- because she exposed your past!
- My daughter...

241
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,750
My Jung Won...
What do I do, Mi Hyang?

242
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,980
"Daughter?"

243
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,980
What kind of mother
lets her daughter end up like this?

244
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,890
Bring my Jung Won back!
You vile witch!

245
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,190
Ma'am, please stop.

246
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,830
This is the last of it.

247
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,700
Is Cha Jung Won's family here?

248
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,610
Is something wrong with my Jung Won?

249
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,540
We don't have any B-negative blood
in our blood bank.

250
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:24,420
If a family member is a match,
we can give a direct transfusion.

251
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,350
She's bleeding out and needs blood,

252
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,390
but we're low
on her rare blood type.

253
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,890
Jung Won...

254
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,590
has B-negative blood?

255
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,020
Yes, that's right.

256
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,460
But I'm Type O. Can't you use mine?

257
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,830
Type O blood is universal, right?

258
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,300
Even if you are Type O,
Rh-positive blood can't be given...

259
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,630
to an Rh-negative patient.

260
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,300
What do we do?

261
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,640
Chairman Jin Tae Seok...

262
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,870
is B-negative.

263
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,910
That's right.

264
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,280
That's my blood type.

265
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:06,090
You pushed my Jung Won
off the roof, didn't you?

266
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,290
Chairman.

267
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,990
Jung Won is in surgery,
and she's running out of blood...

268
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,300
And I'm a match, I hear.

269
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,700
Then let's do it.
I'll gladly donate.

270
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,100
Thank you, Chairman.

271
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,630
Thank you.

272
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,040
Will Jung Won live now?

273
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,070
Thank you so much.

274
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,640
It's the least
any decent person would do.

275
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,050
Let's go.

276
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,630
I can't just go barging
into the hospital.

277
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,280
Seriously, what in the world
is going on?

278
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,810
This is definitely
Cha Jung Won's phone.

279
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,820
I told Manager Gu
to kidnap her, and yet...

280
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,920
What has he done?

281
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,960
It wasn't me.

282
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,300
Then who was it?

283
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,630
It was Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

284
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,730
You saw it yourself?

285
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,300
Ms. Young Chae saw it too.

286
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,070
Proof that Jin Tae Seok
did it himself.

287
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,740
Did you get it on video?

288
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,910
Ms. Young Chae filmed it.

289
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,180
She stopped me from recording.

290
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,520
Even if she told you not to,
you should have filmed it anyway.

291
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,320
Actually...

292
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,390
I looked, but I didn't see anything.

293
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,400
I was too scared.

294
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,100
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,170
Grandma was right.

296
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,070
This isn't just trouble.
It's a complete catastrophe.

297
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,970
Where's Young Chae?

298
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,880
I saw Jung Won fall
with my own two eyes.

299
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,220
How could this happen?

300
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,620
Who on earth could have done this?

301
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,990
I have to go to the hospital.

302
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,790
What gives you the right to go?

303
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,160
- What?
- As her ex-husband?

304
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,060
Or as siblings
who don't share a drop of blood?

305
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,200
But still, how can I not go?

306
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,040
If something happens to Jung Won,

307
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,140
I won't be able to live.

308
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,580
Young Chae.

309
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,050
- What do you think you're doing?
- Do you really have to ask?

310
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,350
The first slap was from your wife,
Young Chae.

311
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,890
And the second one...

312
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,320
was from A Reum,
the baby in her belly.

313
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,330
You saw it yourself.

314
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,400
Jung Won is
in the middle of surgery.

315
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,230
How can you expect me
to just ignore it?

316
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,570
Do you know who pushed Cha Jung Won
off that rooftop?

317
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,900
Who would do something like that?

318
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,140
What about you?

319
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,970
How am I supposed to know?

320
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,310
Don't leave this house, Se Hoon.
If you dare go to that hospital,

321
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,180
I'll have you drowned.

322
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,350
We need to talk, Young Chae.

323
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,690
Follow me.

324
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,630
- Hand it over.
- Hand what over?

325
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,800
The video of Jin Tae Seok
pushing Cha Jung Won.

326
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,930
I don't have it.

327
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,570
- Stop lying.
- I'm telling the truth.

328
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,340
I was so shocked,
I hit the wrong button.

329
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,240
When I checked it later,

330
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,140
it turned out
it hadn't recorded anything.

331
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,150
- Are you sure?
- That's what I said.

332
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,320
Then are you certain
it was Jin Tae Seok who pushed her?

333
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,120
I'm positive.

334
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,690
Chairman Jin Tae Seok...

335
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,230
is an even bigger monster than you.

336
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,930
Jin Tae Seok.

337
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,560
What was he thinking,
doing it himself?

338
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,370
How could this have happened...

339
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,540
to our poor Jung Won?

340
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,110
She was fine this morning.

341
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,410
How could this have happened
so suddenly?

342
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,740
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

343
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,380
Her family must be
beside themselves right now.

344
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,920
After she gets through surgery
and is stable,

345
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,090
it would probably be better
to go then.

346
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,820
But what if something happens
to her before then?

347
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,520
- Director Jin!
- Director Jin!

348
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
I think...

349
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,630
this happened
because I hated her so much.

350
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,130
I never wanted it to come to this.

351
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,130
Don't talk like that.

352
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,100
Let's all pray together
that Jung Won's surgery goes well.

353
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,220
(Operating Center)

354
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,490
How did it go?

355
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,000
The transfusion went fine,
and the surgery is proceeding well.

356
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,930
Let's just wait and see.

357
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,570
Chairman Jin, thank you so much.

358
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,150
(Operating Center)

359
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,090
- Was the surgery a success?
- The surgery was successful.

360
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,000
When will she regain consciousness?

361
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,700
We'll have to monitor her condition.

362
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,700
The impact of the fall
was so severe...

363
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,940
that she had a skull fracture
and a cerebral hemorrhage.

364
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,740
Her brain is swollen,

365
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,780
and her broken ribs...

366
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,810
caused significant damage
to her internal organs.

367
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,420
But she will recover, won't she?

368
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,820
I can't make any guarantees.
Tonight is critical.

369
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,460
Hye Ra.

370
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,900
I'll escort you home.

371
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,170
No, I'm not leaving.

372
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,440
I'm staying right here.

373
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,340
Jung Won, my baby girl.

374
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,610
You're going to make yourself sick,
Mi Hyang.

375
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,050
No.

376
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,920
Please, you have to save her.
My Jung Won can't go like this.

377
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,550
- I can't bear to live.
- Doctor.

378
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,490
Please, just tell us what to do.

379
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,860
There's nothing more
we can do right now.

380
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,160
Now it's up to her to keep fighting.

381
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,380
The surgery is over,

382
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,650
but tonight is critical?

383
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,650
Got it. Keep me posted.

384
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,360
So Cha Jung Won could actually die?

385
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,620
This can't be happening.

386
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,060
Se Hoon.

387
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,860
Leave him be.
It's touch and go with her.

388
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,930
He should get to say
his last goodbye.

389
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,240
- Is Cha Jung Won really dying?
- How should I know?

390
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,110
Snap out of it.

391
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,710
You're the one who threw a fit
wanting her to disappear.

392
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,250
What's with that look on your face?
Why do you look so upset?

393
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,480
Who said I'm upset?

394
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,620
I just can't believe it, that's all.

395
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,220
(Kunhyang Hospital)

396
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,080
You told me not to forgive you.

397
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,580
Why are you kneeling shamelessly?

398
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,020
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

399
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,320
I've only just realized...

400
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,090
that I chose
my ambition and my desires...

401
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,190
over being a mother.

402
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,130
Even though
you are my daughter, Su A,

403
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,930
this is the only time...

404
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,600
you will ever see me on my knees.

405
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,840
How could you make my dad out
to be an abuser?

406
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,110
You're not even human!

407
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,410
You're a devil!

408
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,180
Jung Won.

409
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,220
Please, come back to me.

410
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,050
If you really do exist,

411
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,450
please help
my poor daughter Jung Won.

412
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,420
Please let her wake up.

413
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,560
If you only save my child,

414
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,370
I'll gladly give my own life...

415
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,110
in her place.

416
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:08,020
(A Graceful Liar)

417
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,040
Han Hye Ra had a heated fight
with Cha Ki Beom...

418
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,740
before the accident.

419
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,210
And I believe
Chairman Jin Tae Seok is involved.

420
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,150
I'm going to hold a press conference
and admit it all myself.

421
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,920
Kunhyang's Vice Chairman
is opposing the Chairman?

422
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,950
And you expect to get away with it?

423
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,360
Because I'm going to risk my life
to expose you for the trash you are.

424
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,990
Farewell, Cha Jung Won.

425
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,260
This is the best for you and Hye Ra.

426
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,360
"In danger?" What happened?

427
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,330
No. I can't let her go like this.

428
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,100
I should have finished the job.

429
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,240
If there's even a small part of you
that wants Jung Won to die,

430
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,810
I will rip you limb from limb
and kill you, Jin Tae Seok.

431
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,480
