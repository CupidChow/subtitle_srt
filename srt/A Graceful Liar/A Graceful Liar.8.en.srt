1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,040
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,210
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,980
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,980
But what happens if you start
to want it for real?

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,090
What if you start wanting
to be the real Young Chae?

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,790
What will you do then?

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,890
Just because I want something,
doesn't mean I can have it.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,430
Between Young Chae and you,

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,470
what chance
does someone like me stand?

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,010
You've got a silver tongue,
don't you?

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,480
Jung Won, are you in there?

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,620
Open the door. Jung Won!

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,350
Cha Jung Won!

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,190
"Jung Won?"

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,760
CEO Joo knows?

16
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,500
Joo Ha Neul, did you
and this tramp conspire...

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,600
to ruin Young Chae's marriage
to Jin Se Hoon?

18
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,210
It's the exact opposite.

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,220
(Victoria)

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,450
It's Young Chae.

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,020
- Give it here. I'll get it.
- She's calling for Jung Won.

22
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,090
If you answer, she'll hang up.

23
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,530
Darn it, just answer it! Hurry!

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,930
(Victoria)

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,030
Jung Won, what am I going to do?

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,210
Why? What's wrong?

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,170
That jerk, Park Kyung Shin...

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,850
He cheated on me
and left me for her.

29
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,920
He faked the overdose too.

30
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,820
That jerk.

31
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,960
I am not letting him
get away with this!

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,970
Tell her to get back here. Now.

33
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,010
Come home.

34
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,410
- Stop being hung up on your ex.
- No way. I'm not coming back.

35
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,550
I'm going to find that jerk
and kill him.

36
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,320
Young Chae, calm down.

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,260
- Let's talk when you get back...
- I said no!

38
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,790
I'll bury him, and then I'll end...

39
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
Young Chae.

40
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,030
Mom?

41
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,110
I'll kill that jerk myself.
So get back here this instant!

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,440
Hello? What's wrong with this phone?

43
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,950
- Young Chae. Joo Young Chae!
- You should've been more patient.

44
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,580
Darn it! Try calling her back now.

45
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,220
The number you have called
is currently unavailable...

46
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,560
It says her phone is off.

47
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,490
Darn it.

48
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,370
Book a flight to Paris.
The soonest one available.

49
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,640
Mom's not going to let this slide.

50
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,610
She'll come after me
and Park Kyung Shin.

51
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,010
Unbelievable!

52
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,320
That brat, Young Chae.

53
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,460
Doesn't she know
who the Kunhyang family is?

54
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,290
Does she think she can
actually get away with this?

55
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,700
As a friend, how could you help her
with this stunt?

56
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,800
And you too, CEO Joo!

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,040
You need to leave for the airport.

58
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,540
I'll be the one to drag
Young Chae back.

59
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,410
In the meantime, CEO Joo,
you keep a close eye on this one.

60
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,680
I'll watch her.

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,980
You.

62
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,820
By the time I get back,

63
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
if you get found out,
you're finished.

64
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,820
Mom, tuck me in.

65
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,060
You're still such a baby,
aren't you?

66
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,460
Is this for Joo Young Chae?
The emerald set?

67
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,430
Yes.

68
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,570
But why are there two...

69
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,300
Is one for me?

70
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,970
You're not a big fan of emeralds.

71
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,410
Exactly. I prefer sexy rubies.

72
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,980
You think I don't know my daughter?

73
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,110
I know, right?

74
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,080
It's for me.

75
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,790
- That's not your style.
- Yes, it is.

76
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,320
No, it's not.

77
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,390
Your style is simple, yet elegant.

78
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,030
Your eyes are getting heavy.
Come on, I'll tuck you in.

79
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,570
If I sleep in here with you tonight,
Dad will be mad, won't he?

80
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,210
No, you'll be in trouble with me.

81
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,240
- Come here.
- You're impossible.

82
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,980
Are you still this crazy about him?

83
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,590
My Su A would be...

84
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,300
around 32 by now.

85
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,360
Older than Se Mi,

86
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,700
and the same age as Joo Young Chae.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,770
I wonder how much she resented me
growing up.

88
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,070
Where she is and what she's doing
with her life.

89
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,850
If she's even still alive.

90
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,800
Do you think Young Chae
will be okay?

91
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,040
She'll get the scolding of her life
and be dragged back,

92
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,270
but she'll still live
as Joo Young Chae...

93
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,780
whether she likes it or not.

94
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,410
When Young Chae comes back, you...

95
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,380
I'll have to get off the stage
once the play is over.

96
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,150
You can end this right now.

97
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,520
If you want, I'll help you.

98
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,760
You should just be a good son
and a good brother.

99
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,560
Why are you worried about me?

100
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,970
Because I feel responsible
for not stopping you, though I knew.

101
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,670
And why didn't you stop me?

102
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,140
Was it because you wanted Young Chae
to marry Jin Se Hoon smoothly?

103
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,080
I can't deny that.

104
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,920
But just so my sister
can have a secure marriage,

105
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,050
I have no intention
of supporting your charade.

106
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,860
I'm still trying to figure out
how to resolve this...

107
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,360
without you or Young Chae
getting hurt.

108
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,830
Stay out of it.

109
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,900
Young Chae and I
made this choice together.

110
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,410
If Young Chae comes back,
we'll decide what happens next.

111
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,880
One way or another.

112
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,640
So I'm just supposed to watch?

113
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,550
You're telling me
to just be a bystander?

114
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,020
I'm asking for your respect.

115
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,790
For Young Chae, and for me.

116
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,530
(Paris, France)

117
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,500
I'll search every corner of Paris.

118
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,870
If you'd just rest here,
Chairman Gong...

119
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,740
I'm looking for my daughter.
How can I sit back and do nothing?

120
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,010
This is killing me. Here, take it.

121
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,550
Find her.

122
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,650
- Nothing?
- Over there.

123
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,850
All right.

124
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,620
Excuse me, miss.
Are you from Korea? Korean?

125
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,690
- Yes.
- Yes.

126
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,790
Good. Have you seen this person?

127
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,790
It's my daughter, Joo Young Chae.

128
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,100
- Victoria?
- Yes, Victoria!

129
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,530
They know her. When did you see her?

130
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,200
- I saw her here yesterday.
- Yesterday?

131
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,970
I heard she was leaving for Milan.

132
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,610
Apparently, her ex-boyfriend
is having a fashion show there.

133
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,520
I can't believe that crazy girl!
Why go after the man who dumped her?

134
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,950
I could just...

135
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,190
Sorry. I mean, thank you.
You should come visit sometime.

136
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Darn it.

137
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,930
Young Chae went to Milan?

138
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,200
Do you really not know,
or are you just pretending?

139
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,010
I didn't know.

140
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,110
Have you heard from Young Chae?

141
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,140
No, not yet.

142
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,680
Are you being honest?

143
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,480
You two aren't up
to something again?

144
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,820
That won't happen again.

145
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,950
I'm worried about Young Chae, too.

146
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,390
Worried, my foot.

147
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,430
Are you on edge,
afraid I'll drag her back?

148
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,730
You must enjoy all her perks.
It must be pretty sweet.

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,070
Chairman.

150
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,870
This isn't the time to worry
about things like that.

151
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,740
And you have nothing to gain
by upsetting me.

152
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,780
I gave you permission
to be Young Chae for a bit,

153
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,980
and now you think you've become her.

154
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,280
You just keep
talking back to me so boldly.

155
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,580
But I am Young Chae.

156
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,990
At least until you bring her back.

157
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,520
You, of all people,
must treat me like the real Young Chae.

158
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,960
That's the only way
I can face the Kunhyang family...

159
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,230
as the real Young Chae,
not an imposter.

160
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,030
Go ahead, get as cocky as you want.

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,570
After I find Young Chae,

162
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,740
I'll decide what to do with you.

163
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,680
It won't be too late.

164
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,330
(Joo Young Chae, the chairman
is heading to Milan from Paris...)

165
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,370
Young Chae, where are you?
Are you in Milan?

166
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,970
Chairman Gong just went
from Paris to Milan.

167
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,480
So please, Young Chae.

168
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,180
Run far away.

169
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,080
Somewhere she can't find you,
and don't ever come back.

170
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,190
That's the only way
my show can go on.

171
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,390
Hi.
This is a first for us, isn't it?

172
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,190
Let's make this work.

173
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,240
I'm surprised you asked
to meet first, Se Mi.

174
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,510
To get on my good side,
you should've reached out first.

175
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,190
To make up for it,
dinner's on me tonight.

176
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,460
Is that supposed to be enough?

177
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,840
What are these flowers for?
This is so random.

178
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,310
Looks like someone's about
to propose to you.

179
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,410
I wonder who.

180
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,610
Could it be Ha Neul?

181
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,050
Joo Ha Neul?

182
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,620
Wait. Are you and my brother dating?

183
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,020
In his dreams.

184
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,130
Even after I said so many times
that I wasn't the marrying type.

185
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,160
It's a curse being this popular.

186
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,530
How romantic.

187
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,510
It really is a surprise proposal.

188
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,140
I'm so jealous.

189
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,550
The star of the show today isn't me.
It's Joo Young Chae.

190
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,380
My future sister-in-law.

191
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,090
I have an appointment,
so I should go.

192
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,120
I'll see you again later.

193
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,280
I know our families arranged this,

194
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,610
but I wanted to tell you
how I truly felt.

195
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,250
Joo Young Chae...

196
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Will you...

197
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,020
marry me?

198
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,090
When Young Chae comes back,

199
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,720
she'll take
her life back mercilessly.

200
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,490
It will feel like it's being stolen.

201
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,860
Even though it was always hers.

202
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,540
Se Hoon?

203
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,380
I'm the real Joo Young Chae.

204
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,050
She's the fake.

205
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,660
I knew it.

206
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,020
She seemed so low-class.

207
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,170
I like it.

208
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,480
What's this reaction?

209
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,140
It doesn't feel like you mean it.

210
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,450
Can you feel it?

211
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
My sincerity?

212
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,430
Young Chae.

213
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,800
Joo Young Chae!

214
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,710
(Jin Se Hoon)

215
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,960
It was a magical proposal
I could never have dreamed of...

216
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,130
as Cha Jung Won.

217
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,330
So why am I running away?

218
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Why?

219
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,880
"Go return it right now,
or the wedding is off."

220
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:16,680
Honestly, if I buy him something,
he should just shut up and wear it.

221
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,090
We'll let our daughter-in-law pick
the other wedding gifts herself.

222
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,320
Yes, ma'am.

223
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,660
Which shoe brand do you think
would suit the couple's taste?

224
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,130
I have selected a few brands
for your consideration.

225
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,830
Right this way.

226
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,530
Hold on, Secretary Yoon.

227
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,940
Jo Mi Hyang?

228
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,010
What do you mean
I can't return this?

229
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,990
I've returned items here before,
so why not these men's shoes?

230
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,590
Please look here.

231
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,220
There are clear signs of wear.

232
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,390
The back leather is creased, too.

233
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,630
That's ridiculous.

234
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,400
It's brand new.
I never even unwrapped them.

235
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,370
I returned them in the same shape.
Who could have possibly worn them?

236
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,970
My goodness, that's just bizarre.

237
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,440
But the only man in my house
is Ki Beom.

238
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,150
Perhaps your husband...

239
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,450
slipped them on for a moment.

240
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:28,050
He's the last person on earth
who would ever do that.

241
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,960
That scatterbrained woman...

242
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,400
Who said I wanted to wear this crap?

243
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,200
Did I ask to wear this garbage?
Seriously...

244
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,480
What are you doing?

245
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,720
Does posing in new shoes
bring back old memories?

246
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,920
What memories?

247
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,190
Where'd you get these shoes?

248
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,820
Take them back, now! Take them back!

249
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,130
Darn it...

250
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,740
No, that can't be.
It was just a dream.

251
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,710
Ki Beom would never do that.
Of course not.

252
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,910
I have no idea how these new shoes
ended up like this.

253
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,320
I want a refund, period.

254
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,480
Ma'am, please don't
make this difficult.

255
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,750
I'm not taking no for an answer!

256
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,760
What seems to be the problem?

257
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,600
Hello, Vice Chairman.

258
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,370
Vice Chairman?

259
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,430
My apologies for the commotion.

260
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,070
It's just that this customer...

261
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,370
Just give her what she wants.

262
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,140
Right away.

263
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,650
People in her position
really are a different breed.

264
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,890
This can't be.

265
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,830
Her, the Vice Chairman of Kunhyang?
Get real.

266
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,260
Ma'am, we're in a public place.

267
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,000
Your refund has been processed,
ma'am.

268
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,810
Thank you so much. You're an angel.

269
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:21,430
She's totally different,
but there is a resemblance.

270
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,630
Even if Young Sun's fortunes
completely turned around,

271
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,760
how could she be
Vice Chairman of Kunhyang Group?

272
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,970
Come on. That's crazy talk.

273
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,740
I need to get my eyes checked.

274
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,370
Ma'am.

275
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
Excuse me, one moment.

276
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,140
What now? Is there something else?

277
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,010
This way, please.

278
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,660
Why would a person of your stature
want to meet me in private?

279
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,030
Mi Hyang.

280
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,760
It's me,

281
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,330
Han Young Sun.

282
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,840
So it really is you.

283
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,040
Completely transformed,
from head to toe.

284
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,440
You've completely
reinvented yourself.

285
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,480
I only recognize you
because you said you're Young Sun.

286
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,480
No one would ever recognize you.

287
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,620
I've been searching for 25 years,

288
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,720
but you were hidden so well
I could never find you.

289
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,000
Mi Hyang.

290
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,230
Su A.

291
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,200
How is she?

292
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,970
She must have grown
into a beautiful young woman.

293
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,510
So tall,

294
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,010
and lovely.

295
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,680
And her studies?

296
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,820
Did she do well with her studies?

297
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,620
She always used to fall asleep
with her head on my lap.

298
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,560
Even at seven years old,

299
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,930
she could pick a fish clean
all by herself.

300
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,740
She loved riding bikes with her dad
more than anything.

301
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,540
And with her tiny, little hands,

302
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,010
she was such
a talented little artist.

303
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,380
The picture she drew for me
back then...

304
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,150
I treasure it.

305
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,420
- That's enough.
- Mi Hyang.

306
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,420
I...

307
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,560
I know I don't have
the right to ask.

308
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,490
My Su A...

309
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,030
Where is she?

310
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,730
- Tell me, please.
- Please, just stop.

311
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,340
Mi Hyang.

312
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,370
If it's about Su A,
I have nothing to say.

313
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,270
Mi Hyang.

314
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,380
You know where she is, don't you?

315
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,080
Please, help me.

316
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,110
I'm begging you, help me.

317
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,280
Mi Hyang.

318
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,680
She's dead.

319
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
What?

320
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,130
Su A...

321
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,130
is no longer with us.

322
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,830
You're lying.

323
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,540
Who would lie about a child's death?

324
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,310
Su A.

325
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,670
She was like a daughter to me, too.

326
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,380
Young Sun.

327
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,750
Leave us alone
and go back to your good life.

328
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,050
Isn't that what you did
when you abandoned her?

329
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,190
- She's not dead.
- Don't come for her now...

330
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,530
and ruin the good life
Ki Beom and I have.

331
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,700
She's not dead!

332
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,430
Tell me again! She's not dead!

333
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,400
- Get off me! Help!
- Vice Chairman, please calm down.

334
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,280
I'm going to lose my mind.

335
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,280
If you cared so much
about your child,

336
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,080
why did you abandon her
and run away?

337
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,450
You're the one who killed Su A,
Young Sun.

338
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,590
It's divine retribution.

339
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,290
If that's not, what is?

340
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,660
No... That's not true.

341
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,130
My Su A... Why?

342
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,060
Why?

343
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,930
No... How could my Su A...

344
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,270
How...

345
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,250
What have I just done?

346
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:42,390
I just told her Jung Won was dead
when she was perfectly fine.

347
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,860
I'm the one who'll pay for this.

348
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
No.

349
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,190
Even if I'm punished a thousand,
ten thousand times for this,

350
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,930
as far as Young Sun is concerned,
her daughter Su A is dead.

351
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,730
And my daughter Jung Won is alive.

352
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,840
That is the real punishment
Young Sun deserves.

353
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,670
(Kunhyang Group,
Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

354
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,880
Just having you, Assemblyman Kang,
attend...

355
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,610
will send Kunhyang's stock price
through the roof.

356
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,250
I'll meet you privately
somewhere quiet before the event.

357
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,550
Yes.

358
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,190
It's not just Assemblyman Kang.

359
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,120
Minister Jeong, Vice Minister Park,
and Assemblyman Song.

360
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,960
They're all chomping at the bit.

361
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,060
I heard Assemblyman Kang has his eye
on the presidency,

362
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,430
and it looks like
the rumors are true.

363
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,070
So he needs Kunhyang
to bankroll him?

364
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
And not only that...

365
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,810
Those sly jerks.

366
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,910
As if Kunhyang's money isn't enough
for them,

367
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,280
they want to use Gong Nan Sook
as a lifeline too?

368
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,150
Chairman,
there's an urgent matter...

369
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,390
(Kunhyang Group,
Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

370
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,620
Relax.

371
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,590
- What's so urgent?
- It's about Vice Chairman Han...

372
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,490
My wife? What about her?

373
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,960
She suddenly collapsed
and has been taken to the hospital.

374
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,900
And you're just telling me now?

375
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,530
Clear the rest of my schedule.

376
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,210
A femme fatale? Young Chae?

377
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,510
She's been acting strange
ever since I proposed.

378
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,680
She accepted the ring,

379
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,610
but never actually said...

380
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,180
yes or no. She just bolted.

381
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,990
Did you do something wrong?

382
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,860
I have no idea.

383
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,790
That's the thing.
She seemed so happy at first.

384
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,060
She's a total wild card.

385
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,230
She's impossible to read.

386
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,600
Welcome.

387
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,750
You look different today.

388
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,450
Very different.

389
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,090
This is the real me.

390
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,420
The real you?

391
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,890
This is the real Joo Young Chae?

392
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,230
Yes.

393
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,000
To put it nicely, I'm plain.

394
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,030
- And frankly, a little frumpy.
- You look so innocent.

395
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,930
Breathtakingly so.

396
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,710
I can't believe
you had this side to you.

397
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,270
The innocent type has always been
my ideal.

398
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,980
Exactly like you are right now.

399
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,050
So Young Chae suddenly showed up,
acting all innocent?

400
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,790
You think it's weird too, right?

401
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,930
She's your sister,
but you can't figure her out, right?

402
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,760
But didn't you say
the innocent type was your ideal?

403
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,400
So what's the problem?

404
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,330
A woman's allowed
to change her style.

405
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:47,970
If only that were all.

406
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,980
Young Chae, are you drunk?

407
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,660
How many bottles of soju
did you even drink?

408
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Hey!

409
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,360
It's Jin Se Hoon.

410
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,000
The Crown Prince of Kunhyang Group.

411
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,330
I'm so honored...

412
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,140
that you came to pick me up.

413
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,170
Is this how you are when you drink?

414
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,050
Let's go.

415
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,610
Stop!

416
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,450
Flaunting your money
in a place like this...

417
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,320
No, it's just tacky
to throw your money around.

418
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,030
Guys like you
probably have no idea...

419
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,260
how much three bottles
of soju cost here, do you?

420
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,670
Jerk.

421
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,450
Joo Young Chae,
what's with the loose cannon act?

422
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,990
"A loose cannon?"

423
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,990
You bet. That's me.

424
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,790
I'm also a great clown.

425
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,990
And I can put on one heck of a show.

426
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,930
The Joo Young Chae you know...

427
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,840
is a fake.

428
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,340
Okay, sure.
My Young Chae is good at everything.

429
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,010
A compliment! I'm so excited.

430
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,580
I feel like dancing!

431
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,350
Young Chae really did all that?

432
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Hard to believe, right?

433
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,960
I don't want to believe it either.

434
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,130
Why on earth
is she acting like this?

435
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,330
She won't even wear the ring
I gave her,

436
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,430
and these days
she just ignores all my calls.

437
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,400
Joo Young Chae is just too much.

438
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,300
She's like a maze.

439
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,890
Why are you here without calling?
Is something wrong?

440
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,590
Why are you being mean to Se Hoon?

441
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,600
I got bored.

442
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,500
You're doing this for fun?
You're engaged to the guy!

443
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,740
Engaged?

444
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,270
You think this is funny?

445
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,610
If you keep this up...

446
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,680
and Se Hoon learns
you're not really Young Chae,

447
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,840
what will you do?

448
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,150
What am I even saying?

449
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,420
It's because I'm scared.

450
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,720
I'm terrified I'll be found out.

451
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,820
At least Cinderella knew
she had until midnight.

452
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,190
I have no idea
when the real Young Chae might appear.

453
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,800
It could be tonight,
tomorrow morning,

454
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,470
or a week from now.

455
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,670
Without any warning, my carriage
will turn back into a pumpkin,

456
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,710
and my gown will turn to rags.

457
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,770
What if they learn
I'm not Joo Young Chae,

458
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,770
Chairwoman Gong's daughter,

459
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,780
but just a nobody
named Cha Jung Won?

460
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,850
Then just stop this now.

461
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,420
And if I do?

462
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Then what?

463
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,920
You just go back to your life
as Cha Jung Won.

464
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,790
Once a fox gets a taste
of a sweet apricot,

465
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,260
it can't stop,
even knowing it's poison.

466
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,760
It gets completely hooked
on the taste.

467
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:37,330
It says "Just one more bite,"
and ends up eating it all.

468
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Then what is it you really want?

469
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,910
I want...

470
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,080
to become the real Young Chae.

471
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,720
No more fearing
the real one showing up.

472
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,390
No more worrying about
the carriage turning to a pumpkin...

473
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,160
or losing that glass slipper.

474
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,290
I don't want to be afraid anymore.

475
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,200
I want to live...

476
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,770
as the real Joo Young Chae.

477
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,710
(A Graceful Liar)

478
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,660
