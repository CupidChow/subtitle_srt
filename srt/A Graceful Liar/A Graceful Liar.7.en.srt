1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,210
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,880
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,310
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,920
Surprised to see me?

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,630
Young Chae.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,300
What do you mean, Young Chae?

7
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,180
Why are you calling her Young Chae?

8
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,260
Hey! You conniving witch.

9
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,730
How dare you impersonate
my daughter?

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,560
What do you mean,
she's not Young Chae?

11
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,800
Just tell me what's going on!

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,640
She's right.

13
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,680
I'm not Joo Young Chae.

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,510
That's impossible.

15
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,180
You're telling me you didn't know either,
Chairman Gong?

16
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,850
Of course not!
Would I have let this go on?

17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,890
Enough with your lies.

18
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,800
You thought you could impersonate
my daughter...

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,500
and marry into the Kunhyang family?

20
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,700
You...

21
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,770
And these clothes
are Young Chae's, aren't they?

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,200
Take them off!
Take them off right now!

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,440
The purse, the shoes,
take them all off!

24
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,870
I taught her to be
impeccably punctual.

25
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,010
Young Chae doesn't quite see it
that way, Chairman Gong.

26
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,610
What do you mean, "different?"

27
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,710
She'd like to date for about a month
before deciding.

28
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,380
What? Why, that little...

29
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,080
Oh, my.

30
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,360
Oh, you know.
Just a pet name between us.

31
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,920
You get it, right?

32
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,360
I think my being here will
only make her more uncomfortable.

33
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,170
Perhaps I should see you
another time.

34
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,970
Very well.

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,540
Go on, then.

36
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,020
What is she playing at?

37
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,760
(Mom)

38
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,850
Where are you going?

39
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,980
- The person you have reached...
- Gosh, this little brat.

40
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,880
She's not answering her phone again.

41
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,750
Young Chae, I swear... Gosh!

42
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,290
Darn. Why is this thing so heavy?

43
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,490
This is so annoying!

44
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,870
You startled me.

45
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,040
Please stop. People are watching.

46
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,970
What are you talking about?
There's no one here.

47
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,470
Wait.

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,380
CEO Joo, what are you doing here?

49
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,860
Madam Gong asked if I'm with you.
She's asked twice now.

50
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,460
I've won some major brownie points
with my future mother-in-law.

51
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,600
We need to pick out
Young Chae's wedding dress.

52
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,370
Come to the hotel wedding shop
by 4 p.m. tomorrow.

53
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,470
Tomorrow afternoon?

54
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,910
She must think the vice chairman
of Kunhyang Group has time for that.

55
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,480
I have to be there,
no matter how swamped I am.

56
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,850
I can't miss out on the honor
of picking out my bride's dress.

57
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,920
Oh, Ha Neul. Young Chae
must be coming too, right?

58
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,390
Yes, probably.

59
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,300
(Episode 7)

60
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,940
This is so frustrating.

61
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,120
A month?
Is Young Chae playing hard to get?

62
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,350
Something like that.

63
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,690
That little brat...

64
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,290
Is she with that bum model again?

65
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,300
Why?

66
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,930
Are you so set on her marrying
Jin Se Hoon?

67
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,670
Especially when she's in love
with someone else?

68
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,400
Shut it.

69
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:36,270
Our families' futures are at stake.
Even if Young Chae messes around,

70
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,440
you should be the one to stop her.
That's your job as her big brother!

71
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,520
By the way...

72
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,590
You were with Jin Se Hoon
last night, right?

73
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,620
Yes. Why do you ask?

74
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,090
Well, around the same time,
I was on the phone with Young Chae,

75
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,660
and she told me she was
with Jin Se Hoon too.

76
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,870
She can be stubborn.
But she's not the type to lie.

77
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,300
And she didn't show up
at the wedding shop,

78
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,170
so I have a really bad feeling
about this.

79
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,110
Just give Young Chae some time.

80
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,450
Why does she need time?

81
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,050
Do you know how much I've invested
in Kunhyang...

82
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,750
to make this marriage happen?

83
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,350
When you invest, you don't stall.
You collect on it right away.

84
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,860
That's how you do business.

85
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,060
Don't treat it like a business deal.
Let the two figure it out.

86
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,400
Young Chae has the upper hand.
Se Hoon is way more into her.

87
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,340
You won't find another girl
out there like our Young Chae.

88
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,200
You think Jin Se Hoon
is any exception?

89
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,440
But why do I feel like that brat
is trying to avoid me?

90
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,110
Hold on a minute.

91
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,850
Yes.

92
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,090
I need to put someone
on the Kunhyang family.

93
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,660
Han Hye Ra and Jin Se Hoon.

94
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,930
Right now.

95
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,300
If you're going to tail someone,
it should be Young Chae.

96
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,200
Forget it. She knows all my tricks.

97
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,870
She's as slippery as an eel.
It's no use.

98
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,380
Should we get a new bed?

99
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,220
The one in our room
is perfectly fine.

100
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,990
About our son and Young Chae.

101
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,560
Will they live with us
or on their own?

102
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,430
Of course, they'll live with us.

103
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,430
They're the heirs to Kunhyang,
after all.

104
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,300
Young Chae's condo is
actually pretty nice.

105
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,030
I'm sure they'll want to live alone
for the first few years.

106
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,770
So that's what this is about.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,310
You're picking a bed
for their place?

108
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,140
Whether it's for their place
or for our place,

109
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,880
instead of a king-sized bed,

110
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,110
I thought a queen-sized bed
might be better.

111
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,950
Does the size really matter?

112
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,420
A twin would probably feel
spacious enough for them.

113
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,720
Brings back memories.

114
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
You're so naughty.

115
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,490
You know, we should change our bed
to a queen... No,

116
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,660
a full.

117
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,370
I still feel like
we're on our honeymoon.

118
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,670
I guess you don't feel the same way?

119
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,010
Of course I do.

120
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,610
I'm happier now
than when we were first married.

121
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,280
That young woman over there...

122
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,120
That's Joo Young Chae, isn't it?

123
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,860
Looks like our son
is finally making his move.

124
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,190
I never knew he had
that side to him.

125
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,730
He is your son.
Where else would he get it from?

126
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,200
Vice Chairman Han. I mean, honey.

127
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,540
About that bed.
Let's consider changing it.

128
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,210
Gosh, honey.

129
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,350
You said to date for a month,
so why leave me at the wedding shop?

130
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,220
- I wasn't running away from you.
- Chairman Gong?

131
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,550
You know how she is.

132
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,720
She just plows ahead
without caring what I think.

133
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,160
So then,

134
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,990
you haven't dumped me yet, right?

135
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,600
You've never been dumped before,
have you, Se Hoon?

136
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,870
- Maybe it's about time you were.
- You would regret that a lot.

137
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,380
- I'll take my chances.
- Jumping to conclusions already?

138
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,010
I have a question.

139
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,450
Yes or no.

140
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,350
- You have only two choices.
- What is this, a deposition?

141
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,190
Go on. Ask me.

142
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,760
You like me, don't you?

143
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,930
- Do I really have to say it?
- Yes or no.

144
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,300
- Fine, then don't.
- Okay, yes!

145
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,580
What if
I wasn't really Joo Young Chae?

146
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,810
Are you her long-lost twin?

147
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,020
You're asking if
I would still like you...

148
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,860
if you weren't
Chairman Gong's daughter?

149
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,290
First, Ha Neul, and now you.

150
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,260
Why do you both ask
such pointless questions?

151
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,300
You mean CEO Joo Ha Neul?

152
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,130
My brother?

153
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,770
If it weren't for Chairman Gong,
we'd never have a blind date,

154
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,570
much less marry.

155
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,940
Why is everyone so idealistic,
all of a sudden?

156
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,540
So, is that a yes or a no?

157
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,120
Yes.

158
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,950
Joo Young Chae or not,
it doesn't matter to me.

159
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,920
I can't stop thinking about you.

160
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,760
Whether I'm with you or not.

161
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,730
So you really do like me.

162
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,230
Maybe I should take out a billboard.

163
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,100
"Se Hoon loves Young Chae."

164
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,310
How about you and I
go out tomorrow...

165
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,410
as a future mother-in-law
and daughter-in-law?

166
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Who is it?

167
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,380
A guy?

168
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,350
Someone better.

169
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,890
You know how men bond by
going to the sauna together?

170
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,930
We can get to know one another here.

171
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,230
Please, no need to be so formal.

172
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,230
Should I?

173
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,340
Yes, Vice Chairman.

174
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,510
Can't you call me something else?
Something a bit friendlier?

175
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,220
- Madam?
- No, that still feels too distant.

176
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,920
How about "Future Mother-in-law?"

177
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,190
I guess we can't drop
the "future" part yet, can we?

178
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,560
Not just yet.

179
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,390
"In-law."

180
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,300
- It has a certain distance to it.
- Then...

181
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,770
Mother-to-be?

182
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,840
"Mother-to-be." I like that.

183
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,670
If you're ever in a bind,
just call me, "Mother."

184
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,340
Yes, Mother.

185
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,640
Oh, sorry.

186
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
That's much better.

187
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,630
(Ahn Ji Na)

188
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,000
She's driving me crazy.
Why is she tormenting me?

189
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,440
Ahn Ji Na is seriously obsessive.

190
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,740
No wonder my brother
was so over her.

191
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,680
Oh, Se Mi, you're here already.
What a good girl.

192
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,050
I'm just playing nice because
you said you'd buy me new stuff.

193
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,660
Hey, Young Chae.

194
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,630
Not going to say hi back?
Don't make me pout.

195
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,100
Oh, Se Mi. It's been a while.

196
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,130
It's not like I was dying to see you
or anything.

197
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,910
You should support your brother.
You're not her sister-in-law yet.

198
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,940
What? Did my brother get shot down?

199
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,980
Se Mi.

200
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,950
Looks like Jin Se Hoon
has met his match.

201
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,580
- It's not like that.
- I meant it as a compliment.

202
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,890
I'm not a big fan of pushovers.

203
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,560
Your brother is struggling
right now.

204
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,390
It's probably his first real test.
He's never been turned down before.

205
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,830
Well, that's his problem, not mine.

206
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,600
Manager Kim?
Pick styles for my son's fiancee.

207
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,900
Let's see a few options.

208
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,410
Yes, of course! I'll bring them
right out, Vice Chairman.

209
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,040
Why is Cha Jung Won
meeting Han Hye Ra and her daughter?

210
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,380
That brat, Young Chae.
Is she up to something again?

211
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,890
Cha Jung Won.
Where have I heard that name before?

212
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,390
- Manager Gu.
- Yes, ma'am?

213
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,460
This girl, Cha Jung Won.

214
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,160
Dig up everything you can on her,
down to every last detail.

215
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,510
Why? You know her?

216
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,350
I'll report to you once I'm certain.

217
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,980
All right, get to it.

218
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,690
Here you go.
The one you had your eye on.

219
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,330
"Had my eye on?"

220
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,000
Did you come here by yourself?

221
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,330
We live nearby.
I was just passing by.

222
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,470
I'll admit,
it's absolutely beautiful.

223
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,070
I'm telling you,
it was made for you.

224
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,940
How much is it?

225
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,880
- It's...
- Sir.

226
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,640
Let's go with this one.

227
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,780
Sir, this one isn't 1 carat.
It's only 0.1 carats.

228
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,890
Simple is best.
It's comfortable for everyday wear.

229
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,060
A woman deserves
at least half a carat.

230
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,360
Then go find a man who'll buy you
a half-carat ring.

231
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,370
So, this one would be
the 0.1-carat...

232
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,940
- Half-carat for me, 0.3 for him.
- Jo Mi Hyang!

233
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,070
I have my own money.

234
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,870
I'll buy diamond rings for you.

235
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,580
Where did she hide that bankbook?

236
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,650
Just leave it!

237
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:01,260
I'm going to live a long life,
so just leave it alone.

238
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,660
She's driving me crazy.

239
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,330
Jung Won,
are you sure you'll be okay?

240
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,740
What if you get caught?

241
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,670
Joo Young Chae will be back
in a week.

242
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,040
That Joo Young Chae
is something else.

243
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,610
Fine, so she's eloping or whatever.

244
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,920
But if you get caught
impersonating Joo Young Chae...

245
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,290
And putting a one-month time limit
on it is so annoying.

246
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,920
She should just stay away for good.

247
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,360
Manager, how can you say that?

248
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,490
Why not?

249
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,860
For you, it's like living like
a princess in a castle...

250
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,570
and losing it all overnight.

251
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,940
I can finally breathe.

252
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,740
Thanks to you, Manager.

253
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,610
What did I do?

254
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,780
All those thoughts
I kept bottled up inside.

255
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,880
You said them all out loud for me.

256
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,390
If you just keep bottling it up,

257
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,820
it'll all explode at once.

258
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,490
It'll be over soon.

259
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,360
Being Joo Young Chae
on a limited time...

260
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,690
isn't so bad either.

261
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,500
I'm ridiculous, aren't I?

262
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,170
You're just like Cinderella...

263
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,670
turning back to rags
at the stroke of midnight.

264
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,470
Oh, Jung Won, you poor thing.

265
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,090
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

266
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,100
I'm sure you were surprised
I asked you to come over so late.

267
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,970
Not at all, ma'am.

268
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,440
You must've been upset at the shop.
I apologize for yesterday.

269
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,740
Not at all.
Too many prying eyes around.

270
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:04,210
I heard my daughter, Young Chae,
is giving you a hard time,

271
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,280
so I invited you over to offer
some comfort and encouragement.

272
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,650
I wouldn't say
she's giving me a hard time.

273
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,760
It's more so that I'm the one
who's worried sick.

274
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,490
Here, have a drink.

275
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,560
Here.

276
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,800
All right.

277
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,380
Please take your time.

278
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,020
Gosh, that hits the spot!

279
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,170
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

280
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,890
You said it was urgent,
so I rushed right over.

281
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,690
I'm completely out of breath.

282
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,460
You call this being out of breath?

283
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,900
Before Young Chae gets back,

284
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,330
I didn't want this to get out,

285
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,570
but my mother will find out soon.

286
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,140
So be prepared.

287
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,050
Our vice chairman...

288
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,080
Actually, my mother is closer
to Young Chae than she is to me.

289
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,490
Did you have her followed?

290
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,490
There was no need for that.

291
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,900
Don't get me wrong.
Young Chae keeps avoiding me.

292
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,570
I just wanted to see
if the wedding plans were going well,

293
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,170
just to check in.

294
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,740
I've called them all off now, okay?

295
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,580
My mother says the Kunhyang family
is getting a great daughter-in-law,

296
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,110
and she is thrilled,
saying it's thanks to you, Chairman Gong.

297
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,020
That's a relief.

298
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,750
Regardless of your intentions,

299
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,550
you need to be more careful
from now on.

300
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,560
Our family isn't exactly ordinary, is it?

301
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,860
If you have questions,

302
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,060
it would be much better for you
to ask us directly,

303
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,930
Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

304
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,140
All right.

305
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,840
Gosh, it was only that one time.

306
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,080
This is between...

307
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,850
a future mother-in-law
and her future son-in-law.

308
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,250
Let's just keep it
our little secret.

309
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,990
Okay?

310
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,320
Okay, good.

311
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,030
Cha Jung Won. That witch was
posing as Young Chae, my daughter?

312
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,840
I could tear her to shreds.

313
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,040
Well then, cheers.

314
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,750
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

315
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,780
Please leave a message
after the tone.

316
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,290
(Victoria)

317
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Young Chae.

318
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,960
I think your mom is about
to find out about me.

319
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,860
What am I going to do?

320
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,770
Can't I just keep being you?

321
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,910
Can't you just stay away for good?

322
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,650
Mother?

323
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,620
Mother?

324
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,760
You're actually quite pretty
up close.

325
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,830
Not as pretty as my Young Chae,
of course.

326
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,270
You scheming little witch.

327
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,040
I knew from the start
you were a viper.

328
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,710
Let's see you endure this!

329
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,390
You vicious thing.

330
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,030
You'd rather die than apologize,
wouldn't you?

331
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,130
Who on earth are you?

332
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,160
Are you even really
Young Chae's friend?

333
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,630
How long has this been going on?

334
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,600
Young Chae doesn't come home either,
does she?

335
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,870
Where is she?

336
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,410
I asked you, where is Young Chae?

337
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,810
Young Chae isn't here right now.

338
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,420
She's not here?

339
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,590
Don't tell me...

340
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,490
Did you do something to her?

341
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,690
Did you hurt Young Chae to become
Kunhyang's new daughter-in-law?

342
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,060
No, I would never do that.

343
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,000
I would never dream of hurting my friend.

344
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,380
Then why isn't she home?

345
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,950
She won't answer my calls,

346
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,420
and if she does,
she just spouts nonsense.

347
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,590
She's in Paris.

348
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,360
Paris?

349
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,800
Did she run off
with that good-for-nothing model?

350
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,430
Yes, she did.

351
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,870
But Young Chae is coming back soon.

352
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,880
What do you mean, "soon?" When?

353
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,180
I don't know for sure.

354
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,520
But that's what she told me.

355
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,350
When she left three weeks ago,

356
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,550
she asked me to buy her a month,

357
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,120
and said she'd come back
to sort things out with you herself.

358
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,960
Until then,

359
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,300
she begged me to pretend
I was the one marrying Jin Se Hoon.

360
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,470
Bring Young Chae to me!

361
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,940
Now!

362
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,620
- Is Chilean wine okay?
- Yes, I drink that brand sometimes.

363
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,590
Aren't you the attentive son today?

364
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,590
I know you've been taking
special care of Young Chae.

365
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,230
Thank you for that.

366
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,600
I should be thanking you.

367
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,470
For falling for the woman
I had my heart set on.

368
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,970
I think Young Chae likes you
more than she likes me.

369
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,910
Thanks to you, we'll reach the altar
without a hitch.

370
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,450
Things will unfold as they should.

371
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,420
Son, just try not to let on
how eager you are.

372
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,790
- Is it that obvious?
- Everyone sees it but you.

373
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:06,030
To my son's one true love.

374
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,860
Cheers.

375
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,980
This won't do. Let's go
to the Kunhyang estate right now.

376
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,150
You will go and tell them yourself
that you're not Young Chae.

377
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,450
Let's go!

378
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,850
What do you think you're doing?

379
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,590
And what if I reveal
that I'm an impostor?

380
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,060
Are you ready for Jin Se Hoon
and Young Chae's wedding to be off?

381
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,470
Chairman Gong set up the heir
of Kunhyang Group...

382
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,470
on a blind date with an imposter.

383
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,640
Will you be okay with the world
finding that out?

384
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,710
Until Young Chae
can sort this out herself,

385
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,250
you need me too, Chairman Gong.

386
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,450
When Young Chae comes back,

387
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,760
I'll put everything back
to where it belongs.

388
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,590
So until then,

389
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,960
please let me live as Young Chae.

390
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:24,510
Fine, forget that brat Young Chae
who left you here in her place.

391
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,480
But what about you?

392
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,410
What on earth are you thinking?

393
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,620
Why go to such lengths
to pretend to be Young Chae?

394
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,690
I don't care if I'm just a fake.

395
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,630
I just want to live as her,
even for a moment.

396
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,400
I suppose it's because
I've never had a life like hers.

397
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,040
But what happens if you start
to want it for real?

398
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,340
What if you start wanting
to be the real Young Chae?

399
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,080
What will you do then?

400
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,750
Just because I want something,
doesn't mean I can have it.

401
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,120
Between Young Chae and you,

402
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,620
what chance
does someone like me stand?

403
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,340
(A Graceful Liar)

404
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,830
Jung Won, what am I going to do?

405
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,330
Park Kyung Shin cheated on me
and left me for her.

406
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,540
Does Young Chae, that brat,
think she can get away...

407
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,140
with lying to the Kunhyang family?

408
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,770
My mom is going to kill me.

409
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,540
Me and Park Kyung Shin both.

410
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,740
When Young Chae returns,
what will happen you, Jung Won?

411
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,980
The show will be over,
and it'll be time...

412
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,010
for me to leave the stage.

413
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,880
It's me, Han Young Sun.

414
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,990
Mi Hyang, where's Su A?
