1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,110
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,270
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,140
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,710
Then what is it you really want?

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,420
I want...

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,220
to become the real Young Chae.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,690
No more fearing
the real one showing up.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,460
No more worrying about the carriage
turning into a pumpkin...

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,930
or losing that glass slipper.

10
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,800
I don't want to be afraid anymore.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,100
I want to live...

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,170
as the real Joo Young Chae.

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,510
(Episode 9)

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,090
Mom.

15
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,090
She's asleep.

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,160
They gave her a sedative
at the hospital.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,990
What happened?

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,330
She must be exhausted from preparing
all your wedding gifts.

19
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,300
Why is she doing all that
by herself?

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,730
You know your mom.

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,870
She won't complain
even when things are tough.

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,210
You know your mother
is so fond of your fiancée.

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,940
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,410
I should have been more thoughtful.

25
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,180
Maybe she'd feel better
if she saw her future daughter-in-law.

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,450
Honey.

27
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,660
You should ask Joo Young Chae
to come see her.

28
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,860
Did you two have a fight?

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,160
Of course not.

30
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,330
I knew it. I bet she dumped you.

31
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,740
Jung Won. Look me in the eye.

32
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,920
Even if you act like her forever,
you can never become her.

33
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,720
Why can't I be her?

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,920
Because you're not her.

35
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,720
You're Cha Jung Won.

36
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,090
So, Young Chae was born rich...

37
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,430
and free to choose any man
or life she wanted.

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,160
And was it also her destiny
to feel no guilt...

39
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,860
even when she steals
her friend's designs?

40
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,770
Then what about me?

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,500
Was I destined to be born...

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,700
the daughter
of a poor dry cleaner...

43
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,340
and destined to be abandoned
by my own mother at seven?

44
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,050
That's not what I'm talking about.

45
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,290
If you do your best with your hand,
then someday...

46
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,490
I don't want to hear it.

47
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,260
Spare me your textbook answers.

48
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,730
Do you have any idea
what it's like to be poor...

49
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,700
or to live your life
with just a high school diploma?

50
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,970
Money isn't everything, Jung Won.

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,040
You've never had to worry
about money, have you?

52
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,010
Have you ever been down
to your last three dollars?

53
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,010
Have you ever had to survive...

54
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,480
on one pack of instant noodles
for the whole day?

55
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,550
Have you ever taken the bus
to two separate jobs,

56
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,550
only to have no money left...

57
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,860
and walk three hours home?

58
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,130
What if that's your life
every single day?

59
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Could you still say so easily
that "money isn't everything"?

60
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,030
That's not what I meant.

61
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,870
I'm just saying that having a lot
doesn't mean you have a good life.

62
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,740
Do you know how hard it is...

63
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,510
to live a "good life"
when you're poor?

64
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,920
I told myself that being a designer
was just a dream.

65
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,790
So I gave up and got a job
at some small company,

66
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,120
and tried to just settle
for an ordinary life.

67
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,730
Hi, everyone. It's my first day.
I look forward to working with you.

68
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,060
Just when I was getting used
to a normal office job,

69
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,330
somehow, they found out...

70
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Hello. I look forward to working
with you.

71
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,030
about my father who was framed.

72
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,170
Rumors about him spread
like wildfire.

73
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,540
Sorry, I'm rambling.

74
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,280
I already knew...

75
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,510
about your father.

76
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,720
How did you...

77
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,190
Back when Young Chae was
in high school,

78
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,390
she told me a strange rumor
was going around.

79
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,730
That's right.

80
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,970
People have called me
a murderer's daughter my whole life.

81
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,800
This isn't the life I chose.

82
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,840
So that makes it okay
to steal someone else's life?

83
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,540
Is that really the best solution?

84
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,240
Then what am I supposed to do?

85
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,310
I'm already in way too deep
playing this game as Joo Young Chae.

86
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,720
I wish Young Chae...

87
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,220
would just never come back.

88
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,330
Have you forgotten?

89
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,160
I'm Young Chae's brother.

90
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,970
I'm sorry. I went too far.

91
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,230
I won't accept your apology.

92
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,170
- Wait...
- Don't come out.

93
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,020
It wasn't that I refused
her apology. I had no right to.

94
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,720
I didn't stop her
from seeing me out.

95
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,750
I ran, afraid of what I might say.

96
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,190
That if all she wanted
was to be rich,

97
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,530
she didn't have to take over
Young Chae's life.

98
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,530
That I could be her lifeline,
instead of Jin Se Hoon.

99
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,970
No...

100
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,000
I want to be her lifeline.

101
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,240
Seriously?

102
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,470
Maybe not completely,

103
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,540
but is any of that true,
Joo Ha Neul?

104
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,280
You're really losing your mind.

105
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,490
The person you are calling cannot
come to the phone at the moment.

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,530
Please leave a message
after the beep.

107
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,370
I've called and texted you
many times,

108
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,570
but you're not getting back to me.

109
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,340
Let me just ask you two things.

110
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,940
First, about your friend,
Cha Jung Won.

111
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,180
Are you okay with her continuing
to live as you?

112
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,210
If you're okay with it,
I'm going to help her.

113
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,280
Second.

114
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,550
Young Chae, did you really...

115
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,860
steal Cha Jung Won's design book
and run off with it?

116
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,530
Ha Neul, you too?

117
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,360
This is unbelievable.

118
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,680
Young Chae! You're alive?

119
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,610
- Where are you?
- I'm not a ghost.

120
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,080
You don't need to know where I am.

121
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,280
I was so worried about you.

122
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,120
It sounded like you were
more worried about Jung Won.

123
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,020
That's a ridiculous thing to say.

124
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,890
You, Mr. By-the-Book,
are going to help Cha Jung Won?

125
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,230
Do I need to say more?

126
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,460
Before you come back
and fix this whole mess,

127
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,530
if Jung Won's identity gets exposed,
everything will be ruined.

128
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,070
Is that the only reason?

129
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,100
What's that supposed to mean?

130
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,600
Your first love.

131
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,370
You think I didn't know
it was Cha Jung Won?

132
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,510
Why are you bringing that up now?

133
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,680
You meet again in your thirties,

134
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,450
and you're still that
hung up on her?

135
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,020
What do you even call that feeling?

136
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,490
Don't change the subject.
How long will you run from Mother?

137
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,760
I'm not coming back
until I catch Park Kyung Shin.

138
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,890
And if you can't?

139
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,300
I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

140
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,430
Have you thought about Jung Won,
pretending to be you until then?

141
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,570
You really don't know her at all.

142
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,110
Cha Jung Won is probably praying
I never come back.

143
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,710
Because she must be having the time
of her life right now.

144
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,950
But you're not staying away
for her sake, are you?

145
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,150
Of course not.

146
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,180
I'll go back when I want to.

147
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,820
And I won't if I don't feel like it.

148
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,450
- Young Chae...
- By the way,

149
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,590
let me answer your second question.

150
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,060
About Jung Won's Design Book.

151
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,900
That's right. I stole it.

152
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,200
For your admission to the Royal Art,
and the recent designer competition,

153
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,670
did you steal her design book
and submit it as your own?

154
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,570
Did Jung Won...

155
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,540
snitch to you?

156
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,280
Just tell me if it's true or not.

157
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,750
It's true.

158
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,120
- Why would you do that?
- Because I coveted it.

159
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,950
The only thing she had
that I ever wanted.

160
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,060
So you just steal whatever you want?
Three times, at that?

161
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
Tell me about it.

162
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,330
Next thing I knew,
I'd brought her design book to Paris.

163
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,670
Fortunately, it's been getting
a great response in Paris and Milan.

164
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,610
They think I'm the one
who designed it.

165
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,310
I don't care if Jung Won
gets caught or not.

166
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,150
And I couldn't care less
if she lives there as me.

167
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,280
- Joo Young Chae.
- Tell Mom this for me.

168
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,690
Tell her to weigh
her options carefully...

169
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,320
and decide to let Jung Won marry
Jin Se Hoon as me, or kick her out.

170
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,090
It's her call.

171
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,260
Tell her...

172
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,870
that I'm out of her life for good.

173
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,240
Young Chae...

174
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,560
Dad, why are you sitting here alone?
Especially on a weekend morning.

175
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,730
Let's just get something to eat.

176
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,170
Is Mom not feeling well?

177
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,170
Didn't Dr. Kim say
there was nothing wrong?

178
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,510
Maybe it's not a physical sickness,
but a heartache.

179
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,910
It seems that way.

180
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,910
You think so?

181
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,920
I think she's fallen
out of love with me.

182
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,520
You're giving me the creeps.

183
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,820
Going on about love at your age.

184
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,090
Don't you ever get sick of it?

185
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,130
What's wrong with my age?
What do you know about love anyway?

186
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,000
When your mom is hurting,

187
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,270
I hurt even more.

188
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,630
I even lost my appetite.

189
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,370
And on top of that,
Se Hoon is lovesick.

190
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,780
None of the men in this house
are unbearable.

191
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,290
Why are you giving me
that death glare?

192
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,990
You're going to give me indigestion.

193
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,540
If you cared so much
about your child,

194
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,140
why did you abandon her
and run away?

195
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,580
You're the one who killed Su A,
Young Sun.

196
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,280
It's divine retribution.
If that's not, what is?

197
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,160
My Su A...

198
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,330
There's no way my Su A
could've died so senselessly.

199
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,840
Jo Mi Hyang must be lying.

200
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,960
- It's cold. I'll go warm it up.
- Just leave it.

201
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,600
I'm not hungry.

202
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,040
Did you have something on your mind?

203
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,710
What Jo Mi Hyang said...

204
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,910
I can't believe her.

205
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,950
Should I look into her?

206
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,740
Perhaps I was being oversensitive.

207
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,710
If we check her purchases
from our department store,

208
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,780
we might find something.

209
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,940
If we're lucky,

210
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,350
we could get her contact
and address.

211
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,300
She seems to be
in a better mood today.

212
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,740
Hey.

213
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,250
Jin Se Hoon!

214
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,390
What do you think you're doing?

215
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,720
Did Joo Young Chae
turn down your proposal?

216
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,260
Not exactly.

217
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
She won't see me.

218
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,430
Does she answer her phone?

219
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,770
She hasn't picked up in a while.

220
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,810
You got shot down for real.

221
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,610
Then why did she accept
the engagement ring?

222
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,280
I know, right? Joo Young Chae
isn't moved by diamonds.

223
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Why? What is it?

224
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,130
What is it?

225
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,500
What's in it for me if I help you
get back with Joo Young Chae?

226
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,200
Anything! I'll give you
the moon and the stars.

227
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,600
What would I even do with the stars
that you give me? I'll pass.

228
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,140
Then what is it that you want?

229
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,440
I'll tell you later.
But no backing out.

230
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,040
So childish.

231
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,380
- Should we copy and laminate it?
- That's childish.

232
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:52,060
My mom is sick. Please come visit.
My future sister-in-law.

233
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,890
This ring is mine.

234
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,290
Because I am
the real Joo Young Chae.

235
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,470
Mom, you're supposed to be sick.
Do you have to get all dolled up?

236
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,150
Her days as a guest are numbered.
I have to be polite.

237
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,690
If I were you, I'd be in bed,
playing up how sick I am.

238
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,650
That's how you show
your future daughter-in-law who's boss.

239
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,660
I want to make a good impression.
Is that so wrong?

240
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,330
I should just mind my own business.

241
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,400
Wrong.
You're just a big softie underneath.

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,100
- Me?
- You didn't know?

243
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,210
You act all tough and snappy,
but you're really a big softie.

244
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,650
Thanks, but no thanks!

245
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,720
What's Se Hoon up to?

246
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,560
He was moping around,
but now he's all excited.

247
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,360
He's probably in the walk-in closet,
having his own little fashion show.

248
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,630
And Dad?

249
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,800
Dad, this is overkill.

250
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:40,000
Are you the groom or something?
Why dress up at home on a weekend?

251
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,910
Your mother's making this
a big deal.

252
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,340
I have to dress the part.

253
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,610
This one looks better, Chairman.

254
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,210
Since it's the weekend
and we're at home...

255
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,150
You're saying I don't need to wear
a full suit?

256
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,750
That's correct, Chairman.

257
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,090
You've got a point.

258
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,490
Unbelievable.

259
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,930
You completely ignored me
when I said the same thing.

260
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,760
Do I look like
a doting future father-in-law?

261
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,630
Yes, absolutely.

262
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,170
(Background Check: Cha Jung Won)

263
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,280
This report on Cha Jung Won.
Are you sure this is accurate?

264
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,850
Yes, it is.

265
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,050
She must think
I'm a complete pushover.

266
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,270
Chairman.

267
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,000
You came without letting me know.

268
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,240
- What do you think you're...
- Your father...

269
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,680
is the killer, Cha Ki Beom?

270
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,980
Do you even know
who your father killed?

271
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,520
Joo Sang Cheol.

272
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,220
Joo Ha Neul's biological father.
He's my ex-husband.

273
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,760
You knew all this and deliberately
approached my Young Chae,

274
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,600
and are you planning
on getting some kind of revenge?

275
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,270
I never would have dreamed.

276
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:17,940
I never knew...

277
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,670
that the person who passed away...

278
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,940
was CEO Joo Ha Neul's father.

279
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,340
And revenge?
What are you talking about?

280
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,350
You're ignoring the heinous crime
he committed,

281
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,080
and acting like my family is the one
who wrongly imprisoned your father.

282
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,660
So you pushed Young Chae
out of the way...

283
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,290
and planned to become
the Kunhyang Family's daughter-in-law?

284
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,630
No, that's not it at all.

285
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,400
I admit I wanted to be in her shoes.

286
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
But...

287
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,370
it wasn't premeditated,

288
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,140
and I never once thought
about revenge.

289
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,310
Because my father is innocent.

290
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,980
And who's going to believe that?

291
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,120
My father was with me that day.

292
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,580
He was framed!

293
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,490
I can prove it.

294
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,820
Please, believe me.

295
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,860
You!

296
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,260
Get out of this house right now!

297
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,870
What about Young Chae?

298
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,600
Have you found her yet?

299
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,670
- What?
- Se Hoon and Vice Chairman Han...

300
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,510
think I'm Young Chae.

301
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,340
Are you sure you'll be fine
without me?

302
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,950
Until Young Chae comes back,

303
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,090
even if I wanted to leave,
you should be stopping me.

304
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,320
You should be on your knees,
begging me to stay...

305
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,070
If I visit the Kunhyang family
with a slap mark on my face,

306
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,070
what do you think they'll say?

307
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,940
Why would you visit them?

308
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,610
I'm supposed to visit
Vice Chairman Han, who is sick now,

309
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,940
as their future daughter-in-law.

310
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,250
Han Hye Ra is sick?

311
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,650
My appointment is soon.

312
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,280
So I'd better go ice my face.

313
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,490
What? Are they already that serious?

314
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,370
Hey, it's me.

315
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,700
Where do you think?
I'm at my daughter's.

316
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,140
Listen, Ha Neul.
There's something I need you to do.

317
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,580
I must be nothing
but Chairman Gong's son,

318
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,520
and Joo Ha Neul,
Joo Young Chae's brother.

319
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,230
Because that's the choice I made.

320
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,460
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

321
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,070
If he finds out
Young Sun is now a tycoon's wife,

322
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,940
he would have a heart attack.

323
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,850
- What trouble did you get into now?
- You scared me.

324
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,580
I know what you're up to
just by the look in your eyes.

325
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,320
I can hear a pumpkin rolling
from a mile away.

326
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,320
What? Are you calling me a pumpkin?
I'm a watermelon.

327
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,060
See? Smooth and curvy
like a watermelon, right?

328
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,290
So, what is it?

329
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,930
Did you buy something else?
Wasn't that set of dishes enough?

330
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,130
Did you splurge
on another thousand-dollar designer bag?

331
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,900
A designer bag? Please.
I didn't even buy a tote bag.

332
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Honey.

333
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,110
I was just wondering something.

334
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,580
What?

335
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,290
It's about Young Sun.

336
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,160
What if she married into power,
no, I mean, a conglomerate family,

337
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,000
and showed up looking for our Su A,
I mean, for Jung Won?

338
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,500
What the heck are you talking about?

339
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,470
Why keep talking about that monster?

340
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,470
Who cares if she's a tycoon's wife
or the First Lady?

341
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,110
She has nothing to do with Jung Won.

342
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,980
I never said she did.
It was just a hypothetical.

343
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,610
Why even imagine something
like that?

344
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,020
You say that woman's name
one more time,

345
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,490
the wedding will be toast.

346
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,320
You always threaten to cancel it
over nothing.

347
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,860
Like I'm scared.

348
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,460
What's wrong with toast?
It's delicious.

349
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,300
Maybe I should make
some French toast.

350
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:49,140
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

351
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,710
I made her think
our perfectly fine Jung Won...

352
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,110
had passed away,

353
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,310
but there's no way Young Sun
would fall for that.

354
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,280
The department store card!

355
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:06,220
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

356
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,360
Is this Kunhyang Department Store
customer service?

357
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,090
I'd like to confirm...

358
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,660
the contact info on file
for an account.

359
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,170
Excuse me,
have you seen this woman before?

360
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
I'm pretty sure she lives
in this neighborhood.

361
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,270
Never seen her before in my life.
Why?

362
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,710
- Did she skip out on a debt?
- No.

363
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,910
If you do happen to see her,

364
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,980
please contact me at this number.

365
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,520
I'll make sure
you're generously rewarded.

366
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,920
- A reward?
- Yes. So please, keep an eye out.

367
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,320
Hold on...

368
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,700
You scared me!
I nearly jumped out of my skin.

369
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,770
Mr. Geum, you're the best.

370
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,570
You live and die for your friends!

371
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,910
Right?

372
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,770
So, what trouble did you get into?

373
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,310
Why is a big company
looking for you?

374
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,450
I'm trying my best to prevent
an even bigger disaster.

375
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,320
I don't know the story behind it,
but this is a big neighborhood.

376
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,290
You've really got your work cut out
for you.

377
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,990
That's an understatement.

378
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,790
Nothing in this world...

379
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,560
can stop my love for my daughter,
Jung Won.

380
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,100
Looks like this is all
for your daughter.

381
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,580
My mother received word
that Vice Chairman Han is unwell,

382
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,550
and she sent me here with Dr. Jung,
our family's physician.

383
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,250
Why are you here, Ha Neul,

384
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,120
and not my future sister-in-law,
Joo Young Chae?

385
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,830
My family has its own doctors.
This is ridiculous.

386
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,870
Chairman Gong thinks we were rude
to her daughter before the wedding.

387
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,770
That's not her intention, Chairman.

388
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,070
It's been a while.

389
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,280
Vice Chairman Han, let me start
by taking your pulse.

390
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,510
Yes, of course, Dr. Jung.

391
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,850
How thoughtful of Chairman Gong.

392
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,150
I'm in your hands, Dr. Jung.

393
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,990
I've had
absolutely no energy lately.

394
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,460
Hey, wait a second.

395
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,540
Wait, this is clearly a scenario
I planned,

396
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,610
but why did the whole cast change?

397
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,350
I'm glad to see our special guest,
Ha Neul, but...

398
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,620
But the vibe in here
is really tense.

399
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,930
Why won't Chairman Gong let
Young Chae come to our house?

400
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,130
What's wrong with visiting
her future mother-in-law?

401
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,270
Who knows
what Madam Gong is thinking?

402
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:09,270
You think Chairman Gong is having
second thoughts about this marriage?

403
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,480
That's not it. I'm sure.

404
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,610
Then why?

405
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,080
Maybe it's some kind of power play
between your mother and my mother?

406
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,920
So, Gong Nan Sook's daughter
shouldn't come...

407
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,420
to the Kunhyang home
and humble herself for a sick visit?

408
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,460
Something like that.

409
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,160
She might've felt it was a rehearsal
for being hazed by her in-laws.

410
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Se Hoon.

411
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,470
If she weren't
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter,

412
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,050
do you think you
and Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra...

413
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,880
would still like Young Chae
as much as you do now?

414
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,890
Are you asking if I genuinely
like Young Chae?

415
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,490
Do you like her as Joo Young Chae,
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter?

416
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,090
Or do you like her for who she is?

417
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,660
- What's the difference?
- There's a huge difference.

418
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,500
You want me to assess Young Chae
without our families' arrangement?

419
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,570
This is the second time
I've been asked that.

420
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,080
Who do you think you are,
going to a place like that?

421
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,150
I made a promise
that I would go see her.

422
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,990
Ha Neul already handled it.
Stay out of it.

423
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,190
Vice Chairman Han is expecting me.

424
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,630
Hey! You, Cha Jung Won!

425
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,660
Snap out of it.

426
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,230
If Jin Se Hoon finds out
who you really are,

427
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,640
do you think he'd even give you
the time of day?

428
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,510
Se Hoon likes me.

429
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,110
And so does
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra.

430
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,050
How dare you even dream
of such a thing?

431
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,490
Listen to you.

432
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,290
Don't tell me...

433
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,330
if Young Chae never came back,
were you going to take her place?

434
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,760
You're insane.

435
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,370
You've been living in a fantasy,
haven't you?

436
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,510
I'm about to give you
a rude awakening.

437
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,810
You're coming with me.

438
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,280
With you?

439
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,950
We're going to the Kunhyang home,
and I'll tell them who you are.

440
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,120
Are you serious?

441
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,190
Why? You think I'm bluffing?

442
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,090
Whether my Young Chae
comes back or not,

443
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,520
do you think...

444
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,260
I'd let the daughter of the murderer
who killed my ex-husband...

445
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,060
pass as my own child?

446
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,270
I would pretend
that my Young Chae is dead.

447
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,230
But to replace her
with the likes of you?

448
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,640
I said, let's go!

449
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,280
(A Graceful Liar)

450
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,940
A murderer's daughter
has some nerve.

451
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,310
Will only death make you see sense?

452
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,520
I won't get caught. Even if I do,
I'll say I acted alone.

453
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,790
As a man, I love Joo Young Chae
for the woman she is.

454
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,220
He says he loves your daughter
for who she is, Chairman Gong.

455
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,730
You should be sincerely happy
for them.

456
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,090
This happiness may have started
with a lie,

457
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,300
but I still want to be happy.

458
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,500
Sinking in a swamp of sweet lies,
she dreams an even sweeter dream.

459
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,770
It's already too late to turn back.

460
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,370
