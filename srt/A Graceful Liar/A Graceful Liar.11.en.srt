1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,210
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,270
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,110
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,510
What if Young Chae wants
Jin Se Hoon,

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,950
and wants to marry
into the Kunhyang Family?

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,720
If that's
what Young Chae truly wants,

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,520
and if Se Hoon no longer loves me
and wants her instead,

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,400
then I'll gladly give everything up
and walk away.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,640
Sign it.

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,280
I am Joo Young Chae now.

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,350
(Name: Cha Jung Won)

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,750
The one officially recognized
by her mother,

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,780
Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,420
I'm officially Joo Young Chae.

15
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,860
Just because you signed
a scrap of paper,

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,230
don't you dare think you've
actually become my Young Chae.

17
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,150
(Episode 11)

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,390
Yes, the Kim Jung Ho piece...

19
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,600
I told you we can't be seen together
at official events yet.

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,070
But I want to.

21
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,370
I want to show you off.

22
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,480
Next up, we have the piece that's
garnered the most attention today.

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,220
It is a white porcelain moon jar
from the late Joseon Dynasty.

24
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,420
With its round, moon-like shape
and its pure white color,

25
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,220
it's a symbol of Joseon aesthetics.

26
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,990
The appraised value is
two million dollars.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,230
Do I have 2.1 million dollars?

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,760
- Two and a half million.
- Two and a half million.

29
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,160
- Three million.
- Three million.

30
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,530
- I bid 3.2 million.
- I have 3.2 million dollars.

31
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,270
Any other bids?

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,900
Mother would love that.

33
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Four million.

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,050
Paddle 54 bids 4 million dollars.

35
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,210
Any other bids?

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Four million dollars.

37
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,090
Sold for four million dollars.

38
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,730
Why didn't you bid?

39
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,930
I'm not interested.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,300
But it's a wedding gift.

41
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,740
It should be Mother who should
be more concerned than you.

42
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,400
Just wait.
The right one will be up soon.

43
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,580
A piece by
new artist Lee Seung Hwan,

44
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,150
"Watercolor of a Beach."

45
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,050
"Watercolor" is in the title itself.

46
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,790
It is praised for capturing
a cultural landscape of our time...

47
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,790
through modern-day leisure.

48
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,590
The appraised value
is 500,000 dollars.

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,930
Do I have 510,000 dollars?

50
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,300
Do I have any bids?

51
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
I bid 510,000 dollars.

52
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,800
I have 510,000 dollars.
Do I have 520,000?

53
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,110
No other bids?

54
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,540
Then this piece sells
for 510,000 dollars...

55
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,010
One million.

56
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,420
The piece by artist Lee Seung Hwan
goes to paddle number 56,

57
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,820
sold for one million dollars.

58
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,790
Joo Young Chae,
that insufferable brat.

59
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,360
- Who on earth is she?
- She's Chairman Gong's daughter.

60
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,130
Jin Se Hoon's fiancée?

61
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,100
Gosh,
so the marriage rumors are true.

62
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,530
Really? Are you serious?

63
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,140
- For real?
- Really?

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,470
You really think
my mother will like it?

65
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,710
That's a secret for now.
It's a surprise gift.

66
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,880
I think 520,000 dollars
would have been enough.

67
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,520
- Why bid a million then?
- To give the artist recognition.

68
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,620
In a few years, it'll be worth
three or four times as much.

69
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,160
Okay.

70
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,690
What about you?

71
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,130
Is there anything you want?

72
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,530
You can't get pregnant. Ever.

73
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,270
What am I to do, Chairman Gong?

74
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,770
Everything you tell me not to do
is exactly what I want to do.

75
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,470
Just like Young Chae did.

76
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,280
A little Jin Se Hoon.

77
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,180
Let's go.

78
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,550
(Kunhyang Group)

79
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,030
They're alone?

80
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,560
They're discussing
the wedding gifts.

81
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,130
Poor, sweet Vice Chairman Han.
How can she face that wicked witch?

82
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,800
I have to go check on them.

83
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,340
Don't worry, sir.
Vice Chairman Han is tough as nails.

84
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,070
Her opponent is Gong Nan Sook.

85
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,040
If you'd told me about it sooner,

86
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,510
I would've given her
a bulletproof vest.

87
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,350
The Bedro bed takes six months.
I've placed the order.

88
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,790
And for the sofa,
I think this one would be good.

89
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,160
Goodness, why is this so expensive?

90
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,130
It doesn't even look like leather.

91
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,900
You're paying for the brand name.

92
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,070
I don't understand why anyone would
waste so much money on furniture.

93
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,040
That's not how I raised my daughter.

94
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,340
Then,
is there a brand you had in mind?

95
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,780
You know what? The bed, the sofa...

96
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,250
You can just decide on everything.

97
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,150
Their apartment
is already fully furnished.

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,120
An apartment?

99
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,190
My son...

100
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,390
is the heir to Kunhyang Group.

101
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,160
Isn't it right for them to live
at my house for three years?

102
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,070
Oh, please. The only thing
my daughter knows how to do...

103
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,440
is breathe.

104
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,540
She's not cut out to manage
a large household like the Kunhyang house.

105
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,040
She's more than capable.
She has what it takes.

106
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,210
Excuse me?

107
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,610
I know your daughter
better than you.

108
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,680
- She's so sharp.
- She's devious.

109
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,750
- She's the epitome of humility.
- She's just classless.

110
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,220
She's so considerate.

111
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,690
That's because
she walks on eggshells.

112
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,690
She's incredibly confident.

113
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,460
She's got a lot of nerve.

114
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,330
She's truly a gem.

115
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,730
She's an upstart who's out of line.

116
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,170
And she gets it all from me...

117
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,640
Funny how she's nothing
like her mother.

118
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,140
What did you just say to me?

119
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,520
Chairman Gong, good to see you.

120
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,320
You look especially...

121
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,920
Especially what?

122
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,460
Beautiful.

123
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,060
You certainly have a way...

124
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,200
of stating the obvious.

125
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,110
Seeing you all get along so well,

126
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,740
I assume
the gift exchange went well?

127
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,940
By the way, are you considering
putting my daughter...

128
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,250
through the wringer as a new bride?

129
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,510
The wringer?

130
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,220
I said our daughter-in-law is lovely
and should live with us,

131
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,960
and now she's reacting like this.

132
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,060
That's just what
we parents would like.

133
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,430
Shouldn't we let the kids
decide for themselves?

134
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,810
Does it really matter that much?

135
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,820
It doesn't matter where we live,
as long as I'm with Young Chae.

136
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,250
Exactly.

137
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,320
To enjoy your honeymoon phase,
you two should live on your own...

138
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,990
I'll move into the Kunhyang home.

139
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,290
What?

140
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,860
How can you run
that household alone?

141
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,130
Have you lost your mind?

142
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,740
I mean, are you seriously saying
you'll just move in there?

143
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,570
What if you get caught?

144
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,470
You want Kunhyang Group, don't you?

145
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,810
I'm saying I'll help you get it,
Chairman Gong.

146
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,620
However, I'd like to ask
for one wedding gift,

147
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,720
Mother, Father.

148
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,090
My dear,

149
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,490
I was wondering what to get you
since you seem to have everything,

150
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,730
but it's even better
if you tell us yourself.

151
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,430
What is it you'd like?
Name anything.

152
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,800
No, if there was something
you wanted,

153
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,800
you should have told
your mother first.

154
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,810
Three percent of Kunhyang's stock.

155
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,980
Will you look at that?
She knows how to strike a bargain.

156
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,980
Young Chae, I didn't think
you were interested in the business.

157
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,120
I'm planning on taking
an interest from now on.

158
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,360
What brought this on
all of a sudden?

159
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,930
I can't just stand by Se Hoon's side
like a doll, can I?

160
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,630
If I'm going to support my husband,
I need to do it right.

161
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
And...

162
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
And?

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,540
My mother.

164
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,240
People call her nothing more
than a rich loan shark.

165
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,240
I don't want her to have
to hear that anymore.

166
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,180
My goodness.

167
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,050
I guess it's true what they say
about daughters being the best.

168
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,620
To improve your mother's standing,

169
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,390
you'll get three percent
of Kunhyang's stock.

170
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,430
I'll have them transferred to you
right after the wedding.

171
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,170
My goodness!
You are just the sweetest.

172
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,270
She asked for Kunhyang stock
as a wedding gift?

173
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,540
I knew she was no pushover,
but she's got some real nerve.

174
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,310
She sees right through you, Mom.

175
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,650
She's got the cunning of ten foxes
all working together in her head.

176
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,650
With our stocks combined,
that's 15 percent.

177
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,760
Once they get married,

178
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,660
our family becomes
a major Kunhyang shareholder.

179
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,290
Congratulations.

180
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,100
I'm just ecstatic.

181
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,600
She's nothing
like our Joo Young Chae.

182
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,630
That girl has all flash
and no substance.

183
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,540
She's so ridiculously soft-hearted.

184
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,410
Why chase a guy
who doesn't like her?

185
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,510
It's so frustrating.

186
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,580
Is there still no word
from Young Chae?

187
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,650
Heard from Jung Won? Nothing.

188
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,190
You know she would wake...

189
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,160
from a dead sleep
for sweet potatoes.

190
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,000
That pale-faced guy
would hiccup every time he spoke.

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,530
He got a free meal ages ago,

192
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,370
and we haven’t heard a word
from him since.

193
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,300
Sounds like
you were waiting for him.

194
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,810
You were acting like
you couldn't stand him.

195
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,910
Waiting? Don't be ridiculous.

196
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,680
If he was here to scope us out,
he should've been less obvious.

197
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,310
He seemed to come
from a rich family.

198
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,410
He looked kind too.

199
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,180
He even knew my special soy stew.
Totally my kind of guy.

200
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,850
There you go
with that nonsense again.

201
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,590
I mean, he's a perfect match
for Jung Won.

202
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,990
Just give a call.

203
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,830
Our future son-in-law?
I didn't get his number.

204
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,560
Future son-in-law, my foot.

205
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,160
You never know.

206
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,300
I said, call Jung Won.

207
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,500
She can handle herself.

208
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,900
Go to the department store tomorrow
and check on her yourself.

209
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,570
I'm not going
to the department store.

210
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,240
You? The Jo Mi Hyang who's crazy
about department stores?

211
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,080
If I see it, I'll want it.
There's too much I'd want to buy.

212
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,250
I'll go on a spending spree.

213
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,520
Is it that much trouble for you?

214
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,420
Is it because you didn’t give birth
to her yourself?

215
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,390
What do you mean,
I didn't give birth to her?

216
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,960
Cha Jung Won is my daughter.

217
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,160
Ki Beom, you shouldn't say
things like that.

218
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,500
I've doted on her
since she was seven,

219
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,400
and if she so much as caught a cold,

220
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,170
I'd stay up all night
caring for her.

221
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,900
I treated her like
she was made of glass.

222
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,740
I know.
I'll go to the department store.

223
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,540
No, I'll go to the department store.

224
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,180
I was wondering
if you'd seen a ghost...

225
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,020
at the department store
or something.

226
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,420
What am I going to do?
What if I run into Young Sun again?

227
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,300
- Knock, knock.
- Gosh. Hi, honey.

228
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,570
Do you want to have a glass of wine?

229
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,780
The bedroom's so empty without you.
It feels like Siberia.

230
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,980
It's freezing.

231
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,650
You rashly promised company stock...

232
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,720
to our future daughter-in-law,
and now you can't sleep?

233
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,390
There's no fooling you.

234
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,020
What's the problem?

235
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,900
If Gong Nan Sook has seven percent,
Joo Ha Neul has five percent,

236
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,000
and Joo Young Chae has
three percent, then...

237
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,260
Fifteen percent total?

238
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,930
If two of them consolidate stocks
with one person,

239
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,870
that person would become
the largest shareholder.

240
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,570
I'm talking about
our future daughter-in-law.

241
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,870
She's greedier than I thought.

242
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,940
I'd call it ambition.

243
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,150
"Ambition?" It's the same thing.

244
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,220
It's not.

245
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,650
Greed grows into avarice,

246
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,390
and that path leads
only to downfall.

247
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,760
But when ambition grows,

248
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,530
it can take a barren field of gravel
where nothing has ever grown...

249
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,460
into soil where lush green trees
can grow all year long.

250
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,570
Do you think that girl
is capable of that?

251
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,140
Just you wait and see.

252
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,840
She'll be a breath of fresh air
for the Kunhyang family and company.

253
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,480
What if that girl's ambition
turns into greed?

254
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,580
And grows into avarice?

255
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,410
I'm telling you that won't happen.

256
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,810
You worry too much.

257
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,290
There is one gift I'd like.

258
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,550
Three percent of Kunhyang's stock.

259
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,690
If that day comes,

260
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,060
I'll have to cut out
our dear daughter-in-law.

261
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,700
In a single stroke.

262
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,010
He told me to come, so here I am,

263
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,120
but why is
my heart pounding so hard?

264
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,150
I'm scared to death
I'll be found out.

265
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,060
You're saying you found
Jo Mi Hyang's home?

266
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,060
Yes. The owner of a jewelry store
near Seonyudo Station got in touch.

267
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,400
But last time, he claimed
he didn't know anything.

268
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,670
It was the reward money.

269
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,940
To make sure
he keeps his mouth shut,

270
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,510
give him double what we promised.

271
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,980
Understood.

272
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,410
Cancel the rest of my appointments
for today.

273
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,950
I'm going alone.
Text me the address.

274
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,000
Welcome, Mr. Vice President.

275
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,870
And to his fiancée.

276
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,640
This is a little too tame for you,
isn't it?

277
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,940
On the contrary. I love it.

278
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,610
Thanks to your taste, Manager Kim,
I might become elegant and refined!

279
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,620
This is surprisingly affordable.
Are you sure this is all you want?

280
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,260
I like it even more for the price.

281
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,830
You've been going so easy
on my wallet lately, honey.

282
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,100
Splurging because you make a lot
isn't my style.

283
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,470
You'll make me keep a ledger
when we're married.

284
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,740
That's a great idea!
How much you spend a day,

285
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,940
and where every last penny
goes in the ledger. Deal?

286
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,180
Hey, I like this one.

287
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,950
We'll take this one. Deal.

288
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,590
You're just like a real Cinderella.

289
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,530
You look perfect. You're the best.

290
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,030
So, what about the real
Joo Young Chae?

291
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,530
Still no word.

292
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,200
You don't even know where she is?

293
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,070
I wish she'd just disappear
off the face of the earth.

294
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,320
I'm keeping my place...

295
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,220
even if Joo Young Chae returns,

296
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,420
no matter what it takes.

297
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Can I help you find something?

298
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,630
Oh my goodness.

299
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,400
You startled me.

300
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,810
My daughter, Jung Won, works here.

301
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,910
I'm sorry, who?

302
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,210
Cha Jung Won.

303
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,350
I'm sorry?
Could you speak up a little, please?

304
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,650
Cha Jung...

305
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,050
Won.

306
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,950
Cha Jung Won.

307
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,620
We don't have a part-timer
with that name here.

308
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,760
Unless she worked here
before I joined.

309
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,290
What?

310
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,830
What are you talking about?

311
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,300
Then what about
Manager Kim Sung Hee?

312
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,300
Where is she?

313
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,470
Don't tell me she got fired.

314
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,910
If I ask Manager Kim,

315
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,240
she'll probably know
what's going on.

316
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,610
Oh, Manager Kim!

317
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,250
Let's go.

318
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,420
Why is she all dressed up
like a princess?

319
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,490
What's going on?

320
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,490
Wait, that's not Mr. Hiccups.

321
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,430
Jung Won...

322
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,030
Just stay put.

323
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,770
Why did you cover my mouth?
I almost suffocated!

324
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,740
I'm so sorry. It was urgent.

325
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,240
I don't care how urgent it was.

326
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,250
Why wouldn't you let me call out to
my own daughter, Jung Won?

327
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,320
The thing is...

328
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,420
The thing is what?

329
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Is my Jung Won...

330
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,350
cheating on that other guy?

331
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,020
"Cheating?"

332
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,690
No, what are you...

333
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:45,130
Oh, my.
I guess you don't know Mr. Hiccups.

334
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,260
Mr. Hiccups?

335
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,330
Does the Vice President
have a bad case of the hiccups?

336
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,540
Vice President?

337
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,070
Vice President of what company?

338
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,410
I don't know.

339
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,940
Ask Jung Won yourself.

340
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,990
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

341
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,690
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

342
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,050
Welcome.

343
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,480
You're here to drop something off?

344
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,920
You don't look like you're
from around here.

345
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Ki Beom.

346
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
It's me.

347
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,070
It's Young Sun.

348
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,670
Han Young Sun.

349
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,470
I need to talk to you for a minute.

350
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,140
You've got the wrong person.

351
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,910
I don't know you.

352
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,280
I've been looking for you for ages.

353
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,950
Who's been looking for who?

354
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,150
What right do you have...

355
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,460
Get out. Now!

356
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,060
Just tell me one thing.
Then I'll leave.

357
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,900
Please.

358
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,330
I have nothing to say. Now get lost!

359
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,200
Our Su A...

360
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,910
She's alive, isn't she?

361
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,080
She hasn't passed away, has she?

362
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,050
Mi Hyang was lying, wasn't she?

363
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,120
And what would you do if you knew?

364
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,490
Twenty-five years ago,

365
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,730
you abandoned your own child.

366
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,030
What gives you the nerve
to come here and ask about her?

367
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,980
The thought
that Su A might be gone...

368
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,720
It's just tearing me apart.

369
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,120
Please, just tell me she's alive.

370
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,990
Let me see her just once.
Let me hold her just one time.

371
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,230
I want to touch her.

372
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,800
I want to burn the image
of her eyes, nose,

373
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,140
and lips into my memory.

374
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,110
Please, I'm begging you.
You're Su A's father.

375
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,440
Please...

376
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,320
Just once.

377
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,520
If that's what you want so badly,

378
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,120
then I'll grant your wish.

379
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,160
So our Su A is alive?

380
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Right?

381
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,700
I said I'd let you see her.

382
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,650
Jung Won is definitely
two-timing someone.

383
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,520
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

384
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,120
How did she find this place?

385
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,360
One of the neighbors
must have sold us out.

386
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,270
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

387
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,510
This is a disaster.

388
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,670
What am I going to do?

389
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,620
Our Su A is alive.

390
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,290
I can finally see her.

391
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,020
I nearly jumped out of my skin
when I ran into her.

392
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,790
And then she just started demanding
to know where Su A was.

393
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,760
What was I supposed to do?
What could I possibly say?

394
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,790
That she's alive?

395
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,360
That we renamed her Jung Won,
after my daughter who passed away?

396
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,030
And that I registered her as my own?
Was I supposed to confess all that?

397
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,200
Do you think I enjoyed...

398
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,470
pretending a living child was dead?

399
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,210
If I'm punished for it, so be it.

400
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,820
That punishment
isn't for you to take.

401
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,920
I'll take it all.
The punishment is mine.

402
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,150
Ki Beom, what are you talking about?

403
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,690
Go to bed.

404
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,190
What about you?

405
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,530
I'm going to get some fresh air.

406
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,980
(Cha Su A. May you be free from pain
and play to your heart's content.)

407
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,880
How could...

408
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,850
How could this happen?

409
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,160
No!

410
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,990
No!

411
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,430
No!

412
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,130
(Cha Su A. May you be free from pain
and play to your heart's content.)

413
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,900
Su A.

414
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,380
Su A.

415
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,720
(Cha Su A. May you be free from pain
and play to your heart's content.)

416
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,780
Mommy's here to get you.

417
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,350
Mommy's here to get you.

418
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,720
Why are you here? Why?

419
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,730
It's all my fault.

420
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,600
I should have gone with you then.

421
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,700
I didn't know
I would never see you again.

422
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,450
(Jo Jung Won)

423
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,020
(May you be free of pain
and play to your heart's content.)

424
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,090
Jung Won.

425
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,060
I'm so sorry.

426
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,300
(Cha Su A. May you be free from pain
and play to your heart's content.)

427
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,570
Su A.

428
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,250
How...

429
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,820
Two-timing?

430
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,620
That's ridiculous.

431
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,360
I saw both guys
with my own two eyes.

432
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,590
Two guys?

433
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,890
Who are you talking about?

434
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,930
I saw one of them a few days ago...

435
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,170
at the department store's luxury section.

436
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,200
Manager Kim Sung Hee told me.

437
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,900
She said he was
a vice president somewhere.

438
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,070
I thought he was some tycoon's son.

439
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,010
He is from a well-to-do family.

440
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
Are you two dating?

441
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,880
I knew it. You are.

442
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,450
We're just getting to know
each other?

443
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,490
- Have you slept together?
- Ms. Jo! I mean, Mom!

444
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,260
What? I hear kids these days
try everything before marriage.

445
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,890
So who's the other guy?

446
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,600
As for the other guy...

447
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,700
My goodness.

448
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,240
He's got such a classy air
about him,

449
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,070
and he eats so heartily too.

450
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,480
We really hit the jackpot
with our prospective son-in-law.

451
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,510
I told you, he's not!

452
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,510
Hey, they say you shouldn't
even bother a dog while it's eating.

453
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,590
CEO Joo Ha Neul?

454
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,620
The hiccuping kid is a CEO?

455
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,890
So who's higher up?
A vice president or a CEO?

456
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,960
Why did he come to our house?

457
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,290
He was curious about the people...

458
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,460
who raised a lovely girl like you.

459
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,400
CEO Joo met my father?

460
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,200
So have you decided which of the two
you're going to marry?

461
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,680
Oh my goodness!
Who gave you that ring?

462
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,680
What could CEO Joo
have been thinking?

463
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,280
The hiccuping guy gave it to you?

464
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,020
Wonderful.

465
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:04,950
What's wonderful?

466
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,260
Hey, Ki Beom.

467
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,330
I'm with Jung Won right now,

468
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,960
and she says she's marrying
Mr. Hiccups.

469
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,370
That's not what I said...

470
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,770
What was that?

471
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,600
I can hear you fine now.

472
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,470
Yes, okay.

473
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,810
Your father says to bring
Mr. Hiccups home with you.

474
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,610
I keep telling you, that's not it!

475
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,280
You know what your father's like.

476
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,410
When he gives an order,
you follow it.

477
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,490
Let me see.

478
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,130
Even if Chairman Gong ordered it,
why did you go there?

479
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,530
I was curious.

480
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,270
I wanted to see how a man named
Cha Ki Beom was living.

481
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,570
And how he's changed since
I saw him when I was a kid.

482
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,040
You've met my father before?

483
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,520
I begged and pleaded with my mother.

484
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,460
How old are you?

485
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,060
Do you think I'm a joke
because I'm young?

486
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,000
I won't let you get away with this.

487
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,200
I swear I'll kill you
with my own two hands!

488
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,240
Then you'd better grow up fast.

489
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,710
Catch your father's killer
with your own two hands.

490
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Make sure of it.

491
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,450
I was just a kid,

492
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,020
but I could tell by his eyes
he wasn't lying.

493
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,660
A truth that's so clear to a child.

494
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,730
Why can't we see it
once we're adults?

495
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,370
Because we choose not to.

496
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,640
Because we've learned that
the truth isn't what's important.

497
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,480
My father wants to see you.

498
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
Why?

499
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,150
He has the wrong idea.

500
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,480
He thinks you're my boyfriend.

501
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,390
I thought that day would be
the end of it.

502
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,760
So what should we do?

503
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,060
I can't exactly bring Jin Se Hoon.

504
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,350
(Jin Se Hoon)

505
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,820
(Jin Se Hoon)

506
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,230
Do we really have to go this far?

507
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,460
If you're really not up for it,
you can just leave.

508
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,700
I'll make something up.

509
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Let's go in.

510
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,970
(A Graceful Liar)

511
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,330
I'm not just some random guy!

512
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,070
I'm the man who's going
to marry Jung Won.

513
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,600
What were you thinking,
telling them we're getting married?

514
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,170
Are you going to sing her
a lullaby too?

515
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,440
Who piggybacks a sister over 30?

516
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,510
My daughter-in-law is an influencer.

517
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,540
With every move she makes,

518
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,380
- Kunhyang's stock price goes up.
- That cunning little thing.

519
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,110
Do you think I can't
see right through you?

520
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,780
You want everyone at these events
to think you're Young Chae, right?

521
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,160
When I appear on social media,
the Crown Capital's prestige grows.

522
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,760
It won't be long before your company
is equal to Kunhyang.

523
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,060
Mom.

524
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,160
