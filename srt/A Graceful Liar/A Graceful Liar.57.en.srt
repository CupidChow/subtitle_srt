1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,110
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,180
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,710
Keep buying up more shares
of The Crown Capital.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,350
And do it quietly.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,550
No one can know I'm behind this.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,260
You watched a movie with Jung Won?

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,970
How did you know?

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,110
- Don't say you still like her...
- I'm going to end things.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,580
My heart
still isn't listening to me,

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,350
but I've made up my mind.

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,750
She's the daughter of the woman
who killed my birth mother.

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,020
I can't keep loving her.

14
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,190
You really believe Vice Chairman Han
is the one who hurt your mother?

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,860
All the evidence points to her.

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,430
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,200
Manager Hwang,
do you suspect me as well?

18
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,870
That's a difficult question
to answer.

19
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,230
You helped my sister,

20
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,740
but the issue with
Vice President Jin's mother...

21
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,110
is a different matter.

22
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,070
Don't give up. Keep digging.

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,280
- Find out what really happened.
- Understood.

24
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,120
Don't tell Jung Won or Ha Neul
that Chairman Jin was responsible...

25
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,350
for the death of Ki Beom.

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,290
Keep it a secret for a while.

27
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,490
May I ask why?

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,000
(Episode 57)

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,300
Can we really continue
our partnership like this?

30
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,500
We should keep business
and personal matters separate.

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,670
Things aren't the same between us,
but business is business.

32
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,410
What if my personal feelings
are more important than business?

33
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,910
According to the contract,
you are the investor.

34
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,480
I hold the management
and operational rights.

35
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,150
So?

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,650
I'll handle the day-to-day,
so you just focus on networking.

37
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,890
- If we succeed, you just get paid.
- So we won't have to butt heads?

38
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,790
This will be a good source of income
for both you and Kunhyang.

39
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,300
Is it really worth dissolving
the partnership over this?

40
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,800
I trust that
you will make the right choice...

41
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,640
as the heir to Kunhyang.

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,670
And do you trust me?

43
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,340
I don't trust you.

44
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,610
- What?
- You knew Young Chae was Jung Won,

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,350
so how could I trust someone
who tricked me so flawlessly?

46
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,590
Fine. Let's see how this goes.

47
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,920
But I can't be held responsible
for what happens.

48
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,860
What do you mean?

49
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,730
I don't know what I might do to you.

50
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,000
I honestly don't know yet.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,030
Are you threatening me?

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,200
Let's call it a warning.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,540
It's not like I'd actually kill you.

54
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,920
Are you sure...

55
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,850
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
hurt Se Hoon's mother?

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,320
Based on our findings so far, yes.

57
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,700
- I can't believe she'd go that far.
- She did the same thing to my dad.

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,230
She's more than capable of it.

59
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,500
I don't want the two of them
to be in any more danger.

60
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,080
And a part of me wants them
to discover the truth on their own.

61
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,050
Well, will you look at that?

62
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,760
So I supposedly suggested a deal
to take down Jin Tae Seok?

63
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,000
One who only thinks of my daughter,
Su A,

64
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,200
and feels guilty about what happened
to the late Ki Beom.

65
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,770
And...

66
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,770
the other side feels,

67
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,670
"Good riddance to my ex-husband
Cha Ki Beom, that thorn."

68
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,070
"Now I can breathe."

69
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,010
"Su A? That little brat?"

70
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,950
"Why should I care about her?"

71
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,750
"That whole maternal
instinct thing."

72
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,890
"I can throw it out!"

73
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,120
Why are you acting like this?

74
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,960
- Have you lost it?
- Which version of me...

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,860
do you think suits me better?

76
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,430
Right. You're finally showing
your true colors.

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,240
You've always been so nasty,
Han Hye Ra.

78
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,700
That's right.

79
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,480
I feel like
I've finally found the real me.

80
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,310
Han Hye Ra, that witch.

81
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,610
How dare she...

82
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,150
poke me, a sleeping tiger?

83
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,590
I won't let her get away with it.

84
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,820
A gathering
of Kunhyang Association members?

85
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,760
Of course, we must have it.

86
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,360
At the Kunhyang house that evening,
just like before.

87
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,660
Yes.

88
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,170
I'll see you then.

89
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,210
Jin Tae Seok is blinded by love,
so he has no idea what you think.

90
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,480
But I'm different.
I know everything.

91
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,780
You just have a prettier exterior,
but you're just like me.

92
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,390
With you, Gong Nan Sook,
we can have a symbiosis.

93
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,130
Are you trying to drive a wedge
between me and Chairman Jin?

94
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,260
No.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,600
On the contrary,
I want us to become closer.

96
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,970
- What's your angle?
- My angle?

97
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,240
Whatever schemes you
and Jin Tae Seok used to cook up,

98
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,910
do them with me, Gong Nan Sook.

99
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,580
What are you implying I did?
Spell it out for me.

100
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,520
I'm sure Jin Tae Seok told you.

101
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,220
So you'd give me leverage
on Kunhyang.

102
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,760
You want me to give you
critical dirt on him?

103
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,860
Is that the deal?

104
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,260
Why stop at just leverage
on Kunhyang?

105
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,900
I can help you destroy Jin Tae Seok.

106
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,600
So, what do you say to my offer?
Tempting enough for you?

107
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,470
You've been so delicate and pampered
under Jin Tae Seok's care.

108
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,770
You think you can beat him?

109
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,810
His slush fund.

110
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,810
I'm the one who manages it.

111
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,010
Really?

112
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,020
Kunhyang Association.

113
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,150
A gathering of powerful men's wives
and women from the top one percent.

114
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,860
They meet to do volunteer work.
They even have their own foundation.

115
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,430
Volunteer work and scholarships?
I don't buy that.

116
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,960
It's all just for show.

117
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,730
Do you think I don't know
it's a front for money laundering?

118
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,400
Become a member of the association.

119
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,240
Then I'll show you
exactly how I manage...

120
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,940
Jin Tae Seok's slush fund.

121
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,980
Actually, there's one more thing
I want.

122
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,020
Secure a spot for my Young Chae
right by Jin Se Hoon's side.

123
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,160
Do that for me first.
Then, I'll think about...

124
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,030
whether I'll take your deal or not.

125
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,530
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

126
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,940
- Have a drink with me.
- No, thank you.

127
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,420
Why are you blushing?
I'm the one who's been drinking.

128
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,120
- Do you have a fever?
- Goodness.

129
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,490
Please don't touch me.

130
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,200
I'll be taking my leave now.

131
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,000
What's his problem?

132
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,530
Do my hands really smell
that much like meat?

133
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,300
I’ve been trying to find out...

134
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,010
what he, Jung Won, and CEO Joo
have been up to.

135
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,280
Should I sacrifice Se Hoon...

136
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,150
and join forces with Gong Nan Sook?

137
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,370
Why aren't you out there
with the others?

138
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,440
- I'm more comfortable in here.
- How kind. You're sweet.

139
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,450
Dinner should be ready by now.

140
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,680
Just a moment.
Our guest should be here any second.

141
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,150
Someone else is coming?

142
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,690
A new member
of Kunhyang Association.

143
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,520
Mom, do you know who it is?

144
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,990
I wonder.

145
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,160
I must admit I'm curious.

146
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,730
Not everyone
can join Kunhyang Association.

147
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,100
Hello, everyone.

148
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,570
Come on in.

149
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,600
I hope you've all been well.

150
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,240
The newest member
of Kunhyang Association,

151
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,280
our beautiful and fragrant society,

152
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,710
is none other than Gong Nan Sook.

153
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,880
Please give a round of applause.

154
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,320
Go on, say hello.

155
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,520
Hello.

156
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,850
I'm Joo Young Chae,
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter.

157
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,720
- Joo Young Chae?
- Wait, what?

158
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,890
- Her daughter?
- Isn't she Su A?

159
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,930
I know, right?

160
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,060
- She's...
- The last time we saw her,

161
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,100
I believe she was introduced
as Vice Chairman Han's daughter.

162
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,900
Now, why would you all say
something so hurtful?

163
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,270
Are you all implying that
as her mother,

164
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,980
I'm so foolish
I can't recognize my own daughter?

165
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,750
This is Joo Young Chae.
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter.

166
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,620
Then, does that mean
Vice President Jin's wife...

167
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,250
is really her?

168
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,890
That's right.
She's my daughter-in-law.

169
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,100
Wait, then what about
Vice Chairman Han's daughter?

170
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,100
Where is she now?

171
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,840
I'm Cha Jung Won.

172
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,080
But I went by Su A when I was young.

173
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,420
But at the last gathering,
I'm sure she was Joo Young Chae.

174
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,020
- Wasn't she the daughter-in-law?
- Exactly.

175
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,920
Is that true?

176
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,520
Is she your daughter,
not your daughter-in-law?

177
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,330
That is correct.

178
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,890
She's my daughter.

179
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,460
What's going on?

180
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,400
Our eyesight gets bad at our age.
You're not so sure at first glance,

181
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,510
and it takes a few times to be sure.
We're at that age, aren't we?

182
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,940
Take a good look.

183
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,780
Even back then, this was Young Chae,
and that was Cha Jung Won.

184
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,220
Am I wrong?

185
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,190
Do you really think
Vice Chairman Han...

186
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,290
would mix up her daughter
and daughter-in-law?

187
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,220
Isn't that right, Madam Sa?

188
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,230
I suppose you're right.

189
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,160
Now that I'm getting a second look,
you're right.

190
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,830
This one is the daughter-in-law.

191
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,300
- This one is the daughter, right?
- Yes, that's right.

192
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,710
Okay, I think
we've finally got it all straight.

193
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,410
Dinner is ready.
Please enjoy your meal.

194
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,690
I've prepared it
with the utmost care.

195
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,690
I hope everyone enjoys the meal.

196
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,130
That's odd.

197
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,760
I'm sure...

198
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,370
she was standing
in the daughter-in-law's spot before.

199
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,130
But they said she's her daughter.

200
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
Are you still confused?

201
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,210
That's the daughter-in-law,
and she's the daughter.

202
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,440
End of story.

203
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,210
By the way, Chairman Gong.

204
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,980
Does your son, CEO Joo Ha Neul,
have a girlfriend?

205
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,620
I know someone I'd love to
set him up with.

206
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Me too!

207
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,720
Ha Neul is off-limits.

208
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,090
- Why?
- Why?

209
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,990
My Ha Neul is swamped with work.
All the women who are after him...

210
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,160
are practically lined up,

211
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,070
but he's like a horse with blinders,
only focused on what's ahead.

212
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,000
And his partnership
with my son-in-law is going great.

213
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,880
Both families are so impressive.
It's a real win-win situation.

214
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,380
I'm so envious.

215
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,080
Isn't seeing our children succeed
the greatest reward for us parents?

216
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,850
Oh, my.

217
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,590
Wait a minute.

218
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,890
Chef Hong, your food seems
to taste better at the Kunhyang house.

219
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,090
It's absolutely delicious. Isn't it?

220
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,830
I always put my heart
into my cooking.

221
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,000
But with a helping hand,

222
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,540
it's infused with even more care.
That must be why.

223
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,180
Please eat up and enjoy
the rest of your evening.

224
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,940
I have something
I need to attend to.

225
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,690
Hurry. Go after him.

226
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,930
Just accept the situation.

227
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,770
Se Hoon.

228
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,610
- What situation?
- The fact that I'm your wife?

229
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,380
- Because you're Joo Young Chae?
- We're much more than that.

230
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
I'm tired.

231
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,120
You're done with
Cha Jung Won, right?

232
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,900
What do you think you're doing?

233
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,780
You're hurt!

234
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,030
There. All better.

235
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,330
- It'll be fine.
- Why are you going to such lengths?

236
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,700
Even as
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter,

237
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,770
you can live a perfectly good life.

238
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,600
Why must you be with me so badly?

239
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,810
Because my mission in life
has changed.

240
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,640
First, to break free
from Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

241
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,410
And next,

242
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,880
to ruin Cha Jung Won.

243
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,590
Do you think...

244
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,260
Jung Won stole your life
and lived it as her own?

245
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,190
It's the first time I've had
something taken from me.

246
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,990
I can't stand it.

247
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
No.

248
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,830
I refuse to let her
get away with it.

249
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,940
That's the same feeling I have...

250
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,540
for Ha Neul.

251
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,510
I won't rush you.

252
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,040
Take all the time you need
to come around.

253
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,450
Publicly,

254
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,850
just treat me as your wife,
Joo Young Chae.

255
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,250
I'll be happy with that for now.

256
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,590
The Kunhyang Association members
must be dying to gossip.

257
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,160
That's why we have to get out
ahead of them.

258
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,530
The sooner we set things right,
the better.

259
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,830
The thing is,

260
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,000
we can reveal
Jung Won is my daughter...

261
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,470
and Young Chae...

262
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,840
is the real Joo Young Chae,

263
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,140
but I'm worried about Se Hoon.

264
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,540
I'm not sure
he'll accept Young Chae...

265
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,880
just because we force it on him.

266
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,850
Removing Jung Won is one thing,
but making him accept Young Chae...

267
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,550
is going to take some time.

268
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,890
I think my Young Chae is pregnant.

269
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,830
Of course, she needs to see a doctor
to be sure.

270
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,370
But it seems she missed her period.

271
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,220
Pregnant? Is it true?

272
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,260
It's not confirmed yet.

273
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,790
But you said you were late.

274
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,730
Well, yes,

275
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,800
but I'm not sure
if that's what it is.

276
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,400
Well, a trip to the doctor
will tell us for sure.

277
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,870
I'll take her.

278
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
I'll go with her.

279
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,810
That would be best.

280
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,280
That's an excellent idea, Se Hoon.

281
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,490
What have you done?

282
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,030
Mom, why would you lie like that?

283
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,600
What's the big deal?
We'll just have to make it true.

284
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,570
How are we supposed to make a baby
appear out of thin air?

285
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,970
You couldn't get Jin Se Hoon
to sleep with you, could you?

286
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,110
Mom, come on!

287
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,940
You just made things so much worse.

288
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,520
Gosh, that girl
couldn't even close the deal.

289
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,720
Goodness, that girl's so hopeless.

290
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,790
- You're laughing? This isn't funny.
- No, ma'am, I wasn't laughing.

291
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,270
It's just my face.
I have a resting smile face.

292
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,840
Resting smile face, my foot.
Are you making fun of me?

293
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,870
You're the one who said it's cuter
than a frowny face.

294
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,110
I'll wipe that smile off your face!
Get over here! Come on!

295
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,550
Where did he go?

296
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,920
Young Chae is pregnant?

297
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,220
That rude little brat.
Whose kid is she having?

298
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,360
It's Vice President Jin Se Hoon's child.

299
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,870
Oh, my. If it's Jin Se Hoon,
wasn't he with our Jung Won?

300
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,670
Ma'am, I'm hungry.

301
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,710
All right.

302
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
But what are
the three of you doing...

303
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,340
huddled together
and plotting over here?

304
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:33,420
- I'll get the meat.
- You're leaving me out again.

305
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,990
So when is the article coming out?

306
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,920
The editors
must still be debating it.

307
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,760
It's a big deal to go up
against Kunhyang Group.

308
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,800
And you, Ha Neul?

309
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,930
I've acquired ten percent
of the shares in The Crown Capital.

310
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,670
What about when it's combined
with what you already have?

311
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,400
- Twenty percent.
- And Chairman Gong?

312
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,770
Twenty-five percent.

313
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,110
So you just need a little more.

314
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,610
Do you think Joo Young Chae
is really pregnant?

315
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,080
Is that what matters to you?

316
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,090
The most important thing is
that Se Hoon opens his heart to her.

317
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,320
It's about time
we make their marriage official.

318
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,790
I agree.

319
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,260
I'm surprised you agreed so readily.

320
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,570
It may not be the best option,
but sometimes you have to settle...

321
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,670
for the next best thing.

322
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,810
Something's different about you.

323
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,410
I'm trying to become the Han Hye Ra
that suits you.

324
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,180
Are you saying
you didn't suit me until now?

325
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,510
We only looked good on the surface.

326
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,880
From now on, I will be your wife...

327
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,050
on the inside as well.

328
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,190
Han Hye Ra is the one
driving a wedge between you and me.

329
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,560
Snap out of it, you fool.

330
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,170
Hye Ra telling a lie?
That's impossible.

331
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,440
That's right.

332
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,440
Hye Ra is probably happiest
living in my shadow.

333
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,190
Why are you still here?
Aren't you going to the hospital?

334
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,860
If I go,
am I magically going to be pregnant?

335
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,360
You think I'd make this public
without having everything sorted?

336
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Right?

337
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,270
You already took care
of everything, right?

338
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,700
Go to the hospital,
then bring back Jin Se Hoon.

339
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,270
I'll have lunch ready.

340
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,240
Four weeks.

341
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,350
Isn't it amazing?

342
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,820
You can't get an ultrasound
until you're five weeks along?

343
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,990
- Yes.
- How did it come to this?

344
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,060
I'll be good to you as your wife.

345
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,930
Are you sure...

346
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,730
that baby is mine?

347
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,400
- What?
- It could be...

348
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,230
- someone else's child.
- Hey!

349
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,500
Have you lost your mind?

350
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,210
Hey! I treated you so well,

351
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,780
and you dare treat my daughter...

352
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,910
like she's some tramp
who sleeps around?

353
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,720
Let go of me. I'm not wrong, am I?

354
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,020
Hey, Jin Se Hoon!

355
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,260
You think you're all that because
you're the heir to Kunhyang Group?

356
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,090
Being Jin Tae Seok's son?
It's of no use.

357
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,360
To me, Gong Nan Sook,

358
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,870
making you disappear without a trace
would be child's play.

359
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,100
How dare you say such a vile thing
to my daughter?

360
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,510
What did you say?
"Someone else's child?"

361
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,940
That's it. This ends today!

362
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,340
I'll gladly pay the settlement
after I'm done with you, jerk!

363
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,410
- Mom, please stop!
- Get over here.

364
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,280
Let go! I'm not Gong Nan Sook
if I let him get away with this!

365
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,050
- Get over here, Jin Se Hoon! You!
- Please stop!

366
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,380
This will get you in big trouble!

367
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,020
- Let go!
- Please stop.

368
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,290
- Get over here. It's you or me.
- Mother!

369
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,860
- You won't let go? Hey!
- Come on, Mom!

370
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,890
Young Chae with another man's child?

371
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,330
- Jin Se Hoon.
- Besides Park Kyung Shin,

372
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,370
she had plenty of other guys
she dated.

373
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,330
Or are you just hoping
it's not your baby?

374
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,270
I'm just not ready...

375
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,710
to accept her yet.

376
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,340
But how could you
doubt the child too?

377
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,010
Forget it. I hate talking about this
with you,

378
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,250
and I hate you seeing me like this.

379
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,350
(Kunhyang Group)

380
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,760
Lunchtime was over ages ago,
and you're coming back now?

381
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,530
Do you want to
lose your spot as interim leader?

382
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,500
Let's start the meeting.

383
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,130
First, let's assign tasks.

384
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Ms. Kim Sung Hee, gather data
on luxury feminine looks...

385
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,900
from the past decade,

386
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,210
- and report on it, sorted by brand.
- Ten years' worth?

387
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,010
You have one day.

388
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,310
That's ridiculous.

389
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,710
How am I supposed
to get all that done?

390
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,520
Ms. Ahn Ji Na, you're on fabrics.

391
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,760
Go to the supply room,
sort the fabrics, and bring them.

392
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,960
The supply room?

393
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,560
But I just got my nails done.

394
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,200
And...

395
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,200
Ms. Cha Jung Won,
you'll be my assistant.

396
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,540
You'll find the materials I need,
help with fittings,

397
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,900
and do whatever I tell you to.
Got it?

398
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,470
Understood.

399
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,550
This new design will be
completely groundbreaking.

400
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,450
Honestly, I wouldn't exactly
call it groundbreaking.

401
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,580
It's just a bit...

402
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,550
safe.

403
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,690
It's not like we're blind.

404
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,660
If Director Jin hadn't backed you,
your design never would've...

405
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,930
Designer Ahn Ji Na.

406
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,970
Watch your mouth.

407
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,770
I'm going to the supply room.

408
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,360
Interim Team Leader
Joo Young Chae's design.

409
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,760
I heard you were the one
who really pushed for it.

410
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,590
Is that true?

411
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
It is.

412
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,700
I thought Ms. Joo Young Chae's design
was better.

413
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,580
The Chairman and the Vice Chairman
both respected my opinion.

414
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,650
Don't tell me you're having trouble
accepting the outcome.

415
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:37,810
No, not at all.

416
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,020
There's something I need you to do.

417
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,320
These are resumes
for the new Design Team applicants.

418
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,490
Quickly screen them based on
their educational background.

419
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,800
I thought this was
a blind hiring process.

420
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,640
We still need some basic screening.
Hiring the right people is critical.

421
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,070
Was it like this last year too?

422
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,040
Someone else was in charge,
but the Vice Chairman ordered it.

423
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
So I would assume so.

424
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,150
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

425
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,190
What did you want to talk about?

426
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,930
It's about last year's
open recruitment for designers...

427
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,460
in the Design Team
of Kunhyang Group.

428
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,830
Was it
really a blind hiring process?

429
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
It was, just as it was advertised.

430
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,570
Then why did you order applicants
screened by their education first?

431
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,340
As the Vice Chairman,

432
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,710
I can't micromanage
the staff's workflow.

433
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,410
So the reason you hired me
when I pretended...

434
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,480
to be Joo Young Chae...

435
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,150
wasn't just because
of my design book.

436
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,820
You also factored in my degree
from the New York Royal Art School.

437
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,090
Why does that matter now?

438
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,360
The fact that you pretended
to be Joo Young Chae...

439
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,100
and applied using her credentials.

440
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,200
Wasn't that the bigger issue?

441
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,270
Young Chae and I
both applied at the same time.

442
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,840
And Joo Young Chae got in,
but Cha Jung Won was rejected?

443
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,710
- Yes.
- But for the interview,

444
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,370
you posed as Joo Young Chae,

445
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:11,980
didn't you?

446
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,250
- That's right.
- So wasn't it a skill difference?

447
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,650
It's not about strictly following
the blind hiring process.

448
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,120
Young Chae stole my design book
and submitted it.

449
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,890
Out of my two design books,

450
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,590
the one submitted as Joo Young Chae
from Royal Art School was accepted,

451
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,530
but the one I submitted
as a high school graduate was rejected.

452
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,560
That's the problem.

453
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,960
- Is that all?
- If you call it a blind process,

454
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,070
I believe that rule
should be strictly upheld.

455
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,470
For the new designers you're hiring,

456
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,810
there shouldn't be
a prescreening based on education.

457
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,540
I believe I made it clear
that's for my staff to handle.

458
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,010
A staff designer has no business...

459
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,980
coming directly
to the Vice Chairman...

460
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,520
to protest something like this.

461
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,650
That's enough. You can go.

462
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,860
You don't even seem to grasp
what the problem is...

463
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,230
or even want to.

464
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,730
I suppose it's because
you're used to lies and deceit.

465
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,970
In that case,

466
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,900
I'll have no choice
but to show you myself.

467
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,840

to convince your boss?

It was Cha Jung Won
who leaked it, wasn't it?

The article simply reported the facts.

477
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,520
Talk about terrible timing.

478
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,690
They should've waited
until Young Chae and Jin Se Hoon...

479
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,760
were a sure thing.
That'd have been so much better.

I would hide you forever?

I wasn't going to wait around
for you to reveal it.

495

You just wanted to expose

it was a double-edged sword.

00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,790
That's me.

516
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,130
Cha Jung Won.
Should I kill her for Kunhyang?

517
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,370
Am I wrong? It's all over the news.

518
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,330
You are the future of Kunhyang.

519
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,040
If something gets in your way,
even if it's something you love,

520
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,240
you have to know how to crush it.

521
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,040
I'll do an interview
that even Kunhyang approves of.

522
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
After that, hand over the video.

523
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,280
Do you think Jin Tae Seok
can really be taken down?

524
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,450
