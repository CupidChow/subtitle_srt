1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,040
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,180
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,780
I'll do whatever you ask of me.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,180
Just...

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,750
make me the Vice Chairman
of Kunhyang Group.

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,360
Get up.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,530
The great heir to Kunhyang...

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,230
shouldn't be groveling
for the vice chairman spot.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,730
Please drop the "interim"
from the title.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,940
- What?
- I should get rid...

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,210
of Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
for good...

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,180
and become the vice chairman.

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,210
Are you serious?

15
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,350
Yes, I am.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,450
Chairman Jin won't just stand by
and let that happen.

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,150
If you back me up,

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,220
don't you think we can sway
the board of directors?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,270
You're not taking my calls
and won't come see me.

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,630
You think avoiding me
is going to make me give up?

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,040
Ha Neul...

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,840
Hold on.

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,010
Let's see
what they're talking about.

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,580
Were you that scared of
Chairman Jin Tae Seok's threats?

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,190
Were you worried
that I might get hurt?

26
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,160
I have a lot to do.
I should get going.

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,070
Cha Jung Won.

28
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,570
She acts so innocent,
but she's so sly.

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,140
Look at her,
pretending he's dragging her away.

30
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,210
I can't stand her.

31
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,550
So if you get what you want,

32
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,750
what's in it for me?

33
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,720
I will be genuinely good
to Young Chae.

34
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,460
I will work at it.

35
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,260
Can you really win someone's heart
just by "working at it?"

36
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,000
Through my words and actions,

37
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,570
I'll first show Young Chae I care,
and I will treasure her.

38
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,430
I can put it in writing
if you'd like.

39
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,140
A pledge? A hundred won't help.
Feelings can change in an instant.

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,650
So, what's your next move
after becoming vice chairman?

41
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,080
I want to become the chairman.

42
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,820
Now you're talking.

43
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,050
What I, Gong Nan Sook, want...

44
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,290
is to take down Han Hye Ra,
and after her, Jin Tae Seok.

45
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,260
Until I become the chairman,

46
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,460
please be my unwavering support.

47
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,770
But you don't think that can be done
with just words, do you?

48
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,570
Transfer two percent
of your shares to me.

49
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,440
The moment you're made
vice chairman.

50
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,410
Not the interim position.
It's the official vice chairman,

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
Mother.

52
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,410
Okay.

53
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,990
I'm sorry I didn't show up
the other day.

54
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,330
I didn't wait very long.

55
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,730
Actually,

56
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,570
I waited all night.

57
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,970
I thought you'd left.

58
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,340
You came out?

59
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,320
I shouldn't have gone
to get a drink.

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,520
It's okay.

61
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,990
Just knowing you came
makes waiting all night worthwhile.

62
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,060
Your hands are cold.

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,570
This won't do.
Let's go somewhere warm.

64
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,370
Here.

65
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,780
Why did you insist
we come to your office?

66
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,880
This place feels just like you.

67
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,020
It's not big,
but it's warm and cozy.

68
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,160
No matter how Chairman Jin Tae Seok
tries to interfere,

69
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,000
my feelings for you
will never change.

70
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,430
I heard at the office.

71
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,240
That Vice Chairman Han is resigning,

72
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,910
and that she wants to offer you
the interim vice chairman position.

73
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,210
But Chairman Jin Tae Seok
attached his own condition.

74
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
A condition?

75
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,790
Start dating
my daughter, Se Mi, first.

76
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,090
Or better yet, get engaged to her.

77
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,320
Do that, and I'll approve you
as the interim vice chairman.

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,460
No, I might even appoint you
as the permanent vice chairman.

79
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,900
It's nothing.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
So, did you decide to accept
the vice chairman position?

81
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,440
I still have my own work
to focus on.

82
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,710
Being Kunhyang Group's vice chairman
is too much for me right now.

83
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,150
But it's an interim position,
isn't it?

84
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,920
It wouldn't hurt to give it a shot.

85
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,790
And you'd learn a lot.

86
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,820
And after that, who knows?

87
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,860
You might go from an interim
to a permanent executive.

88
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,260
And if I do?

89
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,430
It means you'll have power.

90
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,530
You can make Gong Nan Sook,

91
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,970
the woman responsible
for your father's death,

92
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,000
and Chairman Jin Tae Seok,

93
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:32,570
who was involved, pay.

94
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,210
Then,

95
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,180
what about your father's case?

96
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,510
He was framed for a murder
he didn't commit,

97
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,180
and then killed by Han Hye Ra
and Jin Tae Seok.

98
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,290
I could finally clear his name.

99
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,620
But is all of that...

100
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,260
only possible if I become
the vice chairman of Kunhyang Group?

101
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,090
Because we need to be stronger.

102
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,860
You have to climb higher...

103
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,770
so we can take back what was stolen
and stop them walking all over us.

104
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,770
We can make them pay ten times...

105
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,270
No, 100 times over.

106
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,040
Those people are worse than demons,

107
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,710
and we can finally teach them
a proper lesson.

108
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,680
Do you really want me
to become the vice chairman?

109
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,250
Even if it means we can't understand
and comfort each other like this,

110
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,350
- and can't share feelings?
- If those feelings...

111
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,120
get in the way of what we must do,

112
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,530
I'll give them up. Willingly.

113
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,300
Is revenge more important than love?

114
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,230
I can't do that.

115
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,740
I'll have both. You and my revenge.

116
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,070
That condition Chairman Jin Tae Seok
offered you...

117
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,240
is connected to
Director Jin Se Mi, right?

118
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,750
Stop loving me.

119
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,890
As for me, Ha Neul,

120
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,130
I've already given up on us.

121
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,200
Are you really okay without me?

122
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,730
You're just too warm...

123
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,500
that you make my anger...

124
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,710
and my thirst for revenge...

125
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,280
all fade away.

126
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,250
When I look at you,

127
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,820
the world just seems so peaceful.

128
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,320
I'm hurting too.
This is hard on me too. I...

129
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,720
I want to make
Gong Nan Sook and Jin Tae Seok...

130
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,860
pay for what they did, but...

131
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,060
Then you have to accept
the vice chairman position.

132
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,500
I'm terrified of losing you.

133
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,310
Ha Neul.

134
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,740
- You'll get hurt. Be careful.
- Mom.

135
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,240
Come here.

136
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,210
My sweet boy.

137
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,820
My little boy fell right asleep.

138
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,820
Stay healthy for a long time,
my Ha Neul.

139
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,230
How adorable.
My goodness, when was this?

140
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,270
Oh, my, look at that smile.
Look how cute my Ha Neul is.

141
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,400
Even my daughter Young Chae,
whom I gave birth to,

142
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,300
wasn't this adorable.

143
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,540
As if anyone doesn't know
you still dote on him.

144
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,910
You startled me.

145
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,740
Are you Chef Hong or Grandma?

146
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,850
Have you been well, my dear?

147
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,620
Grandma.
I'm really mad at you, you know.

148
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,950
Why not move into
the Kunhyang family's kitchen?

149
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,420
What are you even doing here?

150
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,960
Gosh, even when you're jealous,
you're a real piece of work.

151
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,490
Jealous? As if.

152
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,260
I'd have to meet someone
better than me to be jealous.

153
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,330
I'm not jealous.

154
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,800
Han Hye Ra.

155
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
What?

156
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,000
I just went by to see her face.

157
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,270
And I'm sure of it now.

158
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,940
She's a more dangerous woman
than you.

159
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,080
So what makes her more dangerous
than me?

160
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,450
Is she richer than me?
Is she prettier?

161
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,880
Does she have a better figure?
Come on, what is it?

162
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,150
Han Hye Ra has something you don't.

163
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,990
What's that?

164
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,260
Grandma didn't tell me that.

165
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,960
- Are you Chef Hong again?
- But just one thing.

166
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,660
She did say something important.

167
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,030
What is it?

168
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,500
My favorite person in the world,
Gong Nan Sook,

169
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,210
- will lose it to Han Hye Ra.
- Lose what?

170
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,520
She didn't specify.

171
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,050
Seriously... Grandma!

172
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,220
Hold on.

173
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,460
That Han Hye Ra...

174
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,760
recommended Ha Neul
to be the vice chairman, didn't she?

175
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,430
What right does she have
to promote my son on a whim?

176
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,570
That vixen, Han Hye Ra,

177
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,870
is clearly trying to steal him.

178
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,910
She thinks
I'll just sit back and watch?

179
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,510
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

180
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,890
Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

181
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,860
To what do I owe
the pleasure of you...

182
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,060
barging in like this unannounced?

183
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,790
What about you?

184
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,030
Did you call ahead
before you stole my son?

185
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,900
- You think this is funny?
- Should I be crying instead?

186
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,940
Fair point.

187
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,410
Since I recommended Joo Ha Neul
as interim vice chairman,

188
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,970
you should be thanking me for it.

189
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,210
Why the long face?

190
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,750
Are you worried you're going
to lose your son?

191
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:47,050
He's not even your biological son.
Are your feelings for him even real?

192
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,390
- Look at you, getting all jealous.
- Shut it.

193
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,320
Sweet-talk him all you want.

194
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,530
You think my son, Ha Neul,
will just dance to your tune?

195
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,430
Oh, dear. I'm about to tear up.

196
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,100
It's so moving,

197
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,900
- all that fake motherly love.
- That's your specialty, not mine.

198
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,510
Motherhood means nothing to me.

199
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,610
Don't make me laugh.

200
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,510
You hate it when your son, Ha Neul,
even talks to me, right?

201
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,350
But with my son, Se Hoon,

202
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,380
you want to use Young Chae
to wrap him around your finger!

203
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,680
It takes one to know one.

204
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,760
How did you see right through me
so completely?

205
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,860
You really can't stand losing to me,
can you?

206
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,730
You're right, I can't.

207
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,000
I absolutely hate it.

208
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,430
I'll take your son,
and I'll never let you take mine.

209
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,340
That's who I am. Gong Nan Sook.

210
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,040
What are you going to do?

211
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,610
Too bad for you, though.

212
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,610
I want your son more...

213
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,680
than I do mine.

214
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,220
I told you not to cross the line,
didn't I?

215
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,220
What a relief
that he's not your flesh and blood.

216
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,620
It's rare to find a son
so honorable and kind,

217
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,030
who is also profound in character.

218
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,930
How could you
break his heart deeply?

219
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,330
You killed his father yourself.

220
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,370
So even if Joo Ha Neul is
as good-hearted as he is,

221
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,770
could he ever forgive you?

222
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,600
I said, stop it!

223
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,810
Calm down. There is no need
to get so worked up.

224
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,580
Put your personal feelings aside.

225
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,180
Remember your allegiance.

226
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,150
You chose Se Hoon's side, after all.

227
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,920
Although I don't know
what you were promised in return.

228
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,590
Promised? Please.
It was just a few lousy shares.

229
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,490
Darn it, my big mouth.

230
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,760
Then by all means,
stick to your choice.

231
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,800
As for me,
I've chosen CEO Joo Ha Neul.

232
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,940
I'm very curious to see
who will become the vice chairman.

233
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,610
I'm even looking forward to it.

234
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,840
Look forward to it all you want.

235
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,280
Jin Se Hoon
will be the vice chairman.

236
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,550
I will never lose
my son, Ha Neul, to you.

237
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,190
- Mark my words.
- We'll see if things go your way.

238
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,260
You're saying Ha Neul
turned down the offer?

239
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,140
He's got guts.

240
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,640
To throw away a great opportunity
in an instant.

241
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,180
Is that a compliment?

242
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,310
It is.
Even I couldn't have done that.

243
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,250
Joo Ha Neul...

244
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,220
is the type to succeed at anything.

245
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,520
Chairman, do you agree
with Vice Chairman Han?

246
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,790
Do you prefer Joo Ha Neul
as vice chairman instead of me?

247
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,290
I'm still thinking about it.

248
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,660
You say this with the Kunhyang heir
in front of you...

249
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,030
and compare me to CEO Joo Ha Neul?

250
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,860
- When you're the chairman?
- Are you offended?

251
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,330
How would you feel in my place?

252
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,040
Of course you should be.

253
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,970
Actually, you need to make sure...

254
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,780
no one can be your equal, Se Hoon.

255
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,250
If anyone tries to surpass you,
you have to crush them!

256
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,450
Se Mi, you've had enough to drink.

257
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,860
And the Design Team
is already a mess.

258
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,760
You stole it, didn't you?
Cha Jung Won's design book.

259
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,970
This isn't a formal occasion.
It's just between us...

260
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,570
No, we're family.
We should be honest with each other.

261
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,110
That's the only way
I can take your side.

262
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,140
I would never do
something like that.

263
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,950
Cha Jung Won is just trying
to set me up.

264
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,380
I really hope that's true.

265
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,850
Do you believe Cha Jung Won over me?

266
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,720
Because Mom and Ha Neul both like
Cha Jung Won more than me,

267
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,230
I can't stand her.

268
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,200
That makes sense.

269
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,500
It's like you're losing the people
most important to you.

270
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,900
But the strange thing is,

271
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,010
I feel like
Cha Jung Won is telling the truth.

272
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,840
Even though she was a liar
and posed as my sister-in-law.

273
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,380
Se Mi. Don't you fall for it too.

274
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:15,490
Jung Won is good at playing innocent
and charming people.

275
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,220
Right?
She's just tricking them, right?

276
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,960
Is that how she got Ha Neul
to fall for her?

277
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,890
He won't even look at me.

278
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,300
You have to fight for love.

279
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,000
You're so pretty, cute,
and charming.

280
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,000
Just win Ha Neul over.
You can do it.

281
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,440
How can I win him over?

282
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,880
Well...

283
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,440
Is Ha Neul on your mind too?

284
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,320
Everywhere I turn, everyone is
obsessed with Joo Ha Neul.

285
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,550
Did your mother
really recommend Ha Neul...

286
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,050
for interim vice chairman?

287
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,850
I heard that too.
Is it true, Se Hoon?

288
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,020
No way.

289
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,660
So Ha Neul and Se Hoon
are going to go head-to-head.

290
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,960
What "head-to-head?"

291
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,730
The Kunhyang family
has always led Kunhyang Group,

292
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,170
and we always will.

293
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,670
Of course.

294
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,270
Ha Neul can't become vice chairman,
not even temporarily.

295
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,840
I hope Ha Neul gets the job.

296
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,540
- Se Mi!
- Jin Se Mi!

297
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,060
Have a drink.

298
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,200
What's this? A declaration of war?

299
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,900
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
personally recommended you...

300
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,140
as the new vice chairman.

301
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
Is this you telling me to watch out?

302
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,610
- It's a temporary position.
- And what if it is?

303
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,280
Are you thinking of taking my spot?

304
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,320
Was the vice chairman position
ever yours, Se Hoon?

305
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,720
I heard you turned it down.
Guess you haven't given up yet.

306
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,390
Do you know why I turned it down?

307
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,090
It's just Chairman Jin's way.

308
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,230
For one thing, Se Mi...

309
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,660
has feelings for you.

310
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,370
Then you must know
why I had no choice but to refuse.

311
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,440
Is it because of Jung Won?

312
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,740
I don't know...

313
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,780
how it came to this for us.

314
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,450
That's my line.

315
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,250
Isn't loving the same woman
enough for you?

316
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,480
Must you go after Kunhyang Group's
vice chairman position too?

317
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,420
There's something I want to do,

318
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,160
and it's something
I absolutely have to do.

319
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,890
And I just need power to do it.

320
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,060
And that power...

321
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,490
is the Kunhyang Group
vice chairman position?

322
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,000
And stealing my woman?

323
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,430
My feelings for Jung Won...

324
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,770
started a long time ago.

325
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,240
I've only just now realized it.

326
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,440
If you two were meant to be,
I would've held back until the end.

327
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,140
Even though I'm on the verge...

328
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,550
of losing my mind with Jung Won,

329
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,710
I'm holding back too.

330
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,190
But you won't get
the vice chairman position from me.

331
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,890
It's not like that position
has your name on it.

332
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,820
Like your relationship with Jung Won
was meant to end here.

333
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,800
I'd give up
the vice chairman position...

334
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,160
before I ever give up on Jung Won.

335
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,130
You have no right
to anything that's mine, Ha Neul.

336
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,540
No.

337
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,170
Before you can even try,
I'll crush you.

338
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,310
I guess we can't be
drinking buddies anymore.

339
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,910
At every single turn,

340
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,650
you're just an obstacle in my way.

341
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,690
I've decided to stop feeling
any remorse.

342
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,330
I'll only look forward...

343
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,530
and charge forward.

344
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,080
Have you still not made
a decision...

345
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,980
on the interim vice chairman position?

346
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,080
It may be a temporary position,

347
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,920
but that short time could decide
the fate of Kunhyang.

348
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,420
I need a few more days
to think it over.

349
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,590
Chairman Gong is backing Se Hoon,
isn't she?

350
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,160
It's for her daughter, Young Chae.

351
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,330
Is that all it is?

352
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,530
What more do you think there is?

353
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,830
If I were Gong Nan Sook,

354
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,900
I'd be going after...

355
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,040
the shares Se Hoon holds.

356
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,110
(Kunhyang Group)

357
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,930
I'm done, Director Jin.

358
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,240
Good work.

359
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,070
Are you not done yet, Ms. Joo?

360
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,550
I'm done.

361
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,220
Thank you both for your hard work.

362
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,830
Seal these in separate envelopes...

363
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,560
and send them with
the design book for analysis.

364
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,930
Understood.

365
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,900
Where are you sending them
for the analysis?

366
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,870
Why do you ask?

367
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,510
I have a right to know
how credible this place is.

368
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,580
Their document analysis is the best
in the country.

369
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,780
My trusted friend works there
as an expert.

370
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,810
Don't worry about their credibility.

371
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,720
Let's discuss this again
when the results are in.

372
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,580
There's no need
to be so on edge already.

373
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,400
Do you want me
to make you some coffee?

374
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,000
You, offering to make coffee
for someone else?

375
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,640
I'm curious to see how good it is.

376
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,780
Here, you can have this one.

377
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,280
I'll make myself another.

378
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,720
If you say so.

379
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,000
Ji Na, you're on my side, right?

380
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,340
I guess?

381
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,870
Can I be the first one
to find out about...

382
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,410
the results
of the detailed analysis??

383
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,980
Why?
I thought you had nothing to hide.

384
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,850
I mean...

385
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,850
You're not even Director Jin Se Mi,
so why are you in charge?

386
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,620
It's so irritating.

387
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,490
What?

388
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,860
Mom.

389
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,470
I'm with Ahn Ji Na right now.

390
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,400
You know how I told you before?

391
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,940
That Cha Jung Won claims
I stole her design...

392
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,780
Hey. She wants to talk to you.

393
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,020
Yes, Chairman Gong.

394
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,060
Right now?

395
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,140
You've never heard
of Gong Nan Sook...

396
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,470
or what I'm capable of?

397
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,170
I've heard the stories.
That even a bird in flight...

398
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,480
Alter the analysis results
to favor Young Chae.

399
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,120
But we have to wait
for the results...

400
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,920
The results don't matter.
Young Chae stole it.

401
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,320
That's why I'm telling you
to change them.

402
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,390
What?

403
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,360
Gosh, Joo Young Chae is ruthless.

404
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,730
I guess...

405
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,360
you must have known about it, too?

406
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,130
So you'd better know your place.

407
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
And why should I do that?

408
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,770
Do you really want to
keep pushing my buttons?

409
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,440
I have to see what's in it for me.

410
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,340
This is business, after all.

411
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,510
Fine, let's talk business.

412
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,420
My son-in-law, Jin Se Hoon,
will soon be the vice chairman.

413
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,850
After that,
he'll be the chairman, right?

414
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,090
And if I put my mind to it,
speeding up that timeline...

415
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,520
is something
I can do at any time. So?

416
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,260
Are you starting to see
the big picture now?

417
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,090
In that case,

418
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,100
I assume the director position
for the Design Team...

419
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,230
can be given to me?

420
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,510
I thought you were a pretty face,
but you're a sharp negotiator too.

421
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,580
- They were sent for analysis?
- That's correct.

422
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,980
Stay in close contact
with Ahn Ji Na.

423
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,120
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,990
She promised to call me
the moment the results are in.

425
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,850
Who knows
what Gong Nan Sook will do?

426
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,390
Be prepared for anything.

427
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,820
I'll keep that in mind.

428
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,500
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

429
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,940
- What is it?
- I came to ask you the reason.

430
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,710
Why did you recommend
CEO Joo Ha Neul...

431
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,240
for the interim
vice chairman position?

432
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,610
Why would you,
Designer Cha, need to know?

433
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,050
Do you plan to...

434
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,380
use CEO Joo Ha Neul as a puppet
and then toss him aside?

435
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,850
You think I'm using CEO Joo?

436
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,290
Aren't you?

437
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,260
I offered it because I have reason
to trust CEO Joo.

438
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,360
So you chose him for who he is?

439
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,730
- That's right.
- Or did you have...

440
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,840
Director Jin Se Mi in mind
as CEO Joo's partner?

441
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,870
I put personal feelings aside.

442
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,940
You made the right choice.

443
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,980
For Kunhyang's sake too.

444
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,640
For Kunhyang's sake?

445
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,010
You?

446
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,210
Wasn't it the other way around?

447
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:17,090
Your attempts to take me down
are to destabilize Kunhyang Group.

448
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,120
I have no interest
in Kunhyang Group itself.

449
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,260
You, Chairman Jin Tae Seok,
and Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

450
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,330
have used Kunhyang Group's power...

451
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,570
and money as a weapon
to crush countless people.

452
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,910
It may only be
an interim vice chairman position,

453
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,510
but if CEO Joo Ha Neul
takes that seat,

454
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,180
do you think anything will change?

455
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,850
Even just a little, yes.

456
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,020
That's where the change...

457
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,990
will start.

458
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,730
My aching arms, legs, and back.

459
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,900
I've worn my knees to the bone.

460
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,170
All this just to make my son-in-law
even more successful.

461
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,600
I've worked to the bone for you.
Goodness.

462
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,370
I know how hard you've been working.

463
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,050
What's this?

464
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,850
Here.

465
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,280
Please try this.

466
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,420
Really?

467
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,020
Let's see. All right.

468
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,570
Is it just me? It feels really good.

469
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,070
Let me see. Here you go.

470
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,180
Here. My son-in-law
should have some too.

471
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,610
- Here. Have some.
- Yes, Mother.

472
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,650
Could I have one too, please?

473
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,220
I should take care of my health
while I still can.

474
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,620
That's the secret to staying young.

475
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,490
Here. I guess even a pest gets one.
Eat up.

476
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,860
Thank you.

477
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,070
Maybe I should bring a box of these
when I meet the executives.

478
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,500
We can have one each time I grovel.
What do you think?

479
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,070
Yes, that sounds great.

480
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,240
Have you ever seen a mother-in-law
who dotes on her son-in-law so much?

481
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,910
I feel so supported.

482
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,510
Tomorrow's the day.

483
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,020
You will do great.

484
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,220
Trust me, Mother.

485
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,420
See?

486
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,320
I'm the kind of person
who handles her tasks perfectly.

487
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,430
Go on, open it.

488
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,500
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

489
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,900
- Have some.
- Why the long faces?

490
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,430
The board meeting is tomorrow.

491
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,770
Either CEO Joo Ha Neul
or Vice President Jin Se Hoon...

492
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,310
will be named
the interim vice chairman.

493
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,210
My goodness. CEO Joo,
you've gotten that powerful?

494
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,610
Not at all.

495
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,380
It's just that Vice Chairman Han
recommended me.

496
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,010
Why would Han Hye Ra do that?

497
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,750
Why would she abandon her son,
Jin Se Hoon?

498
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
That's what I was wondering too.

499
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,250
You'll take the position
if you get it, right?

500
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,890
There's no way Chairman Jin
would choose me.

501
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,260
There's something
Chairman Jin always tells me.

502
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
"Don't think."

503
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,300
"I'm the one who makes the choices
and decisions."

504
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,340
So for today, don't think about it.

505
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,770
Okay. I'll clear my head.

506
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,320
- What brings you here?
- Father.

507
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,560
I brought you herbal tea.
It helps relieve stress.

508
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,330
It smells nice.

509
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,100
Do you have something on your mind?
Let's hear it.

510
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:53,570
I wonder why Mother wants
to make Ha Neul the vice chairman.

511
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,110
Tell me what you're really thinking.

512
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,870
You want Se Hoon as Vice Chairman,
don't you?

513
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,510
Of course I do.

514
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,050
So you'd side with your husband
over your own brother?

515
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,580
I doubt Se Hoon
treats you all that well.

516
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,590
I don't expect him to treat me well.

517
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,690
I just want him to
successfully carry on your legacy...

518
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,960
and stay on the path to becoming
the heir to Kunhyang Group.

519
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,000
That's why I believe
my support is crucial.

520
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,160
How admirable.

521
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,270
But Se Hoon was born with
a diamond spoon and has never struggled,

522
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,570
so he lacks that fire in his belly.

523
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,940
He thinks he can just coast by
and become the chairman of Kunhyang.

524
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,110
You're mistaken, Father.

525
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,340
You have no idea
how much he wants this.

526
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,920
Why else would a man that proud
get on his knees before Madam Gong?

527
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,020
What? Se Hoon knelt?

528
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,690
To Gong Nan Sook, of all people?

529
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,620
My son, the son of Jin Tae Seok,

530
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,730
begging a vulgar loan shark
to save his skin?

531
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,700
(Kunhyang Group)

532
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,670
As of today,
I will be stepping down...

533
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,910
from my position as Vice Chairman
of Kunhyang Group.

534
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,580
It is an interim position
until a new vice chairman is named,

535
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:10,310
but I will announce a successor
who will capably fill the role.

536
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,880
I will make my announcement now.

537
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,550
Hold on a minute.

538
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,120
Are you making this decision
without consulting the directors?

539
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,260
Have you forgotten?

540
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,590
Our deal was that in exchange for me
taking the fall...

541
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,360
for damaging the group's image
and stepping down,

542
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,530
you would accept my choice.

543
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,630
Says who?

544
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,970
This is unacceptable.

545
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,610
Even for an interim position,
we should consult the board members.

546
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,910
He's right.
Is Kunhyang your private company?

547
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,610
Settle down, everyone.

548
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,280
Let's first hear
who Vice Chairman Han recommends,

549
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,020
and then others may make
their own recommendations.

550
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,850
I recommend CEO Joo Ha Neul.

551
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm Joo Ha Neul.

552
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,740
I recommend
Vice President Jin Se Hoon.

553
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,980
(Electing the Interim Vice Chairman)

554
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,950
I'm Jin Se Hoon.

555
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:43,070
(Electing the Interim Vice Chairman)

556
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,040
(A Graceful Liar)

557
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,300
I guess it's not going to work out
with Ha Neul and me.

558
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,240
I'm heartbroken too.

559
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,900
Do you like CEO Joo that much?

560
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,110
I don't care
if you're Mom's daughter.

561
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,570
I'll never accept you as my sister.

562
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,680
How can I set up Joo Ha Neul
with my Se Mi?

563
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,110
So, what's your next scheme?

564
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,550
A loan shark thinks she can summon
the chairman of Kunhyang Group?

565
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,990
I heard the Design Team
is out to get my Young Chae.

566
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,090
The results are in?

567
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,860
Everything's settled
with my mom, right?

568
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,630
So you're planning on
getting rid of Cha Jung Won?

569
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,660
