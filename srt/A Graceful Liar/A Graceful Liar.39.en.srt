00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,390
And I didn't want to.

176
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,830
So you knew she was your mother,

177
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,830
and you intentionally went through
with marrying Jin Se Hoon?

178
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
That's right.

179
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,640
Dad, aren't you furious?

180
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,980
That woman betrayed you,
knowing you were wrongly imprisoned.

181
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,910
How can you forgive her?

182
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,920
The least she could've done
was wait for you,

183
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,550
but she abandoned
her seven-year-old daughter...

184
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,650
and just took off.

185
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,820
How can you possibly understand her?

186
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
Have you forgotten
what we went through?

187
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,560
- Have you?
- I will never forgive her!

188
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,730
And I have never forgotten.

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,030
Then why?

190
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,130
Showing her that
you're living a better life...

191
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,400
- is the best revenge.
- "A better life?"

192
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,740
How? With what?

193
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,750
Stop it, you two.
This is going to be the death of me.

194
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,050
I, for one, understand
Jung Won completely.

195
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,380
What did you just say?

196
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,150
I can't stand how shameless
Young Sun is.

197
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,860
She acts like she totally forgot
that she abandoned Jung Won.

198
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,790
- Mi Hyang.
- Let Jung Won do what she has to.

199
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,900
I don't care if the sky falls
or the earth shatters.

200
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,670
If getting revenge is the only way
she can let go of this pain,

201
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,530
then I'll be the first one
to cheer her on.

202
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,900
You're crazy.

203
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,240
She's throwing herself
into a pit of fire,

204
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,810
but you're cheering her on
instead of stopping her?

205
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,980
I'll do more than cheer.

206
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,080
If Jung Won starts to struggle,

207
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,250
I'll be there to fight by her side.

208
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,780
- Jo Mi Hyang!
- You must stay out of this!

209
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,950
I fear what Gong Nan Sook
and Jin Tae Seok might do to you.

210
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,820
They play games with lives.

(Kunhyang Group)

212
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,780
You wanted to see me?

213
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,810
Have you been crying?

214
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,050
Is Se Hoon giving you a hard time
because of my situation?

215
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,050
Or...

216
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,060
did you go to Su A's
and run into some kind of trouble?

217
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,320
No, it's neither of those.

218
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,430
I was reading that anonymous post,
and I just got so angry.

219
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,270
They're trying to make everything
you've worked so hard to build...

220
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,040
go up in smoke overnight.

221
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,270
It's a malicious attempt
to shake Kunhyang Group's core.

222
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,950
I can't believe they thought
people would buy those crazy lies.

223
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,820
So, you think
everything in that post...

224
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,150
is a lie, Young Chae?

225
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,620
Of course I do.

226
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,490
- You didn't change your name...
- But I did.

227
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,630
My birth name really
is Han Young Sun.

228
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,430
Anyone can have their name
legally changed.

229
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,240
But the part about your education...

230
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,170
That part is not true, right?

231
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,810
What do you think?

232
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,910
What would you do if you were me?

233
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,320
I don't know all the details
of your past.

234
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,550
If it were me...

235
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,620
Why the hesitation?

236
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,530
Your position as the lady
of the Kunhyang family...

237
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,330
and Vice Chairman of Kunhyang Group.

238
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,330
You fought hard
to get where you are.

239
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,670
I don't think you're the type
to forge credentials or steal art.

240
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,870
And I'd like to think
I'm the same way.

241
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,110
I'll need your help, Young Chae.

242
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,810
Take good care of Su A.

243
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,810
Think of her as your little sister,
not just your sister-in-law.

245
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,650
What's this?

246
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,320
It's the contract for a restaurant.

247
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,690
Su A's father won't accept this.
Su A's mother...

248
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,100
I put the lease
in Jo Mi Hyang's name.

249
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,340
As payment for bringing Su A
to Kunhyang.

250
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,700
So it's a reward?

251
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,840
I would've given them
a bigger one if I could.

252
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,480
A better store
and a bigger house, but...

253
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,420
I'll convey your wishes.

254
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,650
No.

255
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,750
Keep me
and the Kunhyang family out of it.

256
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,890
I'll find a way, Mother.

257
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,100
Did you meet with Reporter Ma Sang Ki
from Jeguk Daily?

258
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,270
Yes. He's preparing an article
to counter the anonymous post.

259
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,000
It's scheduled to run tomorrow.

260
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,540
Should I call
the editor-in-chief myself?

261
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,010
I've already handled it.

262
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,540
The source of the anonymous post?

263
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,280
Our owner risk team mobilized
all networks.

264
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,380
- Did you track it down?
- Yes, sir.

265
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,180
But the location...

266
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,890
was traced to the area
around the Kunhyang house.

267
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,250
What?

268
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,060
When will you know for sure?

269
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,060
We'll be able to pinpoint it
in two days.

270
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,560
Someone in the Kunhyang family
dares to backstab me?

271
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,170
They must have some serious nerve.

Sometimes, the answer
is right under your nose.

273
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,740
Out for a stroll
in the neighborhood?

274
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,910
You're always waltzing in and out
of here.

275
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,720
The true colors
of your noble Han Hye Ra...

276
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,090
are about to be exposed
for all the world to see.

277
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,190
So how could I just sit back
and watch the fireworks from afar?

278
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,690
Aren't you pleased with yourself?
Are you enjoying this?

279
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,060
You look like you're about
to do a little dance.

280
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,870
Can't you hear
our stock prices plummeting?

281
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,300
That's exactly my point.

282
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,440
With Han Hye Ra's reputation ruined,

283
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,940
Kunhyang's image is crashing
along with it.

284
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,880
Did I marry my daughter to Kunhyang
to watch it all fall apart?

285
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,010
So you enjoy watching the spectacle,

286
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
but you can't stand watching
the stock price fall.

287
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,550
Just think of a way to stop this.

288
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,650
Every time I see the stocks...

289
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,950
Look at this.
Can't you see my hands shaking?

290
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,290
If you're going to put on a show,
at least make it convincing.

291
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,790
You know,
there is one good way to solve this.

292
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,430
While we're at it,
have Han Hye Ra give me her shares.

293
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,800
I'll even give you a generous price
for them.

294
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,100
Gong Nan Sook!

295
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,210
Why do you keep summoning me
after you threw me out?

296
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,420
Cha Su A, or rather, Jin Su A.
I have a job for you.

297
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,980
- What is it now?
- The anonymous post.

298
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,350
Make it look like Joo Young Chae...

299
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,490
I mean Kunhyang's daughter-in-law,
who wrote the post.

300
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,560
But she's the one who did it.
What's there to frame?

301
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,160
It's only true when Han Hye Ra
and Jin Tae Seok believe it.

302
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,760
You still don't get how things work.

303
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,940
This should be interesting.

304
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,080
So, have they set my start date
for the design team?

305
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,280
You seem anxious you won't be able
to start at the design team.

306
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,080
The Kunhyang family has bigger fish
to fry right now.

307
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,550
Just be patient.

308
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,150
Are you part of the Kunhyang family?

309
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,220
You act like such a know-it-all,

310
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,460
but you dragged me out here
for nothing.

311
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,590
No one knows the inner workings
of Kunhyang better than I do.

312
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,160
There you go, bluffing again.

313
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
In that case...

314
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,400
Do you know something, then?

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,440
You know Joo Young Chae well, right?

316
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,840
Of course we're close.

317
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,940
We're sisters-in-law.

318
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,940
What kind of nonsense is that?

319
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,780
How could you be sisters-in-law
with Joo Young Chae?

320
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,880
Because I'm Han Hye Ra's daughter.

321
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,750
Last time, you were Cha Jung Won,

322
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,250
now you're
Vice Chairman Han's daughter?

323
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,260
So who are you really?

324
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,490
Didn't you see the anonymous post?

325
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,530
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra's
original name was Han Young Sun.

326
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,330
It's true?
It's not some made-up story?

327
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,330
That part is true.

328
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,930
Maybe the rest is true too?

329
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,670
- And?
- Han Young Sun was living...

330
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,970
with her poor ex and their daughter.

331
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,440
She reunited with her first love,
Chairman Jin Tae Seok,

332
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,440
and the old flame reignited at once.

333
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,010
So you're saying...

334
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,380
that daughter is you?

335
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,690
No way.

336
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,760
If you're going to lie,
at least make it believable.

337
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,160
Come on.

338
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,730
It's up to you to believe me or not,

339
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,300
but it's going to come back
to bite you.

340
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,310
If you really are
Vice Chairman Han's daughter...

341
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,280
- Are you and Se Mi sisters then?
- I'm the older one.

342
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,710
So, here's the bottom line.

343
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,810
Ahn Ji Na,
pick your side carefully...

344
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,810
and get right behind me.

345
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,050
And one more thing.

346
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,390
I'm going to let you in
on a top-secret matter.

347
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,260
You know who wrote
that anonymous post?

348
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,330
Who was it?

349
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,130
Joo Young Chae.

350
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,400
What are you talking about?

351
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,440
Se Mi? How did you find us here?

352
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,850
I asked her to come.

353
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,580
I told you...

354
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,650
she's my little sister.

355
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,790
Is that true?

356
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,950
It is.

357
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,060
What was that you just said?

358
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,230
Who did you say posted
that anonymous post?

359
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,730
(The Truth about Kunhyang Group
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

360
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,970
Are you all right, ma'am?

361
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,140
- What about Hwang Mi Soo?
- We haven't found her yet.

362
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,680
Chairman Jin must know.

363
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,780
I'll get right on
Manager Hwang's tail.

364
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,080
Don't get involved yourself.
Have someone else tail him.

365
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,550
- Discreetly.
- Understood.

366
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,090
Mom.

367
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,490
Se Mi.

368
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,560
What the anonymous post says
isn't true, is it?

369
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,400
Of course not.

370
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,670
Sweetheart, were you upset,

371
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,540
thinking your mother was a liar?

372
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,610
Of course not. I trust you.
You would never do that.

373
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,080
Do you know who posted
that anonymous post?

374
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,020
We'll find out soon enough.

375
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,750
It was Joo Young Chae.

376
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,960
It might have been my sister-in-law.

377
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,330
That's a serious thing to say.

378
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,530
Cha Jung Won...

379
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,060
I mean Su A said that.

380
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,240
The stock price has plummeted.

381
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,880
- It must be because of me.
- Of course it is.

382
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,110
That's not what I meant.

383
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,850
My reputation accounts for a third
of the Kunhyang Group's image.

384
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,450
Is there anyone
who doesn't know that?

385
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,290
We'll find whoever is
behind it soon.

386
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,460
Our owner risk team
is zeroing in on the location.

387
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,060
And where is that?

388
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,800
It's the surrounding area,
including the Kunhyang house.

389
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,340
The Kunhyang house?

390
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,160
Who does she think she's fooling?

391
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,200
Changing her name wasn't enough.

392
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,440
She even had to fake a degree
and forge paintings?

393
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,670
Isn't she afraid
of divine retribution?

394
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,040
Han Young Sun
is already getting hers.

395
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,340
What?

396
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,640
Her own daughter is
her daughter-in-law,

397
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,550
and Gong Nan Sook's crazy daughter
is now Young Sun's fake daughter.

398
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,550
What greater punishment
is there than that?

399
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,120
And what about the punishment
our Jung Won is enduring?

400
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,120
How did my sweet, gentle soul...

401
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,360
end up being so filled with venom?

402
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,720
Revenge isn't for just anyone.

403
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,860
Even a worm fights back
when it's stepped on.

404
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,460
She must have felt so wronged
to feel so much resentment.

405
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,000
Her heart, set on revenge,

406
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,630
is already bruised and broken.

407
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,000
You know this and still support her?
And you're going to help her?

408
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,110
Now you listen to me.

409
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,680
Don't you dare get
in Jung Won's way.

410
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,910
- What?
- You stay out of it.

411
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,220
If you don't listen to a word I say,
I swear...

412
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,790
I'll run off
in the middle of the night.

413
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,820
I'll divorce you!

414
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,020
Mr. Cha Ki Beom came to see you?

415
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,560
What did he say?

416
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,400
He was just upset about Su A.

417
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,400
He probably felt like...

418
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,230
the Kunhyang family
stole his daughter.

419
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,670
Do you have any idea
who you married?

420
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,440
Sir, if it's about Jung Won,
you can talk to me.

421
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,710
About Jung Won?

422
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,720
That's right.
Tell him who Jung Won is...

423
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,020
and everything she's done!

424
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,990
About Su A?

425
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,790
Or the anonymous post?

426
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,590
Right after Su A showed up,

427
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,260
an anonymous post
slandering my mother was uploaded.

428
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,160
Don't you think that's strange?

429
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,070
Don't you think Su A's father,

430
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,640
Cha Ki Beom, was behind it?

431
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
He'd never do that. Not a chance.

432
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,040
I heard...

433
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,880
he was the man
who murdered your father.

434
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,810
So why are you defending him?

435
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,080
How did you find out?

436
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,250
I'm the Vice President
of Kunhyang Group, after all.

437
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,650
You don't think...

438
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,460
Cha Ki Beom is the real killer,
do you?

439
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,860
Are you suspecting my father?

440
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,160
Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

441
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,730
Se Hoon.

442
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,700
Just kidding.

443
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,910
Seems like every time we meet,
we end up drinking.

444
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,540
Tell me about it.

445
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,780
Let's get some work done.
It'll help you clear your head.

446
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,120
Did you finish the presentation?

(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

453
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,950
Did you leak the story about Su A
to the press?

454
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,350
Reporter Ma Sang Ki must have
heard it somewhere and ran with it.

455
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,880
The first part of that...

456
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,780
came from
our strategic planning team.

457
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,250
We aren't going...

458
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,260
to keep Su A a secret forever.

459
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,090
But not like this.

460
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,160
Our stock price
is going to drop again.

461
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,860
We need to start introducing Su A
to the media anyway.

462
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,500
How should we spin it?

463
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,200
We have to find a way to do this
without hurting Kunhyang or Su A.

464
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,170
It's highly likely that...

465
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,170
the person who wrote that
anonymous post is an insider.

466
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,850

Your dad went to the dry cleaners.

Headache or not, we have to eat.

Where's Young Chae?

473
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,110
She came in late last night
and left before sunrise.

474
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,910
I wonder what she's up to.
That sly little fox.

475
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,350
What's this?

476
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,980
A barbecue restaurant?

477
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,450
Why is this in my name?

478
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,860
You never got to do
what you wanted...

479
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,490
because you were busy
taking care of us.

480
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,560
Even a top chef can't cook like you.

481
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,800
You deserve
your own barbecue restaurant.

482
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,030
Where in the world did you
get the money for this?

483
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,100
I'm a daughter-in-law
of the Kunhyang family.

484
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,940
Three percent of Kunhyang's shares
are mine.

485
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,310
Are those really yours?

486
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,580
What good is the stock you got
for pretending to be Joo Young Chae?

487
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,250
I'll handle it.
I'm more than capable.

488
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,750
I'd be thrilled,
but If Ki Beom finds out...

489
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,660
Keep it a secret...

490
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,520
until I tell him.

491
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,530
Lately, there's been a global surge
in AI investment and development.

492
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,640
And our domestic companies
are working to build models...

493
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,810
that can rival top global tech.
So the question is,

494
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,880
what is Sky Question's
competitive edge?

495
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,960
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Is it weird that I came uninvited?

496
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,620
Don't be ridiculous.

497
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,030
You're the future designer
for Kunhyang Fashion,

498
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,030
and you'll be the lady of Kunhyang.
You belong here.

499
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
You can't even separate business
from personal matters.

500
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,770

the daughter-in-law of Kunhyang...

503
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,790
wrote the anonymous post
and the article regarding Su A.

504
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,960
Where did you get your info about
Han Hye Ra's real daughter, Su A?

505
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,470
Joo Young Chae, who is the daughter
of Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

506
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,530
and Vice Chairman
Han Hye Ra's daughter-in-law.

507
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,540
There's been a big misunderstanding.

508
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,640
If my image is tarnished,
does that make you look better?

509
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,550
I was treating you with respect,
and now you're running your mouth.

510
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,020
Han Hye Ra knows
that I wrote the anonymous post...

511
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,450
and that I leaked
everything on Su A.

512
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,320
Where was the IP address traced to?
Are you saying it was from her room?

513
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,990
Did she try to rattle
Kunhyang Group?

514
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,320
Then she doesn't belong
in this family.
