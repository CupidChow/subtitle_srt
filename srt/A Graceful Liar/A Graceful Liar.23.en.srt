1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,370
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,440
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,540
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,320
My Jung Won impersonated
her rich friend?

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,620
What, kidnapping?

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,090
Say something that makes sense
if you want me to listen.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,490
You put her up to it, didn't you?

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,860
- What?
- Like father, like daughter.

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,060
Don't you dare insult
my daughter again!

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,270
This is why you don't treat lowlifes
with any respect.

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,770
What?

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,170
You put Jo Mi Hyang's daughter on
your family register, didn't you?

13
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,610
I guess people become
similar over time.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,610
Does that mean Cha Jung Won...

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,310
has a murderer's blood
in her veins too?

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,310
I'm impersonating Joo Young Chae?

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,880
And what's all this
about a kidnapper?

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,650
I was so shocked,
I thought I was going to pass out.

19
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,590
They say I kidnapped Kyung Shin?

20
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,560
Right! Park Kyung Shin was the name.

21
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,860
So when the Chairman mentioned
Cha Jung Won,

22
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,030
did he actually mean Joo Young Chae?

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,130
Honey!

24
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,440
- Did you two have a fight?
- Get inside.

25
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,870
Just you, Jung Won.

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,080
I want a straight answer.

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,020
The name of the friend you're living
with now is Joo Young Chae?

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,420
It's Joo Young Chae's house,
that's right.

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,460
But I'm not living with her.

30
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,560
If you're not living together,
then where is she?

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,590
Paris.

32
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,160
She took off with a guy.

33
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,330
So you've been going around
pretending to be her?

34
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,800
It was Young Chae's idea of a joke.

35
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,340
To her friends who know her
as Victoria Shin,

36
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,670
the ones who studied abroad,

37
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,870
she said my name was Joo Young Chae.

38
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,540
Why would she pull such a stunt?

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,280
Because I'm so pathetic
and insignificant.

40
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,280
I never blatantly pretended
to be her.

41
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,020
It's just that other people...

42
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,120
mistook me for her
or got the wrong idea.

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,720
Then what about this
Park Kyung Shin guy?

44
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,830
Are you involved in this
whole kidnapping thing?

45
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,660
He's Young Chae's boyfriend.

46
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,930
He's the guy she went to Paris with.

47
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,030
Then why call it a kidnapping?
And why did your name come up?

48
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,370
I guess Young Chae's telling people
her name is Cha Jung Won.

49
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,510
What's she trying to pull?

50
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,980
Because I'm easy
to take advantage of,

51
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,740
and because I'm a pushover.

52
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,150
It's all...

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,980
because I'm a failure as a father.

54
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,920
Don't say that.

55
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,860
Joo Young Chae,
she's the awful one here.

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Cha Jung Won?

57
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,980
Yes, that's right. Cha Jung Won.

58
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,110
(Han Hye Ra, Vice Chairman)

59
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,180
It's a rough neighborhood.

60
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,920
Please, let me handle this.

61
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,490
I'm counting on you, Min Jung.

62
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,900
Are you trying to run away?

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,550
How did you untie the ropes?

64
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,450
I prayed really hard for a lifeline.

65
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,190
Guess you didn't pray hard enough.
Seeing as I caught you.

66
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,390
Young Chae, please, let me go.

67
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,930
And if I let you go,
do you have anywhere to run to?

68
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll go far away.
I swear, I'll go really far away.

69
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,360
There's nowhere you can hide
from Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

70
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,900
No matter how far you go,
you'll be caught eventually.

71
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,410
You're dead if my mom finds out.

72
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,440
Don't be ridiculous.

73
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,120
I will survive!
I'll do anything to escape!

74
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,480
I'm trapped here too!

75
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,820
It's not like I want
to be here either.

76
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Don't you get it?

77
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,990
You...

78
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,590
are finished.

79
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,650
Young Chae, please let me go.

80
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,280
I don't want to have to hurt you.

81
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
You got Noh Min Gu?

82
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,570
Where is he now?

83
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,900
You don't need to know.

84
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,670
Noh Min Gu helped Cha Jung Won
confine Park Kyung Shin.

85
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,380
Why would you take such a big risk?

86
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,080
I'm considering sending him abroad.

87
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,910
Just thinking about it.

88
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,780
What do you mean
you're "thinking about it?"

89
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,820
It's amusing.

90
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,250
- Toying with a guy like that.
- Se Hoon.

91
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,490
Just kidding.

92
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,330
I've got him locked up in my suite
at Kunhyang Hotel.

93
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,130
You're going to send him away,
right?

94
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,830
Far, far away.

95
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,830
Of course.

96
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,580
Jin Se Hoon.

97
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,450
Be mine. Forever.

98
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,860
Park Kyung Shin,
between you and me...

99
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,830
This only ends when
one of us is dead.

100
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,400
Die!

101
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
I'm sorry. Young Chae.

102
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,800
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

103
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,610
Sir,
Secretary Yoon is moving discreetly.

104
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,670
Discreetly?

105
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,940
Without even reporting to you?

106
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,810
That's right.
According to the company car's GPS,

107
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,850
she's heading toward Yangpyeong.

108
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
Destination?

109
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,450
It has to be the villa
owned by Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

110
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,550
How did you know?

111
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,690
I planted a bug in the
Vice Chairman's office.

112
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,700
That's simple and effective.

113
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,130
- Tail her.
- Understood.

114
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,570
I wonder...

115
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,470
what little scheme
my lovely wife is up to now.

116
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,950
Kyung Shin.

117
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,890
Park Kyung Shin.

118
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,820
Hey.

119
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,760
Hey, wake up.

120
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,360
Stop messing around.
You're scaring me.

121
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,330
Open your eyes.

122
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,800
Hey, come on!

123
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,170
Kyung Shin!

124
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,080
Kyung Shin, open your eyes!

125
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,640
Hey, open your eyes!

126
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,250
Somebody help me!

127
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,770
No one else can find out about this.

128
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,610
What?

129
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,110
Who?

130
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Dead?

131
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,380
Park Kyung Shin?

132
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,680
What if I'm the one who killed him?

133
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,690
I'm so scared.

134
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,460
Don't touch a single thing.

135
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,630
Don't throw anything away,
don't make or answer any calls.

136
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm on my way.
Don't move a muscle until I'm there.

137
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,060
Got it?

138
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,400
That darn girl...

139
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,740
Did she actually kill someone?

140
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,710
(Secretary Yoon Min Jung)

141
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,980
- Where are you?
- I'm near the Yangpyeong villa.

142
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,180
It looks like an accident,

143
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,220
but Cha Jung Won
hurt Park Kyung Shin.

144
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,060
Ma'am, I have an urgent report...

145
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,860
I know. To the Yangpyeong villa.
Now!

146
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,200
Is she psychic now, too?

147
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,210
Where are you off to, honey?

148
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,310
I left some important
documents at the office.

149
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,720
- Why not send Yoon? Why you?
- It's just easier if I go.

150
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,150
Should I go with you?
A late date for old time's sake.

151
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,320
- What do you say?
- You never grow up, do you?

152
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,660
As the Vice Chairman,
I have to pull my own weight.

153
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,530
Drive safe.
If anything happens, send an SOS.

154
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,830
Sleep well.

155
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,910
Right. Don't do anything
until I get there.

156
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,980
Something terrible
must've happened at the villa.

157
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,150
The Vice Chairman
is heading there in person.

158
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,250
What? Han Hye Ra's
heading to the villa?

159
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,060
All right. Keep me updated.

160
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,430
Hurry. We have to get there
before Han Hye Ra does.

161
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,260
Don't make a move yet.

162
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,770
We can't let Yoon's team spot you.
Instead...

163
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,630
whatever went down there,

164
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,740
you get your hands on...

165
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,640
any critical evidence first.

166
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,400
Young Chae. Are you okay?

167
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,460
Are you hurt anywhere?

168
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,170
This was bound to happen.

169
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,470
It might even be for the best.

170
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,440
Park Kyung Shin is dead.

171
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,340
I'm the one who killed him.

172
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,510
How could you say
this is for the best?

173
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,120
How can you say that, Mom!

174
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,920
Hey! Snap out of it!

175
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,050
Get a grip!

176
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,750
Young Chae!

177
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,460
Okay, okay. I get it.

178
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,670
Nothing happened.

179
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,440
Young Chae, you didn't do a thing.

180
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,210
Mom will take care of everything.
It's okay.

181
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,510
- Pull up the drone footage again.
- Yes, ma'am.

182
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,580
(Video Playback Failed)

183
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,850
There's a problem with the drone.

184
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
What?

185
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,460
Not picking up?

186
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,060
- Was the drone spotted?
- It could be a temporary glitch.

187
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,700
How about the video of Cha Jung Won
attacking Park Kyung Shin?

188
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,770
I'll have to go to the drone team
to check.

189
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,430
Who was here before I arrived?

190
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,170
Chairman Gong Nan Sook.
I saw her go inside myself.

191
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,640
Gong Nan Sook is behind this.

192
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,440
The body and the drone.

193
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,620
I've secured
the drone's memory card.

194
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,920
So Cha Jung Won is the one
who attacked Park Kyung Shin,

195
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,550
but why is Gong Nan Sook
cleaning up the mess?

196
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,920
And Hye Ra...

197
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,290
goes all the way out to the villa
to check on it herself.

198
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,230
After Park Kyung Shin broke up
with Joo Young Chae,

199
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,030
it seems he was definitely dating
Cha Jung Won.

200
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,440
There's no audio,

201
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,640
but those two were clearly in love.
Madly.

202
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,210
I'll look into it further.
As for why the Vice Chairman...

203
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,250
went to the villa herself.

204
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,850
No need.

205
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,920
Because I already know why.

206
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,890
It's because Cha Jung Won is
Cha Ki Beom's adopted daughter.

207
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,490
She's still worried
about Cha Ki Beom.

208
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,260
That woman of mine.

209
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,590
Han Hye Ra.

210
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,940
When did you get here?

211
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,170
What if Mom finds out?

212
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,550
Stop.

213
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,460
What's wrong?

214
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,390
Did something happen to you?

215
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,990
I can't tell anyone.

216
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,330
Mom, what happened?

217
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,540
Don't you worry about a thing.

218
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,680
What in the world is going on?

219
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,720
Kyung Shin tried to kill me first.

220
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,920
If you check the CCTV
at the villa...

221
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,360
That's a private safe house.
You think they'd have cameras there?

222
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,460
What did you do
with Park Kyung Shin's body?

223
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,160
- Where is he now?
- You don't need to know.

224
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,230
- Mother.
- Mom!

225
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,570
I told you I handled it!

226
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,670
That's desecration of a corpse.

227
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,070
- You think I don't know that?
- If word gets out... I mean...

228
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,310
If the press gets a hold of this,

229
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,840
it won't just be
Young Chae and you...

230
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,740
No, our entire family
will fall apart.

231
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,510
So you're more worried about
this family than I am?

232
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,750
Why?

233
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,920
Are you worried it'll cause problems
for Cha Jung Won?

234
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,390
- Yes, I am.
- What?

235
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,020
I'm worried about the harm it causes
Cha Jung Won,

236
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,430
who has to live as you.

237
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,860
- Isn't that the same thing?
- No, it's completely different.

238
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,430
Of course it is different.

239
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,270
The Kunhyang family thinks you're
Cha Jung Won right now.

240
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,170
Even if we erase every trace,
what about fingerprints?

241
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,540
And your link to Park Kyung Shin?

242
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,710
Cha Jung Won, living as Young Chae,
will be a suspect, and in the end...

243
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,540
the wedding will be called off.

244
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,010
Jung Won will be a suspect?

245
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,220
Mom, make it happen.

246
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,650
Make it look like the real Jung Won
attacked Park Kyung Shin.

247
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,850
Can't you see this is a bad idea?

248
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,690
I'm worried that's what will happen,
not something to aim for!

249
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,860
We have to cover this up.

250
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,060
We'll make it so it never happened.

251
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,430
Ha Neul.

252
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,230
I need to speak with you.

253
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,740
What should we do about Young Chae?

254
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,840
After the wedding,

255
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,680
we'll report it to the police
and claim self-defense.

256
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,110
We're back to this again?
Who is the real assailant here?

257
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,650
Is it Young Chae who claimed
she's Cha Jung Won on a whim?

258
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,290
Or Cha Jung Won who's pretending
to be Young Chae?

259
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,250
What do you plan to do, then?

260
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,530
I do have a place where Young Chae
can hide for a while.

261
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,930
Where?

262
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,430
Well, for tonight at least,

263
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,730
I suppose she'll have to stay
at my place.

264
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,480
My poor baby.

265
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,720
Are you in torment
even in your dreams?

266
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,850
For now, just get some rest.

267
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,090
And then you have to
get through this.

268
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,920
Be more ruthless.

269
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,490
Like a true daughter
of Gong Nan Sook.

270
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,240
You're awake?

271
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,580
You can't sleep?

272
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,720
You're drinking alone
when you rarely drink.

273
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,320
I feel a little left out.

274
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,260
Cognac is just like you.

275
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,460
Smooth, yet deep.

276
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,070
Did you get them?

277
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,600
How urgent could those papers be?

278
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,380
You already know I went
to the villa in Yangpyeong.

279
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,920
Also, you know that Cha Jung Won
hurt Park Kyung Shin...

280
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,750
don't you?

281
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,260
But before we get to that,

282
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,990
there's something we need
to clear up first.

283
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,830
Documents? Please.

284
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,030
I can overlook
a little lie like that.

285
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
They say people...

286
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,230
lie three times in a
ten-minute conversation.

287
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,540
But here's the thing.

288
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,940
Why were you looking into where
Park Kyung Shin was being held...

289
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,110
behind my back?

290
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,540
Was it for Cha Jung Won?

291
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,950
Are you that worried about her,

292
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,050
when she's not
Cha Ki Beom's own daughter?

293
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,790
You mean Cha Jung Won,
who's hurting our daughter-in-law.

294
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,390
- That's the one we should discuss.
- No.

295
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,200
You're still...

296
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,830
not over Cha Ki Beom.

297
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,740
- Honey.
- Stop right there. Don't go there.

298
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,010
If you push this any further,

299
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,840
the Han Hye Ra you've created
and cultivated,

300
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,150
the woman who is still...

301
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,950
the most beautiful and kind
woman in the world to you,

302
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,290
will disappear.

303
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,160
I'm sorry.

304
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,870
I won't do it again, honey.

305
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,810
You still look sleepy.

306
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,280
Let me put you to bed.

307
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Come on.

308
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,420
You're the only one for me.

309
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,560
If you lie to me and don't trust me,

310
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,090
I feel like I'll go crazy.

311
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,510
(Groom: Cha Ki Beom,
Bride: Jo Mi Hyang)

312
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,280
I'm going to quickly drop these off
in the neighborhood.

313
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,510
What's there to brag about...

314
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,650
getting married this late in life?

315
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,690
This might be your
second time, Ki Beom,

316
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,060
so it may not be a big deal to you,

317
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,260
- but I'm over the moon.
- Send one to Jung Won too.

318
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,700
Jung Won's address? I don't have it.

319
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
I'll ask her to come over.

320
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,200
Gosh, she's busy.
Why make her come all the way here?

321
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,970
Don't you have those e-invites?
Just send her that.

322
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,210
I'm to send my daughter an e-invite
to her parents' wedding?

323
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,040
Are you kidding me?

324
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,940
For goodness' sake.

325
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:27,050
Looks like my future sister-in-law
is a bundle of nerves.

326
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,820
- Se Mi, drop the "future" part.
- Why? They're not married yet.

327
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,730
My dear daughter-in-law.

328
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,060
Are you free next Friday?

329
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,530
I'm sorry?

330
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,000
That's your wedding day.
Next Friday.

331
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,600
Can't have a wedding
without the bride, now can we?

332
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,510
I'll clear my schedule, Mother.

333
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,840
For guests, just from our side,
I'm thinking four or five hundred?

334
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,810
Ask Chairman Gong
how many guests from her side.

335
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,580
We need to know
so we can book the venue.

336
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,690
Why?

337
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,920
Are you worried
you'll have too many guests?

338
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,560
Why don't you just broadcast
the wedding on national TV?

339
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,700
Breakfast is late today, huh?

340
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,070
Because Chef Hong was preparing
something for you...

341
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,840
to build up your strength.

342
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,910
You know I don't usually
eat breakfast.

343
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,340
- This is too heavy.
- You need a full stomach for today.

344
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,980
The cold and the loneliness.

345
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,290
Mother, may I have a word with you?

346
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,620
Why is there
only one drumstick in mine?

347
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,920
Did you sneak a bite, Chef Hong?

348
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,830
Mine has three drumsticks.

349
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,070
Young Chae, please eat up.
You'll need your strength.

350
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,210
Here, Young Chae,
have some of this too.

351
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,710
Have another drumstick.

352
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,210
What's going on?
Why is everyone acting so weird?

353
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,510
Do I look like
I haven't eaten in days?

354
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,820
Eat up.

355
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,600
Mom, are you going on a work trip
or something?

356
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,530
Not me. You.

357
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,870
Where are you sending me?

358
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,370
You're not, right?

359
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,910
Just go and get some rest
until I can clean up this mess.

360
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,450
- Are you abandoning me? Mom?
- Abandon you? You're my daughter.

361
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,710
This is exactly what
abandoning me looks like.

362
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,120
For your business
and your own selfish gain,

363
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,920
you'd cast aside your own child?

364
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,050
Is that what a mother does?

365
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,660
I told you you'll understand later.
This is for your own good.

366
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,600
Take her.

367
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,870
No, let go of me! Ha Neul!

368
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,800
Do you really have to go this far?

369
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,440
Then do you have a better idea?

370
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,280
- I'll find a good place for her.
- Ha Neul!

371
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,610
Stay out of it.

372
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,920
To rein in a wild horse,
that's the only place to do it.

373
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,930
No, let me go!

374
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
Please!

375
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,130
Open the door.

376
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,670
Open the door!

377
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,940
Get my mom, please!

378
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,480
(Cha J Won)

379
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,450
(Cha J Won)

380
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,690
I was gifted some fine Pu'er tea
and brought it for you.

381
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,430
It smells wonderful.

382
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,730
It's from a tree over 100 years old.

383
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,670
I should've known you have the best,
Chef Hong.

384
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,540
Young Chae...

385
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,800
will get through this.

386
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:15,610
Are you sure about that facility?
Sending her abroad might be better.

387
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,480
Keep your friends close,

388
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,650
and your enemies closer.

389
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,920
Young Chae is my daughter,
not my enemy.

390
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,920
Hasn't anyone who stood in your way
become your enemy? Daughter or not?

391
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,900
So why did she have to kill someone?

392
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,900
Mom will take care of everything.
It's okay.

393
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,970
Manager Gu!

394
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,080
Get rid of Park Kyung Shin,
and take Young Chae home.

395
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,480
Should I take Young Chae first?

396
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,880
- What about the body?
- Take Young Chae first.

397
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,210
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,480
- Go on.
- Let's go.

399
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,950
Go with Manager Gu.

400
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,310
You brought this on yourself.

401
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,620
Please let me live.

402
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,260
(Naeil Care Hospital)

403
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,800
Did Mom send you to get me?

404
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,340
She did, right?

405
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,480
The whole thing's been handled,
right?

406
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,510
If you want to get out of here...

407
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,650
If she wants to leave
the care facility,

408
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,020
she needs to live as Cha Jung Won,
not Joo Young Chae.

409
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,420
Live as who?

410
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,490
What do you mean, I'm Cha Jung Won?

411
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,730
There can't be
another Joo Young Chae.

412
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,760
Ha Neul!

413
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,830
That's CEO Joo to you.

414
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,730
Actually, "Mr. Joo" wouldn't be
so bad either.

415
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,100
You're all insane.

416
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,540
Both you and Mom are
out of your minds.

417
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,910
How could you do this to me?

418
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,980
Cha Jung Won can't live
as you forever.

419
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,410
When that time comes,

420
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,520
your name, your position,
your life...

421
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,120
- You can get it all back.
- And when is that?

422
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,930
How long do I have to live
as Cha Jung Won?

423
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,490
Mom will be the one to decide.

424
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,470
(A Graceful Liar)

425
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,970
Joo Young Chae is my woman.
I'm finally being recognized.

426
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,080
Joo Young Chae makes an exception
for Jin Se Hoon, just for today.

427
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,380
Why did Jung Won
call herself Joo Young Chae?

428
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,350
Jung Won, what in the world
have you been doing?

429
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,680
Mom, isn't my fiancee beautiful?

430
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,620
Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you.
My name is Joo Young Chae.

431
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,220
It looks like
my mom approves of you.

432
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,630
What do you mean, I'm Cha Jung Won?

433
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,060
There can't be
another Joo Young Chae.

434
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
You're all insane.

435
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,630
Both you and Mom are
out of your minds.

436
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,930
How could you do this to me?

437
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,930
The Kunhyang family.

438
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,630
This is my world now.
The world of Joo Young Chae.

439
