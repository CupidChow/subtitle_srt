1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,240
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,270
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,280
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,850
Se Hoon, was this you?

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,420
Why would I?
I don't stoop to methods like these.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,820
If not you, then it must be
Cha Jung Won and Joo Ha Neul.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,490
What are you going to do?

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,070
I'm going to make them regret
pulling a stunt like this.

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,100
Are you planning to get rid of
Cha Jung Won again?

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,840
Gong Nan Sook comes first this time.

11
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,360
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

12
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,570
I am Administrator Kim Yong Hyuk
from the Seoul Regional Tax Service.

13
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,540
This is an audit of Crown Capital.
Your cooperation is required.

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,270
A tax audit?

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,820
(Episode 84)

16
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,960
- Where's Jin Tae Seok?
- How may I help you?

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,930
Why is Chairman Han's
secretary interfering? Move aside.

18
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,630
Now I work
for the honorary chairman.

19
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,000
You should stay out of this.

20
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,200
What? Then what about that big guy,
Manager Hwang?

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,640
He works for Chairman Han.

22
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,980
So you two did a little switcheroo?
What a bizarre setup.

23
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,180
Chairman Gong,
is your memory failing you?

24
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,180
Have you forgotten why you're here?

25
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,780
Right.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,850
Jin Tae Seok!

27
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,500
- How dare you show your face here?
- The tax audit.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,470
Did you think I wouldn't know
you were behind this, Jin Tae Seok?

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,300
That's right, it was me.

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,340
Were you that pissed off
about getting dunked in the water?

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,980
Me, Jin Tae Seok, being humiliated
by a low-life loan shark?

32
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,940
And being forced to call you
"ma'am" as well?

33
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,980
Calling me "ma'am" was more shameful
than the dunking.

34
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,720
Just say so. I can call you "sir."
How about that, sir?

35
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,520
This right here is the difference
in our class.

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,830
When you're at a disadvantage,
you change your tune instantly...

37
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,200
and grovel again and again,
but I'm different.

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,500
Don't give me that nonsense
about class.

39
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,570
Sir Jin Tae Seok.

40
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,140
You really picked a fight
with the wrong person this time.

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,370
You're the one who poked the bear.

42
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,840
You've been backing Joo Ha Neul
and Cha Jung Won?

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,950
And you've even been buying up
shares to take over Kunhyang.

44
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,680
As if that wasn't enough,
you sent me a threatening letter?

45
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,080
A threatening letter?

46
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,050
What?

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
What, this thing?

48
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,690
What does this even say?

49
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,700
Looks like it's all true to me.

50
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,430
But this wasn't me.

51
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,070
Then, it was Joo Ha Neul
and Cha Jung Won.

52
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,110
Because they think they have you
in their corner.

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,940
No, that's not it.
They're counting on your money.

54
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,180
Do you think I'll let them get away
with being so cocky?

55
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,980
To me, money is more precious
than life itself.

56
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,390
But you dare to sic the tax auditors
on my company?

57
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,620
You think you can cut off
my cash flow?

58
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,930
Compared to this, drowning you
was letting you off easy, wasn't it?

59
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,700
Enjoy being picked clean.

60
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,740
Those days when you were the top dog
among the low-life loan sharks...

61
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,070
- You'll miss them terribly.
- Miss them? Come on.

62
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,240
You and I are done for good.

63
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,210
I hate people who are more powerful
than me but even filthier.

64
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,980
And that's you. Sir Jin Tae Seok.

65
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,550
I can't stand you calling me that.
Get out now!

66
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,420
I was on my way out
before you told me to.

67
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,730
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

68
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,210
A hidden camera?

69
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,420
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

70
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,960
Don't tell me it was Joo Ha Neul.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,030
Or maybe Cha Jung Won?

72
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,470
Going as far as to plant
a hidden camera?

73
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,000
And they stole the footage
of Cha Ki Beom's death?

74
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,410
(Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul)

75
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,080
You'd plant a hidden camera
and steal from me?

76
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,310
Give me back my footage.

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
"Your" footage?

78
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,050
What makes the video
of Cha Ki Beom's death yours?

79
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,120
You're probably the one who stole it,
using Young Chae.

80
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,630
Even Chairman Gong Nan Sook
can't pull strings for you anymore.

81
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,260
Stop messing around
and hand it over.

82
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,300
What did you do to Chairman Gong?

83
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,470
A tax audit.

84
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,240
The tax audit on The Crown Capital.

85
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,310
Was this your doing, Jin Se Hoon?

86
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,740
Though Chairman Gong's scheming
gets on my nerves,

87
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,710
she's still my mother-in-law.

88
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,250
As her son-in-law,
I could never be that cruel.

89
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,420
Jin Tae Seok.

90
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,360
What? What did you just say?

91
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,930
I said get on your knees.

92
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,630
You must get on your knees.

93
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,030
And who am I supposed to kneel to
on these worn-out knees?

94
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,470
To a woman more fearsome than you.

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,240
A woman who has something you lack.

96
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,070
That fortune-teller
was scarily on the money.

97
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,040
- And if I do?
- I could stop the tax audit.

98
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
And how would you do that?

99
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,950
Chairman of Kunhyang Group is
my title.

100
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,150
- Have you forgotten?
- Can you beat the honorary chair?

101
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,990
I’m asking whether...

102
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,860
you can really make it
worth my while to kneel before you.

103
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,130
Jin Tae Seok has abandoned you. But I...

104
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,560
Of course you'd need me.

105
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,200
If I really put my mind to it,
I could have Jin Tae Seok groveling.

106
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,700
So you're saying you can easily
change Jin Tae Seok's mind?

107
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,310
But here's the thing.

108
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,310
I realized I'm a lot more like you
than I thought.

109
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,540
Like me?

110
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,580
Like me, you can't stand a woman
who's prettier and more successful?

111
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,120
That's exactly it.

112
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,820
- So I have to bow down to you?
- Exactly.

113
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,090
Even you, Gong Nan Sook.

114
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,840
Han Hye Ra...

115
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,940
There’s no way
I can bow down to you.

116
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,450
What do you think you're doing?

117
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,650
Oh my goodness.

118
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,190
That's strange.
I think my joints gave out.

119
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,620
They won't bend.
They worked just fine yesterday.

120
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,760
So strange.

121
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,630
If I tell you to kneel,
then do it right, Gong Nan Sook!

122
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,600
Oh my.

123
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,770
Why are you kneeling?
It's not your place to do that.

124
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,500
I can't watch you kneel, ma'am.
It will be over my dead body.

125
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,870
What a loyal secretary.

126
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,650
It's not like I've never knelt.
Why are you being so dramatic?

127
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,980
Anyone but Chairman Han Hye Ra.

128
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,080
Let's go. This isn't our place.

129
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,450
Let me go. Let go!

130
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,990
Don't do it, ma'am.
You absolutely can't!

131
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,490
You can't! Please!

132
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,890
I'm almost jealous.

133
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,130
Your loyal secretary surprises me,
Gong Nan Sook.

134
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,830
Surprising, my foot.

135
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,870
Fine, I'll kneel. If I have to,

136
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,900
I will.

137
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,870
Even if my knees shatter, I will.

138
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,240
I will kneel.

139
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,040
No matter where I look in the world,
the only person who can save me...

140
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,250
is you, Han Hye Ra.

141
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
Forget it.

142
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,450
- What do you mean, "forget it?"
- This isn't fun anymore.

143
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,720
But I said I would get on my knees!

144
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,990
You're the one who called it off.
I was definitely about to kneel.

145
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,800
So we're even.
I'm leaving before you take it back.

146
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
See you.

147
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,580
No matter where I look in the world,
the only person who can save me...

148
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,950
is you, Han Hye Ra.

149
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,760
I can't abandon
Gong Nan Sook just yet.

150
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,960
At least for Jung Won
and Vice Chairman Joo's sake.

151
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,970
You're the most beautiful woman
in the world.

152
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,880
There's probably no man who can lie
as charmingly as you do.

153
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,480
If you'll take my arm, do it right.

154
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,220
We're in public. People will talk.

155
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,650
Come on, who's watching?
It's just us.

156
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,760
How can I...

157
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,330
win Hye Ra back?

158
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,100
Hye Ra.

159
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,530
Care for a drink?

160
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,210
I know you're furious with me.

161
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,380
And that you can't forgive me.

162
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,720
What do you want me to do?

163
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,020
You want me to get on my knees?

164
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,860
I'm sick of your smooth talk.

165
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,130
It's agonizing that I can't
be close to you...

166
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,110
even when I'm in the same room
as you.

167
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,180
You're just...

168
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,890
pathetic.

169
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,960
Please, forgive me.

170
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,190
I can't take it anymore.

171
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,440
You did something unforgivable.

172
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,170
Do you even realize that?

173
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,240
Hye Ra.

174
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,050
While you've been shutting me out,

175
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,680
it felt like my heart
was being ripped apart.

176
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,720
Please, just look at me.

177
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,040
Darn it.

178
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,410
What? Hang on a second.

179
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,990
Extra income tax, punitive charges,
proceeds of crime...

180
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,860
Why is this so complicated?
And reporting me for concealment?

181
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,730
I'm a model citizen
who always pays the taxes on time?

182
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,060
Let's be honest, that's not true...

183
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,770
The illegal stuff I do for you alone
is more than a handful...

184
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,800
What? You little punk!

185
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,310
Hey, where did Grandma go?

186
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,380
Her favorite girl in the world
is in such shock,

187
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,080
she's on the verge
of kicking the bucket.

188
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,080
You mean the most evil woman
in the world.

189
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,520
Grandma, come on!
Are you rubbing salt in my wounds?

190
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,650
You don't like salt?
How about sugar?

191
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,750
Why sugar? It'll just get sticky.

192
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,290
Grandma, what am I going to do?

193
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,600
For crying out loud.

194
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,580
What?
You’re scaring the life out of me.

195
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,210
What's with the sigh?

196
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,390
I almost begged Han Hye Ra
on my knees. Isn't that enough?

197
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,490
A child who is like your own,
but isn't.

198
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,690
A child who is more than your own...

199
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,690
- will be the one to help you.
- What?

200
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
"A child who is like your own,
but isn't."

201
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,930
"A child who is more than your own?"
What is this, a riddle?

202
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,060
Who are you talking about?

203
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,200
Chairman Gong
is under a tax investigation?

204
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,970
It's an attack from Jin Tae Seok.
A fatal one.

205
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,380
I know there's a lot we can't trust
about Chairman Gong.

206
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,650
But right now, we really need her,
don't we?

207
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,490
We have to find a way.

208
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,960
We gave Jin Tae Seok 72 hours.

209
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,290
- There's one day left.
- And yet he struck first.

210
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,960
And he went after Chairman Gong,
not you or me.

211
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,170
The footage.

212
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,640
Let's leak it.

213
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,570
But then, what about Chairman Gong?

214
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,010
She'll find a way out somehow.
You know how she is.

215
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,310
She'll have a hard time with this
unless we step in.

216
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,820
- What are you doing here?
- I invited her.

217
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,090
I asked Vice Chairman Joo
to let me in on it.

218
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,390
In on what?

219
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,790
Jin Tae Seok.

220
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,330
- We three must take him down.
- Including you, Chairman Han?

221
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,340
No! You could get seriously hurt
because of me, just like last time.

222
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,770
If I don't get involved,
you and Vice Chairman Joo...

223
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,810
will be in even greater danger.

224
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,780
But I can't just do nothing.

225
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,010
That's why she's offering
to do this together.

226
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,150
She knows you won't stop, Jung Won,
even if she tells you to.

227
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,520
That's how...

228
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,190
powerful Jin Tae Seok is.
Now, we must make a thorough plan...

229
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,760
step by step...

230
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,560
- to get closer to him.
- When it's time, we have to charge.

231
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,900
And we have to know
when to take a step back.

232
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,410
Even if we get knocked down
again and again,

233
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,170
we have to get up and keep climbing.

234
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,250
Okay, then. Tell us
why the three of us are here today.

235
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,880
The issue
with Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

236
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,420
She's our most important card
for taking down Jin Tae Seok.

237
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,660
Do we let her go down for this,

238
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,190
or do we give her an out
for the time being?

239
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,850
Should we sit down?

240
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,270
It's cold. Do you want
to go somewhere warmer?

241
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,240
That's strange.

242
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,950
This is a first.

243
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,720
I'm not cold when I'm with you.

244
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,020
Even with your nose all red?

245
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,460
Yours is too, Mom.

246
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,790
"Mom?"

247
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,470
Okay, you're right.
Let's go somewhere warm.

248
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,780
Feeling a little warmer now?

249
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,820
My dear Jung Won.

250
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,550
It's going to be
a difficult road ahead.

251
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,820
Aren't you scared?

252
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,060
Are you sure you'll be okay?

253
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,460
I wish I could bear it all for you.

254
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
I'm scared.

255
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,170
I'm very scared.

256
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,370
What if I get hurt again?

257
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,310
Or worse, what if I actually die?

258
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,180
I just can't believe
a father could...

259
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,590
Listen.

260
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,420
I won't let you die.
I won't let you get hurt.

261
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,430
I won't let him touch...

262
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,460
a single hair on your head.

263
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,860
Jin Tae Seok...

264
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,300
I'm going to tear him
limb from limb.

265
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,310
Is that the kind of hatred...

266
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,440
you've been living with
all this time, Mom?

267
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,850
Thank you...

268
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,150
for calling me Mom, Jung Won.

269
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,920
I'm sorry.

270
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,820
For causing you so much heartache.

271
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,060
Don't say that.

272

I'm the one who's sorry.

What's going on?

274
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,950
Chairman Gong is sick.

275
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,190
She was so upset
and has become sick with stress.

276
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,260
- Make sure she takes her medicine.
- She's already taken it.

278

My goodness.

280
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,190
You're just making me sicker.

This is what I get
for trying to take care of you?

282

I swear,
having no children is the life.

283
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,530
I didn't think you were even capable
of getting sick.

284
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,270
Are you that scared
of the tax audit?

285
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,440
You.

286
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Get out.

287
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,810
That's how you can help me.

Don't be sick. Okay?

292
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,840
I never thought of you as someone
who could get sick either.

the baddest woman in the world,

I'd rather see you
screaming your head off.

297
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,600
This doesn't suit you.

298
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,500
Why would someone like Gong Nan Sook
get sick?

299
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,800
You're not someone who would crumble
over a mere tax audit, are you?

with Chairman Han Hye Ra.

That means it's my duty
to help you and Cha Jung Won.

306

You kept the originals separately, right?

Yes.

308
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,430

for releasing these documents,

310
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,100

but when you peel back a layer,

347
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,800
you feel the warmth of its people.

348
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,470
That irony inspired this design.

349
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,100
Young Chae,
you really are a talented designer.

350
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,310
Excellent!

351
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,410
If we launch this as is,
we'll be set for next season.

352
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,440
Really?

353
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,480
Vice Chairman,
what are your thoughts?

354
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,590
I'm no fashion expert,

355
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,960
but it's a design
that really draws you in.

356
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,260
- Great work, Designer Joo.
- Thank you, Vice Chairman.

357
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,370
Are you really just going to let
this happen?

358
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,080
Just a little longer.

359
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,280
I'll let her climb higher,
even if it's all fake.

360
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,620
That way, the fall will hurt more.

361
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,350
That's what happened to me.

362
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,420
So for Joo Young Chae's
little puppet show,

363
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,860
I guess I'll have to grit my teeth
and play along.

364
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,190
- It's hard, though.
- Thank you...

365
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,760
for being so professional
about this.

366
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,400
You don't have to thank me.

367
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,740
A pro's got to be a pro.
That's my motto.

368
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,500
A designer
stealing someone else's work.

369
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,010
I can't let that slide.

370
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,120
(Jin Tae Seok)

371
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,260
Honorary Chairman,
what are you doing here?

372
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,200
Is any part of Kunhyang off-limits to me?

373
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,370
I was thinking of grabbing lunch
with my daughter, Jung Won.

374
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,570
Se Hoon, how about you join us?

375
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,640
Are you serious?
We used to be married.

376
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,110
You want me to have lunch
with you...

377
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,180
and Cha Jung Won,
who's my half-sister?

378
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,180
That's insane.

379
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,090
You have no idea what a relief it is
you're not half-siblings, Se Hoon.

380
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
But...

381
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,260
you tried to get rid of Cha Jung Won
at all costs.

382
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,660
And now you want to have lunch
with her?

383
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,870
What's your angle?

384
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,040
Blood is thicker than water,
I suppose.

385
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,090
Our Jung Won.

386
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,130
Accept her as your daughter.

387
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,000
- What?
- Then I'll go back to how I was.

388
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,230
Your sweet and lovely wife.

389
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,070
A picture-perfect woman...

390
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,840
who is yours and yours alone.

391
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,460
Jung Won,
if you want to beat Jin Tae Seok,

392
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,700
you have to treat him
like your father.

393
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,800
That monster who tried to kill
his own daughter multiple times?

394
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,540
That's the only way
you can rip out his heart.

395
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,550
You know what I mean, don't you?

396
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,440
That was delicious.

397
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,910
Is sushi really enough for you?

398
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,210
More than enough.

399
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,850
You've been through a lot,
haven't you?

400
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,420
It's a burden I'll have to carry
for the rest of my life.

401
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,260
If I'd known you were
my own flesh and blood,

402
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,730
I never would have done
those things.

403
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,530
I know that you already knew.

404
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,100
I wasn't sure.

405
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,140
And it's not like Gong Nan Sook
is a trustworthy person.

406
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,670
Why were you...

407
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,780
so desperate to kill me?

408
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,180
I don't know what came over me.

409
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,450
Jung Won.

410
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,790
Can't you forgive your father?

411
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
I don't really know
what forgiveness means,

412
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,280
but the fact that you're my father
doesn't change, does it?

413
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,690
If you can admit just that much...

414
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Good.

415
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,730
Let's...

416
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,370
try to get along.

417
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,790
(A Graceful Liar)

418
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,250
It's like my son Ha Neul was there,
and at the same time, he wasn't.

419
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,290
You think
I have nothing better to do?

420
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,360
He's worried about me right now,
isn't he?

421
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,500
If convicted of money laundering,
you're looking at about five years.

422
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,570
Get all my front men from all over
and make sure they keep quiet.

423
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,970
Before the prosecution
starts investigating.

424
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,270
- Will keeping them quiet be enough?
- You have a plan, right?

425
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,510
From now on, the people here
are the only real family we have.

426
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,610
My dear Jung Won,
let's try to get along.

427
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,010
He was always harping on you
to remove Cha Jung Won, wasn't he?

428
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,750
I'll put up with it.
I'm going to pull this off.

429
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,720
When you strike, end it in one blow.
Make it a clean, inescapable hit.

430
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,450
