00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,910
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,110
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,550
Be my shadow, Gong Nan Sook.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
Your shadow?

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,350
And I suppose that makes you
the light?

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,020
You've got to be kidding me.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,230
If there's a light, it must be me.
You're meant for the shadows.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,100
Stop playing dumb.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,300
So in public, you're the chairman,
but in private, we're co-chairmen?

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,910
Gong Nan Sook.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,310
I need your help...

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,080
until we take down Jin Tae Seok
for good.

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,620
I have to admit that does sound fun.

15
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,090
This is about your son, Joo Ha Neul,
and my daughter, Cha Jung Won.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,990
Their entire futures are at stake.

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,860
You're saying we take over Kunhyang
for ourselves,

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,430
and then pass it on to our kids?

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,300
(Episode 73)

20
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,480
Manager Hwang, why are you here?

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,080
I had some business to attend to.

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,350
Are you here to see...

23
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,120
if my phone's data
has been recovered?

24
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,890
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

25
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,030
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,630
It vanished after being recovered?

27
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,530
Vice Chairman Joo,
your acquaintance...

28
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,400
was able to recover the data.
It was a success.

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,470
And?

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,210
While he stepped out
to use the restroom,

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,370
the phone and the recovered data
disappeared.

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
All the backup files, too.

33
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,450
Are you saying Jin Tae Seok's people
were behind this?

34
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,350
It looks that way.

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,450
So they swiped
the decisive evidence. Is that it?

36
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,660
- Mom.
- What? I want in on this, too.

37
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,130
This is about my daughter,
and your father's senseless death.

38
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,960
We all know too well
that Jin Tae Seok did this,

39
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,670
so does it make any sense
that all we can do is file a report?

40
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,770
The prosecution can only hold him
for a maximum of 48 hours.

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,040
If we can't find concrete evidence
by then...

42
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,970
Jin Tae Seok just gets to walk free?

43
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,340
That's ridiculous.

44
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,680
No one is above the law.
The good guys are supposed to win.

45
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,120
- I won't let that happen.
- What are you planning to do, Mom?

46
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,320
You're going to help me, right?

47
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,260
Yes. Of course, I'll help you.

48
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,360
But out of all
of Chairman Jin Tae Seok's associates,

49
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,030
who would've done
something like this?

50
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,170
- Besides you, Manager Hwang.
- That's what I'd like to know.

51
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,250
This is a great piece, isn't it?

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,320
It's even better since I'm here
with you, Director Jin.

53
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,290
When I hit a creative block
with my designs,

54
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,400
coming to a gallery to clear my head
and find inspiration...

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,200
is a huge help.

56
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,770
We should come more often.

57
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,580
Mom and Cha Jung Won?

58
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Just the two of them?

59
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,150
We should go say hi.

60
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,660
Her long-lost daughter,
found after 25 years.

61
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,890
She came back from the dead.

62
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,200
It must be such a touching
and emotional reunion.

63
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
I'd hate to interrupt.

64
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,550
This piece
hasn't found its place yet.

65
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,020
It doesn't quite fit in
with the main exhibition,

66
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,990
but to put it away in storage,

67
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,860
it's just too striking.

68
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,900
So you're just going to leave it be?

69
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,330
I don't want to leave you
in limbo...

70
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,900
like this painting.

71
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,640
Before the board meeting,

72
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,610
I'm going to transfer
my shares to you.

73
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,450
- Why all of a sudden?
- Because now...

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,490
you're part of Kunhyang's family
and a top shareholder.

75
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,360
Are you planning...

76
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,360
to announce that decision
at the board meeting?

77
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,390
I have no intention of hiding it.

78
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,430
How could you make a decision
like that without consulting me?

79
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,200
But there's one condition.

80
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,200
This gallery is run
by the Kunhyang Association.

81
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,170
I want you to be its director.

82
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,740
Me?

83
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,620
Don't think I'll just do
whatever you tell me to.

84
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
You won't even take my scraps?

85
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,790
How disappointing.

86
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,190
Use me. Take full advantage of it.

87
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,230
Are you trying to protect me?
Or are you just trying to manage me?

88
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,530
Both.

89
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,370
I'll think about it.

90
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,440
You last longer in a position
you choose for yourself.

91
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,010
Take your time and think it over.

92
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Yes, Director Park.

93
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,620
Of course, we should meet.

94
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,560
Yes. Thank you for reaching out.

95
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,890
Yes, Managing Director Jung.
What's this about?

96
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,900
Director Park
and Executive Director Hong...

97
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,130
are meeting
with former Vice Chairman Han privately?

98
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,870
They'll discuss
the chairman position?

99
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,380
So they're planning to sideline me
and Chairman Jin?

100
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,850
Han Hye Ra.

101
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,420
You dare to move against me?

102
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,920
How could you?

103
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,590
Hye Ra.

104
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,090
You, of all people,
shouldn't have done this.

105
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,000
Look at me. Who do you think I am?

106
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Jin Tae Seok.

107
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,440
The Chairman of Kunhyang Group,

108
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,770
but you're about to be
the former chairman.

109
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,880
Have you forgotten how I loved you?

110
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,750
If it weren't for me,

111
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,680
you wouldn't even exist.

112
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,220
You groomed me.

113
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,650
Groomed?

114
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,860
I nurtured and cared for you.
I showered you with love.

115
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,300
Now you bite the hand that fed you.

116
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,600
That was obsession...

117
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,070
and possessiveness.

118
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,140
To you, I was just
a beautiful piece of furniture.

119
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,050
An accessory for you to show off.

120
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,450
Obsession and possessiveness
are forms of love.

121
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,020
What's wrong with wanting
to show off my woman to the world?

122
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,260
"Look, everyone. I, Jin Tae Seok,"

123
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,100
"am not just a ruthless businessman,
but a true romantic."

124
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,170
It helped your public image.

125
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,400
It wasn't just that. I meant it.

126
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,540
Even now,

127
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,070
you're the only one for me, Hye Ra.

128
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,180
You love yourself
more than you love me.

129
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,820
You doubt my love?

130
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,850
Is that why you're doing all this?

131
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,460
And you dragged Gong Nan Sook
into it?

132
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,560
Do you have any idea
how much you're hurting me?

133
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,000
You deserve to hurt more.

134
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,240
Compared to the pain
you put me through,

135
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,870
this is nothing.

136
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,770
What I did to Cha Ki Beom
and Cha Jung Won...

137
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,170
was all for you, Hye Ra.

138
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,140
For our future, I thought
it was best that they disappear.

139
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,050
That's what you wanted.

140
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,380
You've always been like that.

141
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,250
You decide everything on your own
and assume I'll want the same thing.

142
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,330
I never wanted Cha Ki Beom to die.

143
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,460
And especially not Jung Won!

144
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,230
Have you ever, even once,

145
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,240
bothered to look inside
and see the real me?

146
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,110
I always have.

147
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,340
I always put you before myself,
Hye Ra.

148
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,110
And what do you suppose
I'm thinking about now?

149
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,580
Jin Tae Seok.

150
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,390
I want to see you ruined
completely and utterly.

151
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,190
Your position.

152
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,030
I'm taking your seat outright.

153
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,260
I will no longer let you...

154
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,270
control my life
and the people I care about...

155
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,500
and treat us like
your personal puppets.

156
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,520
Se Hoon, when did you get here?
You haven't had lunch, have you?

157
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,820
What do you think you're doing?

158
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,860
How could you help
former Vice Chairman Han...

159
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,260
attack the Chairman?

160
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,660
Have you abandoned me?

161
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,130
Abandon? Don't be ridiculous.

162
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,470
How could I possibly abandon
my handsome, talented son-in-law?

163
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,970
Especially with our Young Chae
and A Reum to think about.

164
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,470
You're all talk.

165
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,010
Have you forgotten
why I agreed to marry Young Chae?

166
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,450
You promised to make me
the Vice Chairman.

167
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,680
There you go again, jumping the gun.

168
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,090
I'm only working with Han Hye Ra
for a bit.

169
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,290
What's with all the fuss?

170
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,660
Let's be honest with each other.

171
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,360
You want to be Kunhyang's chairman,
don't you?

172
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,700
Isn't that obvious?

173
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,800
So which side should you be on?

174
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,800
I can never turn my back
on Chairman Jin.

175
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,370
When will you be the Chairman?
After Jin Tae Seok dies?

176
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,510
In times like these,

177
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,010
even if you can't openly help
Han Hye Ra and me,

178
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,310
the smart thing to do is
take a step back...

179
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,350
and watch Jin Tae Seok fall
from a distance.

180
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,820
And then what?

181
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,150
Well, for a very brief moment,

182
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,720
Joo Ha Neul and Han Hye Ra
will have their moment in the sun.

183
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,230
Are you saying
former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra...

184
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,860
could actually become the Chairman?

185
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,430
Look at the big picture.

186
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,870
Don't just stare at the tree
in front of you.

187
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,500
Chairman for a few months?
What's the point of that?

188
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,440
I wouldn't take the job
if they begged me.

189
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,110
If you're going to be chairman,
it should be for a hundred years.

190
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,540
No, why stop at a hundred years?

191
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,150
Think about it.

192
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,650
You, A Reum, and their children...

193
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,920
For generations, the descendants
of Chairman Jin Se Hoon...

194
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,550
should inherit Kunhyang, right?

195
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,260
And that's your grand plan,
Chairman Gong?

196
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,330
That's "Mother" to you!

197
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,730
Do you want to bet my hand on it?

198
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,440
I'll throw in the other one
right now!

199
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,270
Go see Chairman Jin Tae Seok first.

200
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,570
Then...

201
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,740
we can talk again.

202
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,610
Are you leaving?

203
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,880
Darn it.

204
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,350
Did I bet my hands too soon?

205
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,760
Jin Tae Seok wants to see me?

206
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,990
His eyes must be blazing.
He must want to eat me alive.

207
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,060
I ought to just...

208
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,010
Why ask to see me?
This game's been over for a while.

209
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,580
So you're the one
pulling Hye Ra's strings?

210
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,480
You've got some nerve.
Do you have a death wish?

211
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,080
Such harsh language is my specialty,
not yours.

212
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,550
Just because you've been locked up
in this stuffy place for a bit,

213
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,420
you've completely lost your class.

214
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,860
Now, how should I get rid of you?

215
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,060
You think this is funny?

216
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,500
- Are you mocking me?
- Snap out of it, Chairman Jin.

217
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,000
It's already over for you.

218
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,340
Don't make me laugh.

219
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,410
I'm not Jin Tae Seok
if I go down like this.

220
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,010
- Then prove it.
- Prove what?

221
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,250
Walk out of here
and go crush Han Hye Ra.

222
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,990
Who knows?
I might even lend you my hand again.

223
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,930
Before Han Hye Ra,
I'll finish you first, Gong Nan Sook.

224
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,000
You know exactly what happens
to traitors, don't you?

225
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,700
Oh, I'm terrified. I'm shaking.

226
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,640
You should just worry about
getting out of here in 48 hours.

227
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,070
Jin Se Hoon will get me out.
No, wait.

228
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,270
Han Hye Ra will.

229
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,210
So...

230
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,480
why did you have to poke me?

231
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Especially when
I wasn't sleeping well.

232
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,220
You made me believe for 25 years
that I killed Joo Sang Cheol.

233
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,820
Were you just playing with me?

234
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,760
Ripping your mouth from ear to ear
wouldn't be enough.

235
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,230
Even if I tore you apart,
piece by piece, limb from limb,

236
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,130
and broke every bone in your body,
I still wouldn't be satisfied.

237
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You're laughing?

238
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,940
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

239
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,720
The only card I have
to rattle Gong Nan Sook...

240
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,150
is you, for now.

241
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,520
Besides,

242
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,590
Se Hoon,
there's something you don't know.

243
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,230
And that's why we must use her
and then cut her loose.

244
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,640
Se Hoon, the person who killed
your birth mother...

245
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,670
was Gong Nan Sook.

246
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,020
I can never forgive her.

247
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,550
Goodness.

248
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,050
You made me jump.

249
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,190
What's with that look?

250
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,260
I told you that wasn't good
for A Reum.

251
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,630
You...

252
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,730
Did you know?

253
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,030
Know what?

254
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,110
Later.

255
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,740
We'll talk about it later.

256
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,480
Are you mad at me
because of Ha Neul and my mom?

257
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,880
What Ha Neul did is nothing next to
what Chairman Gong Nan Sook did...

258
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,150
I need to
get my facts straight first.

259
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,550
I have to find out
if Gong Nan Sook...

260
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,590
is the one who killed my mother,
not Han Hye Ra.

261
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,490
I have to find that out first.

262
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,800
Se Hoon.

263
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,200
I just have a lot on my mind.

264
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,600
- We can talk more at home.
- But I need to talk to you now.

265
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,100
What is it?

266
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,470
Thanks for having me back
on Design Team.

267
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,910
But that's not enough.

268
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,210
Give me
my team leader position back.

269
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,380
That's up to Director Jin Se Mi
to decide.

270
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,950
But you can pull some strings
behind the scenes.

271
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,380
Try to earn it on your own merit.

272
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,120
If it doesn't work out,
then that's that.

273
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,640
Are you working late?

274
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,940
Does a director ever leave on time?
I'm swamped with work.

275
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,710
What do you have left?

276
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,420
Let me help you.

277
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,360
- Why?
- I was wondering how you felt...

278
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,630
when Cha Jung Won was pretending
to be your mother's daughter.

279
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,060
I was about to lose my mind.
I felt like she was taking my place.

280
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,370
I was furious and jealous.

281
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,170
So it wasn't just me.

282
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,210
Why do you say that?

283
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,780
Do you feel like Cha Jung Won...

284
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,410
has former Vice Chairman Han
all to herself?

285
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,880
It's not that.

286
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,150
Jung Won must be so precious
to her...

287
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,250
since Jung Won
came back from the dead.

288
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,320
If I were in her shoes,
I'd be really attached to Jung Won.

289
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,890
Oh my.

290
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,130
You're about to burst into tears.

291
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,830
I know exactly how you feel.

292
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,270
Although I was the one who asked
Cha Jung Won to pretend to be me...

293
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,070
Still,
that must have been infuriating.

294
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,440
It's not even like
she's taking my place,

295
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,910
but I find myself hating
Cha Jung Won more and more.

296
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,580
With my dad being arrested
and all...

297
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,650
Don't tell me...

298
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,220
my dad really pushed Cha Jung Won
off that rooftop.

299
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,160
Of course he didn't.

300
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,120
It's all Cha Jung Won's scheme.

301
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,560
From now on, you can rely on me.
I'll help you in any way I can.

302
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,540
That's okay.

303
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,110
Designer Joo Young Chae,
just stick to doing your job.

304
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,740
Give me back
the team leader position.

305
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,440
In return,
I'll show you concrete results.

306
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,380
I'll be your right-hand woman.

307
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,850
My right-hand woman?

308
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,990
To win back your mother's affection
and also win over Ha Neul,

309
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,020
I'll do whatever it takes
to help you.

310
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,600
Han Hye Ra.

311
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,040
Jin Se Hoon.

312
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,770
Why do I have a bad feeling
when I've made up my mind?

313
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,610
For Young Chae's sake,
siding with Se Hoon is right.

314
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,550
You can't pick Jin Se Hoon.

315
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,380
- What?
- You had...

316
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,220
Vice President Jin's mother...

317
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,290
killed... Remember?

318
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,990
Hey! Do you think
you're Chef Hong now?

319
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,030
How dare you speak of such secrets!
What if Se Hoon overhears you?

320
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,430
Secrets?

321
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,430
What can't Se Hoon find out?

322
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,430
Mom, don't tell me you did something
to Se Hoon again...

323
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,470
Then again,

324
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,140
you're openly pushing for Ha Neul
to be Vice Chairman,

325
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,880
and you blatantly
took Han Hye Ra's side.

326
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,010
You're even trying
to oust Chairman Jin.

327
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,710
The list of things you've done wrong
is endless.

328
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,280
- That's just the beginning.
- Manager Gu!

329
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,920
What in the world
has gotten into you today?

330
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,020
I didn't sleep well last night.
I guess I'm just tired.

331
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,160
Shut that trap of yours!

332
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,830
Dinner is ready.

333
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,700
Yes.

334
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,470
Goodness.

335
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,670
Young Chae,
why don't you stay for dinner?

336
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,310
I'm bloated and have no appetite.
I feel like I'm actually pregnant.

337
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,810
Did you even sleep with Se Hoon?

338
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,920
I don't know. He says it's risky
since I'm in my first trimester,

339
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,450
- so he won't even touch me.
- For heaven's sake. You fool.

340
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,660
I'm just going to eat. Move.

341
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,560
What's with Chef Hong lately?

342
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,400
Chairman Gong didn't even ask me
to have dinner.

343
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
I'll treat you to a meal.
Just the two of us.

344
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,070
In return,
just answer one question for me.

345
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,680
What did my mother do to Se Hoon?

346
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,010
You said ousting Jin Tae Seok
was just the beginning, right?

347
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,150
So what could she
have possibly done?

348
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,700
Young Chae is going to betray me?

349
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,370
- It can't be.
- Think of your actions, you wench.

350
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,810
Grandma, let's be real here
for a second.

351
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,940
The part where I said
I killed someone?

352
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,240
That was a total bluff.

353
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,950
Otherwise,
people wouldn't be scared of me.

354
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,280
No matter how hard I think,
I haven't done anything wrong.

355
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,550
You get jealous when others succeed.

356
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,320
Sure. I get jealous.

357
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,920
You love instigating fights
and get a kick out of it.

358
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,560
That part's true.
It's hilarious, isn't it?

359
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,560
- Did you kill Park Kyung Shin?
- Him?

360
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,470
Grandma, you only know what goes on
in this country, right?

361
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,240
You can't see what happens
overseas, can you?

362
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,840
Park Kyung Shin is a top model
in Milan right now.

363
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,340
I'm the one who made that happen.

364
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,540
I've already got my hands full.

365
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,980
I knew it. You've really
lost your touch, Grandma.

366
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,890
Oh my, he's really alive.

367
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,060
See? I told you.
I'm not that horrible of a person.

368
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,190
Gosh, I'm too cowardly
to commit murder.

369
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,400
- The thought is terrifying.
- You're the one...

370
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,060
who killed Jin Se Hoon's mother.

371
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,000
That thing?

372
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,100
That was just one little thing.
Just once.

373
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,870
That will be your downfall.

374
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,440
Why do you keep saying that?
You're really making me uneasy.

375
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,380
Jin Tae Seok made me do it.
I had no choice.

376
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,980
You always blame someone else.

377
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,280
You agreed to it.

378
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,850
I had to separate Jin Se Hoon
and that wench Cha Jung Won forever.

379
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,020
I'm telling you, I had no choice!
It was all Jin Tae Seok's idea.

380
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Would you like some more lettuce?

381
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,730
It's about
Vice President Jin Se Hoon's birth mother.

382
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,940
A doctor bribed
by Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

383
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,270
killed her.

384
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,850
If Se Hoon finds out,
he'll kick me out of Kunhyang.

385
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,790
What's wrong?

386
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,660
I'm so angry that I feel like
I'm going crazy.

387
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,900
Could you possibly be
as angry as I am?

388
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,770
I know...

389
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,710
who had your mother killed.

390
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,040
Young Chae, how do you know that?

391
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,140
I confirmed it myself.

392
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,150
Who is it?

393
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,780
It's not her, is it?

394
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,520
- Your mother, Gong Nan Sook...
- Yes.

395
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,990
Gong Nan Sook.

396
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,790
I thought Cha Jung Won
was the daughter...

397
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,160
of the woman who killed my mother.

398
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,230
It took everything I had
to cut her out of my life.

399
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,100
After that insane situation,
I barely managed to accept you.

400
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,030
And now this, again?

401
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,870
- Again?
- I'm not like Cha Jung Won.

402
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,940
You're still the daughter
of that woman who killed my mother.

403
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,080
I can disown my mom for you.

404
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
What?

405
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:32,050
From now on, I'm going to live
for you and our A Reum.

406
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,780
Okay?

407
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,150
I need some time to think.

408
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,860
Go stay with your mother
for a while.

409
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,590
What?

410
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,530
Se Hoon!

411
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,460
She offered you
the director position...

412
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,970
at the gallery
run by the Kunhyang Association?

413
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,600
I wonder what Kunhyang Association
really does.

414
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,070
And why would she
entrust that position to me?

415
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,880
Wives of high-ranking officials
and the top one percent ladies...

416
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,280
formed the Kunhyang Association.

417
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,580
They do volunteer work...

418
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,880
and give scholarships
to students in need.

419
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,750
They show art from unknown artists
at their gallery.

420
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,220
But behind the scenes,

421
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,220
it's for money laundering?

422
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,860
It's highly likely.

423
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,760
It's a front for
the Kunhyang Group's slush fund.

424
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,500
Former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
is the head,

425
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,360
and Chairman Gong Nan Sook
is a member too.

426
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,300
So, is former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra...

427
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,570
asking me to manage
the Kunhyang Group's slush fund?

428
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,870
Most likely.

429
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,140
And didn't she transfer five percent
of Kunhyang's shares to you?

430
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,210
If I accept it,

431
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,350
I'll become a major shareholder
in Kunhyang.

432
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,310
It's a double-edged sword.

433
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,650
If you take the position,
you'll have a direct window...

434
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,550
on Kunhyang's slush fund details
and how it's funneled...

435
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,690
One false move,

436
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,020
I could end up taking the fall
for everything.

437
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,890
It depends on
what former Vice Chairman Han...

438
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,630
and Chairman Gong decide.

439
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,400
To catch a tiger,
I have to enter the tiger's den.

440
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,340
Have you acquired more shares
of The Crown Capital?

441
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,040
Getting the last two percent
is proving to be difficult.

442
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,610
It's because Chairman Gong Nan Sook
holds so many of the shares.

443
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Ha Neul.

444
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,410
The one who actually killed
your father...

445
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,120
is Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

446
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,090
Will you still go after
Chairman Gong Nan Sook?

447
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,390
She's a loose cannon.

448
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,830
We have to use the stock
to keep a tight leash on her.

449
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,730
That's the only way we can steer her
in the direction we want.

450
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,230
I should get going.

451
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,270
I'll give you a ride.

452
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,940
It's okay. I can go on my own.

453
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,170
I just want to spend
a little more time with you.

454
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,480
You have such a warm voice.

455
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,780
That's why...

456
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,210
You like it?

457
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,420
Wait, you mean you like it, right?

458
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,090
Hey.

459
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,390
Was that your answer?
Is it just my voice you like?

460
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,270
As for
former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra,

461
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,570
you should meet with her often...

462
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,070
and talk things over with her.

463
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,350
You should clear up
any misunderstandings.

464
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,350
That's not easy.

465
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,680
Even if Jin Tae Seok is the culprit,

466
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,850
she's still involved
in my father's death.

467
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
And...

468
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,430
I feel like
I feel sorry for my father.

469
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
It's like...

470
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,600
I'm forgetting about his death, too.

471
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,500
Just one step at a time.

472
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,110
Go to her, nice and slow.

473
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,420
Give me your hand.

474
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,160
It's okay. It's too big.

475
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,930
You're right.

476
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,410
Come here.

477
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,040
Feel free to look around.

478
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,560
- It's perfect!
- It is.

479
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,090
- Try this on.
- Try this on.

480
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,570
Give me your hand.

481
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,310
It's beautiful, my dear Jung Won.

482
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,940
Yours, too, my dear Ha Neul.

483
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,710
- What?
- It's time to be more affectionate.

484
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,180
My dear Ha Neul.

485
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,120
If you and I were just
an ordinary couple,

486
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,920
this would be our happiest moment.

487
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,060
When...

488
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,460
will I be able
to make you truly happy?

489
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,500
Se Hoon! I told you,
I've disowned my mother.

490
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,410
Does that suddenly make you
not Gong Nan Sook's daughter?

491
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,740
I can't even stand to look at you
for a while.

492
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,410
- I'll be in touch.
- What about A Reum?

493
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,450
Even if I divorce you,

494
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,080
A Reum is going to be raised
by the Kunhyang Family.

495
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,850
What is all this commotion?

496
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,490
Mother, please,
you have to stop him.

497
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,890
He told me to go to my mom's house.

498
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,530
Why? Young Chae is pregnant.

499
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:49,400
- Se Hoon, what are you doing?
- Se Mi, you stay out of this!

500
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,970
Later.

501
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,840
I'll explain later, Mother.

502
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,450
Young Chae,
how did things get so bad?

503
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,080
Se Mi, please,
you have to stop your brother.

504
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,280
I've never seen him look
that angry before.

505
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,820
Mom, you have to do something.

506
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,320
Do you really think Se Hoon
will listen to me right now?

507
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,090
Are you really just going to
let him kick me out?

508
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,530
What? You're telling me Se Hoon
sent Young Chae back home?

509
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:29,640
Yes, it seems you'll have to
look after Young Chae for a while.

510
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,010
How could you throw her out
so easily...

511
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,410
when she's carrying the heir
to Kunhyang?

512
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,650
Did you do something
to anger Se Hoon?

513
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
Did I do something?

514
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,390
Let me see...

515
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,860
You mean that I stopped
backing Se Hoon...

516
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,330
and supported Joo Ha Neul
for the vice chairman position?

517
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,260
Or that I teamed up with you...

518
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,530
and completely ruined
Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

519
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,830
I don't believe that's it.

520
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,400
Jin Se Hoon...

521
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,870
He's such a pain in the neck.
My neck is killing me!

522
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,040
That aside,

523
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,750
we're proceeding
with the board meeting as planned.

524
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,850
Of course, we should.

525
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,680
Since you're unpredictable,

526
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,920
I was worried you might have changed
your mind.

527
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,560
The die is cast.
I'm all in this time.

528
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,590
Jin Tae Seok has been
jerking me around for years.

529
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,200
It's time I made him pay dearly.

530
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,530
Good. I'm counting on you, then.

531
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,140
The nerve of her to talk tough
after just watching Young Chae...

532
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,240
get kicked out.

533
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
Oh my!

534
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,650
You got kicked out at lightspeed?

535
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,350
This is all your fault, Mom!

536
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,360
Hey, stop crying
and tell me what happened.

537
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,830
Why is Se Hoon so furious with me?

538
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,360
You killed his birth mother!

539
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,030
How could he have found out?

540
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,000
How am I supposed to know?

541
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,070
You! Did you run your mouth?

542
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,880
I don't know
what you're talking about.

543
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,480
I swear, I didn't say a word.

544
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,690
Then who in the world
snitched to Jin Se Hoon?

545
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,990
Don't tell me it was Jin Tae Seok.

546
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,330
We have the data...

547
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,100
from Cha Jung Won's phone
from the rooftop incident.

548
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,800
Can I check it now?

549
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,810
Hye Ra killed your father.

550
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,410
Actually, it might just be easier
for you to believe that.

551
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,220
Are you saying Han Hye Ra
wasn't the one who did it?

552
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,750
- You want to know?
- Tell me the truth.

553
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,350
Was it you?

554
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,020
That's right.
Cha Ki Beom was very much alive.

555
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,590
They say people cling to life.

556
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,930
After he fell and his head bled,
he was still alive.

557
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,340
Do you have any idea
how terrified I was?

558
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,810
On Jung Won's phone,

559
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,640
there was a recording
of Jin Tae Seok's confession.

560
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,880
Jin Tae Seok.

561
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
I got you.

562
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,320
There's no evidence.

563
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,960
I'll be out of here by tomorrow.

564
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,530
This is decisive evidence.

565
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,840
What are you going to do with it?

566
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,110
I'm going to use it, of course.

567
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,120
(A Graceful Liar)

568
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,510
