1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,270
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,180
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,320
What do you think you're doing?

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,950
What? My Su A died?

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,490
In a car accident?

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,320
You're her father,

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,590
so how could you lie that our child
died in such a gruesome way?

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,030
How could you?

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,230
Young Sun, that's enough.

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,400
My daughter Jung Won died
in a car accident.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,070
- Is that true?
- Mi Hyang's daughter, Jung Won.

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,080
When she was seven...

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,380
Then what about our Su A?

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,950
She's alive.

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,320
Things are about to get messy.

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,520
It was the only way to break...

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,820
this cruel twist of fate.

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,030
How can you sever the sacred bond
between a parent and child?

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,700
- You think you can break that bond?
- Your greed is what broke it.

21
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,470
- That sacred bond.
- Greed?

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,040
You're right.

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,240
Right, my greed wasn't for you.
But it was for my daughter, Su A!

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,610
More than caring about you
being framed for murder,

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,350
I couldn't let my daughter Su A
live as a murderer's daughter.

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,150
I couldn't let her be scorned
forever as a murderer's daughter.

27
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,820
What's the point of saying that now?

28
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,860
Do you have any idea
how much Su A has suffered?

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,330
She painfully resented you,
and yet still longed for you.

30
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,830
All that built-up resentment, anger,
and all the difficult years,

31
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,730
I want to make it all up to her.

32
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,640
I want to give our Su A
the finest clothes and food.

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,570
I want her to live
her whole life smiling brightly.

34
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,980
Please let me see her, Ki Beom!
Why are you keeping her from me?

35
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,310
As long as Jin Tae Seok is alive,
it's never going to happen!

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,720
Is he the one stopping you?

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,190
Did he threaten you if I met Su A?

38
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,190
Don't you dare say his name
in front of me!

39
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,360
I will never let Su A be in danger.

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,590
- Even if it's Jin Tae Seok.
- You can't stop him.

41
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,060
The more desperately
you search for her,

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,270
the more danger
you'll put our Su A in.

43
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,200
Sometimes, a mother's love
means staying away!

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Cha Jung Won...

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,210
You said Cha Jung Won
is Mi Hyang's daughter, right?

46
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,310
Is that girl our Su A?

47
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,420
Jung Won is not your daughter.
She is my daughter.

48
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,120
- But your daughter's dead!
- She's adopted.

49
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,730
After I lost my Jung Won,
the pain was so unbearable,

50
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,590
so I adopted a girl...

51
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,300
from an orphanage
who looked just like her.

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,330
Does Cha Jung Won know
that she's adopted?

53
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,510
No, Jung Won has no idea.

54
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,610
Then, did our Su A...

55
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,740
grow up with Cha Jung Won?

56
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,850
That's enough!

57
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,760
She storms out on me...

58
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,620
and runs straight to
Cha Ki Beom's house?

59
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,300
They're not meeting alone.
Jo Mi Hyang is there as well.

60
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,570
Please calm down, sir.

61
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,470
(Episode 33)

62
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,450
Find that girl, Su A.

63
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,950
Before Vice Chairman Han finds her.

64
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,690
I'll get right on it, sir.

65
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,090
Han Hye Ra had a child?

66
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,130
And she's alive?

67
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,500
Su A.

68
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,400
Got it. Keep me posted.

69
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,980
So the music box was
about that child all along?

70
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,810
Well, the plot thickens.

71
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,660
Su A got married and went
to the US to study.

72
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,470
Where in the US?

73
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,770
- LA.
- New York.

74
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
LA or New York?

75
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,570
You should...

76
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,680
just be grateful
that Su A is alive.

77
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,210
For the rest of your life.

78
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,750
Just don't come here anymore.

79
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,280
Let us have some peace.
Seriously, this is killing us.

80
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,030
They're lying.

81
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,560
She's close by.

82
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,860
When it comes to Vice Chairman
Han Hye Ra's days as an artist,

83
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,130
I know more than any other reporter.

84
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,640
Did you write this yourself?

85
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,940
("From Artist to Curator,
Grace Han's New Direction")

86
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,010
You're the daughter-in-law
of Kunhyang Group.

87
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,650
But why are you curious about
old articles on your mother-in-law?

88
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,350
Don't even think about
crossing the line.

89
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,890
(Power Off)

90
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,560
And no secretly recording me, either.

91
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,060
- That's classic Joo Young Chae.
- I need the files from back then.

92
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,930
That was a very long time ago.
It'll take some time to find them.

93
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll make it worth your while.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,710
Money isn't enough to sway me.

95
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,010
The deepest secrets
of the Kunhyang Group.

96
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,140
I'll give them exclusively to you,
Reporter Ma.

97
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,410
Be quick about it.

98
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,760
Would she believe Su A got married
and moved to the US?

99
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,400
I don't care
if she believes it or not.

100
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,730
What right does she have
to show up now,

101
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,830
faking all this motherly love?

102
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,640
Young Sun should've been an actress.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,410
- Hearing her was heartbreaking.
- Enough.

104
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,180
I'm losing my appetite.

105
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,680
Okay. I'll stop.

106
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,220
If Young Sun finds out that
Jung Won is her real daughter, Su A,

107
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,320
and that Jung Won
is just a fake Joo Young Chae...

108
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,820
posing as her daughter-in-law...

109
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,890
Jung Won. What are you doing here
without calling first?

110
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,700
Who's that?

111
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,560
This is my friend, Joo Young Chae.

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,570
You know her, Dad.

113
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Joo Young Chae?

114
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,370
What are you up to?

115
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,840
How am I supposed to live here?

116
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,980
Why should that friend of yours
live in our house?

117
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,390
It's so cramped.

118
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,660
There's not a single decent piece
of furniture.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,170
There isn't even a bed?

120
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,570
How can anyone possibly live here?

121
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,910
You know I stayed with Young Chae...

122
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,240
before I got my own place
near where I worked, right?

123
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,580
It's my turn to repay that favor.

124
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,420
Do you have to let her live with us
to repay the favor?

125
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,150
It's a complicated situation.

126
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,220
She's a daughter
of a wealthy family.

127
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,690
Why would she need to stay here?
She won't even last a day.

128
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,230
A day? She won't make it half a day.
No, she'll run off within the hour.

129
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,730
I just returned all that money.
Why bring this troublemaker home?

130
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,370
I told you before that...

131
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,870
Young Chae fled the country
with the man she loved.

132
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,680
I guess her mom
still hasn't gotten over it.

133
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,310
She cut her off and sold her house.

134
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,080
So she's completely broke.

135
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,520
Your friend's mom, Gong Nan Sook,
is so shameless.

136
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,060
I wouldn't put it past that woman.

137
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,230
Then isn't she CEO Joo Ha Neul's
little sister?

138
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,790
That's right.

139
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,360
Does your friend know about me
and CEO Joo Ha Neul's father?

140
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,700
- How could she possibly not know?
- They're not biological siblings.

141
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,170
Does she know you once posed as her
to marry a rich heir?

142
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
She knows.

143
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,310
Dad.

144
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,520
My relationship with Young Chae
is complicated.

145
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,320
But I want to help her.

146
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,560
This is just how I feel right now.

147
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,830
This will only be temporary.

148
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,060
Tell her to find
somewhere else to stay soon.

149
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,530
Thanks, Dad.

150
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,200
If your dad's fine with it,
then I'll wash my hands of it.

151
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,980
She'll treat your friend
even better than I will.

152
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,150
Dad, I have to go.
Something urgent came up.

153
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,660
Seriously... Darn it.

154
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,030
What do you think you're doing,

155
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,160
touching things
in someone else's room?

156
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,060
I picked those out
and bought them myself.

157
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,630
- No wonder they're so tacky.
- What did you say, you little brat?

158
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,970
What can I do? I'll just have
to change it all to suit my taste.

159
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,070
Knock it off.

160
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,070
In this house, every room
reflects Jo Mi Hyang's taste.

161
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,480
What? What's going on in here?

162
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,810
What's with all the clothes?
Are you using them as a pillow?

163
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,080
- Sir.
- Call him Jung Won's father.

164
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,590
It's just that
I grew up without a father.

165
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,560
Jung Won's father...

166
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,960
It feels weird.
How about I just call you "Sir?"

167
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,230
Deal?

168
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,130
Sir.

169
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,200
I have to have a bed.
I can't sleep on the floor.

170
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,370
Are you here on vacation?
You're in no place to make demands.

171
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,740
I'll be paying my rent on time.

172
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,040
If anyone's freeloading,
it's Jung Won.

173
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,440
All right, fine! I'll get you a bed.

174
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,780
Good grief, what a headache.

175
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,520
So Young Chae
is at your parents' house?

176
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,690
And she actually pulled it off?

177
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,530
But she can't stay for long.
If Young Chae suddenly goes rogue,

178
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,530
she'll expose that I married
into the Kunhyang family under her name.

179
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,830
To my dad.

180
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,100
If Young Chae decides
to drop that bombshell,

181
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,710
you'll have to be the one
to shut Cha Ki Beom up.

182
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,910
As for the rest...

183
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,610
But who's going
to believe her anyway?

184
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,680
Not when you have me
completely in your corner.

185
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,250
Who's Su A?

186
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,960
So Han Hye Ra had another daughter.

187
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,660
She's not Jin Tae Seok's
biological daughter, is she?

188
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,370
How am I supposed to know?

189
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,370
Right. Of course you wouldn't know.

190
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,540
But I have this strange feeling.

191
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,110
You know that music box
you cherish so much.

192
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,820
I have a feeling Han Hye Ra
bought it for that girl, Su A.

193
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,390
Did Young Chae say it was mine?

194
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,390
Is she wrong?

195
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,900
Well, I do have it with me now,

196
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,000
but my memory
from back then is hazy,

197
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,900
so I don't know
how it ended up with me.

198
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,800
You don't think...

199
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm Han Hye Ra's secret daughter,
do you?

200
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,080
How would I know?

201
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,380
If I knew things like that,

202
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,010
why would I be a loan shark?

203
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,250
I'd be a professional psychic.
Wouldn't I?

204
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,290
(Kunhyang Group)

205
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,190
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

206
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,660
Have you eaten lunch?

207
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,870
I don't have an appetite.

208
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,240
- Should I order some porridge?
- I'll get something myself later.

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,070
I'm sorry about yesterday.

210
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,610
Su A is alive.

211
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,110
I've confirmed it.

212
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,980
Is that what Cha Ki Beom told you?

213
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,020
But why wasn’t she found?

214
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,390
That's what I'd like to know.

215
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,990
After all that time
we spent looking,

216
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,100
but I guess there were some things
even Kunhyang Group couldn't do.

217
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,500
It sounds like you think
I deliberately didn't find her.

218
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,640
Where is Su A?

219
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,270
Have you arranged to meet her?

220
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,240
I was told she got married
and went abroad to study.

221
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,750
That's a lie.

222
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,950
I'll find her. Just give me time.

223
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,080
Stay out of it.

224
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,120
From now on,

225
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,090
I'll find her myself.

226
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,270
Should I report on the new members
for the Design Team later?

227
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,670
No, go ahead. I'm curious too.

228
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,610
Why is Ahn Ji Na's name on here?

229
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,480
You think Jin Se Mi...

230
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,480
- will get you a designer position?
- Yes.

231
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,890
We were almost sisters-in-law.

232
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,420
- That makes us pretty close.
- You're still not over Jin Se Hoon?

233
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,620
I was going to come through for you.

234
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,190
And I'm supposed to believe you?

235
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,700
I don't even know if you are
Cha Jung Won or Joo Young Chae.

236
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,830
Ahn Ji Na.

237
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,870
Does it matter to you who I am?

238
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,970
Let me say this again.
I am Joo Young Chae,

239
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,170
- but now, I must be Cha Jung Won.
- What are you talking about?

240
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,780
Who's forcing you to be?

241
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,510
So you really are Cha Jung Won.

242
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,480
Whether you believe me or not,
we're on the same boat.

243
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,450
The same boat? Really?

244
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,690
But...

245
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
you haven't accomplished
a single thing.

246
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,890
You're all talk.

247
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,560
Why did Se Mi like your proposal?

248
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,030
That's because...

249
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,330
I'm a talented designer
with a proven track record?

250
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,370
I'm the one who asked Ha Neul.

251
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,670
You mean, Joo Ha Neul?

252
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,940
Joo Young Chae's brother?

253
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,120
Se Mi swore she'd never get married,

254
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,490
but she said she would
if it were Joo Ha Neul.

255
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,460
And Ha Neul
would do anything for me.

256
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,500
Joo Young Chae.

257
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,200
She won first place
in Kunhyang's blind recruitment.

258
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,740
She created a street art installation
in downtown Seoul.

259
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,570
It became so popular
and is now a prime date spot.

260
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,010
Kim Sung Hee.

261
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,210
Manager of Personal Shopper Room
at Kunhyang's Luxury Goods Section.

262
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,080
She's named top sales associate
for luxury brands.

263
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,080
She excels at personal styling
and analyzing customer habits.

264
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,580
And finally,

265
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,320
Ahn Ji Na.

266
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,820
She worked with designers
in Soho, New York.

267
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,990
She gained recognition for planning
and presenting Ji Na's Collection.

268
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,760
I understand your choices
of Joo Young Chae and Kim Sung Hee.

269
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,200
But why Ahn Ji Na, Director Jin?

270
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,870
Allow me to explain the key points
behind my recommendations.

271
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,710
My main focus
was on renewing the brand.

272
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,150
Above all, I chose designers
with a modern, trendy style.

273
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,950
And you're saying Ahn Ji Na
is a trendy designer?

274
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,550
Right. She's worked with designers
in Soho, New York.

275
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,190
And earlier this year,
she presented Ji Na's Collection.

276
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,790
- Ji Na's Collection? Her solo show?
- Yes.

277
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,260
Her skills are undeniable.

278
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,100
Are you sure that's a good idea?
It's awkward between our families.

279
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,000
If she's good, I believe in keeping
personal feelings from work.

280
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,300
And do you think Ahn Ji Na...

281
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,070
will accept our offer?

282
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,810
She might feel uncomfortable
clashing with Vice President Jin?

283
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,450
Ahn Ji Na agreed,
if you two approve.

284
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,950
What?

285
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,820
I guess we'll find out soon enough
if you were telling the truth.

286
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,420
I've invited a surprise guest.

287
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,230
Jin Se Mi? You invited her?

288
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,830
I said she and I are close.

289
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,170
Sorry, I was just briefing
the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

290
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,500
How did it go?

291
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,610
It will all be good
once they approve.

292
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,010
Aren't you going to introduce us?

293
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,050
This is Director Jin Se Mi
from Kunhyang Fashion.

294
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,420
This isn't the first time we've met,
is it?

295
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,490
- A few times at parties, maybe?
- Yes, I've seen you around.

296
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,420
Though we've never been
formally introduced.

297
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,460
I'm Cha Jung Won.

298
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,730
Cha...

299
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,690
Jung Won?

300
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,060
My sister-in-law's friend?

301
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,170
No, I mean, are you the one
who made her life miserable?

302
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,770
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

303
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
My goodness.

304
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,580
Let me go clean this up.

305
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,150
First of all, let me get
something straight.

306
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,260
I have nothing to do
with CEO Joo Ha Neul.

307
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,490
That's a relief.

308
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,300
And what about you
impersonating my sister-in-law?

309
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,070
It's a bit of a long story,

310
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,710
and I tend to only open up
to really close friends.

311
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,440
So let's get to know each other.

312
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,880
You've known my sister-in-law
since high school, right?

313
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,450
By any chance,

314
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,720
do you know someone named Su A?

315
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,690
Su A?

316
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,030
I heard the music box
my sister-in-law had...

317
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,590
was originally Su A's.

318
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,000
And I thought you
and Su A were close.

319
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,030
Wait, you really don't know her?

320
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,510
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

321
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,650
You're saying Han Hye Ra gave it
to a child she had...

322
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,490
before she met Jin Tae Seok?

323
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,320
I mean, Cha Jung Won's music box.

324
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,590
Manager Gu.

325
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,160
Don't you have anything
that comes to mind?

326
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,430
Nothing seems to come to mind.

327
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,830
I'd have better luck
talking to a wall.

328
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,200
I'm better off not thinking at all.

329
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,970
That's my secret to staying young.

330
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,010
Exactly. That's why I like you.
You're young and know your place.

331
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,510
I'm honored.
What do you need me to do?

332
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,690
Dig meticulously
into Han Hye Ra's past.

333
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,420
From a single strand of hair...

334
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,020
to every dust speck on her shoes.
I want you to dig into everything!

335
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,830
- For example?
- I might as well be your secretary.

336
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,400
Just tell me. From top to bottom.

337
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,440
All right, look.

338
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,670
Jin Tae Seok's first love
was Han Hye Ra.

339
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,980
Han Hye Ra replaced Se Hoon's mother
and joined the Kunhyang family.

340
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,210
Then she quickly became
the vice chairman.

341
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,980
Chairman Jin Tae Seok is
still completely in love with her.

342
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,450
In other words, the real power
behind the Kunhyang family is...

343
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,520
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra.

344
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,820
Okay, so?

345
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,890
I don't want secrets everyone knows.
I want something else.

346
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,030
Like if there were any other men
before she met Jin Tae Seok,

347
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,770
or if she secretly had
another child somewhere.

348
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,340
But you just said she had a child.

349
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,140
You fool! Bring me proof!

350
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,410
- Yes, ma'am!
- Get out!

351
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,620
If the proof isn't found,

352
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,460
I'll just have to make some.

353
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,230
Se Hoon.

354
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,070
I think Mom has another daughter.

355
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,770
- What?
- I heard it with my own ears.

356
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,070
Her name is Su A.

357
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,420
I was just about to call you.

358
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,890
We must be in sync.

359
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,190
What's wrong?
Is something bothering you?

360
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,960
- Was Mom giving you trouble again?
- No, I'm just hungry.

361
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,860
What?

362
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,230
Come on.
Let's go get something good to eat.

363
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,310
I said we should go somewhere nicer.

364
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,310
Kunhyang's food is the best.
You're the best cook in the world.

365
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,320
You always say the sweetest things.

366
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,050
Tell me. What's on your mind?

367
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,050
It's nothing.

368
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,760
Two hearts that beat as one.
No secrets, remember?

369
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,160
I can't believe I let Se Mi's words
get to me so much.

370
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,400
I'm being such a selfish son.

371
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,330
Is this about your parents?

372
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,610
I think, before my mother
married my father,

373
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,010
she may have had a daughter.

374
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,340
I'm not sure, though.

375
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,350
And if it's true?

376
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,080
Why are you being like this?
You're starting to scare me.

377
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,120
I'm scaring you? Why?

378
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,060
Why are you looking at me like that?

379
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,020
- You're making it worse.
- Is that really so scary?

380
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,860
One out of every three couples
gets divorced these days.

381
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,760
And blended families
aren't exactly rare.

382
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,870
I wanted to believe my mother
was the most virtuous woman alive,

383
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,300
completely worthy of
my father's love.

384
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,110
I mean, she had to be
completely flawless as my mother.

385
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,280
I guess that's
what I wanted to believe.

386
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,580
So if she had another man's child,
that makes her tainted?

387
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,180
Unworthy of being the wife
of Kunhyang Group's chairman?

388
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,720
And a terrible flaw for the mother
of the chairman's successor?

389
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,760
I'm a real piece of work.
I admit it.

390
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,790
That's my Jin Se Hoon.
You're so honest and pure.

391
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,300
You admit you're wrong right away.
I love that.

392
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,900
Now you sound like
my Joo Young Chae again.

393
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,170
Take good care of your mother.

394
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,170
Go work out with her
and take walks together.

395
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,550
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

396
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,890
Se Mi.

397
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,060
Ha Neul.

398
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,660
Can't you just be
a little nicer to me?

399
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,370
- What?
- I have no one left to trust.

400
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,070
Not even my own mother,
whom I love most in the world...

401
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,480
and respect the most.

402
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,650
What's wrong? Did something happen?

403
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,120
My mother...

404
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,550
apparently has another daughter
besides me.

405
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,620
What do I do?

406
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,830
Se Mi.

407
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,130
Vice Chairman Han has a daughter?

408
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,370
Come here, have a seat.

409
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,700
Are you sure you didn't hear wrong?

410
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
Su A.

411
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,850
So I guess her name
is going to be Jin Su A now?

412
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,050
Su A?

413
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,650
Su A?

414
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,190
Hey.

415
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,190
Don't you live with Cha Ki Beom?
Why do you keep popping in?

416
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,560
What if someone sees you?

417
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,600
- I said something urgent came up.
- What's so urgent?

418
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,830
Apparently, Cha Jung Won's music box
belonged to a kid named Su A.

419
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,170
What's Jung Won's link to Su A?

420
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,970
Jung Won could be Su A.

421
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,870
If that's true, she's probably
Han Hye Ra's daughter.

422
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,640
What? No way.

423
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,850
Never say never.

424
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,780
We have to make the first move
before they figure things out.

425
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,480
Shouldn't we confirm it first?

426
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,020
- Of course. You do it.
- How?

427
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,920
Figure it out. You have to think
of something brilliant.

428
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,320
But what if she really is
her daughter?

429
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,460
Forget the truth. It means nothing.

430
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
What are you plotting?

431
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,570
Curious? Take a guess.

432
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,170
Are you scheming to use me again?

433
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,900
I must be crazy, coming to warn you
so you don't get blindsided.

434
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,940
Handle it.
And make it an A-plus job.

435
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,330
Here's a little scoop for you.

436
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,330
(Reporter Ma Sang Ki)

437
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,900
Grace Han's art style is identical
to that of a disappeared artist.

438
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,670
There was an article about it back then,
but my editor killed it.

439
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,100
"The Vanished Artist, Hwang Mi Soo,"

440
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,010
"and Strange Parallels
with Grace Han."

441
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:40,980
"Artist Han Hye Ra's style
is drawing comparisons..."

442
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,550
"to Hwang Mi Soo, who suddenly
vanished from New York's art scene."

443
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,550
"Hwang Mi Soo was
a prolific artist,"

444
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,020
"but all traces of her vanished
in the early 2000s."

445
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,690
"Some are even claiming that
Hwang Mi Soo's works..."

446
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,230
"are identical to those
of Han Hye Ra."

(The Vanished Artist, Hwang Mi Soo,
and Strange Parallels with Grace Han)

00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Where did she go?

449
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,740
Grace Han?

450
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,010
Are you an even bigger fraud
than I am?

451
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,350
When you learn
that the daughter you left...

452
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,520
is now your daughter-in-law,

453
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,490
will you still be able to wear...

454
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,260
that same beautiful, gentle smile?

455
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,340

Se Mi is quite taken with
Joo Ha Neul, isn't she?

458
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,820
Someone of Joo Ha Neul's caliber
wouldn't be a bad match for her.

459

Jin Se Mi has a thing
for Joo Ha Neul?

Looks like the skies
are on my side after all.

00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,160
Joo Young Chae has more than enough
involvement with that family.

462
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,570
You remind me of my mother
who left me when I was seven.

463
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,340
She said she'd be right back.

464
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,270
I need to find out
if Cha Jung Won is Su A.

465
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,070
She will soon find out
who I really am.

466
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,040
And I'll make her regret it dearly.

467
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,010
You know who Su A is,
don't you, Chairman Jin?

468
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,180
You never miss a thing.
