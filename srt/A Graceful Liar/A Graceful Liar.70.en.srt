1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,870
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,440
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,310
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,580
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,350
What on earth did Jin Tae Seok do?

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,360
The person who pushed Jung Won
off the rooftop...

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,860
was Jin Tae Seok.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,840
He's a monster.

9
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,070
Young Sun,
you need to pull yourself together.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,980
Unless you want to lose the daughter
you just found after 25 years.

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,050
Let's talk outside.

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,860
Chairman Jin Tae Seok
pushed Jung Won?

13
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,460
Where did you hear that?

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,730
- I just know.
- Mi Hyang, this is serious.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,040
It's incredibly dangerous.
For you, for me... No.

16
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,040
Above all,
it puts Jung Won in greater danger.

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,110
Let me ask you one thing.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,980
You are Jung Won's birth mother,
aren't you?

19
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,090
Our relationship may be
a twisted mess now,

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,690
but you...

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,490
don't want her to die, do you?

22
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,830
Mi Hyang.

23
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,670
How could I ever want something bad
to happen to Jung Won?

24
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,370
You're right.
I don't deserve to be a mother.

25
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,210
But anyone who tries
to harm our Jung Won,

26
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,280
I won't let them get away with it!

27
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,780
Even if it's Jin Tae Seok?

28
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,050
Yes.

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
How?

30
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,050
I need to know the truth first.

31
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,690
That Jin Tae Seok pushed Jung Won.

32
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,130
Who told you that?

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,370
I did.

34
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,140
- Is that true?
- It is.

35
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,540
I didn't witness it myself, though.

36
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,380
I shouldn't have just pushed her.

37
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,650
I should have finished the job.

38
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,160
I heard him say it
with my own two ears.

39
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,660
Killing him is letting him off easy.

40
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,160
We need concrete proof.

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,300
An eyewitness or video footage.

42
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,670
I'll look for it.

43
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,540
Manager Hwang,
I need a private word with you.

44
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,260
It was something
you were supposed to do,

45
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,430
but I held the press conference
in your place.

46
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,770
I'm sure former Vice Chairman Han
will take a hit too.

47
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,440
So will Jin Tae Seok
and Gong Nan Sook.

48
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,340
They'll get what they deserve.

49
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,310
Jung Won... No.

50
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,780
My dear Jung Won.

51
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,490
I can call you that, right?

52
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,560
Did you just smile?

53
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,330
You did, right?

54
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,400
Jung Won, hurry and wake up.

55
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,510
We need to get
our revenge properly, together.

56
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,750
And stop running away from me.

57
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,320
Let's finally
love each other for real.

58
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,920
I know you love me too, you idiot.

59
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,170
So can I trust that
you're on my side now?

60
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,270
Yes, you can.

61
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,810
If Chairman Jin Tae Seok finds out,
he won't let you get away with this.

62
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,340
I'm prepared for the consequences.

63
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,820
Even with you two helping,

64
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,690
and Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul
lending his support,

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,790
we're still not strong enough
to take on Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

66
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,500
We have to get...

67
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,170
Chairman Gong Nan Sook on our side.

68
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
She trusts
Vice Chairman Joo implicitly.

69
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,940
I mean Chairman Gong.

70
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,040
That alone isn't enough to wage
an all-out war with Jin Tae Seok.

71
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,040
We need leverage
to convince Gong Nan Sook...

72
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,910
that Jin Tae Seok is her enemy.

73
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,150
Do I really need to leave as well?

74
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,320
I don't want to drag you into this,
Secretary Yoon.

75
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,990
Min Jung.

76
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,230
What could we possibly
need to discuss alone?

77
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,180
You should've taken Gong Nan Sook
down sooner...

78
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,240
if you didn't want to die
like a dog.

79
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,880
He's still alive.

80
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,290
So the one who killed
Joo Sang Cheol...

81
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,690
was Jin Tae Seok,

82
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,730
- not Gong Nan Sook?
- I was there.

83
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,560
I was so shocked,
I started recording.

84
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,230
If Chairman Gong Nan Sook
learns the truth,

85
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,070
things will definitely change.

86
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,990
How did you get this?

87
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,220
- Were you there?
- That's not important right now.

88
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,030
Or did someone send you this video?

89
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,260
That means there was a witness.

90
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,240
- Who was it?
- That's not the point, Father.

91
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,010
- What?
- Father, I'm blackmailing you.

92
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,210
What did you just say?

93
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,510
Go on, then. Let's hear your threat.

94
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,920
Remove Joo Ha Neul
as interim Vice Chairman.

95
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,050
- Effective immediately.
- And I'm to put you in his place?

96
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,850
I want
the official Vice Chairman position.

97
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,890
And if I refuse?

98
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Why are you even asking?

99
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,230
It's simple math, isn't it?

100
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,690
If you don't accept my offer,

101
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,300
I'll leak that video.

102
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,840
Is that any way for a son
to speak to his father?

103
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,340
You're the one who taught me.

104
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,310
"Keep business
and personal matters separate."

105
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,410
"Don't let family or blood ties
get in the way."

106
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,250
You're even more ungrateful
than Joo Ha Neul.

107
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,890
Especially after I took you in
as my son.

108
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,020
What do you mean you took me in?

109
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,060
- What do you mean?
- Just shut it and get out.

110
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,030
I'm not leaving
until I get a clear answer.

111
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,070
I'll consider it.

112
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,570
Don't take too long.
I'm not very patient.

113
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
How dare he...

114
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,850
blackmail me, his father?

115
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,750
That little jerk.

116
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,850
Who sent that video...

117
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,890
to Se Hoon?

118
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,430
I should've known better than
to take in an ungrateful human.

119
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,730
I dug my own grave.

120
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,580
Everything will work out.

121
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,780
Se Hoon...

122
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,550
you'll be Kunhyang's Vice Chairman,

123
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,090
and then Chairman.

124
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,930
I'll make sure of it.

125
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,140
You're not drinking in the annex?

126
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,280
It feels wrong to drink
in front of A Reum.

127
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,150
You...

128
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,380
really do care about A Reum,
don't you?

129
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,520
I wonder when you'll feel that way
about me.

130
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,320
Young Chae.

131
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,830
I know you're trying so hard for me.

132
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,230
And that you gave me the video
for my sake.

133
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,170
- Aren't you grateful?
- I feel bad for you.

134
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,570
You already have everything.

135
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,310
Why are you so desperate
to marry into the Kunhyang family...

136
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,110
when I don't even
treat you properly?

137
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,980
- Why go to such lengths for me?
- I wonder that myself.

138
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,320
Even without you,
I could get away from Madam Gong,

139
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,290
and I could meet a man who likes me,
and date or even marry him.

140
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,220
So why...

141
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,490
does it have to be you?

142
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,100
Because I was with Cha Jung Won?
You wanted to steal me from her.

143
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,600
I can't say that's not part of it.

144
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,870
But more important than that,

145
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,370
I thought I was only half-serious,
but now I realize.

146
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
I...

147
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,380
think I've really fallen for you.

148
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,950
- What?
- It'll take time,

149
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,450
but I hope you get over her
and finally see me.

150
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,420
You're really something else.

151
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,460
This is exactly why I said
I feel sorry for you.

152
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,170
Just open your heart to me
bit by bit.

153
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,710
Young Chae filmed the video?

154
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,350
Father, you asked for me?

155
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,820
It was you?

156
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,330
You dared to film that on the roof?

157
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,840
You must have seen everything I did.

158
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,840
I even pushed Han Hye Ra's daughter,

159
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,180
so what do you think I'll do to you?

160
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,450
Please spare my life, Father!

161
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,050
I was to meet Cha Jung Won there.
I saw it completely by chance.

162
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,680
Fine, that's possible.

163
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,030
But then why did you record it?
To blackmail me again?

164
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,530
If this video gets out,

165
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,560
Vice Chairman Han,
the person you love the most,

166
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,170
will be ruined.
And at the same time,

167
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,900
Kunhyang's name will be ruined.

168
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,370
This is blackmail, isn't it?

169
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,340
Let's call it a deal.

170
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,880
If Gong Nan Sook
hadn't come back then,

171
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,340
no telling
what I'd have done to you.

172
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,180
But it's not my fault I was there.

173
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,990
Filming it was pure instinct.

174
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,590
I would have done the same.
The problem is...

175
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,360
that you manipulated Se Hoon
into daring to blackmail me.

176
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,730
I guess that's all
I ever learned from my mother.

177
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,970
That figures.

178
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,910
What could you possibly learn
from a mother like Gong Nan Sook?

179
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,910
- What am I going to do with you?
- Never mind me.

180
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,950
What about your grandchild?

181
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,550
That's right.

182
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,660
You're carrying my flesh and blood.

183
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,360
How about this?

184
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,500
I'll make you a proposition.

185
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,130
The full video of
Cha Ki Beom's accident...

186
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,770
that your mother,
Gong Nan Sook, has.

187
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,270
Bring it to me.

188
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,470
- But how am I supposed to...
- That's for you to figure out.

189
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,480
If you bring it to me,
I'll forgive you this time.

190
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,650
And what if I fail?

191
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,690
Do I really have to
spell it out for you?

192
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,340
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

193
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,780
(Voice Recording)

194
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,550
What is this healthy-looking blob?

195
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,590
Brown rice?

196
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,420
I guess you want me
to stay beautiful forever.

197
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,560
All this stuff does is give me gas.

198
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,670
Is Grandma on her way?

199
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,900
She says someone's even scarier...

200
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,410
than the baddest witch,
Gong Nan Sook, is...

201
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,770
Han Hye Ra? What's she up to now?

202
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,410
She says she's reaching out to you.

203
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,610
A move?

204
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,610
Han Hye Ra? Let her try.
What can she possibly do to me?

205
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,380
It's not like my heart will race.

206
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,090
She says your heart will be sinking.

207
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,490
It just came in.

208
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,900
What on earth did she send me?

209
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,070
You should've taken Gong Nan Sook
down sooner...

210
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,300
if you didn't want to die
like a dog.

211
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,840
He's still alive.

212
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,180
What is this?

213
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,860
You should've taken Gong Nan Sook
down sooner...

214
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,890
if you didn't want to die
like a dog.

215
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,170
He's still alive.

216
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,210
Make it look like
that punk Cha Ki Beom did it.

217
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,380
I'll put it in Cha Ki Beom's locker.

218
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,090
- What should I do with the body?
- We need Cha Ki Beom caught fast.

219
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,660
Just leave it there.

220
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,460
Once Cha Ki Beom
is branded a murderer,

221
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,530
Young Sun will have no choice
but to be mine.

222
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,210
That jerk Tae Seok...

223
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,350
let me believe
I killed Joo Sang Cheol until now.

224
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,350
Was he just toying with me?

225
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,750
Goodness.
Killing him once wouldn't be enough.

226
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,460
(Han Hye Ra)

227
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,400
Yes. Why did you send me
this audio file?

228
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:42,070
Why did you want to meet here?

229
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,980
I figured if it wasn't at home,
it would be here.

230
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,890
- What are you talking about?
- The video of Cha Ki Beom's death.

231
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,860
You know where it is,
don't you, Manager Gu?

232
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,760
You're with my mom
nearly all the time.

233
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,070
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

234
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,410
Jin Tae Seok.

235
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,140
I can't just let him
get away with it.

236
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,720
How can I use this
to completely ruin him?

237
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,800
I have no idea.

238
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,940
- Even if I knew, I can't tell you.
- What if it gets me killed?

239
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,150
- Killed?
- You know how Chairman Jin is.

240
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,880
He threatened to kill me
if I didn't get him that video.

241
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,120
You're the only one who can save me.

242
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,360
Like a loyal guard dog,

243
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
you've always been
the one protecting me.

244
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,310
(The Crown Capital)

245
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,640
I used the cheap teacups on purpose.
She won't throw one, will she?

246
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,450
I'm not going to throw it.
Don't worry.

247
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,680
Gosh, is she a mind reader?

248
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,150
So, why did you
send me that audio file?

249
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,690
Because I thought you still believed
you killed Joo Sang Cheol.

250
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,730
I wanted you to know the truth.

251
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,630
It's been 25 long years.
Any time I stepped out of line,

252
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,570
he'd threaten me, saying,
"You killed him. I'll expose you."

253
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,870
That was
always Jin Tae Seok's go-to threat.

254
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,980
I just want to go
and strangle that jerk right now!

255
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,950
Even for someone as powerful as you,
Gong Nan Sook,

256
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,810
this is too much
to handle alone, isn't it?

257
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,520
Besides, the statute of limitations
has run out.

258
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,120
- Now, hand it over.
- Hand what over?

259
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,990
The video from
the gallery staircase.

260
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,690
That's a crime
he can still be prosecuted for.

261
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,230
No. You're hardly innocent
in the video, Han Hye Ra.

262
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,470
I don't care.
To take down the greater evil,

263
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,600
I have to own up to what I did.

264
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,240
So this is what my grandma meant
when she called you a scarier witch.

265
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,050
A better one, not a scarier one.
To be precise.

266
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,750
Fine. Point taken.

267
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,120
To crush Jin Tae Seok,

268
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,790
you don't need the worst woman,
you need the craziest,

269
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,690
and I guess that means
I'll have to team up with anyone.

270
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,390
Fine. I'm in.

271
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,100
Okay, let's see.

272
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,100
My gosh. No. Hey, where did it go?

273
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,910
What? Oh, my.

274
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,040
Are you putting on an act again?

275
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,350
Hiding it somewhere
and pretending it's lost?

276
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,620
No! Hey, I may be a lying witch,

277
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,890
but not this time.
This is for real, I swear!

278
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,960
That means someone must've taken it.

279
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,800
Who would dare to steal something
that belongs to me?

280
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,930
Are you sure
you recorded the whole thing?

281
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,030
The part where Cha Ki Beom
was still alive,

282
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,170
- and that Jin Tae Seok killed him?
- Of course. It's all in the video.

283
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,070
I'm telling you,
I saw it with my own two eyes.

284
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,180
That's exactly
what Manager Hwang said.

285
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,980
Darn it. The smoking gun is gone.
What do we do now?

286
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:46,020
Find out who took it.
And find out why.

287
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,690
- Find out.
- And when I do,

288
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,150
what will you do with it?

289
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,620
I'm going to expose him
to the world.

290
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,720
Show everyone what kind of man
Jin Tae Seok really is.

291
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,360
You think Jin Tae Seok will stand by
and do nothing?

292
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,630
He thinks you're his.

293
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,860
- The man is a psycho.
- I'm not letting it slide anymore.

294
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,640
Killing Ki Beom wasn't enough.
He had to push my girl off a roof?

295
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,870
What's with the sudden rush
of maternal instinct?

296
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,710
This isn't about maternal instinct.
What's important is...

297
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
What's important?

298
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,720
Jin Tae Seok doesn't love me.
He just thinks he does.

299
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,320
He thinks that's love. Nonsense.

300
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,420
He used "loving me" as an excuse
to kill the people I care about,

301
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,490
and now he's trying to kill again.

302
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,990
- I can't take it anymore.
- So?

303
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,030
Is this about proving to the world
you're stronger than Jin Tae Seok?

304
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,270
Yes, you're right.

305
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,170
I'm going to show him that
if I put my mind to it,

306
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,110
I can take him down
whenever I please.

307
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,110
We're on the same page there.

308
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,910
Tearing him apart
wouldn't even be satisfying.

309
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,220
In that case,

310
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,660
How about you and I team up
until we take...

311
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,890
Jin Tae Seok down?

312
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,340
You're darn right!

313
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,180
Neither Chairman Gong Nan Sook
nor I...

314
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,010
want Vice Chairman Joo to know...

315
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,520
that Chairman Jin Tae Seok
killed Joo Sang Cheol.

316
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,150
It's too dangerous.

317
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,490
I didn't expect you
to ask for this meeting.

318
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,160
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

319
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,560
I'm the one...

320
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,930
who mailed you that
audio file of your father.

321
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,200
You mean the recording
of Madam Gong...

322
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:50,210
and Chairman Jin Tae Seok
conspiring together?

323
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,540
Why did you send that to me?

324
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,250
I thought you deserved to know
the truth, Vice Chairman Joo.

325
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,880
Even knowing that if
Chairman Jin Tae Seok found out,

326
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,080
you would be in danger?

327
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,120
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't afraid.

328
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,230
I couldn't tell you
the whole truth...

329
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,330
out of fear.

330
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,630
There's more to it?

331
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,040
You mean my father's real killer
wasn't Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

332
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,740
but Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

333
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,380
That's correct.
And former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra...

334
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,350
and Chairman Gong Nan Sook
know as well.

335
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,250
You should have told me first!

336
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:38,120
- This is about my father.
- They're worried about you.

337
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,160
Worried that you might be in danger,

338
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,730
- just like Cha Jung Won.
- Who exactly is worried about me?

339
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,860
Both of them.

340
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,100
They told me to keep you
in the dark.

341
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,830
Then why are you telling me now?

342
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,010
I thought about what I would want
if I were in your position.

343
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,580
Oh, my goodness!

344
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,050
So that jerk Jin Tae Seok
was the evil all along!

345
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,390
Should I give this to
Chairman Jin right away?

346
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,500
But will he really keep his promise?

347
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,240
Why are you drinking?
You're pregnant.

348
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,240
It's nothing. Nevermind.

349
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,370
The doctor said one glass
of wine is fine.

350
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,440
What's this?

351
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,480
Oh, no!

352
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,750
What am I going to do?
Don't you know how vital this is?

353
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,020
Our lives are on the line!
Mine and our A Reum's!

354
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,290
What are you talking about?

355
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,560
Are you saying this has
everything that happened...

356
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,430
at the scene of
Cha Ki Beom's accident?

357
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,270
Yes.

358
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,770
There's more to it
than Han Hye Ra...

359
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,870
pushing Cha Ki Beom to his death?

360
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,240
Chairman Jin Tae Seok
must be involved too.

361
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,540
I haven't seen the rest
of it either.

362
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,810
My father told you
to get this for him?

363
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,980
In return, he swore not to hurt you
and our A Reum?

364
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,320
He'd use his unborn grandchild's life
as a bargaining chip?

365
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,020
What am I going to do?

366
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,790
If he finds out it's ruined,
he's going to lose it.

367
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,160
I'll take care of this.

368
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,670
If my father asks you about it,
just tell him you couldn't find it.

369
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,170
What are you going to do?

370
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,140
I have to be the one...

371
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,710
protecting my own child.

372
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,080
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

373
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,320
What? Did the USB drive grow legs?
Where would it run off to?

374
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,490
Someone must have stolen it.

375
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,860
It wasn't me. Absolutely not.

376
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,400
Manager Gu.

377
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,500
You're hiding something from me,
aren't you?

378
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,270
What do you mean?

379
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,270
Only you could have touched it,
Manager Gu.

380
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,080
I'm hurt to hear you say that.
You said I was your right-hand man.

381
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,650
That's right.

382
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,550
Do you have any idea
why I haven't fired you yet?

383
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,060
- Because of my baby face?
- You want to get slapped?

384
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,730
- I can't think of any other...
- Because you're a good guy.

385
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,000
Everyone might call me
a scary witch,

386
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,270
but I have a soft spot
for good guys like you.

387
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,380
Is it true that
Chairman Jin Tae Seok killed Father?

388
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,680
Great. Here is
Mr. Nice Guy Number Two.

389
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,250
You'll all be the death of me.

390
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,850
Mr. Nice Guy Number Two.

391
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,120
No, wait, Number One! You, get out.

392
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,660
What? So that witch Han Hye Ra
has an even bigger mouth than me?

393
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,830
I didn't hear it from
the former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra.

394
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,160
Then how did you find out
so quickly?

395
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,470
What is the truth?

396
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,040
He's still alive.

397
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,410
You stay out of this.

398
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,580
I'm going to handle
that jerk Jin Tae Seok.

399
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,380
I'll destroy him so completely,
he won't know what hit him.

400
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,820
You do what you have to do.

401
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,920
And I'll do what I have to do.

402
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,220
Fine. Let's do that, then.

403
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,990
Tomorrow, I'm meeting Han Hye Ra...

404
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,330
and the Kunhyang Association members...

405
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,900
to really stir the pot.

406
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,160
You've decided to join forces...

407
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,260
with the former
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra?

408
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,330
Only long enough
to take down Jin Tae Seok.

409
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,500
After that, Han Hye Ra and I
will go back to killing each other.

410
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,940
The battle of the blue dragon
and the white tiger, if you will.

411
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,910
But until then,
I'm siding with Han Hye Ra...

412
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,910
to crush Jin Tae Seok first.

413
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,320
(Kunhyang Group)

414
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,150
Team Leader Ahn Ji Na,

415
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,160
when can you report
on the revised designs?

416
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,020
I'll try to have it done
by the end of the day.

417
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,590
Then we can go straight into
sample production tomorrow.

418
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,900
Already?

419
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,800
I guess it's easy when I do the work
and you just put your name on it.

420
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,870
What do you mean
you did all the work?

421
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,340
Do you know how many all-nighters
Designer Kim Sung Hee and I pulled?

422
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,670
- You think I was fooling around?
- That's enough, you two.

423
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,240
Is now really the time
to be fighting?

424
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,780
I'm sorry, Director Jin.

425
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,280
Team Leader Ahn Ji Na,
Designer Kim Sung Hee.

426
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,180
I know how hard you've both worked.

427
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,150
Let's just push through
a little longer.

428
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,220
- I'm counting on you.
- Don't worry, Director Jin.

429
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,220
We'll work extra hard...

430
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,760
to cover for
Designer Cha Jung Won's absence.

431
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,290
That's right, Director Jin.
We're all in this together.

432
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,630
Thanks, everyone.

433

Are you crying?

435

It feels like
everything's falling apart.

436
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,090
There's so much turmoil
at the company.

437
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,720
I'm angry thinking the scandal
is all Cha Jung Won's fault,

438
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,160
but then when I think about her
lying there like that,

439
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,160
my heart just aches.

440
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,000
Se Mi,
you're too kind for your own good.

441
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,010

Okay.

At the upcoming emergency
shareholders' meeting,

445
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,180
I'll press charges against
the Chairman and oust him.

446
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,090
I ask for your help.

447
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,860
I trust you'll help me do that.

She's improving, you say?

459

That's a relief.

When Cha Jung Won dies,

461
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,500
will she go to paradise...

has been ringing off the hook.

- Is it true?
- There was an unexpected accident.

we need to sway the board,

- but it's not easy.
- So you want us to sway the board?

476
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,220
On what grounds?

Chairman Jin Tae Seok...
