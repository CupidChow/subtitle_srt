1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,340
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,240
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,820
Ha Neul!

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,420
- Thank you.
- Yes.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,620
Who is that?

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,130
(Ha Neul)

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,010
I sure know
how to pick a son-in-law.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
You're too kind.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,980
Thank you.

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,050
- Shall we go, sir? I'll drive you.
- Okay.

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,750
So, CEO Joo Ha Neul...

13
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,030
is Ki Beom's future son-in-law?

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,060
Manager Kim.

15
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,960
You're right on time
for your appointment.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,400
Who was that man
with CEO Joo Ha Neul?

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,340
I'm sorry, but client information
is confidential.

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,780
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, don't be so formal.

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,180
Just tell me his relationship
with Ha Neul.

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,620
Se Mi, are you here
for some shopping?

21
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,090
Mom.

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
You saw him too, right, Mom?

23
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,160
Do you know who he is?

24
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,760
And why do you want to know?

25
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,830
Something's fishy.

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,500
Anyone would've thought
they were father and son.

27
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,540
You shouldn't bring up
CEO Joo's father so casually.

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,740
I forgot.

29
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,440
But still, the vibe was weird.
Seriously, they seemed really close.

30
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,780
What? Is there something on my face?

31
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,420
Are you interested
in CEO Joo Ha Neul?

32
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,620
What? Am I crazy?

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,030
You know I'm always
on your side, Se Mi.

34
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,900
I've always supported
whatever choices you make.

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
I know that.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,370
As for CEO Joo Ha Neul,

37
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,610
he is a bachelor and an in-law,
nothing more, nothing less.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Got it?

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,610
You worry about
the strangest things.

40
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,550
Have you forgotten?
I'm not the marrying kind.

41
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,250
I'm 30 minutes late
for my appointment.

42
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,850
Manager Kim must be waiting.

43
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,820
See you at home, Mom!

44
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,240
Cha Jung Won and CEO Joo
are getting married?

45
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,380
Could it be that
CEO Joo and Ki Beom...

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,680
don't know
what Cha Jung Won is up to?

47
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,680
Or...

48
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,120
is Joo Ha Neul trying
to get revenge on Ki Beom...

49
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,820
and deliberately approaching him?

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,290
I insist, sir.
Let me give you a ride.

51
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,130
No, I'm fine.
I have to make a quick stop first.

52
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,560
Then let me at least take you
where you're going.

53
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,630
Come on now.

54
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,130
I have a private life, you know.

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,100
All right, sir. Get home safe.

56
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,210
All right. Go on now. Okay?

57
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,160
Excuse me, sir!

58
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,960
Excuse me, sir!

59
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,170
Me?

60
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,040
How do you know Ha Neul?

61
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,400
Ha Neul?

62
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,780
Are you my future son-in-law's
younger sister?

63
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,980
Future son-in-law?

64
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,750
No way.

65
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,720
Do you think Jung Won isn't
good enough for him or something?

66
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,260
I'm not Ha Neul's sister.

67
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,030
I'm just...

68
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,430
a younger friend of his.

69
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,130
Just a close friend?

70
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:26,040
CEO Joo Ha Neul is marrying
my daughter soon.

71
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,370
As the saying goes,

72
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,880
"You can't stop a ship
that has sailed."

73
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,640
Who said I was trying to?

74
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,750
Anyway, who's your daughter?

75
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,680
- No, I mean, what's her name?
- My daughter?

76
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,180
Jung Won.

77
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,850
Cha Jung Won.

78
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,600
Are you home, Ki Beom?

79
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,900
I'm sure I heard someone come in.

80
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,040
You know the Kunhyang Hotel's
premium dessert line, right?

81
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,820
Yes. The Premium Fruit Dome,
Mousse Cake, Tart, and Gelato Duo.

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,480
The main ingredient for this season
is apple mango.

83
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,490
Here.

84
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,790
Not in front of the child.

85
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,700
This is delicious.

86
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,400
I heard Ha Neul is getting married.

87
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,270
CEO Joo Ha Neul?

88
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,970
Who's the girl?

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,070
Cha Jung Won?

90
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,380
That name sounds so familiar.

91
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,850
- Dad, do you know her?
- Cha Jung Won?

92
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,930
Cha Ki Beom's adopted daughter,
Cha Jung Won,

93
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,500
is marrying Joo Ha Neul?

94
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,600
We can't jump to conclusions
just based on what Se Mi said.

95
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,110
But what if it's true?

96
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,410
It's not like it's impossible.
People fall for who they fall for.

97
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,610
Doesn't Joo Ha Neul know
who Cha Ki Beom is?

98
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,150
He probably knows.

99
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,150
So he'd marry the daughter
of his father's killer?

100
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,190
Maybe he believes...

101
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,790
Cha Ki Beom is innocent. Or...

102
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Or what?

103
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,170
Or maybe he's truly in love
with Cha Jung Won...

104
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,170
without caring who she is
or whose daughter she is.

105
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,740
That's impossible.
Se Mi must have gotten it wrong.

106
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,310
I'm going to read in my study.
I can't concentrate here.

107
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,760
My dad bought you this?

108
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,590
I tried to refuse, but he insisted.

109
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,060
You don't like it?

110
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,860
You know that's not it.

111
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,400
My dad shouldn't have.

112
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,040
He doesn't have the money for this.

113
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,010
He probably thinks
of a future son-in-law as a son...

114
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,440
and wanted to do something nice.

115
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,340
But you're not really
his son-in-law.

116
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,950
I didn't mean to, but I keep lying.
I feel terrible about it.

117
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
It's all my fault.

118
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,620
I know I don't deserve it,

119
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,690
but this suit...

120
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,800
Do you think I could wear it?

121
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I'd be happy if you wore it.

122
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,700
Both my dad and I.

123
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,070
Thank you.

124
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,670
For meeting my dad
with an open mind.

125
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,590
This is Joo Ha Neul.

126
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,920
(The Crown Capital)

127
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,740
What's the big rush?

128
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,640
I just came for a cup of tea.

129
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,810
Bring us the two cups of
the most expensive teas we have.

130
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,180
You know, the most expensive
is always the best.

131
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,780
The saying
"you get what you pay for..."

132
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,080
exists for a reason, you know.

133
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,020
Do you think covering yourself
from head to toe in luxury goods...

134
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,630
can hide your natural tackiness?

135
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,330
In front of Han Hye Ra,
you act all gentle and polite,

136
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,040
treating me with all the respect
due to an in-law.

137
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,800
But now you're showing
your true colors.

138
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,670
As if there's anything to hide.

139
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,540
Do we really have to be polite
when we're alone?

140
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,650
You became Chairman of Kunhyang
with a dirty loan shark's money.

141
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,980
- How dare you!
- "Dare?"

142
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,390
You want to have a shouting match?

143
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,130
Jin Tae Seok.

144
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,830
Don't cross the line.

145
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,530
Like it or not,

146
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,940
you and I are in the same boat,
Chairman Gong.

147
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,580
Our families' futures are at stake.
Have you forgotten?

148
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,080
So, compose yourself.

149
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,620
A man whose life is in shambles...

150
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,860
surely didn't come all this way
just to talk of our shared destiny.

151
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,730
So, what is it you want?

152
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,330
It's about Cha Jung Won.

153
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,600
I hear she's set to marry your son,
Joo Ha Neul.

154
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,010
Is that true?

155
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,210
(Kunhyang Group)

156
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,580
I wasn't expecting you
to ask to see me.

157
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,250
Why is that?

158
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,050
You and my son are close,
and Se Mi is quite fond of you.

159
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,490
More importantly,
you're our prospective son-in-law.

160
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,490
I'm not sure
in what capacity I'm here.

161
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,490
Cha Jung Won.

162
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,470
So you do know her.

163
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,230
I was hoping you didn't.

164
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,410
Are you...

165
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,540
planning to marry her?

166
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,510
Why do you ask?

167
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,010
It's a personal matter.

168
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,220
Cha Jung Won is
Cha Ki Beom's daughter.

169
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,020
You haven't forgotten...

170
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,820
who Cha Ki Beom is, have you?

171
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,860
I know.

172
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,690
I know who her father is.

173
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,330
You know who he is, and you're still
dating her with marriage in mind?

174
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,600
I never said anything
about marriage.

175
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
We're just...

176
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,510
enjoying each other's company.

177
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,570
That's all I can say for now.

178
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,540
Enjoying each other's company?

179
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,510
How is that even possible?

180
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,020
After what her father
did to your father?

181
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,720
Do you believe he's innocent?
Is that it?

182
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,490
Does what I think matter?

183
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,690
I want to know.

184
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,370
If you're thinking of marrying
Cha Jung Won,

185
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,370
then how could you...

186
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,140
possibly accept him?

187
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,280
Where does that kind of magnanimity
and that forgiveness...

188
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,440
come from?

189
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,510
It's not magnanimity or forgiveness.

190
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,720
- It's just...
- "Just?"

191
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,190
Could a man with such kind eyes...

192
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,890
and a good heart as Cha Ki Beom...

193
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,960
really be evil enough
to hurt my father?

194
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,300
I'm conflicted.

195
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,040
To be more precise,
I'm just waiting and seeing.

196
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,770
You don't have an ulterior motive,

197
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,740
do you?

198
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,210
You can't possibly think...

199
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,650
that I deliberately
approached her...

200
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,310
to get some kind of revenge, do you?

201
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,490
I think it's possible.

202
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,950
Don't jump to conclusions.

203
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,660
I hope I'm wrong.

204
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,530
I mean it.

205
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,430
You can't judge a book by its cover.

206
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,170
The world is full of devils...

207
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,870
with angelic faces.

208
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,250
Do you know Cha Ki Beom?

209
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,020
This is the first I've heard of it.
That's absurd!

210
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,820
You think it's possible
for CEO Joo Ha Neul...

211
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
to get married to Cha Jung Won
without me, his own mother, knowing?

212
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,890
What a ridiculous pairing.
She's so beneath him.

213
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,460
That's absolutely laughable.

214
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,630
I guess it was just a rumor
after all.

215
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,740
Who do these people think they are,
spreading rumors about my son?

216
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,040
If I ever get my hands on them,

217
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,280
I'll tear them to shreds.

218
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,920
I was looking into Cha Jung Won
and found out who her father was.

219
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,250
You know Cha Jung Won is
a suspect...

220
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,090
in Park Kyung Shin's
disappearance, right?

221
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,430
Yes.

222
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,400
Are you in contact with her?

223
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,370
Have you told Cha Ki Beom about it?

224
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,440
No. I didn't want to worry him.

225
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,240
So he doesn't think
Ki Beom is the one...

226
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,410
who hurt his father.

227
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,540
He trusts Ki Beom.

228
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,950
I'm also very curious
as to how things got to this point.

229
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,210
Rest assured, not only I,

230
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,650
but my family is also
looking into this.

231
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,150
To avoid trouble
for either family...

232
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,250
before Se Hoon
and Young Chae's wedding,

233
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,390
I will do my best.

234
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,730
I hope it wasn't an imposition
asking you to come when you're busy.

235
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,170
Not at all.
Please feel free to call me anytime.

236
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,540
The coffee in your office
is exceptionally good.

237
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,510
Please, open the door. Hurry!

238
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,110
Please, open the door!

239
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,150
Come on, seriously, open the door.

240
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,100
How long am I supposed to be
locked up in here?

241
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,570
Did Mom tell you not to
even talk to me?

242
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,710
Gosh, I'm starving.

243
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,980
Are you going to make me skip lunch?

244
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,290
- Hey, Chef Hong.
- I bet you're starving.

245
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,210
Playing favorites with the food.

246
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,050
If it weren't for me,
Park Kyung Shin wouldn't be here.

247
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,630
Please talk to my mom.
Tell her to let me out of here.

248
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,200
She said you need to be
more patient.

249
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,130
- Otherwise, you're in big trouble.
- Who did?

250
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,170
What are you talking about?
I didn't say a thing.

251
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,810
What the heck?

252
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,010
You totally gave me goosebumps.

253
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,380
Eat slowly.

254
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,420
That way you'll sleep soundly.

255
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,560
- A Florence Rosé?
- I knew you had a refined palate.

256
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,400
Even though it's a rosé,
I like that it's drier than sweet.

257
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,470
It's a lot like you, isn't it?

258
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,380
I'll give you this,
you're a great judge of character.

259
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,360
Mister, who are you?

260
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,800
Time for my little puppy to eat.

261
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,690
Who are you?
Why are you being so nice to me?

262
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,620
People call me Chef Hong.

263
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,890
You're a chef?

264
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,330
Your hunger and your fear will end.

265
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,570
I'll be back for you soon.

266
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,770
Hey, what's with you?
You're scaring me.

267
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,340
So says my grandmother.

268
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,940
Enjoy your meal.

269
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,350
This is a truffle and egg rice bowl.

270
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,490
It's perfect
for building an appetite.

271
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,390
The poached egg and truffle
go so well together.

272
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,560
By the way, what do Noh Min Gu
and Park Kyung Shin's faces...

273
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,630
tell you?

274
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,670
Why would a chef be reading faces?

275
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,540
Chef Hong!

276
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,810
My grandmother says...

277
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,940
- What?
- one is fated to be a fugitive,

278
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,780
and the other is fated to die.

279
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,950
- Who dies?
- I don't know.

280
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,790
Darn it,
you always leave me hanging.

281
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,390
Come on, ask your grandmother
properly for me.

282
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,530
She'll give her answer to a disciple
who shows true devotion.

283
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,400
Same thing every time.

284
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,810
Mom, what about dinner?

285
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,010
Yes, I had a dinner meeting.

286
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,440
You must be tired.

287
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,580
Let your favorite daughter
relax you.

288
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,080
I was expecting cloudy skies,
but you're all sunshine?

289
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,890
Ha Neul will never marry
Cha Jung Won!

290
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,090
You found out already?

291
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,020
Your father told you?

292
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,860
He said he asked
Chairman Gong Nan Sook directly.

293
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,930
- Should I be happy about this?
- Yes, you should be thrilled.

294
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,670
I'm not exactly thrilled...

295
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,770
that my darling daughter is still
so hung up on CEO Joo.

296
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,070
Don't overreact.
My feelings on this are very simple.

297
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,810
I'm just happy that...

298
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,050
Ha Neul's partner isn't a disaster
like Cha Jung Won.

299
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,080
So I'm in a great mood!
End of story.

300
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,420
I think I'll go listen
to some music.

301
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,090
Seriously...

302
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,520
"A disaster?"

303
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,900
(Cha Jung Won)

304
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,380
How cute.

305
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,910
So I'm just chopped liver now?

306
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,920
You make me ring the doorbell
even though I know the code.

307
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,890
How did you know
I like stuffed animals?

308
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,660
A little birdie told me.

309
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,890
That a guy who wins you prizes
from a claw machine is charming.

310
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,460
Wait, you won these
from a claw machine?

311
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,730
All of them?

312
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,370
Yes.
It's a lot harder than it looks.

313
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,040
It totally cleaned out my wallet.

314
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,640
Good job.

315
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,410
Any other news?

316
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,350
It's too quiet.
It's making me anxious.

317
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,180
You're getting a call.

318
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,450
That's just my alarm.
I'll go turn it off.

319
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,960
I'll put these guys away too.

320
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,240
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

321
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,180
(Joo Young Chae)

322
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Why would
Cha Jung Won's phone number...

323
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,520
be the same as the one
my daughter-in-law gave me?

324
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,030
I just got a new phone.

325
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,900
(My Daughter-in-law)

326
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,170
You listed a different number
on your contest application,

327
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,210
so I just figured
you had two phones.

328
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,080
If Secretary Yoon found this number,

329
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,250
that means it's registered
under Cha Jung Won's name.

330
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,500
Young Chae. You look pale.

331
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,870
Are you feeling sick?

332
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,270
I haven't slept well for a few days,
so I'm just tired.

333
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,510
Tell me what's going on.

334
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,110
You're always worrying and trying
to handle things on your own.

335
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,140
How long are you going
to keep that up?

336
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,610
The thing is...

337
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,790
Vice Chairman Han...

338
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,420
I mean, your mother just called me.

339
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,420
- It wasn't an alarm.
- That wasn't your phone.

340
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,930
I heard it coming
from the other room.

341
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,430
The phone number I gave your mother
when I first met her...

342
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,600
was actually Cha Jung Won's.

343
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,400
Just explain it so I can understand.

344
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,670
After Cha Jung Won got dumped
by Noh Min Gu,

345
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,740
she stayed with me for a while.

346
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
That's when I happened
to run into your mother.

347
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,680
I didn't feel comfortable
giving my number to a stranger.

348
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,050
You gave her Cha Jung Won's number?

349
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,190
What's the problem?

350
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,520
Your mother thinks...

351
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,990
Cha Jung Won is the suspect
in Park Kyung Shin's disappearance,

352
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,600
and it looks like
she tracked down her number.

353
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,260
You're the one who has that phone?

354
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,030
You'd be saved in her phone
as Joo Young Chae, right?

355
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,140
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

356
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,280
My mom?

357
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,610
Why are you so scared?
You did nothing wrong.

358
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,890
Yes, Mother.

359
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
Tomorrow evening?

360
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,200
- Welcome.
- I hope you like these, Mother.

361
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,370
Oh, my!

362
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,140
Is this the heather flower?
What does it symbolize?

363
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,510
Strength in solitude.
It can bloom even on a cliff.

364
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,040
It's like you can read my mind,
my dear.

365
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,710
I love it.

366
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,820
You only brought a gift for Mom?

367
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,850
I'm sorry.

368
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,890
- I'm sorry...
- A gift isn't necessary every time.

369
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,360
Just seeing you is a gift in itself.

370
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,800
I told her just to get something
for Mom.

371
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,200
- Why?
- A gift only really shines...

372
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,770
when it's for one person.

373
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,740
Well said.

374
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,640
Being the only one
to receive a bouquet...

375
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,580
makes me feel so special to her.

376
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,450
Of course you are.

377
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,580
We can talk more later.
Let's have dinner first.

378
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,620
- Let's head in.
- Yes, Father.

379
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,190
I'm starving, Mom.

380
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,600
Right, yes, of course. Let's go in.

381
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,070
Seriously? Leaving me out again.

382
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,580
What is this,
some kind of secret meeting?

383
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,180
What's wrong?

384
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,550
It's nice seeing them...

385
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,620
looking like
a real mother and daughter.

386
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,980
Mom only has one daughter,
and that's me.

387
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,450
Hey, Jin Se Mi. Are you going
to keep glaring like that?

388
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,220
I'm not glaring.

389
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,760
My mistake.

390
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,660
- See? Pretty, right?
- You know what side-eye is, right?

391
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Are you nuts?

392
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,410
You let her stay with you?
She's not even a close friend.

393
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,410
I know Cha Jung Won had a hard time
after her breakup, but even so.

394
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,880
There were strange rumors about me
and Park Kyung Shin at the time,

395
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,950
so I thought it would be good
to have someone else in the house.

396
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
But...

397
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,230
why would you have
Cha Jung Won's phone?

398
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,030
When we met, you put your number
into my phone yourself.

399
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,030
And when I called that number,
you were the one who answered.

400
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,640
That must have been when Jung Won...

401
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,270
had left her things and her phone
at my place...

402
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,380
and had been gone for days.

403
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,250
I went to give her phone back,

404
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,150
but she stood me up.

405
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,580
And that was the day I ran into you
outside her place.

406
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,820
Mother,

407
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,930
I'm a little uncomfortable
right now.

408
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,800
It feels like you don't trust me.

409
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,870
Oh, I was being paranoid.

410
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,070
I must have upset you.

411
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,340
Yes, a little.

412
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,870
I need to know what that girl,
Cha Jung Won, is plotting.

413
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,410
It seems like she keeps getting you
tangled up in her messes.

414
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,950
I never thought Jung Won...

415
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,490
would hate me this much
and make things so difficult.

416
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,690
That's because you don't have
a mean bone in your body,

417
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,330
and you love being generous
to others.

418
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,760
Not just anyone would do that.

419
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,630
She wasn't even a close friend,

420
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,840
but you let her stay at your place,
gave her food, and clothes.

421
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,240
The more people have,
the more they want.

422
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,180
Their greed just grows and grows.

423
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,210
That must be what happened
with Cha Jung Won.

424
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
You poor thing.

425
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,790
Goodness. You must be upset.

426
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,330
You have such a comforting,
motherly scent.

427
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,840
A mother-in-law is like
a second mom.

428
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,940
Mom.

429
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,480
What is this? You two look like
a real mother and daughter.

430
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,980
Is my little Se Mi jealous?

431
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,750
Yes. I'm super jealous.

432
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,590
Se Mi, could you show me your room?

433
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,660
This is so cute.

434
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,130
It really suits your style.

435
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,740
Just what I'd expect from a manager
at Kunhyang Fashion.

436
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,180
I'll show you this
when you start as our new designer.

437
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,380
Yes, of course, Manager.

438
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,120
A music box?

439
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,890
It's my most prized possession.

440
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,400
It looks like an antique.

441
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,670
When I was little, I couldn't sleep
without this little thing.

442
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,140
Now, when I can't sleep,

443
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,940
I play it instead of
taking a sleeping pill.

444
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
Like a lullaby?

445
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,780
(A Graceful Liar)

446
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,240
You liked Young Chae more than me,
didn't you?

447
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,940
It's about
our future daughter-in-law.

448
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,880
Hasn't she passed the last test yet?

449
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,450
One thing after another
keeps coming up.

450
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,820
I don't want to see this lie become
a swamp you can't escape.

451
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,550
I'll handle it
before it gets any more tangled.

452
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,120
Something feels off, doesn't it?

453
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,190
Should we postpone the wedding?

454
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,420
Will this only end if I die?

455
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,990
In my head,
I've killed you a dozen times over.

456
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,200
You got drunk on just a little wine
and let that little rat get away?

457
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,800
I'll take care of it, Chairman.

458
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,300
Stop pretending you're a swan.

459
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,630
You're just a crow.

460
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,700
And if I refuse?

461
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,810
