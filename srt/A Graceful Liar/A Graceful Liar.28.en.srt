1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,470
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,710
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,110
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,880
Oh, my goodness!

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,320
What an incredible feast.

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,620
Let me see. Hold on.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,190
How many side dishes are there?
Nine? Twelve?

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,960
And all these greens. Let's see.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,430
It's seasoned perfectly.

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,590
Grandma wanted me
to make it for you.

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,200
Did she?

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,970
- What else did Grandma say?
- She's tired of all your questions.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,440
What are you talking about?
My grandma thinks I'm the greatest.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,670
She absolutely adores me.

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,240
She said to ask just one question.

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,740
And do it gently.

17
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,950
She's such a joker.

18
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,790
Where is my Young Chae right now?

19
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,790
I'm worried sick.

20
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,160
That's a lie.

21
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,090
- Excuse me?
- You're just furious.

22
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,830
Grandma is a great mind reader.

23
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,270
You're right. I'm mad at that brat.
What am I supposed to do?

24
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,570
She'll be here soon.

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,500
Soon? How soon?

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,540
Just shut it and eat.

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,580
Gosh. Grandma!

28
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,940
Your soup has gotten cold.

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,980
I'll reheat it for you, Chairman.

30
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,980
Unbelievable.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,860
Mother, we're here.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,330
My goodness!

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,140
My sweethearts are here!

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
Let me see.

35
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,770
Come here.

36
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,680
You've been through so much,
my dear daughter, Young Chae.

37
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,910
Why would I run away?

38
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,910
This is my house.
Joo Young Chae's house.

39
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,730
You should receive the bow, Mother.
I don't deserve it.

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,430
You're the man of the house.
Of course you deserve it.

41
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,340
Just sit down. Come on, now.

42
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,970
My beautiful son-in-law
and daughter.

43
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,710
Alright, I'm ready for your bow.

44
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,550
That's great.

45
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,220
Thank you for raising me so well.

46
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,690
Mom.

47
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,530
You're so good to me,
I could just throttle you.

48
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,840
Mom, what did you just say?

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,240
It's a paradox.

50
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,370
She's saying you two are adorable.

51
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,410
Right. Paradoxical...
Paradox? Right.

52
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,350
Right, I love a good paradox.

53
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,710
It's that sharp French wit,
you know.

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,420
She's always had a sharp wit.

55
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,550
That's right.
I'm exceptionally witty.

56
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,660
You must be starving, right?
Just a moment.

57
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,800
Oh my, you eat with such gusto.
Have some more. Come on.

58
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,270
Why aren't you eating, Mother?

59
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,010
Just watching you eat
is making me full.

60
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,020
Hey, use your spoon and dig in!

61
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,720
Is that how I taught you to eat?

62
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,630
Chef Hong, I think I'll have
a cup of Pu'er tea.

63
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,230
Do you absolutely love it?

64
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,380
Subtly...

65
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,580
I can see a bit
of the old you in it.

66
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,720
What part of me?

67
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,920
That strength hidden
beneath your natural gentleness?

68
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,320
Gentle in appearance,
strong at heart.

69
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,790
That's what
our daughter-in-law said.

70
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,360
It's deeper than that.

71
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,570
Even though she's become a queen,

72
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,440
it's like she's still not satisfied.

73
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,070
The Han Hye Ra in the painting...

74
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,610
must still have things
left to accomplish.

75
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,610
Was my interpretation
too deep for you?

76
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,420
It really is a wonderful painting.

77
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,850
I wonder if it's because
the kids are out.

78
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,060
- The house feels empty.
- It hasn't even been that long.

79
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,590
That upsets me.

80
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,990
There you go again, complaining.

81
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,730
Where are you going?

82
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,760
Our daughter-in-law...

83
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,830
asked me to check on the decor...

84
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,140
in the dressing room of the room
they'll be using as newlyweds.

85
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,980
What's your read on that wench?

86
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,750
One tough broad on top of another.

87
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,020
A bigger shark than me? As if.

88
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,460
Just because I call you "master,"

89
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,490
you think Gong Nan Sook
is easy prey?

90
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,000
A visitor comes by night.
Open the door, little one.

91
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,400
Who would possibly be visiting
at this hour?

92
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,210
Did you all enjoy dinner?

93
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,710
I polished off two whole bowls.

94
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,250
You must like Chef Hong's cooking.

95
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,980
We should invite him to Kunhyang.

96
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,750
That's a great idea.

97
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,550
That would be okay,
wouldn't it, Mother?

98
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,160
Of course. Just say the word.

99
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,990
You guys keep chatting.
I've got something I need to finish.

100
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,990
We'll be heading out soon, too.

101
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,100
What are you talking about?

102
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,460
Aren't we supposed to spend...

103
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,270
the first night back
from our honeymoon at your house?

104
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,900
Isn't that right, Mother?

105
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,070
Of course! You absolutely
have to stay the night.

106
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,160
I knew it. She has my taste.

107
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,510
Since she was wearing
a traditional dress,

108
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,110
I doubt she wore any jewelry.

109
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,530
Perfect.

110
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,600
It's stunning.

111
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,900
It's perfect.

112
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,340
There's no way
she would've thrown my gift out.

113
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,980
What do you think you're doing,
barging in here?

114
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,980
You must have a death wish,
don't you?

115
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,020
Being ready to die is the only way
I can get through this.

116
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,260
- How dare you talk to me like that?
- Mom!

117
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,630
How did you get in?

118
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,030
Call the police right now.

119
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,270
No, there's no need to
blow this out of proportion.

120
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,370
She must've followed Young Chae
and spied to get the door code.

121
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,780
Why would you go this far?

122
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,980
Are you here to spout that nonsense
about being Joo Young Chae again?

123
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,590
I never imagined you'd be the one
to walk all over me like this.

124
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,690
Hey, you.

125
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,790
If you've completely lost your mind,
go check yourself into a hospital.

126
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,360
Please just get out.
I said, get lost!

127
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,170
- You don't belong here.
- Just say what you have to say!

128
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,110
Why do you resent me?

129
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,110
What do you feel so wronged about?

130
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,080
Tell me everything, honestly.
Right here, in front of my family.

131
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Family?

132
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,520
She's my daughter.
Of course we're a family.

133
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,020
Then why did you crawl in here
late at night to make a scene?

134
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,090
Good grief!

135
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,140
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,540
Young...

137
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,340
Young Chae.

138
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,950
You...

139
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,290
Is it true you've been going around
pretending to be me?

140
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,890
Yes, I lied.
I told everyone I was you.

141
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,890
Why would you do that?

142
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,030
After everything I did for you!

143
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,970
I just wanted to be like you.

144
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,470
If you're sorry, then beg for it.

145
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,500
You think just kneeling
is going to be enough?

146
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,680
Please forgive me.

147
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,880
Young Chae.

148
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,190
She came all this way just to kneel
and beg for forgiveness?

149
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,430
Those are crocodile tears.

150
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,630
Even so, that takes courage.

151
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,200
Are you that worried
about your sister?

152
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,070
Both of them.

153
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,940
Both of them?

154
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,170
Of course you'd worry
about your sister.

155
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,980
But did you really...

156
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,210
date that crazy woman?

157
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,020
No comment.

158
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,080
So you did.

159
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,750
You sure have a type.

160
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,060
How could you date the woman
who pretended to be Young Chae...

161
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,820
and masterminded
a kidnapping Park Kyung Shin?

162
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,230
What'd you do with Noh Min Gu?

163
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,330
You sent him abroad, didn't you?

164
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,030
No comment.

165
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,750
Gosh, that girl.
She's a real piece of work.

166
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,810
My Young Chae...

167
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,310
This is so confusing.

168
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,950
- She's just toying with Young Chae.
- You pick on her for being good.

169
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,060
This isn't Grandma, is it?
I'm talking to Chef Hong, right?

170
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,830
Why'd you change your mind?

171
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,230
Since you're living as me,
I have to live as you.

172
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,340
You're not up to something, are you?

173
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,040
You're one to talk
about ulterior motives.

174
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,410
Listen carefully.

175
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,380
I'm never going back.

176
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,610
No matter what tricks you try,

177
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,480
I have no intention of going back
to the way things were.

178
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,220
- Not one bit.
- Were you that jealous?

179
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,150
Jealous enough to want to be me?

180
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,820
You made me this way.

181
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,330
Your clothes, your bags, your shoes,

182
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,060
and the people in your world.

183
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,800
I knew not to covet your life,
but you taunted me.

184
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,040
Why did you do that?

185
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,110
Was I such a joke to you?

186
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,940
Just because I was bored.

187
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,080
That arrogance of yours
is what led you to this.

188
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,680
Now that you've become me,
do you like it?

189
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,720
Are you happy?

190
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,520
I love it.

191
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,460
I'm deliriously happy.

192
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,560
Funny.
I found it boring and suffocating.

193
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
What?

194
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,130
Go on. Keep living it.

195
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,400
Money?

196
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,700
The money never runs out.

197
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,010
And that's why you get sick of it.

198
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,910
You had no idea how good you had it.

199
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,150
After a life with Gong Nan Sook
as your mother,

200
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,350
you'll see what it's like.

201
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,920
Joo Young Chae is just...

202
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,220
- Gong Nan Sook's puppet.
- I'll change that.

203
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,890
I'll live my life on my own terms.

204
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,160
You think that's possible?

205
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,900
- I can't wait to see.
- I'm looking forward to it too.

206
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,270
Seeing how well you survive
as Cha Jung Won.

207
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,570
My gosh,
what if Jin Se Hoon finds out?

208
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,870
What are you two whispering about
over there?

209
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,040
Young Chae...

210
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,410
Cha Jung Won.
Let me have a word with you.

211
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,950
Are you sure
you can pull off being Cha Jung Won?

212
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,520
What if I'm not?

213
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,230
Can we even take it back now?

214
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,000
Toughen up.
You just have to get through this.

215
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,200
Just tell me
where I'm supposed to stay.

216
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,740
Where else?
At Cha Jung Won's house, I told you.

217
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,040
So I just barge in?

218
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,780
And just say, "I'm your daughter?"
Is that the plan?

219
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
That's a good point.

220
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,250
- You can stay there for a while.
- Where?

221
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,560
It's not my home anymore.

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,430
It's become Cha Jung Won's home.

223
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,470
Come on, you know.

224
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,030
We live in a world
where money determines your class.

225
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,970
Hey, there's no class system
between friends.

226
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,010
- The cheese, please.
- Sure.

227
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,550
Here you go.

228
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,150
Want me to make some more coffee?

229
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,490
You know to wash the whites
separately, right?

230
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,590
Then again,
as a dry cleaner's daughter,

231
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,690
I'm sure you know what you're doing.

232
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,410
This isn't quite your style.

233
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,270
It's Gong Nan Sook's...

234
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,140
- It's my mom's taste.
- That explains it.

235
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,080
- You smell so good.
- I'm happy too.

236
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,120
Gosh... You were busy.

237
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,390
Sorry to interrupt.
I just need Young Chae for a second.

238
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,060
We need to talk.

239
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,460
Take it easy.

240
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,200
You're on birth control, aren't you?

241
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,110
Look at you. Have you forgotten?

242
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,210
Your number one rule
as Joo Young Chae is...

243
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,350
not to get pregnant ever.

244
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,810
That's not exactly up to me.
We're married.

245
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,350
Just try getting pregnant.

246
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,750
Just know that it'll be the death
of you and that baby...

247
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,790
if that happens.

248
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,320
I'll try to be careful.

249
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,860
Use birth control. Period.

250
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,260
I said, use birth control...

251
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,630
She's doing this on purpose, right?

252
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,900
What if she goes
and gets herself pregnant...

253
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,150
Well, if it isn't CEO Joo Ha Neul.
What brings you here?

254
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,280
I thought we could have a drink.

255
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,720
A drinking buddy?

256
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,620
With your ex-sister?

257
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,400
You okay with that?

258
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,760
I said I'll do whatever you want.

259
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,170
What's there to worry about?

260
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,140
I'm not even sure
what I want anymore.

261
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,110
For Cha Jung Won to live happily
as your sister, Joo Young Chae.

262
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,410
And for me to hit rock bottom
as Cha Jung Won.

263
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,710
Is that how it looks to you?

264
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,180
Since when were you such a puppet
for Mom?

265
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,520
You can't stand her.

266
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,190
You always seemed to be hiding
something deep inside.

267
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,560
As if you're saying,
"Let's be patient for the future."

268
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,800
What's most important to you now?

269
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,630
I'll do what it takes to show
Cha Jung Won what I'm capable of.

270
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,170
And after that?

271
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,540
- Show my hand to the enemy?
- Why am I the enemy?

272
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,640
So, what, you're on my side?

273
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,350
As long as you still feel sorry
for Cha Jung Won,

274
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,710
you, Joo Ha Neul, are my enemy.

275
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,890
Take good care
of your precious things.

276
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,110
The daughter you abandoned
was only seven.

277
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,120
And Dad was in prison,
framed for murder.

278
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,850
How detestable.

279
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,660
Honey, are you almost ready?

280
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,760
Coming.

281
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,010
I'm just getting started,
and she's already taking the bait.

282
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,310
I found it in the trash.

283
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,350
So I took it out myself...

284
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,920
and put it back where it belongs.

285
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,850
Who would do such a thing?

286
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,220
I'm so sorry.
I should've been more careful.

287
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,460
I thought maybe you threw it away
because you didn't like my gift.

288
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,460
A gift from you, Mother?

289
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,260
That's unimaginable.

290
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,000
- I'm just kidding.
- Even so, that hurts, Mother.

291
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,540
Then we're even!

292
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,070
Because my feelings
were almost hurt too.

293
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,540
When I'm not wearing it,
I'll keep it in the safe.

294
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,380
There's no need for that.

295
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,050
Whoever did it,
I'm sure it was a mistake.

296
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,320
Everyone working at my house
is like one of our own.

297
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,090
I'll be more careful from now on.

298
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,220
Mother, would it be all right
if I stepped out for a bit today?

299
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,830
You don't have to ask my permission
for every little thing.

300
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,130
This house isn't a prison.

301
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,730
Where to?

302
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,100
I was hoping to thank Manager Kim...

303
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,800
and others
who helped with the wedding.

304
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,620
I'm sorry this is all
I can give you.

305
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,730
- It's only 0.1 carats.
- This is more than enough for me.

306
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,830
I told you to get one
that was 0.3 carats.

307
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,970
Is Jung Won coming tomorrow?

308
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,770
I'm here.

309
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,070
Hey.

310
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,680
My goodness.
You look like a Cheongdam-dong wife.

311
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,080
No one would think
you're my daughter...

312
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,410
if they saw you on the street.

313
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,220
- Your wedding's tomorrow, you two.
- So you did know?

314
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,950
You're coming, right?

315
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,160
Tonight,

316
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,690
- I have a business trip to Paris.
- What?

317
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:26,000
Goodness, our Jung Won
is really going places.

318
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,400
You're already taking
business trips overseas?

319
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,500
It's for a fashion show in Paris.
The designers are going too.

320
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,340
Can't they hold the fashion show
without you?

321
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,110
Why did it have to be tonight?

322
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,210
You didn't plan this on purpose
to miss the wedding, did you?

323
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,050
Ki Beom, you know
you don't mean that.

324
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,850
I'm upset too.

325
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,220
That I have to miss your wedding.

326
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,420
It's not like you did it on purpose.

327
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,660
Spend some time with your mom
before you go.

328
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,960
What about lunch?

329
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,160
I don't have an appetite.

330
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,300
Seriously...

331
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,270
You know your dad's just pouting,
right?

332
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,440
Of course I do.
He's my dad, after all.

333
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,910
Let's get something to eat.
Want me to make some noodles?

334
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,080
Let's eat out.
It's been a long time.

335
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:20,020
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

336
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,390
That barbecue smells amazing!

337
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,420
We can't just smell it,
we have to eat it.

338
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,660
Are you sure it's okay
to eat without your dad?

339
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,360
When did we last eat out, just us?
It feels like forever ago.

340
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,900
- A mother-daughter date?
- Yes.

341
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
I love it!

342
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Let's go inside.

343
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,180
You've made an excellent choice.
Please enjoy your meal.

344
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,550
Thank you.

345
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,820
The service is great,
and the restaurant is so clean.

346
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,960
Look at this.
This meat has amazing marbling.

347
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,500
Here, Jung Won, open up.

348
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,940
Your turn, Mom. Open up.

349
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,280
It just melts in your mouth.

350
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,650
So you really can't
make it tomorrow?

351
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,320
What if at the wedding
they find out I'm his daughter?

352
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,490
How long do we have to hide
your marriage from your father?

353
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,430
It's not going to be forever, is it?

354
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,060
- It might have to be forever.
- What are you talking about?

355
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,430
It's the only way I can be happy.

356
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,740
Then, you and Dad can live in luxury
and never worry about money again.

357
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,040
Want to run a restaurant
like this one?

358
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,880
That's beyond my wildest dreams,
unless I win the lottery.

359
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,080
I'll set it up for you.
You can be the boss.

360
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,980
Are you serious?

361
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,900
Goodness.
We meet again, Mr. Cha Ki Beom.

362
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,270
Goodness,
look at the state of this place.

363
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,070
What are you doing here?
What are you pulling this time?

364
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,910
I don't even know where to begin...

365
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,780
on renovating this place.

366
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,720
The whole thing's a lost cause.

367
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,490
- Maybe we should get a new house.
- What are you saying?

368
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,190
Do you still plan to take...

369
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,260
my daughter as yours
and marry her to a rich family?

370
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,560
You still haven't given up on that?

371
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,160
You should've gratefully taken it
when you had the chance.

372
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,670
It's always the poor ones
who are so hung up on pride.

373
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,570
What gives you the right
to barge in here and cause a scene?

374
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,940
You're Gong Nan Sook, aren't you?

375
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,040
And who might this be?
How dare you say my name?

376
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,050
The tramp who tempted my Jung Won
and gave her false hope.

377
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,480
"Tramp?"

378
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,880
Seems another tramp
has a death wish.

379
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,650
What? "A death wish?"

380
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,060
All right, it's you or me today!

381
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,520
- Goodness!
- Hey!

382
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,530
You old hag!

383
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:19,500
What do you think you're doing?
Break it up and talk. Let go!

384
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,130
I said let go!

385
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,940
What are you doing here?
You're Mother's personal secretary.

386
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,640
The vice chairman has assigned me
to assist you, ma'am.

387
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,040
So she's assigned me a watchdog.

388
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,050
Ma'am? Don't be ridiculous.

389
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,820
Just call me Young Chae.

390
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,350
I will address you
as Madam Young Chae.

391
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,090
I will do my utmost to assist you.
I look forward to working with you.

392
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,660
No, I'm the one
who should be grateful.

393
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,970
Gosh, women are way scarier
when they fight.

394
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,400
Darn it.

395
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,810
Do you have any idea
how much this hairdo cost me?

396
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,080
What did you put in your hair
that it's completely unscathed?

397
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,210
You ripped out a bride's hair,
you wicked witch.

398
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,020
Hey, before everything falls apart,
get Cha Ki Beom out of here.

399
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
All right.

400
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
Gosh.

401
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,600
What, is this a contest to see...

402
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,130
who can drink
cold water the fastest?

403
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,270
Ki Beom! Just look at my hair.

404
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,640
- My scalp is showing.
- What?

405
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,310
- Go buy me root touch-up spray.
- Now?

406
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,810
It's urgent. Hurry up.

407
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,910
What about her?

408
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,540
I'll handle her.

409
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,110
Don't try anything funny.

410
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,980
Here, take this!

411
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,630
Yes, bring it here.

412
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,830
It is a gift for you.

413
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,640
You think
I can't afford my own juice?

414
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,610
What is this?

415
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,280
A bribe?

416
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,080
I think we met briefly
at the wedding.

417
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,690
- You know, don't you?
- Know what?

418
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,290
That Cha Jung Won already married
into a rich family.

419
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,930
And it looks like
Cha Ki Beom has no idea.

420
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Let my dear Young Chae...

421
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,400
live here in this house.

422
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,690
(A Graceful Liar)

423
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,060
You want me to work
in the design department?

424
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,560
But you passed the Kunhyang Fashion
design competition fair and square.

425
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,230
She's married to Kunhyang's heir.

426
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,500
The head of fashion
seems like a good fit.

427
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,630
I want to work as a designer
at Kunhyang Fashion.

428
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,170
Does that make any sense to you?

429
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,570
I need you to transfer Kim Sung Hee
to the design department.

430
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
I need an ally.

431
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,880
It's a pleasure to meet you.
My name is Cha Jung Won.

432
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,440
How could you do
something like that?

433
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,980
This is why
you can't be nice to underlings.

434
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,780
How can my mother be so two-faced?

435
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,950
I can't stand it anymore.

436
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,650
Don't say that, Se Hoon.
I should have been more careful.

437
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,290
As for the Kunhyang family,

438
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,860
who think
you're the kindest person alive,

439
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,620
I'm going to shatter their hearts,
bit by bit.

440
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,360
