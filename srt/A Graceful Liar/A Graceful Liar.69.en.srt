1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,070
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,140
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,940
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
How is Jung Won?

5
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,660
Can I...

6
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,000
see her?

7
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,130
In a little bit.

8
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,640
I haven't been able
to see her yet either.

9
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,710
(Episode 69)

10
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,650
Jung Won will get through this.

11
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,430
I feel like I've done nothing
for her.

12
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,730
I should've cherished
and understood her more,

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,230
and I should've protected her.

14
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,070
How could she do this to me?

15
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,110
She said she couldn't be
with me anymore...

16
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,480
and forced me away.

17
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,280
Now she's fighting for her life...

18
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,220
Does this make any sense?

19
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,920
How could she blindside me
like this again?

20
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,630
Se Hoon.

21
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,400
Just for today, can't we both...

22
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,340
just pray for Jung Won
to pull through? Please.

23
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,250
If you are truly there,

24
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,320
please let
my poor daughter, Jung Won,

25
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,400
wake up.

26
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,670
I realize now how foolish
and arrogant my choices were.

27
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,340
If you just let my child live,

28
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,540
I would gladly offer...

29
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,480
my own life.

30
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,910
I finally realize it now.

31
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,480
That you were right, Min Jung.

32
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,750
Min Jung.

33
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,950
I want to be with Tae Seok.

34
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,390
Then just go.

35
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
But what about Su A?

36
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,130
President Jin Tae Seok loves you.
He'll accept Su A too.

37
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,690
Tae Seok...

38
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,260
only wants me.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,870
I want to be the matriarch
of the Kunhyang family.

40
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,100
I want to be with Tae Seok.
Please, you have to stop me.

41
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,500
But still, how could you
do something like that?

42
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,240
If I survive, I'll believe that
the skies have taken pity on me...

43
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,340
and have given me permission...

44
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,410
to be with Tae Seok in this life.

45
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,550
And if not?

46
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,950
If I die just like that,

47
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,920
it'll be the price
I pay for my sins.

48
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,260
I'll just have to accept it.

49
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,030
I don't want to live
as a murderer's wife.

50
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,640
This is everything I have.

51
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
It'll be more than enough
for your wife's surgery.

52
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,380
But what if you die?

53
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,680
Then what does that make me?

54
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,920
If you refuse,

55
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,150
I'll just find someone else
to do it.

56
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,460
All I need you to do...

57
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,190
is to drive as instructed.

58
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,570
I was so foolish.

59
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,440
To gamble so recklessly...

60
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,780
with my own life.

61
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,450
Just because I survived,

62
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,720
I thought it was a sign
from the Almighty.

63
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,130
I thought I could abandon Ki Beom,
who was framed,

64
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,970
and my own daughter, Su A.

65
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,070
But what if the price for my sins...

66
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,410
- is being paid by my Jung Won?
- Don't say that, Hye Ra.

67
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,350
You can start over now.

68
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,320
I'm sure Jung Won will wake up.

69
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,320
Your prayers...

70
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,720
will be answered this time.

71
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,090
If Jung Won can just come back
to me alive,

72
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,030
I don't care what happens to me.

73
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,540
As for Jin Tae Seok,

74
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,140
I will make him pay
with my own two hands.

75
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,890
- Defibrillator! Get it now!
- Right away, Doctor!

76
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,500
One, two, three, four...

77
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,740
(Intensive Care Unit)

78
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,750
What do you mean, critical?
What happened?

79
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,850
I just got the call myself.
They said her condition is critical.

80
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,550
No.

81
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,850
I can't let her go like this.

82
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,460
Are you all right?

83
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,630
(Joo Young Chae)

84
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,030
(Joo Young Chae)

85
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,370
Just leave me alone.

86
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,990
So today's the day
she either lives or dies?

87
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,960
Farewell, Cha Jung Won.

88
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,970
This is the best for you and Hye Ra.

89
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,340
I shouldn't have just pushed her.

90
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,950
I should have finished the job.

91
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,490
You're a feisty one.

92
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,660
- Were you recording this?
- My word alone isn't enough.

93
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,760
They will only believe
a confession straight from you.

94
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,410
I tried to show this to Se Hoon,
but he won't answer my calls.

95
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,750
What's this?

96
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,780
I thought you said
you didn't manage to record it.

97
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,190
Stay out of it. This is mine.
I said I'll handle it.

98
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,860
You brat. Do you have any idea
how dangerous this is?

99
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,960
If Jin Tae Seok finds out
you have this...

100
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,090
And so what if he does?

101
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,330
He won't spare you either.

102
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,930
Not even
when I'm Madam Gong's daughter?

103
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,170
Don't you remember?
When Cha Jung Won posed as you,

104
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,140
he cast her aside,
thinking she was my daughter.

105
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,040
Technically, Han Hye Ra
was the one who cast her out.

106
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,540
He pushed her from a roof,

107
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,610
knowing she was
Han Hye Ra's daughter.

108
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,710
What makes you think
he wouldn't do the same to you?

109
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,180
Fine.

110
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,650
- I'll delete it.
- Send it to me first.

111
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,420
And you won't be in danger?

112
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,590
We're leagues apart.

113
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,390
This card can keep
Jin Tae Seok on a leash,

114
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,390
and I can make it work for me.

115
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,730
All right.

116
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,930
Oh, no.

117
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,870
Looks like I deleted it
by accident. Sorry.

118
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,540
Why, that little...

119
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,880
She didn't want to give it to me,
so she just pretended...

120
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,550
What's the update?

121
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,150
She's in critical condition?

122
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,020
All right. Keep me updated.

123
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,590
(D Ward, West Wing)

124
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,670
(Friend)

125
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,720
Jung Won.

126
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,520
You have to hold on.

127
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,790
You have to wake up...

128
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,320
and get your revenge on me.

129
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,990
On Jin Tae Seok
and Gong Nan Sook too.

130
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,130
You have to make them pay.

131
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,080
Thank you for holding on.

132
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,380
Don't sleep for too long.

133
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,350
You're not Sleeping Beauty,
you know.

134
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,790
You're most beautiful
when you smile.

135
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,380
Looks like Jung Won made it
through the worst of it.

136
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,580
Seeing as you're back in here.

137
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,310
Thanks to the blood you gave her.

138
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,980
But is she going to wake up?

139
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,920
They say we have to wait and see.

140
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,560
It could be a week,
or it could be a month.

141
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,030
Or she may never wake up at all.

142
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,370
Why are you looking at me like that?

143
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,170
I was just wondering
what it must feel like to be you.

144
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,940
I was just lost in thought.

145
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,780
And what do you think you'd feel
if you were me?

146
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,880
Obviously, you'd hope for Jung Won
to pull through.

147
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,020
Even if you weren't happy
she existed...

148
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,760
and felt no attachment
to her at all,

149
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,090
even if you wished
she would just disappear,

150
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,760
the fact
that she's Han Hye Ra's daughter,

151
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,000
the woman you love above all else,

152
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,200
would be enough for you
to want her to live.

153
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,700
And why do you think that is?

154
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,040
If anything were to happen
to Jung Won,

155
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,640
and it turned out
you had anything to do with it...

156
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,180
If there's even a small part of you
that wants Jung Won to die,

157
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,320
I will rip you limb from limb...

158
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,030
and kill you, Jin Tae Seok.

159
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,700
What?

160
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,330
Honey.

161
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,200
- I didn't know you had that in you.
- I abandoned her.

162
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,240
For my own ambition.

163
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,380
Because I wanted to climb higher.

164
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,950
But does that mean
I'd want my own daughter to die?

165
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,780
Even knowing it means certain death,

166
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,260
a mother bird will attack an eagle
that's attacking her chicks.

167
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,030
Now you're showing your true colors,
Hye Ra.

168
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,800
What about your true intentions?

169
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,000
You pushed Jung Won, didn't you?

170
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,870
Don't be ridiculous. Why would I?

171
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,870
Especially when I knew
you'd react like this?

172
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,610
I don't think you knew.

173
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,810
- Knew what?
- You'll find out soon enough...

174
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,180
what you overlooked.

175
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,850
What you never really knew
about Han Hye Ra.

176
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,330
You know, you're really on edge.

177
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,660
Jung Won will wake up soon.

178
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,430
- Let's just believe that.
- Of course. She has to.

179
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,870
She will wake up.

180
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,310
She still has so much left to do.

(Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul)

183
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,490
Jung Won.

184
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,020
I'll see it through.

185
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,960
Everything you couldn't finish...

186
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,460
Help me finish it well.

187
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,370
There are so few of us now.

188
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,470
That's all the more reason
for us to stay focused.

189
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,010
I need you two to pick up the slack
for the two who are missing.

190
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,210
- Yes, Director Jin.
- Yes, Director Jin.

191
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,750
That won't be necessary.

192
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,150
Ms. Joo Young Chae,
what are you doing here?

193
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,390
I thought you were suspended
and working from home...

194
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,620
because you didn't want to
work in the pantry.

195
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,060
This is an emergency.
Seriously, without me,

196
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,200
do you think you can prepare
the new collection?

197
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:56,770
To be honest,
it's true we're short-handed.

198
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,340
I'll resume my position
as team leader.

199
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,900
Designer Joo.

200
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,770
This isn't about making things easy
for me.

201
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,380
Let's just get the new collection
launched first.

202
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,610
Then you can punish me
however you see fit.

203
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,780
Unbelievable.

204
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,120
So, what's it going to be?

205
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,520
Are we just going to postpone
the launch?

206
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,490
Postpone the launch?

207
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,260
- That's out of the question.
- My point exactly.

208
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,930
Your suspension isn't something
I can lift on my own.

209
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:30,330
It needs approval of the Chairman,
Vice Chairman, and Vice President.

210
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,940
Then go get their approval
right now.

211
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,410
Do you think company decisions
are made overnight?

212
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,810
Since you're here at work,
Ms. Joo Young Chae,

213
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,580
go work at your assigned spot
in the pantry.

214
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,680
Then who's going to be
the team leader?

215
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,390
Designer Ahn Ji Na, you'll be
the acting team leader.

216
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,890
Me?

217
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,190
I'll do my best, Director Jin!

218
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,780
Reporter Ma, it's been a while.
Why did you call me?

219
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,220
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul...

220
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,720
is holding a press conference
in Cha Jung Won's place?

221
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,320
There he is.

222
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,010
Today's press conference...

223
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,910
is being held separately
from Kunhyang's official schedule.

224
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,650
The announcement
I'm about to make...

225
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,450
is being streamed live online.

226
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,390
Cha Jung Won...

227
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,390
is currently receiving treatment
for injuries sustained in a fall.

228
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,660
She is unable to be here herself,

229
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,000
so I ask for your understanding.

230
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,240
I will now read the statement
prepared by Cha Jung Won.

231
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,570
First,

232
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,770
Kunhyang's statement regarding
the late Cha Ki Beom...

233
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,480
is false.

234
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,250
Cha Ki Beom was not violent,
nor did he have an affair.

235
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,310
And Kunhyang,

236
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,980
without any grounds,

237
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,450
has tarnished his reputation.

238
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,250
Second,

239
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,190
it is hard to believe
Cha Ki Beom's death...

240
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,820
was a mere accident.

241
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,800
Before his death,
former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra...

242
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,530
and Cha Ki Beom had an argument,

243
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,770
and we have secured video footage
of this argument.

244
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,870
This is huge, isn't it?

245
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,140
It is also suspicious that
after Cha Ki Beom collapsed,

246
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,010
he was left unattended
for a considerable amount of time.

247
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,380
Based on the circumstances
following that,

248
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,150
we believe Chairman Jin Tae Seok
is also involved.

249
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,390
What Cha Jung Won wanted...

250
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,030
wasn't support from Kunhyang...

251
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,830
but for the truth...

252
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,140
to be brought to light.

253
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,870
I respect her wishes,

254
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,670
and if necessary,

255
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,940
including the evidence
we've obtained,

256
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,150
I will release
additional information.

257
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,450
(Kunhyang Group)

258
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,450
Joo Ha Neul...

259
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,460
I made him Vice Chairman,
and he stabs me in the back?

260
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,390
It was a live broadcast,
so the news is everywhere by now.

261
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,430
The board of directors
is going to cause a commotion.

262
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,730
You resigning as Vice Chairman
won't be enough to end this.

263
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,540
What's done is done.

264
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,510
Let's focus on
how to handle the fallout.

265
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,440
Do whatever it takes...

266
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,510
and block every single article
about this.

267
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Yes, sir.

268
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,880
Don't worry.

269
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,250
We've dealt with the press before.
There's nothing Kunhyang can't do.

270
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,050
And you think that's going to work?

271
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,360
The genie is out of the bottle.
You can't put it back.

272
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,430
- We should just...
- Just what?

273
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,530
What's important is containing this
before it gets worse.

274
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,070
I'll admit to part of it.

275
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,070
- I'll hold a press conference.
- No, absolutely not!

276
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,870
If we don't stop this now,

277
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,840
it will all come crashing down
like a tidal wave.

278
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,950
Kunhyang will fall, and you too.

279
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,680
Admit to part of it? What part?

280
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,750
Will you admit to pushing
Cha Ki Beom,

281
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,420
and that's why he died?

282
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,790
But that wasn't the end of it.

283
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,820
You still think I was involved
with Cha Ki Beom's death?

284
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,890
Does it matter what I believe?

285
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,660
You're the one who knows the truth.

286
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,370
Ki Beom was still alive,

287
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,730
and you're the one who killed him!

288
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,210
- You want to take me down with you?
- I will admit...

289
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,140
to pushing Ki Beom down the stairs.

290
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,310
As for the rest,

291
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,350
as long as there's no evidence,

292
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,250
I won't drag you into it.

293
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,790
This isn't just about you.

294
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,490
If you confess, Kunhyang will fall.
And so will I.

295
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,120
Then what am I supposed to do?

296
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,730
Don't do anything for me.

297
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,130
No.

298
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,970
For the sake of your daughter,
who's fighting for her life.

299
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
Oh, my.

300
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,010
This handsome young man here...

301
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,510
Is that really our Ha Neul?

302
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,140
You can't recognize your own son?

303
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,880
It's not that I don't recognize him.
I'm just speechless.

304
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,650
What are you looking for?

305
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,820
An earpick.
I thought your ears were burning.

306
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,690
Use it on yourself.

307
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,690
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

308
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,830
Anyway, look at this.

309
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,130
Looks like Jin Tae Seok is going
to tear Ha Neul to shreds.

310
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,330
Are you worried?

311
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,840
Worried? Of course not.

312
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,800
Ha Neul needs a lesson...

313
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,840
from Jin Tae Seok so harsh
it makes him cry.

314
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,580
Then maybe he'll stop talking
so much about Cha Jung Won.

315
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,220
Here he comes.

316
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,620
- Mr. Vice Chairman!
- What's Kunhyang's position?

317
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,920
You said Cha Jung Won is critical.
What caused her fall?

318
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,630
As Kunhyang's interim Vice Chairman,

319
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,560
are you taking a stance
against Kunhyang Group?

320
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,470
Please don't twist my words.

321
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,800
Regardless of my position,

322
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,170
I believe that uncovering the truth
is the right thing to do.

323
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,340
- That's my principle.
- I imagine Chairman Jin Tae Seok...

324
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,340
is going to be furious, isn't he?

325
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:52,180
We can talk more
at a later time. Excuse me.

326
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Mr. Vice Chairman!

327
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,990
Over here, Mr. Vice Chairman!

328
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,990
Come on, hurry up!
You're as slow as a snail!

329
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
Hey!

330
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,530
Am I your assistant?
Who said you could walk ahead of me?

331
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,800
- You told me to hurry.
- For crying out loud!

332
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:12,100
Stay out of my shadow!
But make it quick, got it?

333
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Yes, ma'am.

334
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,270
Not that
I can even see her shadow today.

335
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,610
Is Joo Ha Neul out of his mind?

336
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,810
There's a limit to how he can drag
Kunhyang's name through the mud.

337
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,850
This is your chance.
You need to crush Joo Ha Neul.

338
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,950
Even if I do nothing,
Chairman won't let this slide.

339
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,650
This is serious.

340
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,920
That's because
you don't know my mother.

341
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,200
She cares more for Ha Neul than me,
her own flesh and blood.

342
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,260
- That's ridiculous.
- I'm telling you, I saw it!

343
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,840
That woman keeps a home video
of Ha Neul from when he was three...

344
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,740
tucked away in her jewelry box.

345
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,970
What does that have to do
with his press conference?

346
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,450
How dare you defy me?

347
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,380
"Based on the circumstances,"

348
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,320
"we believe Chairman Jin Tae Seok
is also involved."

349
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,090
Are you out of your mind?

350
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,160
I could have said you murdered
Cha Ki Beom who was still alive.

351
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,430
You should be thankful I didn't.

352
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,590
You insolent little punk.

353
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,430
Did you think
I made you Vice Chairman,

354
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,660
so you could try to take me down?

355
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,670
How could the Vice Chairman
attack the Chairman of Kunhyang?

356
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,930
And you expect to get away with it?

357
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,000
Was Jung Won...

358
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,570
harmed by you?

359
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,740
What?

360
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,880
I was easy on you
because you're Gong Nan Sook's son.

361
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,380
- So now you see me as a pushover?
- A pushover?

362
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,150
- No. I see you as a demon.
- Fine. Then I'll end you today!

363
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,090
If you're going to end me,
you better not miss.

364
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,490
Because I won't stop.

365
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,460
I'll risk my life to show the world
what kind of monster you are...

366
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,030
- and that you deserve to die.
- Fine. Then I'll kill you myself.

367
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,670
- What are you doing? Let him go!
- Gong Nan Sook!

368
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,470
Are you insane?
How dare you lay a hand on my son?

369
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,840
Do you have any idea
what that brat of yours did to me?

370
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,310
He disgraced me
in front of the entire country.

371
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,180
I don't care if he humiliates you
or spits in your face,

372
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,420
you will not lay a finger on my son.

373
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,050
Really? Then you should be the one
to die today! I'll...

374
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,460
- Stop it, Madam Gong. Mother!
- Get out of my way!

375
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,030
I'm going to end this today.
Let's see blood.

376
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,860
What’s the point of Chairman Jin
raging at Ha Neul?

377
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,800
As long as my mother has his back,

378
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,470
- he's untouchable, right?
- Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

379
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,000
- killed Joo Ha Neul's dad, right?
- That's what I find so strange.

380
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,110
Honestly, she is a piece of work...

381
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,010
and complicated.

382
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,010
So, there is no cards to play...

383
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,210
to take down Joo Ha Neul?

384
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,120
Actually, I have one.

385
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
What is this?

386
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,780
My father really did this?

387
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,050
How can he be so evil?

388
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,250
Poor Jung Won.
I feel so terrible for her.

389
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,590
Snap out of it, Se Hoon.

390
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,230
Did you think I showed you this
just to cry for Cha Jung Won,

391
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,930
and not Chairman Gong?

392
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,670
- What?
- See what this video can do.

393
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,040
Make the right call for our A Reum.

394
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,910
For A Reum's sake...

395
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,250
You have to oust Joo Ha Neul
and take the Vice Chairman position.

396
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,220
No, oust Chairman Jin Tae Seok too!

397
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,850
You need to rise up and be the owner
of Kunhyang Group.

398
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,490
This video...

399
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,720
will give you the power to do it.

400
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,540
Gong Nan Sook, are you insane?
You dare attack me, Jin Tae Seok,

401
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,970
and swing a nameplate at my head?

402
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,170
You broke the unwritten rule.
You don't go after the kids!

403
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,150
- He's not related. "Your kid?"
- Ha Neul is different.

404
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,120
- He's my pride.
- I see.

405
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,850
For a crass woman
like Gong Nan Sook...

406
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,960
has an upstanding and honest son
like Joo Ha Neul?

407
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,060
In any case,
no one touches my Ha Neul.

408
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,530
His life or death
is my decision and mine alone.

409
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,200
Fine. I admit I crossed a line.

410
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,210
If you touch my Ha Neul
one more time,

411
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,340
- your kid is next, Jin Tae Seok.
- My kid?

412
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,380
Don't tell me
you're thinking of Se Mi?

413
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,410
The daughter
who's the apple of your eye.

414
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,420
I'll tear her limb from limb
with my own two hands.

415
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,820
Don't you touch Se Mi.

416
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,660
Chairman, we're in big trouble.

417
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,960
- Chairman, a statement, please.
- Is this related to Cha Ki Beom?

418
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,390
Kunhyang Group
also has the video, correct?

419
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:05,900
Please give us a statement.

420
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,400
- This has nothing to do with me.
- Please comment, Chairman.

421
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,870
It's not me. Stop filming.
Hey, go bother him!

422
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,870
Chairman Jin Tae Seok, are you
involved in Cha Ki Beom's death?

423
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,870
How dare you make
such an outrageous claim?

424
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,870
I am Jin Tae Seok.

425
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,050
Members of the press,
when you're writing your stories,

426
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,180
you'd better remember
who you're dealing with.

427
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,890
If you harm the reputation
of Kunhyang or my own name,

428
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,660
I will not stand idly by.

429
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,130
Gosh, that was exhausting.

430
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,470
Did you have a hair-pulling match
with Chairman Jin?

431
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,710
Hey, I was this close to killing
Jin Tae Seok today, but I held back.

432
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,410
The exit is that way.

433
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,320
What is this?

434
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,420
(Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul)

435
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,220
It might've fallen when Cha Jung Won
fell from the rooftop,

436
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,360
but it's her phone.

437
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,370
Why are you giving this to me?

438
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,630
Get it fixed.

439
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,810
You never know. It may have evidence
on it of what happened on the roof.

440
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,870
Why are you helping me?

441
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,210
If this is...

442
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,680
because you hope I'll forgive you
for what you did to my father...

443
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,780
Don't be absurd.

444
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,120
This has nothing to do with that.

445
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
It's just that...

446
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,860
I couldn't stand seeing that jerk
Jin Tae Seok come after you.

447
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,730
I only just realized
that myself today.

448
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,660
I was surprised...

449
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,100
- that you'd protect me...
- No, it's not like that.

450
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,240
It's nothing like that.

451
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,540
I'm not your mother, so don't think
I've suddenly started doting on you,

452
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,940
or that some maternal instinct
kicked in and made me do this.

453
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,750
So don't you dare
get the wrong idea.

454
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,450
Seeing that jerk Jin Tae Seok...

455
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,880
running wild
and doing as he wants...

456
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,050
is something I just
couldn't tolerate.

457
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,260
Nothing more, nothing less.

458
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,230
So brace yourself.

459
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,800
You never know when that jerk,
Jin Tae Seok,

460
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,700
will come for your throat again.

461
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,200
Hey, do you ever turn
the heat on in here?

462
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,370
Gosh, it's freezing.
Now's not the time to be cheap.

463
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,680
(Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul)

464
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,790
- Please give us a comment!
- Just a moment!

465
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,220
Are you involved in
Cha Ki Beom's case?

466
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,360
What's your reaction to all this?

467
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,790
Please tell us what happened
in detail!

468
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,430
Did you push Cha Ki Beom
down the stairs?

469
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:55,570
Technically, yes,
but it was an accident.

470
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,270
But we're hearing that Chairman Jin
was involved as well.

471
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,600
So you admit Vice Chairman Joo's
press conference was factual?

472
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,940
As for my official statement,

473
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,540
I will deliver it soon
at a press conference.

474
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,310
That's all for today,
so please leave.

475
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,650
I must ask you to leave.

476
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,420
- Han Hye Ra!
- Please leave us a comment!

477
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,620
- Han Hye Ra!
- Give us a comment!

478
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,890
Just one more comment!

479
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,190
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

480
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,600
I can't just let Jin Tae Seok
get away with this.

481
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,380
How can I use this
to utterly destroy him?

482
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,170
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

483
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,510
You're not having any meat today?

484
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,410
Spit it out.

485
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,180
- Anything wrong with my Jung Won?
- No.

486
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,420
Ms. Cha Jung Won is responding well
to treatment.

487
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,060
Then what is it?

488
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,560
Chairman Jin was always scary,

489
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,660
but he's still the man
I've served for nearly 30 years,

490
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,970
so I tried not to think, judge,
or make my own choices.

491
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
And now?

492
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,940
I can't take it anymore.

493
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,790
Jung Won, my dear,
what am I going to do?

494
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,760
I won't let him get away with this.

495
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,230
That jerk, Jin Tae Seok...

496
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,600
What are you talking about?

497
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,970
What on earth did Jin Tae Seok do?

498
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,970
The person who pushed Jung Won
off the rooftop...

499
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,380
was Jin Tae Seok.

500
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,660
(A Graceful Liar)

501
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,620
Take down Joo Ha Neul right now,
or I'll leak the video.

502
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,490
I should've known better than
to take in an ungrateful human.

503
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,330
Se Hoon, you'll be Kunhyang's
Vice Chairman, and then Chairman.

504
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,530
You dared to film that on the roof?
What do you think I'll do to you?

505
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,700
That jerk Tae Seok let me believe
I killed Joo Sang Cheol until now.

506
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,270
Was he just toying with me?

507
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,970
Even for you, Gong Nan Sook, this is
too much to handle alone, isn't it?

508
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,910
Tearing him apart
wouldn't even be satisfying.

509
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,450
How about you and I team up
until we take Jin Tae Seok down?
