1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,710
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,840
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,880
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,950
So we meet again.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,290
- Cha Jung Won.
- Joo Young Chae.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,990
Looks like we can finally
go head-to-head.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:23,930
Right?

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,930
You might have gotten this far
thanks to my work you stole,

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,670
but you shouldn't do that
from now on.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,470
Show me what you've really got,
Young Chae.

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,720
(Episode 52)

12
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,050
Welcome.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,390
Looks like all of the new members
of the design team are here.

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,720
You all know each other, right?

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,390
Go ahead and introduce yourselves.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,990
I'm curious to hear
what you all have to say.

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,460
I'm Kim Sung Hee.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,800
I was a long-time personal shopper
in the luxury goods department.

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,030
- I always wanted to be a designer.
- Okay, that's enough from you.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,740
- What's your name?
- I'm curious too.

21
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,040
Since her name changes so often.

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,810
Why don't you introduce
yourself first?

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,220
I'm Joo Young Chae.

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,150
I graduated
from the New York Royal Art School.

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,290
- And this is...
- I'm Cha Jung Won.

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,060
I dropped out...

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,390
of Hangang University's fashion program
in my sophomore year.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,230
For a while, due to circumstances,
I went by the name Joo Young Chae.

29
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,000
But my real name is,
in fact, Cha Jung Won.

30
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,310
So now you're the real Cha Jung Won.

31
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,240
It's even more ridiculous
hearing you say it yourself.

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,780
So I can assume...

33
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,050
there won't be any more confusion
on who's who, right?

34
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,180
Aren't you going to explain
why you impersonated me?

35
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,550
Designer Cha Jung Won.

36
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,420
What are you, a pathological liar?

37
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,230
Look who's talking.

38
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,000
You pretended to be
Jung Won once, too.

39
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,670
That was my fault.

40
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,340
I admit it was completely my fault.

41
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,210
By pretending to be someone else
for so long,

42
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,640
I'm sure some of you were hurt.

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,580
- I sincerely apologize.
- Let's get one thing straight.

44
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,450
Designer Cha Jung Won.

45
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,290
What gives you the right
to be a designer at Kunhyang?

46
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,230
You of all people
shouldn't be asking me that.

47
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,000
You're the one who isn't qualified
to be a designer.

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
That's...

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,600
It's because of who you know,
isn't it?

50
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,170
Are you really...

51
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,970
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra's
biological daughter?

52
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,510
So, everyone's here.

53
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,680
Come to my office for a moment.

54
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,090
You're going to be accused
of nepotism for a while.

55
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,260
I'm prepared
for that kind of gossip.

56
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,400
Why didn't you officially announce
that you're my daughter?

57
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,900
You said you were prepared.

58
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,800
The lies came easily,

59
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,140
but the truth still feels
unfamiliar and heavy.

60
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,770
I'd like to think you're concerned.

61
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,440
You’re asking for too much.

62
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,510
I was worried it would be too much
of a shock for everyone.

63
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,510
More than anything,

64
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,850
at least in the design team,

65
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,690
I want to be known for my skills
as a designer.

66
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,160
You're not Joo Young Chae.

67
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,760
You didn't go
to the New York Royal Art School...

68
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,790
and have barely any experience.

69
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,960
I'll prove you wrong.

70
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,100
I can hold my own against anyone,
no matter what their resume says.

71
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,870
- I hope that's not another lie.
- I'll never lie again,

72
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,070
or live a fake life.

73
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,540
You're the one who needs to take off
a mask, Vice Chairman Han.

74
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
A mask?

75
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,480
I don't wear one.

76
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,420
What you see is what you get, Su A.

77
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,950
Then I'll take it off for you.

78
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,220
With pleasure.

79
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,660
(Voice Recording)

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,300
President Jin.

81
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,500
You can't do this to me.

82
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,240
Don't you know I haven't signed
the investment papers yet?

83
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,310
If this project falls through,
your chairmanship is over too.

84
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,540
Cha Ki Beom.

85
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,410
A real pain in the neck
works at that construction site.

86
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,550
Don't you worry about a thing.
Just go home and rest.

87
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,490
Tomorrow, the sun will rise again.

88
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,690
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

89
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,260
That's Chairman Jin Tae Seok
and Gong Nan Sook's voices.

90
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,790
Madam Gong killed my father?

91
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,460
And they even talked
about framing Cha Ki Beom for it.

92
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,600
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

93
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,380
About that day,

94
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,310
if you know everything
that went on at the gallery,

95
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,280
can't you find the courage
to speak up for them?

96
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,250
Someone was deeply hurt
by that incident,

97
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,620
and it would be a terrible injustice
if they never learned the truth.

98
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,560
For the man who died
and his daughter.

99
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,130
He has a point.

100
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,070
Manager Gu. Why not hang this up
before you get hit?

101
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,630
That's what you have to do
right now.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,070
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,210
You're the one who killed my father,
aren't you?

104
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,580
You had Chairman Jin Tae Seok
clean up the mess...

105
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,180
and framed Cha Ki Beom for it?

106
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,320
Get out.

107
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,690
Well, talk about
coming out of left field.

108
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,660
- You have proof or something?
- I do.

109
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,770
You do?

110
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,440
Espresso?

111
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,850
You always know just what I like,
Jung Won.

112
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,620
- Thanks.
- You haven't kicked that habit?

113
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,590
I'm Joo Young Chae.
You're Cha Jung Won.

114
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,620
You're the one
who used to make my coffee.

115
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,390
- Did you forget?
- How could I?

116
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,930
Every morning, I imagined it.

117
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,630
Putting poison in your coffee.

118
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,840
- What?
- Poison stronger than espresso.

119
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,840
Just one drop...

120
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,340
would have been enough to kill you.

121
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,620
You claimed we were best friends
and you'd be with me forever.

122
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,950
But you stole my design book
three times,

123
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,120
which was my everything,

124
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,320
So what?

125
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,920
You stole my life to become
a rich family's daughter-in-law...

126
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
by manipulating my mom.

127
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,490
Let's not forget
your mom used me, too.

128
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,660
You hated me enough to kill me?

129
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,800
Back then, yes.

130
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,000
But now...

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,070
I just feel sorry for you.

132
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,200
How dare you?

133
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,310
Now you're Han Hye Ra's daughter,

134
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,580
so you think I'm beneath you?
Is that it?

135
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,510
You're barking up the wrong tree.

136
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,950
I'm not interested in having
an emotional fight with you anymore.

137
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,750
I guess you really are
Han Hye Ra's daughter, after all.

138
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,490
I was impressed
by your little performance earlier.

139
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,960
"I'm sure some of you were hurt.
I sincerely apologize."

140
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,330
Hey, shouldn't I be the first one
you apologize to?

141
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,400
Fine.

142
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,440
I'll apologize if I need to.

143
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,770
Although it was brief,

144
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,670
if you felt like
I stole your life and your spot.

145
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,740
But here's the thing.

146
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,550
For you, it's still ongoing,
isn't it?

147
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,950
- What was that?
- You became a designer using my work.

148
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,550
How do you think
you'll survive here?

149
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,390
Do you have the talent
to earn their respect?

150
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,460
Cha Ki Beom.

151
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,270
A real pain in the neck
works at that construction site.

152
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,930
Don't you worry about a thing.
Just go home and rest.

153
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,940
Who on earth sent you this trash?

154
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,070
I have no idea.

155
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,110
Someone must have
wanted me to know...

156
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,580
that you were the one
who really killed my father.

157
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,520
So, who on earth is it
that has no fear left?

158
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,590
Is that what you're angry
about right now?

159
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,790
Shouldn't you be more concerned
with whether the recording is real?

160
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,560
Right. That's a good point.

161
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,990
You're right.

162
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,530
I killed your father.

163
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,950
Hey, you...

164
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,080
Your husband's home,
and you won't even look at me?

165
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,320
Husband, my ass.

166
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,790
You're on her side, not mine.

167
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,660
Did you think I didn't know
you were having an affair for ages?

168
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,400
What? Were you out drinking
with that wench again?

169
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,570
Cut the nonsense.

170
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,830
I just met with Jin Tae Seok.

171
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,170
Jin Tae Seok?

172
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,940
Do you have any idea
how much he looks down on you?

173
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,280
Darn it!

174
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,880
Hey!

175
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,280
You should be building me up,
not tearing me down!

176
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,420
I'm Crown Capital's
major shareholder.

177
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,920
You must respect me, so others
will revere me too, darn it!

178
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,620
"Revere you"?

179
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,120
"Respect you"?

180
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,790
You don't have a single ounce
of business sense.

181
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,860
You ruin every investment you touch,
and you want what?

182
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,430
And this time, you blew through
Jin Tae Seok's slush fund, right?

183
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,070
Seriously, the only things
you know how to do...

184
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,940
are womanizing, gambling,

185
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,410
- and sucking me dry, right?
- How dare you?

186
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,480
Hey! Shut your mouth! Are you crazy?

187
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,210
Let go of me! Darn it.

188
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,420
Hey, Gong Nan Sook!

189
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,490
Do you think I'd live with you
if you weren't my meal ticket?

190
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,160
Your dad is a sleazy loan shark.
Who do you think you are?

191
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,960
What did you say?
A sleazy loan shark?

192
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,460
And what about you?

193
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,500
What about you?

194
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,100
- You're one to talk.
- Hey...

195
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,630
You wench!
You must have a death wish.

196
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,740
- Fine.
- Fine!

197
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,040
- Go on, kill me.
- Die, you wench!

198
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,870
- Let go of me!
- Die, you wench!

199
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,150
Good work.

200
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,020
- And keep your mouth shut. Got it?
- Yes, ma'am. I won't forget.

201
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,150
You can go.

202
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,930
I built a whole construction company
for you.

203
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,670
But you thought you could control
someone like me?

204
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,910
Did you think I'd let it slide
when you cheated with a bookeeper?

205
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,090
Love was never in the cards
for someone like me.

206
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,760
That useless emotion.

207
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,060
Throw it to the dogs.

208
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,170
- Help me, honey, please.
- Let go of me.

209
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,140
- Let me go!
- Not this way, Gong Nan Sook.

210
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,040
- I'm taking you with me!
- Let go of me! Let go!

211
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,960
President Jin,
there's been an accident.

212
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,560
You have to help me.

213
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,590
That's the truth.

214
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,330
How could you...

215
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,270
How could you hide this for 25 years
and act like nothing happened?

216
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,870
I never hid it.
You simply never asked.

217
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:51,110
You of all people know how terrible
your father was, don't you?

218
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,180
He coasted on his inherited shares
of this capital company...

219
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,020
without putting in any effort.

220
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,350
He ruined hundreds of investments,
just based on his connections.

221
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,560
If it weren't for me, Crown Capital
would've been worthless years ago.

222
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,630
So...

223
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,600
- Did he deserve to die?
- It was him or me!

224
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,000
- It was self-defense.
- That's just a shameless excuse!

225
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,940
How could you kill my father
and treat me like nothing happened?

226
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,270
Are you even human?

227
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,980
And what is a human, anyway?

228
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,220
What?

229
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,990
Do you think humans are some kind
of beautiful, noble creatures?

230
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,220
Humans are the filthiest,
most terrifying things in the world.

231
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,190
Joo Sang Cheol was
a perfect example of that.

232
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,400
I shouldn't have loved a man
like him.

233
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,970
You realized it too
as you grew up...

234
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,400
just how awful a person
your father was.

235
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,270
Ha Neul.

236
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,110
The reason you're so successful
and upstanding today...

237
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,450
is all thanks to me.
I took care of him for you.

238
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,120
It's because I kept a jerk
like Joo Sang Cheol away from you,

239
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,750
that you turned out so well.

240
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,560
Shut up, Gong Nan Sook!

241
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,800
And what can you possibly
do about it now?

242
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,600
So what if you know the truth?

243
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,630
The statute of limitations
ran out a long time ago.

244
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,810
Just die! I'll kill you!

245
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,210
Just...

246
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,650
Go on. Try and kill me,
my dear son, Ha Neul.

247
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,060
You should have seen it through
to the end.

248
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,100
Did you ever once treat me
like your son?

249
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,670
How could you do something so cruel?

250
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,540
You know, sometimes I wonder.

251
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,040
Why did I let you live?

252
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,780
Was it because of the stock you own?

253
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,910
That worthless stock.

254
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,680
If I'd really wanted it,
I could've gotten my hands on it anytime.

255
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,450
You let me live?

256
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,020
You could’ve killed me
like you did to my dad?

257
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,290
Of course.

258
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,920
Then why did you let me live?

259
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,790
Well...

260
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,600
Why did I?
I wonder that myself sometimes.

261
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,700
Maybe...

262
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,270
I thought...

263
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,140
having an honest and upright
young man like you by my side...

264
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,610
might be nice.

265
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,610
Something like that, perhaps?

266
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,680
You're going to regret this.

267
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,880
Maybe so.

268
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,090
I know the law can't punish you.

269
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,120
But even if it could,

270
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,320
it wouldn't be enough for me.

271
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,930
Go on, then. Do whatever you can.

272
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,400
Your life, your values,

273
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,370
and your entire worldview.

274
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,970
I'm going to shatter it all
to pieces.

275
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,870
I'll make you realize
how dangerous it is,

276
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,510
how it stabs innocent people
in the heart,

277
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,510
and pushes them to the brink.

278
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,880
Bring it on.

279
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,350
I'm going to make you experience...

280
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,750
that same humiliation, despair,

281
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,450
and the agony of wanting to die.

282
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,390
With my own two hands, I swear it.

283
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,030
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

284
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,150
Gosh...

285
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,980
You're here again?

286
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,050
Why does he keep popping in and out?

287
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,960
What? A recording?

288
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,760
Joo Ha Neul knows what we discussed
on the phone call from 25 years ago?

289
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,630
- Who sent it to him?
- I'm so annoyed.

290
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,440
You recorded it to blackmail me?
You son of a witch!

291
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,600
Look who's talking!

292
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,340
You secretly filmed what happened
on the stairs at Kunhyang Gallery.

293
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,840
I did. The part where Han Hye Ra
pushed Cha Ki Beom down the stairs,

294
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,880
and what you did afterward.

295
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,550
It's all on there, clear as day.

296
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,750
You were planning to use that video
to blackmail me if you needed to.

297
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,790
You think I don't know that?

298
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,460
But the statute of limitations is up
for my case with Joo Sang Cheol.

299
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,160
But Cha Ki Beom's case
is a different story.

300
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,230
It's an ongoing case.

301
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,870
Depending on what I decide,

302
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,200
Don't you forget...

303
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,700
that I could ruin you
and Han Hye Ra instantly.

304
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,970
There's no point in us being
at each other's throats right now.

305
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,210
- The important thing is...
- The important thing is,

306
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,550
who took the file
you recorded as an insurance policy?

307
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,720
And why did they send it
to Joo Ha Neul?

308
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,650
That's what we need to find out.

309
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,560
I can't believe the balls
on whoever did this.

310
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,460
Whoever took it must be
someone close to us.

311
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,870
I wonder if it is a man...

312
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,570
or a woman?

313
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,900
Are you here to flex your muscles
or something?

314
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,710
- No, of course not.
- Then you're here for a second job?

315
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,340
We're not hiring.

316
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,580
Anyway, you did the work,

317
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,050
so I have to pay you
for your trouble.

318
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,750
No, absolutely not.

319
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,790
And I insist.

320
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,560
I believe in
settling things properly...

321
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,860
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

322
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,160
Then I'll take my pay in meat.

323
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,170
Will two servings be enough?

324
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,810
Four servings? All by yourself?

325
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,010
He's eating like he's been
starved for months.

326
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,220
What's he really up to?

327
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,690
Wherever Chairman Jin Tae Seok goes,

328
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,760
you're always there, aren't you?

329
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,760
Besides what happened
between Vice Chairman Han...

330
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,330
and Cha Ki Beom,

331
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,500
I know there's more that you know.

332
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,640
Is there something
you feel bad about me?

333
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,440
I can't let the barbecue I cooked
give you indigestion.

334
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,480
Have some water.

335
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,720
This barbecue is just so delicious.

336
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,990
Do you have a thing for me?

337
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,360
Then listen up and listen good.

338
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,930
Even if Ki Beom was no longer
in this world,

339
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,670
I wouldn't have the slightest bit
of interest in you.

340
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,140
So, for whatever reason,

341
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,740
stop showing up here
for no good reason.

342
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,940
Thank you for the meal.

343
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,240
I'll be back again.

344
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,450
He certainly pays his dues.

345
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,350
He's definitely acting this way
because he's hiding something.

346
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,850
But he doesn't seem like a bad guy.

347
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,290
Excuse me.

348
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,800
You're a regular now, right?
Let me get your business card.

349
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,060
Is something the matter, sir?

350
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,560
The recording of Joo Sang Cheol's death
has vanished.

351
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,700
What do you mean?

352
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,370
Who would dare
to touch your private safe?

353
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,970
That's what I'd like to know.

354
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,270
The only people who knew
about that recording...

355
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,440
were the two of us. Right?

356
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,480
- Are you suspecting me, sir?
- I may not trust others,

357
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,580
but I have to be able to
trust you, Manager Hwang.

358
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,520
By the way,

359
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,320
how is Hwang Mi Soo?

360
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,990
She had improved enough
to be discharged,

361
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,890
but her condition
suddenly took a turn for the worse,

362
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,660
so she's been readmitted.

363
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,560
Oh, dear. What a terrible shame.

364
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,670
She's your only sister, right?
Like a mother to you.

365
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,240
She'll get better soon...

366
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,340
thanks to your constant care.

367
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,670
Right.

368
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,370
For that to continue,

369
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,580
I shouldn't have any reason...

370
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,650
to stop trusting you, right?

371
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,550
I will find out who stole that recording,
no matter what.

372
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,130
I'm busy. It's my first day
on the design team.

373
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,600
So what?
Is it your dream to be a designer?

374
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,430
Not my dream,

375
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,600
but at least
I have to beat Cha Jung Won.

376
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,470
If you want to beat Cha Jung Won,
stick to what you're good at.

377
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,640
- Seducing men.
- Jin Se Hoon?

378
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,850
If you keep dragging your feet,
you won't just miss your shot,

379
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,450
- you're going to lose everything.
- What's wrong? Why the sudden rush?

380
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,490
Listen to me very carefully.
If you don't make your move now,

381
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,730
Ha Neul is going to pull
in Cha Jung Won for his revenge,

382
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,900
and he’s going
to destroy our family.

383
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,100
Mom,
did you do something to Ha Neul?

384
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,500
Don't be ridiculous! Of course not.

385
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,200
Hey! Jin Se Hoon!

386
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,640
Gosh, not this again.

387
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,540
Jin Se Hoon.

388
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,610
Why don't you get him in the sack?

389
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,250
How can you say that
to your own daughter?

390
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,250
I'll handle it myself.

391
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,620
Hey!

392
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
Come on.

393
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,490
That girl is impossible.

394
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,990
I'm saying this for her own good,
and she won't listen to a damn word.

395
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,690
If I were just ten years younger,
do you think I'd ask you to do this?

396
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,760
I'd have done it myself
in a heartbeat.

397
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,770
Darn it.
I was such a stunner back then.

398
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,740
Do you still think you're all that,
don't you?

399
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,340
My goodness!
Grandma! Please, sit down.

400
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,450
What brings you all the way out
to the office?

401
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,890
Oh no. What's going to happen?

402
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,150
You create all your own problems,

403
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,590
and then you always ask
what's coming next.

404
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,390
So there is something, isn't there?

405
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,660
What is it? Tell me now.
The suspense is killing me.

406
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,840
My child, you must brace yourself.

407
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,910
Why?

408
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,140
There is someone more fearsome...

409
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
than the baddest woman in the world.

410
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,010
Scarier than me?
Who could that possibly be?

411
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,880
What's up?
Do you want something delicious?

412
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,720
Or did you run out of money?

413
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,550
So, who is this woman?

414
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,250
Grandma didn't tell me anything
beyond that.

415
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,990
She just told me it was urgent
and to tell you right away.

416
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,590
Who could it be? Whatever!

417
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,260
I don't care who it is. Bring it on.

418
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,160
Darn, I have a really bad feeling
about this.

419
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,370
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

420
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,170
You secretly filmed what happened
on the stairs at Kunhyang Gallery.

421
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,840
I did. The part where Han Hye Ra
pushed Cha Ki Beom down the stairs,

422
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,780
and what you did afterward.

423
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,440
It's all on there, clear as day.

424
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,950
But the statute of limitations is up
for my case with Joo Sang Cheol.

425
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,620
But Cha Ki Beom's case
is a different story.

426
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,620
Depending on what I decide,

427
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,120
Don't you forget...

428
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,790
that I could ruin you
and Han Hye Ra instantly.

429
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,660
Joo Ha Neul's father,

430
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,300
Joo Sang Cheol
was killed by Gong Nan Sook?

431
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:59,140
Someone sent a recording
of that confession to CEO Joo.

432
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,070
Maybe there's more to the story
of Ki Beom's death.

433
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,670
And Gong Nan Sook knows what it is.

434
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,530
So, how was your first day?

435
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,070
Thank you for your concern,
Vice President Jin.

436
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,700
I still have some work to finish up.

437
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,470
(Young Chae)

438
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,370
(Ha Neul)

439
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,410
Ha Neul is in the shower?

440
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,360
Something urgent came up.
Please come to my house.

441
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,760
Be there by 8:00 p.m.

442
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,990
I wonder what's going on.

443
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,300
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

444
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,810
Let's grab a drink at my place.
Get here by 8:10 p.m.

445
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,110
At Chairman Gong Nan Sook's house?

446
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,780
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

447
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,060
Stay out late tonight...

448
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,190
if you don't want
to ruin everything.

449
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,060
What is she plotting now?

450
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,800
Unbelievable.

451
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:20,340
What? The woman Grandma said
was scarier than me was Han Hye Ra?

452
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,720
Right this way.

453
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,090
Okay.

454
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,160
Oh my.

455
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,030
To what do I owe the pleasure?

456
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,740
A visit from
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra...

457
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,570
who is my sort-of, kind-of in-law?

458
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,340
I was hoping I could trouble you
for a cup of tea.

459
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,750
What's with her?
Why is she so deceptively sweet?

460
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,050
It's scaring me to death.

461
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,220
Bring us two cups of the finest tea
in the world.

462
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,940
You of all people know how terrible
your father was, don't you?

463
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,340
- Did he deserve to die?
- It was him or me!

464
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,380
- It was self-defense.
- That's just a shameless excuse!

465
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,480
How could you kill my father
and treat me like nothing happened?

466
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,880
Are you even human?

467
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,520
And what can you possibly
do about it now?

468
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,790
So what if you know the truth?

469
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,500
The statute of limitations
ran out a long time ago.

470
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,350
It's beautiful.

471
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,050
It's almost too pretty to drink.

472
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,850
And the temperature is just perfect.

473
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,060
All right, cut to the chase.
What do you want?

474
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,230
Gong Nan Sook.

475
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,230
You're the one who killed
Joo Sang Cheol.

476
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,040
And then you framed
Cha Ki Beom for it?

477
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,880
I don't know what kind of nonsense
you've been hearing,

478
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,710
but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

479
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,420
Oh my!

480
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,250
My goodness, this is expensive!
Are you out of your mind?

481
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
I'm sorry.

482
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,680
Is something wrong?

483
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,130
My father...

484
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,770
was killed by Madam Gong.

485
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,820
What do you two think you're doing?

486
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,610
(A Graceful Liar)

487
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,660
Things would've been different
if you hadn't killed Joo Sang Cheol.

488
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,840
- Different how? You mean your life?
- I wouldn't have abandoned Su A.

489
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,500
But thanks to me, you ran straight
to Jin Tae Seok, didn't you?

490
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,110
My husband handles loose ends well.

491
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,780
He'd have handled Joo Sang Cheol...

492
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,480
just like he did with Cha Ki Beom.

493
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,110
- Why was her discharge delayed?
- Because he wants her hidden.

494
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,250
Manager Hwang, you sent Joo Ha Neul
the audio file about Joo Sang Cheol?

495
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,490
I don't know anything about that.

496
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,620
Leave Jin Tae Seok
before he casts you away.

497
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,160
Join me.

498
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
