1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,010
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,110
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,910
It's finally started.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,450
The circus Gong Nan Sook arranged.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,260
Young Chae, my dear, it's time
for your dazzling performance.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,400
Cha Jung Won, you joined
the Kunhyang family...

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,560
as their daughter-in-law,

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,530
and I'll take my place
as Han Hye Ra's daughter.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,370
Who will be better
at this pretend play?

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,810
This is going to be fun.

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,540
What if she crashes and burns?

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,510
(Episode 37)

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,850
If she falls, she's out.
Simple as that.

15
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,350
If she's "out," does that mean
she's not your daughter anymore?

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,620
Do you not care what happens
to Young Chae's life?

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,190
Let me tell you something.

18
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,230
A lioness pushes
her cub off a cliff.

19
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,600
Because only the cub that survives
can rule the jungle.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're cruel.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,630
Chillingly so.

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,010
CEO Joo, let's get
one thing straight.

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,380
You could have easily snatched...

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,850
those DNA test results.

25
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,410
But...

26
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,790
Somehow, that little brat,
Cha Jung Won, stopped you.

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,620
Why is that?

28
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,030
Don't tell me you have a soft spot
for that Cha Jung Won girl...

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,570
No, that's impossible.

30
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,570
I know you're a deep thinker,

31
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,810
and you're just too compassionate
for your own good. That must be why.

32
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,870
My main concern is Young Chae.

33
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,740
Getting her into Kunhyang
isn't the end, is it?

34
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,780
It's not the end.
It's the beginning.

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,480
A glamorous stage,
but one where every day,

36
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,190
the fear of getting caught
will drive her mad.

37
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,360
- I have very high expectations.
- Chairman Gong.

38
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,420
"Mother."

39
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,410
What's going on?
You've been calling nonstop.

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,710
What on earth are you thinking?
Pretending to be Su A?

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,310
This doesn't suit you.

42
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,250
Go back to worrying
about Cha Jung Won.

43
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,050
Why are you going along with this?
Everyone has lost their minds.

44
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,390
I can't just sit back
and take it anymore.

45
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,720
You and Jung Won are both victims.
But you're both offenders now too.

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,290
From the moment you decided
to steal each other's lives.

47
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,060
I don't see Jung Won as a victim.

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,060
She was practically begging me
to pull off this fake Su A act.

49
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,830
Since when do you do
whatever Jung Won tells you?

50
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,700
It's because your mother told you.

51
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,740
How long are you going
to be Chairman Gong's puppet?

52
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,810
- Not this time. This is my choice.
- Young Chae.

53
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,010
Just stick to what you do best.

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,510
- Watching and doing nothing.
- Joo Young Chae!

55
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,610
She should be here by now.

56
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
Yes, Vice Chairman.

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,030
(Kunhyang Group)

58
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,500
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

59
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,640
You're here without calling?

60
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,010
I have an urgent matter at home,
so let's talk later.

61
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,110
Only you can stop this, Chairman.

62
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,340
This fake Su A charade.

63
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,020
- Chairman Gong has a big mouth.
- It's not too late.

64
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,720
What?

65
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,760
What's that rude girl doing here?

66
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,860
Is she here to see my Jung Won?

67
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,660
What's going on?

68
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,970
What is this? Were you following me?

69
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,070
Is this...

70
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,100
where Jung Won lives?

71
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,740
You said you'd go
to the Kunhyang house.

72
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,040
This can't be it, can it?

73
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,510
Hold on. Someone's coming out.

74
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,290
Su A.

75
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,650
Mom.

76
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,660
Why is Han Young Sun
coming out of that house?

77
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,070
Why is she calling her Su A?

78
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,570
This is bad. Let's go for now.

79
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,930
I should have...

80
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,430
I should have recognized you sooner.

81
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,530
Su A.

82
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,130
I'm so sorry.

83
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,640
I can't believe this.

84
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,970
That you're my mother,
Vice Chairman.

85
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,570
I can't believe this either.

86
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,440
I thought you were Jung Won,
Mi Hyang's daughter.

87
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,410
I thought you had passed away.

88
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,380
They say what's meant to be
will always find a way.

89
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,120
It all makes sense now.

90
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,860
Why my heart raced
whenever I saw you,

91
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,990
why it ached,

92
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,660
and why I felt something stir...

93
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,600
so deep inside my heart.

94
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,170
My baby.

95
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,900
My baby girl.

96
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,270
You must have resented me so much.

97
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,950
- Thinking that I'd abandoned you...
- I never once thought that.

98
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,850
And I never resented you.

99
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
I just...

100
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,550
really missed you.

101
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,350
No matter how much I...

102
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,960
No matter how much
I called Mi Hyang "Mom,"

103
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,900
I could never forget
my birth mother.

104
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,430
Me too.

105
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,340
I never forgot about you
for a single moment, Su A.

106
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,270
I missed you even in my dreams, Mom.

107
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,680
I know.

108
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,960
I know.

109
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,470
I missed you.

110
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,110
I missed you too.

111
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,980
Mom.

112
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,590
Don't call me Su A!

113
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,290
And don't you dare cry!

114
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,630
It's sickening. You make me sick!

115
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,330
Su A.

116
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,910
A fake mother.

117
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,710
And a fake daughter.

118
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,610
A perfect match.

119
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,720
What are you doing here?

120
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,890
The meeting just ended, so I...

121
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,820
Are you crying?

122
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,160
No.

123
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,590
I was just so moved
by the heartwarming family reunion.

124
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,060
You're too sweet.
My pretty Young Chae.

125
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,300
So, what's Su A like?

126
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,100
She's gorgeous. Absolutely.

127
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,400
Prettier than you?

128
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,440
I doubt it. Not to you, right?

129
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,310
Of course not.

130
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,410
But you're in for a surprise.

131
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,350
Just try not to pass out.

132
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,050
Why's that?

133
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,290
What do you mean, fake?
That's a dangerous thing to say.

134
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,360
If Vice Chairman heard you,
I can't even imagine...

135
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,660
You know how it is.
Nice people are scariest when angry.

136
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,600
I won't tell Vice Chairman Han
for now.

137
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,830
So you're not buying it.

138
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,830
I also know all about
your scheme with Chairman Gong.

139
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Then you must also know
why we need Cha Su A.

140
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,240
Don't let Chairman Gong
push you around!

141
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,480
How dare you lecture me,
the chairman of Kunhyang Group?

142
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,310
Do you...

143
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,280
genuinely love Vice Chairman Han?

144
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,050
If I didn't truly love her,

145
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,620
I'd never have let her
join my family.

146
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,360
Then how could you use a fake...

147
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,990
to replace
your beloved wife's daughter?

148
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,930
I expect this from Chairman Gong,
but not from you.

149
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,060
Chairman Jin,
you're better than this, aren't you?

150
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,110
This is a Kunhyang family matter.
Stay out of it.

151
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,110
Don't get cocky just because you have
Chairman Gong backing you.

152
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,780
Is that a warning? Or...

153
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,980
is that a threat?

154
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,650
I'm trusting you
to keep your mouth shut.

155
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,250
Goodness.

156
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,760
The whole family's gathered by now,
including our dear Su A.

157
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,490
I'm looking forward to
your presentation.

158
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,830
Now, get back to work.

159
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,190
(Kunhyang Group)

160
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,560
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

161
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,510
Why did Han Young Sun
call Young Chae Su A?

162
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,710
And why is Young Chae playing along?

163
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,840
That rude girl.

164
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,050
Is she plotting to become
the daughter of a rich family?

165
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,380
Her mom's richer than any tycoon.
Why would she?

166
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,720
That's what I'm wondering.

167
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,250
Don't you think that crazy witch,
Gong Nan Sook, cooked this all up?

168
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,960
Mi Hyang.

169
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,160
Tell me straight. At the house
where you saw Jung Won,

170
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,290
why was Han Young Sun there?

171
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,300
Did you sneak Jung Won away
behind my back...

172
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,630
and have her live
with Han Young Sun?

173
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,100
What a horrible thing to say.

174
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,400
If that were true,
why would Young Sun...

175
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,270
call that little brat "Su A?"

176
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,350
If Han Young Sun lives there,

177
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,750
does that mean
Jin Tae Seok lives there too?

178
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,220
That house.
It's the Kunhyang house, right?

179
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,550
That's right.

180
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,290
Wait, how did you know to follow me?

181
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,290
- Did you go through my phone?
- Is that what's important now?

182
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,600
What on earth is going on here?

183
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,730
The number you have called
is currently unavailable...

184
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,240
Did she block my number?

185
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,070
Hey, calm down. I'll tell Jung Won
to come here and ask her.

186
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,480
She stood you up again today.
You think she'll come if you call?

187
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,580
My stomach!
My insides are twisted in a knot!

188
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,920
I'm dying.

189
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,590
Hey, what's wrong?
Did the shock upset your stomach?

190
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,120
Mi Hyang. Let's go to the hospital.
Let's go.

191
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,090
No, it's okay.
I'll be fine if you kiss it better.

192
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,230
Let's hurry inside.
Come on, let's go.

193
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,870
How should I introduce her?

194
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,740
I'm sure everyone
already recognizes her.

195
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,780
Right?
You're Cha Jung Won, aren't you?

196
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,080
The one who plotted with Noh Min Gu
to abduct Park Kyung Shin.

197
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,050
Cha Jung Won?

198
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,260
Cha Jung Won?

199
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,830
- Cha Jung Won is Su A?
- No way.

200
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,700
She posed as my sister-in-law
and hit on Ha Neul.

201
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,230
That's not what happened.

202
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,870
Let me formally introduce myself.
I'm Cha Su A.

203
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,240
I'm looking forward to
getting to know you, Se Hoon.

204
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,050
- Right.
- You don't have to be so formal.

205
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,180
- Okay.
- Ms. Se Mi.

206
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,150
Actually, no.

207
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,560
Se Mi.
So you're my new little sister.

208
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,690
Se Mi.

209
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,730
Go on, greet your sister.

210
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,500
Hello, Su A.

211
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,070
Sorry, everyone. I had a visitor
I just couldn't turn away.

212
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,210
- You must be Su A.
- Hello. I'm Cha Su A.

213
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,110
You're Jin Su A from now on.

214
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,450
Thank you, honey.

215
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,050
Welcome. Now, the Kunhyang house
is your home, Su A.

216
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,490
Thank you, Chairman.

217
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,490
Call me Dad.

218
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,560
Yes, Dad.

219
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,430
It's beautiful.

220
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,440
It's absolutely gorgeous.

221
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,280
I've had this waiting for you.

222
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,450
And I didn't even bring you a gift.

223
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,080
Having you here is
the only gift we need.

224
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,660
That's the same one I have.
Are you okay with that?

225
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,660
You know how women feel about
wearing the same jewelry.

226
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,460
I bought them as a matching set...

227
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,230
when preparing
Young Chae's wedding gifts.

228
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,100
Was I being thoughtless?

229
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,610
- This makes it more meaningful.
- That's a relief.

230
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,410
I worried I couldn't wear the gift
Mother gave me anymore.

231
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,450
We should wear them together.
Young Chae.

232
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,290
We'll look more like sisters
than in-laws.

233
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,620
You two are so lovely together.

234
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,630
Young Chae, why don't you show her
around the Kunhyang house?

235
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,940
Dad. About Cha Jung Won.

236
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,440
I mean, that Su A girl.
It's not just dislike, I hate her.

237
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,410
Mind your mouth about your sister.

238
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,680
I assume you did a DNA test?

239
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,510
Do you think I wouldn't check first?

240
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,580
Cha Jung Won would fake the results
if she's determined.

241
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,250
Se Mi.

242
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,920
I admit, I was thrown off
at first too...

243
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,660
when I confirmed that
Cha Jung Won was actually Su A.

244
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,790
Put your prejudice aside.
She's your mother's real daughter.

245
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,000
Are you okay with this, Father?

246
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,700
That Mom has another daughter...

247
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,100
Exactly! If I were you, Dad,
I'd be absolutely furious.

248
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
It was before I met your mother.

249
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,670
And I already knew about it.

250
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,610
Dad, you're incredible.
To accept your love's past...

251
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,310
and even embrace her other daughter.

252
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,350
- Mad respect.
- I know it won't be easy at first.

253
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,820
Do it for your mother.
Be nice to Su A.

254
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,090
Of all people,
it had to be that jerk.

255
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,560
Hey.

256
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,290
That's no way to talk
about your sister.

257
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,300
So, is that why you abandoned
my birth mother?

258
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,710
I was just pretending to be sick,
and I ended up falling asleep.

259
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,740
How could I fall asleep
at a time like this?

260
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,410
Where's Ki Beom?
Did he go to the laundromat?

261
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,950
He must've gone to make a delivery.

262
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,990
The number you have called
is currently unavailable...

263
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,350
Don't jump to the worst conclusion.

264
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,390
I'm not expecting anyone.
Who could that be?

265
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,230
Who is it?

266
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,400
What are you doing here?
You can't just show up unannounced.

267
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,640
Are you here to thank me for housing
your daughter, Young Chae?

268
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,410
Jo Mi Hyang.
Listen to me very carefully.

269
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,520
What? What's gotten into you?

270
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,250
It's been a while.

271
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,620
You don't have to be so formal.

272
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,860
Sorry to take up your time
when you're busy.

273
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,700
It's just that daughter of mine,
Jung Won...

274
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,900
She won't answer my calls at all,
and I have no one else to ask.

275
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,910
The girl you think is Joo Young Chae
is not my daughter.

276
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,240
What are you talking about?
How can you say she's not yours?

277
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,150
Should I just tell Cha Ki Beom
everything?

278
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,580
And about you too.

279
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,550
You knew the whole time Jung Won
was posing as Young Chae...

280
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,290
to marry into the Kunhyang family,
and you played dumb.

281
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,290
No, you can't.
If he finds out, he'll die of shock.

282
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,060
It won't just be the shock
that kills him.

283
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,300
What do you mean?
You mean someone would hurt him?

284
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,730
Who? Me! Gong Nan Sook.

285
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
I knew it
when you threw your daughter out...

286
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,610
and made my Jung Won an imposter.

287
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,640
But you can't just talk so casually
about taking a human life.

288
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,310
Gosh, you're loud.
I've never met a bigger loudmouth.

289
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,010
Hey, Manager Gu. You take over.

290
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,190
If Chairman Jin steps in,
Mr. Cha Ki Beom will be...

291
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,560
Hey! Stop, don't say it!

292
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,500
Jo Mi Hyang.
I'm only going to say this once.

293
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,600
Make sure Cha Ki Beom
keeps his mouth shut.

294
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,840
Otherwise, the new husband
you finally got after all these years...

295
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,240
Or is he an old groom now?

296
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,910
I'll have to send him
to the afterlife.

297
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,980
Got it?

298
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,750
Are you asking if Jung Won
is living at the Kunhyang house?

299
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,820
Yes.

300
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,990
Where Mi Hyang went to see Jung Won
was the Kunhyang house.

301
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,360
Well...

302
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,430
I'm not really sure
where Jung Won is living.

303
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,800
Your younger sister, Joo Young Chae,

304
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,070
is staying at my house for now.
You know that, right?

305
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,910
Yes, I'm aware. I should've visited
and thanked you sooner.

306
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,210
- I apologize.
- No, that's not what I meant.

307
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,150
In front of the Kunhyang house,

308
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,380
Han Hye Ra rushed out...

309
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,020
to greet Young Chae.

310
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,690
If you know anything, let me know.
This is important.

311
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,190
Even if I did know something,

312
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,530
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- So you're also...

313
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,300
- in on this whole thing?
- Pardon?

314
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,100
You spied on me for Chairman Gong,
you gave me those shoes,

315
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,410
and you knew my daughter was a fake,
but you pretended you didn't.

316
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,950
I visited you
on Chairman Gong's orders. However,

317
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,080
my feelings and respect for you
were completely sincere.

318
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,450
Then why can't you just be honest
with me?

319
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,620
Tell me about Jung Won's situation
and what's going on behind my back.

320
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,290
You have to tell me.

321
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,530
The thing is,

322
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,760
if you find out everything,

323
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,900
it will put you and Jung Won
in danger.

324
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,540
Get Jung Won here right now!

325
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,870
She's not in a position
to come just because I call.

326
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,540
Then I'll just have to go
to her myself.

327
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,740
Please, I'm begging you.

328
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,080
Until Jung Won tells you herself,
or rather,

329
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,880
until I'm in a position to protect
both you and her,

330
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,990
please just give me
a little more time.

331
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,030
Have you given Su A a tour
of the house yet?

332
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,000
I left it to Young Chae.

333
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,440
I have to say, I'm surprised
you're so welcoming to our Su A.

334
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,510
- Of course. She's your daughter.
- Not as Cha Su A,

335
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,150
but will you let her be Jin Su A?
Are you being serious?

336
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,920
That's what I'm saying.

337
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
If you were going to accept her
this easily,

338
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,190
then why have you been trying
to stop me...

339
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,930
from finding her all this time?

340
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,630
- Stop you? What are you saying?
- For 25 years,

341
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,370
the Kunhyang family... No,

342
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,370
I was the one searching,
and I never found her.

343
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,140
If you hadn't gotten in my way,

344
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,780
that would've been impossible.

345
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,510
- Honey.
- If I were you, I couldn't bear it.

346
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,920
You might act like a doting father
in front of me,

347
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,790
but secretly, you'd be scheming
to get rid of Su A...

348
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,190
That's not true. Never.

349
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,590
You're not even
the least bit furious?

350
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,860
You're not angry at all?

351
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,730
- Are you some kind of saint?
- Of course I'm furious.

352
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,640
I'm no saint, you know.

353
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,710
I just can't trust you.

354
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,940
Don't be afraid, Hye Ra.

355
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,040
Su A...

356
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,950
Knowing she's Cha Ki Beom's daughter
makes me want to scream.

357
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,250
But...

358
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,250
none of this is Su A's fault.

359
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
I'm to blame,

360
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,160
and so is Cha Ki Beom,
who was framed.

361
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,790
But you're the one most at fault!

362
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,660
- What?
- Why did you have to find me again?

363
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,800
Why did you fall in love with me?

364
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,000
If you hadn't done all that,

365
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,010
I never would have wanted
to be with you,

366
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,040
and I never would've been separated
from my Su A, not for a second.

367
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,350
- The accident was avoidable too!
- Don't tell me...

368
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,380
you think I was behind
that accident too.

369
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,060
Whatever happened in the past,

370
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,930
I'll let it all go.

371
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,560
No matter what you've done.

372
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,530
But don't you dare hurt our Su A.

373
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,930
If you so much as
lay a finger on her,

374
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,370
I swear I will make you pay!

375
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,010
Looks like your taste in clothes
has gotten an upgrade.

376
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,580
A look fit for
the Kunhyang daughter-in-law.

377
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,720
Are you enjoying this?

378
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,920
- Are you thrilled?
- Can you hear it?

379
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,450
My heart pounding with joy.

380
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,960
- So this is how it felt to be you?
- Now do you get it?

381
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,890
Why I was so desperate
to have your life.

382
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,100
You clawed your way up from nothing
by snatching my life away.

383
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,300
We're in
completely different leagues.

384
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,570
You were born with everything.

385
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,640
And you got so sick
and tired of it all,

386
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,270
so you asked me to take your place.
That's all it was?

387
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,240
I'll give you this.
You found an opening...

388
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,980
and managed to drag me down
to this pathetic spot for a while.

389
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,480
- For that, I'm impressed.
- You said you were thrilled.

390
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,650
You said your heart was pounding.

391
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,890
Because now I know how it feels
to take something away.

392
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,720
That brazen face of one
who's never stolen anything.

393
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,460
Is that even comparable
to stealing a few design books?

394
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,100
I get to be Han Hye Ra's daughter.
Do you know how incredible it feels?

395
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,330
Because Han Hye Ra...

396
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,840
- is Kunhyang Group's vice chair?
- My mother...

397
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,970
No. She's your mom now, isn't she?

398
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,140
She's in a different league
than Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

399
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,080
She has dignity, restraint,

400
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,150
and a certain warmth.

401
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,890
- She's like a comforting blanket.
- She's a fake mom.

402
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,920
Don't tell me you're jealous.

403
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,460
You said you hated her for leaving.
That you'd get your revenge.

404
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,260
Go ahead. Be my guest.

405
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,630
I love being Han Hye Ra's daughter.

406
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,970
Don't get the wrong idea, Su A.

407
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,900
My mother...

408
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,010
isn't always a warm
and gentle spring breeze.

409
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,010
A paper cut can be more painful
than a deep gash,

410
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,150
and more than
a harsh winter blizzard,

411
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,520
a chilly autumn wind can sometimes
be more biting.

412
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,280
Playing the part of
the sister-in-law now?

413
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,920
I'm your elder sister-in-law.

414
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,190
Wouldn't you be wise
to take my advice?

415
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,590
- You will address me properly.
- Of course, sister-in-law.

416
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,830
I'm in your care now.

417
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,700
But the nightmare a sister-in-law
can raise...

418
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,470
can be more biting
than any autumn wind.

419
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,340
- You'd better brace yourself.
- Let's try to get along.

420
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,040
Are you two still looking around?

421
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,780
Mom, when can I move in?

422
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,820
I wish you could move in today.

423
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,920
I don't think that's wise, Mother.

424
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,290
She probably hasn't told
her parents yet.

425
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,460
That's true.
I'll go see them myself and...

426
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,800
- Let me go see them.
- You will?

427
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,800
From their perspective,

428
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,770
they'll feel like
their daughter is being stolen.

429
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,340
Rather than you going in person,

430
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,440
I think it'd be better
if I explain our family's position.

431
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,980
- Let's do as she suggests, Su A.
- Okay.

432
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,100
I hate being apart from you.
But let's just wait a few days.

433
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,130
I've waited 25 years.
What's a few more days?

434
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,340
It's just...

435
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,510
I'm scared you won't come back,
just like before.

436
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,350
That won't happen. Never.

437
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,250
We're only delaying
your move-in for a few days.

438
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,150
We'll still see each other
every day, right?

439
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,990
Come to the office tomorrow.
Let's get a nice lunch.

440
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,290
Okay.

441
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,220
Let's go.

442
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,610
Cha Jung Won is Cha Su A...

443
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,280
- No, wait, Jin Su A?
- I told you you'd be surprised.

444
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,380
You were craving a beer,
weren't you, honey?

445
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,350
I don't get what Father's thinking.

446
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,720
- How...
- How can he be so casual...

447
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,890
and treat Su A so warmly and kindly?

448
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,960
- Like he's her real father.
- About Mom's past...

449
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,030
He said he knew all about it,

450
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,200
but I just don't get it.

451
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,470
Because she's the fake Su A.

452
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,970
How many masks must someone wear
to act like that?

453
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,540
"Poker face" doesn't even begin
to cover it.

454
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,240
- To my own mother...
- He was so heartless.

455
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,020
Slow down.
Day drinking hits you harder.

456
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,020
- That's the idea.
- I know it's hard.

457
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,590
But still, try to be nice to Su A.

458
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,530
- It's not that easy.
- Without sincerity, be strategic.

459
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,630
Strategic?

460
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,570
Think of it as business.

461
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,740
For your future as the heir
to Kunhyang.

462
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,840
You're right.

463
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,990
Great minds think alike.
I was looking for a drinking buddy.

464
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,030
Along with a photo of
artist Hwang Mi Soo's diploma,

465
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,600
we have confirmed that
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra...

466
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,810
is not an alumna of that school.
What's more concerning...

467
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,640
is that the artist, Hwang Mi Soo,
is currently missing.

468
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,180
She has dignity, restraint,

469
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,350
and a certain warmth.

470
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,920
She's like a comforting blanket.

471
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Joo Young Chae.

472
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,690
You're about to see
the hideous true face...

473
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,760
of the Han Hye Ra
you think you know.

474
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,660
I'll wait out here for you
until you come out.

475
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,910
(A Graceful Liar)

476
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,740
Do you know I'm married
into the Kunhyang family too?

477
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,210
Why are you living in the house
where Han Hye Ra...

478
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,050
- and Jin Tae Seok live?
- Young Chae?

479
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,250
Will Cha Ki Beom and Jo Mi Hyang
give up Su A that easily?

480
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,220
Her adoptive parents will be shocked
if they find out.

481
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,490
They might be desperate
to cash in on the Kunhyang family.

482
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,530
You think poor people
are all leeches?

483
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,130
"Cash in?" How dare you think that?

484
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,360
Still not in the Kunhyang house?
Don't lose your footing this early.

485
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,430
Use your head!

486
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,700
You're my flesh and blood.

487
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,730
Who would do such a thing?

488
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,540
"Exposing the Real Han Hye Ra."

489
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,170
It has to be the work
of CEO Joo's fake sister.

490
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,910
This will blow over. It's nonsense.
In one ear and out the other.

491
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:34,840
You posted that anonymously, right?
To make me come beg for your help...

492
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,850
and be completely dependent on you?

493
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,020
