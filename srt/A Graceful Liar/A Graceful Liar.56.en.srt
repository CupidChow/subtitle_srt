00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,060
Designer Cha Jung Won?

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,790
- Yes.
- You did a great job.

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,200
Using natural materials
was a very innovative idea.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,300
The Chairman
and Vice Chairman liked it.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,340
Thank you.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,210
Jin Se Mi,
this isn't what we agreed on.

10
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,550
Designer Joo Young Chae.

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,620
- Yes?
- Your design has been chosen...

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,290
for next season's SS collection.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Really?

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,060
To prepare for the next season,
Designer Joo Young Chae...

15
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,970
has been appointed
as the interim team leader.

16
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,500
You will all take direction...

17
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,540
from interim leader
Joo Young Chae...

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,570
for the time being.

19
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,380
Thank you. I won't let you down.

20
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,980
Congratulations, Team Leader Joo.

21
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,030
You earned this one with your skill.
Congratulations.

22
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,470
I'm not thanking you for this.

23
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,010
Ha Neul, let's go see a movie.

24
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,590
- A movie? Just the two of us?
- Yes. Is that a problem?

25
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,860
- Today?
- Yes, today.

26
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,220
I already have plans.

27
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,890
I don't care.
I'm texting you the time and place.

28
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,800
And I'll wait for you to show up.

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
Wait...

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,600
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,200
There's no stopping her.

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,070
Joo Ha Neul, you'd better be there.

33
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,250
How did the designer selection go?

34
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,250
(Episode 56)

35
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,420
Joo Young Chae won, of course.

36
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,620
- Good.
- You came to your senses, right?

37
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,190
It can't be Cha Jung Won.
Absolutely not.

38
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,860
Did you ask Joo Ha Neul
to the movies?

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,500
What did he say?

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
He said he had plans,
but I insisted.

41
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,640
- Joo Ha Neul won't show up.
- What if he does?

42
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,770
Se Mi, I just don't want you
to get hurt too.

43
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,740
I mean it as your brother.

44
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,120
Designer Cha Jung Won,
can I have a word?

45
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,420
Yes.

46
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,560
You must be sad you weren't chosen.
Consider this a consolation prize.

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,700
Thank you.

48
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,700
It looks like you can go
with Designer Kim Sung Hee.

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,210
- First a stab, then a Band-Aid.
- It's a movie I wanted to see.

50
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,550
I'm sorry,

51
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,480
but it's my dad's birthday today.

52
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,550
Why don't you ask CEO Joo Ha Neul
to go with you?

53
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,220
It's fine. I'll just go by myself.

54
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,490
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,400
It's not right to just keep Se Mi
waiting like this.

56
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,400
I should go and tell her
where I stand.

57
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,880
(Movie Ticket Discount Information)

58
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,430
Jung Won.

59
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,430
Ha Neul, you're here
for a movie too?

60
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,960
Yes.

61
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
You too, Jung Won?

62
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,330
Yes.

63
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,500
Are you here alone?

64
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
The movie's about to start.

65
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,540
Watch it with me.

66
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,720
What's going on?
Why isn't Jin Se Hoon here?

67
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,920
And what are Cha Jung Won
and Ha Neul doing here together?

68
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,620
(Jin Se Hoon)

69
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,600
The number you have dialed
is not available.

70
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,270
Transferring to voicemail.

71
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,770
Please leave a message
after the beep.

72
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,540
He's ignoring me again?

73
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,250
I'm craving pasta.

74
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,790
Why did they have to meet here
at this hour...

75
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,560
to make me feel more pathetic?

76
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,330
This is so frustrating.

77
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,080
Turn around for a second.

78
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,380
There.

79
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,280
But you'll be cold too.

80
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,290
I'm not cold at all.
It feels nice and cool.

81
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,060
Aren't you hungry?

82
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,890
When I'm with you,
I'm not hungry at all.

83
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,900
(Roasted Sweet Potatoes)

84
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,580
Wait here. I'll be back in a flash.

85
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,620
- That looks so good.
- Here you go.

86
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,060
Your office is really cozy.

87
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,230
I've been sleeping here a lot,

88
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,100
and maybe that's why
it feels extra cozy.

89
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,570
Why are you looking at me like that?

90
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,470
You don't want to go home, do you?

91
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,440
Pretty much.

92
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,180
It's just uncomfortable
being with Madam Gong.

93
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,020
You're not comfortable
at the Kunhyang house either, right?

94
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,820
I can see why
you've been sleeping here.

95
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,620
In its own way,
it's cozy like you said.

96
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,830
Were you planning
on sleeping here tonight too?

97
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,930
I should go home.

98
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,940
You're walking such a hard path,

99
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,640
but I'm sorry
I can't tell you to stop...

100
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,910
or to turn back from it.

101
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,680
And I'm sorry I can't tell you...

102
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,320
to leave my side,
not to cover for me,

103
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,950
or watch over me.

104
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,390
We both have things we need to do.

105
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,360
Let's be bold.

106
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,860
Let's be bold.

107
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,060
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

108
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,170
What are you doing here?

109
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,640
Why weren't you at the theater?
You ignored my calls too.

110
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,240
Did you really think I'd show up?

111
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,940
Cha Jung Won and Joo Ha Neul
are acting like a couple in public.

112
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,910
They showed up at the theater
looking all sweet together.

113
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,220
Not Se Mi and Joo Ha Neul?

114
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,280
What do you mean?

115
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,990
Se Mi took the tickets you gave me.

116
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,960
You gave them to Director Jin Se Mi?

117
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,360
I threw them away.

118
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,630
And Se Mi picked them up.

119
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,060
You threw them away?

120
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Jin Se Hoon.

121
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,740
Did he catch on?

122
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,110
I'll help you forget Cha Jung Won.

123
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,520
Drink up.
And forget everything else.

124
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,430
Let me ask you one more thing.

125
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,200
Is there not even
a one-percent chance for me?

126
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,830
Am I really that unappealing?

127
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,980
- You jerk.
- You're right.

128
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,810
I'm a terrible person.

129
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,260
Just because he acts like this,
I'm not giving him up.

130
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,190
All I want...

131
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,560
is to be loved.

132
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,210
What's with all the moping?
It doesn't suit you.

133
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,570
This is all your fault.

134
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,980
Right. Everything is my fault,
including why you're so well-off.

135
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,310
Why? Are things not working out
with Jin Se Hoon?

136
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,480
I thought you had plans with him.

137
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,760
You're hiding something from me,
aren't you?

138
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,790
Just leave me alone!

139
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,590
Goodness, has she lost her mind?

140
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,160
That startled me.

141
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,600
The temper of that girl.

142
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,500
So she didn't manage to get him
into bed, did she?

143
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,010
Then again, what does it matter?

144
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,740
We just have to force it through,

145
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,740
and we can just say it happened,
and that'll be that.

146
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,320
Madam Sa, hello.
This is Gong Nan Sook.

147
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,560
So what do people
in the Kunhyang Association...

148
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,430
think about Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
these days?

149
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,160
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

150
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,900
Where is Chairman Jin?

151
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,540
After playing golf
with Assemblyman Jung,

152
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,900
he went to the spa.

153
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,810
That gives you about an hour.

154
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,910
Have you heard from Hwang Mi Soo?

155
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,980
Yes, thanks to you, Vice Chairman.

156
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,210
But how did you know?

157
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,980
That the Chairman was going
to harm my sister.

158
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,820
I had Secretary Yoon
track Chairman Jin's movements.

159
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,620
Someone who was about
to be discharged...

160
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,120
was sent to a closed ward.
It didn't sit right with me.

161
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,760
I will never forget
what you've done.

162
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,000
Please get up.

163
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,340
There's something I need you to do
for me, Manager Hwang.

164
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,480
Just say the word.

165
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,910
It's about Jo Yeong Ran,

166
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,650
Vice President Jin Se Hoon's birth mother.

167
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,790
I want to know...

168
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,690
- who did such a thing to her.
- Understood.

169
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,960
Work together with Secretary Yoon.

170
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,900
- But Chairman Jin Tae Seok...
- Don't worry.

171
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll make him believe
that I'm still his man.

172
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,540
Was Chairman Jin involved...

173
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,040
in Cha Ki Beom's death?

174
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,810
Are you still trying to protect...

175
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,780
Jin Tae Seok?

176
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,350
No, ma'am. I was afraid
you might get shocked.

177
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,390
Just tell me.

178
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,320
Don't leave anything out.

179
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,960
- Why are you here?
- We'll talk about that later.

180
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,430
- Did you really call 911?
- I told you I did.

181
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,900
Call them again! Tell them to hurry!

182
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,200
Hye Ra, calm down.

183
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,600
Secretary Yoon,
escort the Vice Chairman.

184
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,970
- We have to go, ma'am.
- No.

185
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,110
I'm waiting here
until the ambulance arrives.

186
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,170
Secretary Yoon!

187
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,580
We have to go.

188
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,450
This way, ma'am.

189
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,850
You have to save Ki Beom.

190
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,350
He's Su A's father.

191
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,020
Please, Tae Seok.

192
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,560
I promise. I'll ensure he's saved.

193
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,960
Manager Hwang, find out
if the ambulance is on its way.

194
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes, sir.

195
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,770
The ambulance...

196
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,540
was never called.

197
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,000
It was Chairman Jin's order.

198
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,310
So you're saying Chairman Jin...

199
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,080
just stood by and watched him die?

200
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,550
Cha Ki Beom.

201
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,220
Life is so unfair, isn't it?

202
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,690
This is your fate.

203
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,390
To die at Han Hye Ra's hands...

204
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,060
before I could deal with you myself.

205
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,970
What's wrong?

206
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,600
You're not dead yet?

207
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,240
I can't die like this.

208
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,810
Jin Tae Seok.

209
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,480
You're a monster.

210
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,490
It's done.

211
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,060
I'm busy. Call me later.

212
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,360
You'd better get out of there,
and fast.

213
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,460
CEO Joo Ha Neul will be there
any minute.

214
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,230
And Cha Jung Won, that brat,
might be with him.

215
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,000
Just as we wanted.

216
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,840
Gong Nan Sook.
From where was she watching us?

217
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,080
Should we just leave the body there?

218
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,110
Just leave it.

219
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,280
Su A has to know what Hye Ra did.

220
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,160
Jin Tae Seok, you are so dead.

221
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,030
Chairman Gong was there too.
I'm certain of it.

222
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
So Chairman Jin was behind it all.

(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

224
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,570
I am so sorry.

225
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,600
I couldn't stop him in the end.

226
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,100
How could he do such a thing?

227
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,710
And all this time, he let me believe
I was the one who killed Ki Beom.

228
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,180
Do you have any proof?

229
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,080
Proof that Jin Tae Seok...

230
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,550
did that to Ki Beom?

231
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,690
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,190
The video I recorded...

233
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,860
only goes up until the moment
you left.

234
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,930
Chairman Gong Nan Sook
must have filmed the whole thing.

235
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,090
Gong Nan Sook?

236
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,500
We have to find a way
to get our hands on her video.

237
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,870
I have to find out who let my mom...

238
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,340
die like that.

239
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,310
Chairman Jin gave me the same order.

240
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,480
My offer for you
to come work for me...

241
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,280
still stands.

242
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,490
I'll do my absolute best
to find out, Vice President Jin.

243
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,630
Let me give you one piece of advice.

244
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,270
Don't trust anyone.

245
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,500
Not even yourself, Se Hoon.

246
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,050
The one person I can't trust
is myself.

247
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,090
Look who's brooding all by himself.

248
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,520
It breaks your heart.

249
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,060
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

250
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,430
Care for a drinking buddy?

251
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,240
I should be going.

252
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,680
What's his deal?
He just blew me off.

253
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,310
Is he doing that on purpose?

254
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,960
Gong Nan Sook.

255
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,430
I never imagined that your home...

256
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:41,370
would feel like
a vast, insurmountable mountain.

257
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,830
And to think...

258
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,970
I once thought of you as my mother.

259
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,550
- What? Oh, gosh.
- Is Dad...

260
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,620
hitting you again?

261
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,050
Yes.

262
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,130
But it's okay. I never lose.

263
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,630
When you wake up in the morning,

264
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,800
your dad will be nice again.

265
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,530
I...

266
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,800
No, Mom...

267
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,870
can promise you.

268
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,170
Back then,
I just hoped that when morning came,

269
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,580
you'd be smiling
as if nothing ever happened.

270
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,450
But...

271
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,350
How dare you?

272
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,120
Hey! Shut your mouth! Are you crazy?

273
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,120
Let go of me! Darn it.

274
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,020
You must have a death wish.

275
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,020
- Fine.
- Fine!

276
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,390
- Go on, kill me.
- Die, you wench!

277
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,810
You're worrying me.
Why do you have to be sick?

278
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,310
Gosh, this kid.

279
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,510
One minute,
you're screaming your head off...

280
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,450
asking if your dad is dead.

281
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,310
Ha Neul.

282
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,050
My son.

283
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,350
Don't be sick. Okay?

284
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,090
That's how you'll grow up
to be strong.

285
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,730
Why did you force me...

286
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,030
to have no choice
but to hate and despise you?

287
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,870
Why?

288
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,060
Hye Ra.

289
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,000
What's wrong? Did something happen?

290
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,030
How long will you hide it,
Jin Tae Seok?

291
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,100
Hide what?

292
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,300
You set me up...

293
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,140
to take the fall
for killing Cha Ki Beom?

294
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,310
What makes you think that?
Why would I?

295
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,950
Gong Nan Sook offered me a deal.

296
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,880
That's a lie.

297
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,120
What kind of deal?

298
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,290
If I give her leverage on Kunhyang,

299
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,730
she said she'll give me proof
that you killed Ki Beom.

300
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,600
It's Gong Nan Sook
we're talking about.

301
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,400
Why would she do us any favors?
It's all a lie.

302
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,370
And as for what happened
to Se Hoon's mother,

303
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,240
I'll take care of everything.
I'll make sure you're clear of it.

304
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,440
Do you really think
I killed Yeong Ran?

305
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,850
- No, of course not.
- Then why?

306
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,250
Why are you framing me
for the murder of Se Hoon's mother?

307
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,890
- Hye Ra.
- It's getting harder to trust you.

308
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,520
I feel like...

309
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,830
you're conspiring with Gong Nan Sook
to put me in danger.

310
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,890
Then what about me?

311
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,860
- What am I supposed to do?
- Trust me.

312
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,170
No matter what, just do as I say,

313
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,570
and do exactly what I want you to.

314
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,370
That's your job, Han Hye Ra.

315
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,750
Are you off to work?

316
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,350
Come here for a minute.

317
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,620
So, how is your little conspiracy
coming along?

318
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,160
I thought you were ready to leave,
but you're still sticking around.

319
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,700
Is this you taking one step back
to take a giant leap forward?

320
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,400
I learned that from you, Madam Gong.

321
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,830
Keep your friends close,
and your enemies closer.

322
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,240
That's my boy. I taught you well.

323
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,470
- I'm so proud, my son.
- "My son?"

324
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,840
You disgust me.

325
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,180
Go after Han Hye Ra first.

326
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
What was that?

327
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,120
To get to me,
go after Han Hye Ra first.

328
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,520
That's how you rattle Jin Tae Seok,

329
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,790
and that's
what will get to me, right?

330
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,690
Are you telling your enemy
which cards to play?

331
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:02,990
Who said you're my enemy?

332
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,530
My goal is to take down
Han Hye Ra and Jin Tae Seok.

333
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,730
If you just leave me out of it,
then you, Cha Jung Won, and I...

334
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,870
share the same goal.

335
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,600
Just you wait.

336
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,940
I'll ensure you don't walk away
from this unscathed.

337
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,180
That kid...

338
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,150
He has no sense of humor at all.

339
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,350
Good thing he's handsome.

Chairman, this is the new product
we're launching this time.

344
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:50,040
- Really?
- Our hard work finally paid off.

345
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,180
It's all thanks
to your support, Chairman.

346
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,880
You're the one who did
all the hard work, Director.

347
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,520
My knees have been aching
when I take the stairs lately.

348
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,750
Let me give it a try.

349
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,230
What do you think, sir?

350
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,330
I just took it. What do you expect?

351
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,000
I do feel like my joints
are moving more smoothly. I like it.

352
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,270
We paid a lot of attention
to the package design as well.

353
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,210
What are your thoughts, Chairman?

354
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,570
I don't really know much
about design,

355
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,940
so let's ask one of our experts.

356
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,180
Ask a designer from the Design Team
to come up. Anyone will do.

357
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,230
Yes, this is
the Kunhyang Group Design Team.

358
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,500
Yes, I understand.

359
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,340
We just got a call
from the Chairman's office.

360
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,740
They're asking for any designer
to come up.

361
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,710
Sounds like a perfect title for you.
"Any Designer."

362
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,680
Then would you like to go,
Designer Ahn Ji Na?

363
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,580
No, I'll pass.
Because I'm not just "anyone."

364
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,960
- Should I go?
- Keep working. I'll go.

365
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,340
You wanted to see me?

366
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,840
Designer Cha Jung Won,

367
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,640
this is our chief director.
Please say hello.

368
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,010
Hello, sir. I'm Cha Jung Won
from the Design Team.

369
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,310
Yes, a pleasure to meet you.

370
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,150
Give us your expert opinion.

371
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,350
What do you think of the design
of the package?

372
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,260
I like its sleek design,

373
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,370
and that you can tell what it
is at a glance.

374
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,970
It's also perfect for daily use,
which will be great for knee health.

375
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,070
Thank you.

376
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,970
I've heard there's a lot
of customer anticipation...

377
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,340
for the new launch.

378
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,580
I'm sure it will be a great success.

379
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,380
You've been keeping up with that?

380
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,880
It's a Kunhyang Group matter,
after all.

381
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,190
I had no idea you were so invested
in company affairs, Designer Cha.

382
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:31,370
Who in the world dares to sit
so brazenly in my seat?

383
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,500
Manager Gu, get to it.

384
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Yes, ma'am.

385
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,180
What?

386
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,180
(The Crown Capital)

387
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,760
If it isn't the great Chairman Jin
of Kunhyang.

388
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,590
Did you have your eye on my seat?

389
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,560
Did you try to pull something
on Hye Ra?

390
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,430
- Pull something?
- Did you tell Hye Ra...

391
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,030
that I killed Ki Beom?

392
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,800
Han Hye Ra told you a lie like that?

393
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,740
And you just fell for it?

394
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,010
Hye Ra telling a die?
That's impossible.

395
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,340
You must have planted the idea
in her head to make her suspicious.

396
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,680
She said you asked her
for leverage on Kunhyang.

397
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,850
And in return, you offered proof
that I eliminated Cha Ki Beom.

398
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,020
Gosh, Han Hye Ra's good.

399
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,990
I'm an excellent judge of character.

400
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,330
You still see her through
rose-colored glasses.

401
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,900
Han Hye Ra might just be
a bigger monster than me.

402
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,170
Gong Nan Sook, do you think
I can't see what you're up to?

403
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,840
Trying to drive a wedge between us
to exploit the situation?

404
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,140
Hoping to swallow Kunhyang whole?

405
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,980
If I could have done that,
I would have ages ago.

406
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,620
Han Hye Ra is the one
driving a wedge between you and me.

407
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,890
Snap out of it, you fool.

408
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:03,060
- Am I still the prime suspect?
- That's correct.

409
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,000
The doctor who got bribed
said you gave the order.

410
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,970
But I thought
all the security cameras were down.

411
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,540
There's also a witness who saw you
entering the hospital room.

412
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,210
- I checked on her, then killed her?
- You're being framed.

413
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,020
Speak your mind.

414
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:29,520
I've given the same report
to Vice President Jin.

415
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,690
- I apologize.
- I understand your position.

416
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,790
As you should.

417
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,500
Manager Hwang,
do you suspect me as well?

418
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,570
That's a difficult question
to answer.

419
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,200
You helped my sister,

420
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,800
but the issue with
Vice President Jin's mother...

421
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,970
is a different matter.

422
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,070
Don't give up. Keep digging.

423
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Find out what really happened.

424
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,580
Understood.

425
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,420
Keep buying up more shares
of The Crown Capital.

426
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,120
And do it quietly.

427
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,320
No one can know I'm behind this.

428
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,200
What is this?

429
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,100
Proof that I am
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra's daughter.

430
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,710
Are you sure
I can run a story on this?

431
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,380
My boss walks on eggshells
around Kunhyang.

432
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,620
so it may take a few days to clear.

433
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
As long as the truth gets out.

434
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,120
That's all that matters.

435
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,220
(A Graceful Liar)

436
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,710
You told Jin Tae Seok I offered you
a deal to get rid of him?

437
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,650
With you, Gong Nan Sook,
we can have a symbiosis.

438
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,250
Then secure a spot for my Young Chae
right by Jin Se Hoon's side.

439
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,050
I'm Joo Young Chae,
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter.

440
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,620
That's right.
She's my daughter-in-law.

441
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,690
Why are you going to such lengths?
Why must you be with me so badly?

442
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:50,160
Because I have a new life goal now.
To destroy Cha Jung Won.

443
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,100
- I think my Young Chae is pregnant.
- Pregnant?

444
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,600
Is it true?

445
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
