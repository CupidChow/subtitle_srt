1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,240
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,270
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,140
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,520
But I heard my pressure and sugar
are fine.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,890
So why on earth do I have
to get my blood drawn?

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,260
You know a blood test can reveal
a lot about your health, right?

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,230
I heard you gave Cha Jung Won
a blood transfusion.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,530
Let's just say
I was feeling charitable.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,870
I wonder why
you would bother to do that.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,970
She has B-negative blood.
It's a very rare blood type.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,780
That blood type. B-negative is rare?

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,080
Yes. Only about 0.1 percent
of the population has it.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,390
Is that right?

14
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,430
You sent for me?

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,330
Last time, Grandma said this.

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,030
This is all your fault, you witch!

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,370
If only you hadn't egged them on!

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,640
No one could ever do that
to their own child!

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,070
You'll burn in fiery pit, you witch!

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,380
There's something more going on,
right?

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,320
I heard Jin Tae Seok gave
Cha Jung Won a blood transfusion.

22
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,580
And what's more,

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,190
they both have the same rare
B-negative blood type.

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,690
Something smells fishy.

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,090
Did I say that?

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,800
I don't remember.

27
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,270
Don't tell me you have the memory
of a goldfish, just like Young Chae.

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,040
You're hiding something, aren't you?

29
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,870
Why are you asking me?

30
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,640
Take them to a hospital
and get them tested.

31
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,640
You're right.

32
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,850
I need to confirm the facts first.
Yes, that'll do it.

33
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,720
Tell Designer Cha Jung Won
to come to my office in 30 minutes.

34
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,790
Understood.

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,660
What do you think you're doing?

36
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,460
There we go.

37
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,260
This side for Han Hye Ra,
and this side for Gong Nan Sook.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,170
Keep the nameplate visible this way.
You should let the air circulate.

39
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,070
Do you hate being in my shadow
that much?

40
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,510
I used to be called Queen Nan Sook.
I was treated like a queen.

41
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
What do you want?

42
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,820
The chairman doesn't have time
for idle chit-chat, you know.

43
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,090
Bring us two teas.

44
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,860
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

45
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,490
Make them the prettiest
and the most expensive in the world.

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,830
What?

47
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,570
My Jung Won is Jin Tae Seok's
flesh and blood?

48
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,340
Don't be ridiculous.

49
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,410
Did Cha Ki Beom have
B-negative blood type by any chance?

50
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,950
I don't really remember.

51
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,550
But I always thought
Jung Won was just regular type B.

52
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,120
We separated when she was young,
so I could be mistaken.

53
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,330
But seriously, how can two men
have the exact same rare blood type?

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,300
Hey, Han Hye Ra, are you
some kind of vampire...

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,700
that only preys
on men with B-negative blood?

56
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,340
Cut the crap.

57
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,940
She really takes after me,
saying such vulgar things so freely.

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,280
This is a real problem.

59
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,980
When I get curious about something,
I have to get to the bottom of it.

60
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,720
Think about it carefully.

61
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,590
What if there's a chance
Cha Jung Won is Jin Tae Seok's kid,

62
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,590
even if it's one in a million...

63
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,130
I said, shut up!

64
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,280
Look. Cha Jung Won.

65
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,510
Are you really
Cha Ki Beom's daughter?

66
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,280
And what if
I'm not my father's daughter?

67
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,450
His death was tragic enough
as it is.

68
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,920
- I have somewhere I need to be.
- Wait.

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,130
Don't you think that's strange?

70
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,630
What is?

71
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,760
That you share a rare blood type
with Jin Tae Seok.

72
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,000
You don't find that strange?

73
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,800
B-negative, you mean?

74
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

75
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,040
After everything, now you're trying
to say I'm Chairman Jin's daughter?

76
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,710
I'm just dying of curiosity.

77
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,490
You want me to deliver the painting
from the gallery to Madam Sa?

78
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,800
This isn't for an exhibition, is it?

79
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,430
You're right.

80
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,100
I heard Madam Sa's family
are key figures in the ruling party.

81
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,110
You're funneling political funds
through paintings, aren't you?

82
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,610
It's by a rising artist,
so it's not too expensive now.

83
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,680
In a few years, at ten,
or even twenty times the price,

84
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,580
- Kunhyang Gallery will buy it back.
- And the profit margin...

85
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,390
will be a staggering amount.

86
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,620
It's one of the reasons
conglomerates run art galleries.

87
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,790
(Chairman Han Hye Ra)

88
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,860
This is the list.

89
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,400
It details all the art transactions.

90
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,540
This is the original,

91
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,340
so keep it safe.

92
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,340
Why are you giving this to me?

93
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,580
Because you're the gallery director.

94
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,710
So this is what
being the director is about?

95
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,620
A courier delivering political funds
through art.

96
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,950
This could be your undoing,

97
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,690
or it could be what saves you.

98
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,760
The moment you're given power,

99
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,130
you're put to the test.

100
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,560
So, now I'm in charge of...

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,530
managing Kunhyang Group's
slush fund?

102
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,500
You can handle it, can't you?

103
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,470
I won't run away from it.

104
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,170
But...

105
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,710
- But?
- If I take this on,

106
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,340
I’ll manage it with responsibility.

107
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,710
I won't just be the director
in name only.

108
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,980
I'll be watching.

109
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,920
As long as you have
Kunhyang Group's slush fund ledger,

110
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,090
Jin Tae Seok won't be able
to harm you so easily, Jung Won.

111
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,500
Am I taking too long
to make my moves lately?

112
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,540
Not at all, Manager Gu.
You always take your time.

113
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,140
Is that right?

114
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,150
We acquired the Kunhyang shares
faster than I thought.

115
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,050
Right. Given our liquidated assets,
this is the expected result.

116
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,260
The full 15 percent from David K,

117
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,060
and five percent
of my ten percent, correct?

118
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,360
Yes. I sold them off bit by bit
instead of all at once.

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,700
I used several accounts for funds
before buying the Kunhyang shares...

120
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,900
to make the source harder to trace.

121
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,840
You're impressive as always,
Manager Gu.

122
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,940
You really are the brains
behind this whole operation.

123
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,150
There's no way Kunhyang will trace
the money back to The Crown Capital.

124
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,690
Checkmate.

125
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,890
You beat me again.

126
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,330
It must be exhausting,
pretending to be dumb all the time.

127
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,590
But I am dumb.

128
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,860
- That's why I look so young.
- Please.

129
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,870
- Yes, Chairman.
- Gu Yeong Soo! Come here at once!

130
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,640
You've gotten lazy.

131
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
I'll be there in a flash.

132
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,920
You said you'd do anything,
didn't you?

133
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,460
If I keep your fake pregnancy
a secret from Se Hoon.

134
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,560
Yes. Anything.

135
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,130
I need you to be my informant.

136
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,100
Everything that goes on
at Kunhyang Group,

137
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,940
especially what Se Hoon is up to.

138
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,310
Report every single detail to me.

139
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,980
- You don't trust Se Hoon?
- Young Chae, do you trust him?

140
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,050
And your mother, Gong Nan Sook?
Can you trust her?

141
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,450
Who can you trust in this world?

142
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,520
See? You get it.

143
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,330
When it comes to greed,
family ties mean nothing.

144
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,800
Se Hoon's not himself lately.

145
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,570
I'll be on your side, Father.

146
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,070
Se Hoon...

147
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,570
adores our A Reum.

148
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,540
Of course.

149
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,040
You have to believe
the lie yourself...

150
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,580
- before you can fool anyone else.
- You will have...

151
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,720
what you want.

152
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,550
Go on and work on Se Hoon.

153
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,950
So I can get Kunhyang back...

154
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,990
right in the palm of my hand.

155
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,670
- What are you doing with my coffee?
- You're pregnant.

156
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,110
Aren't you?

157
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,940
Who said I wasn't?

158
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,150
Don't you know coffee
is bad for the baby?

159
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,010
And it looks like
you've been drinking, too.

160
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,220
What I eat is none of your business.
You're so annoying.

161
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,860
You're acting a bit strange,
Designer Joo Young Chae.

162
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,030
I thought motherhood was supposed
to make you more responsible.

163
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,300
What are you looking at?

164
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,570
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,050
What are you doing here?

166
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,520
This is going to be my seat soon.
Do I need your permission to try it?

167
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,990
Vice President Jin Se Hoon.

168
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,530
I am the Vice Chairman,
officially appointed by the board.

169
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,960
Now, get back to work.
You must have a lot to catch up on.

170
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,930
(Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul)

171
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,240
You're right.

172
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,510
This seat belongs to
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul.

173
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,970
Forgive my rudeness.

174
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,510
Is there something you need?

175
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,650
You've been working so hard
for Kunhyang.

176
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,220
I was hoping you'd let me
treat you to dinner at my place.

177
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,520
Will you accept my invitation?

178
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,690
(Chairman Han Hye Ra)

179
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,330
My Jung Won is Jin Tae Seok's
flesh and blood?

180
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,900
Don't be ridiculous.

181
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,010
Did Cha Ki Beom have
B-negative blood type by any chance?

182
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,980
When I get curious about something,
I have to get to the bottom of it.

183
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,720
Think about it carefully.

184
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,420
What if there's a chance
Cha Jung Won is Jin Tae Seok's kid,

185
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,890
even if it's one in a million...

186
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,060
That's absurd.

187
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
How could something like that
possibly happen?

188
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,370
What's wrong?

189
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,400
No, it can't be.

190
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,770
There's absolutely no way.

191
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,640
How could our Jung Won
be Jin Tae Seok's...

192
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,410
It can't be true, right?

193
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,910
Hye Ra, get a grip.
What's gotten into you?

194
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,320
It can't be, can it?

195
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,890
How can my Jung Won be his daughter?
It can't be true, right?

196
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,660
What would make you think that?

197
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,920
Is there even a one percent chance
it could be true?

198
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,840
Gu Yeong Soo, that brat.
He's always slacking off.

199
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,080
- My eyebrows are gone, aren't they?
- What are you talking about?

200
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,140
I ran over here so fast
that they must have flown off.

201
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,850
What can I do for you?

202
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,580
What were you just doing?

203
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,950
- I was playing chess.
- With Ha Neul?

204
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,020
Yes.

205
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,220
Are you doing your job right?
Helping Ha Neul buy up stock...

206
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,120
from that David K, or whatever?
Is that going well?

207
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
I'm just following your orders.

208
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,130
That's what I expect.

209
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,800
But I do have one question.

210
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,400
Vice Chairman Joo could turn on you,

211
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,440
so why did you order me to help him?

212
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,910
Didn't I tell you?
No questions asked,

213
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,580
- you just do as I say.
- I'll only do what you've ordered.

214
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,450
I need you to run a DNA test
on Cha Jung Won and Jin Tae Seok.

215
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
And be discreet.

216
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,950
Yes. Cha Jung Won and Han Hye Ra...

217
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,190
Wait, we already did that,
didn't we?

218
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,430
This time, you mean
Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

219
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,030
I need to confirm this
once and for all.

220
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,340
A month before I married Ki Beom,

221
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,310
Jin Tae Seok came to see me.

222
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,280
We had already broken up by then,

223
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,210
but he said he couldn't bear it
and that he missed me.

224
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,180
Tae Seok.

225
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,620
I couldn't turn my back on him.

226
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,860
That can't be true, can it?

227
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,190
I'll look into it.

228
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,760
Fate wouldn't...

229
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,170
punish me like this, would it?

230
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,770
I'm sure it's not true, Hye Ra.

231
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,880
I can't make it today. My team
has a dinner at Kunhyang house.

232
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,610
A team dinner? Are you kidding me?
Now is not the time for that!

233
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,150
I'm doing it to get a rise out
of Cha Jung Won and Ha Neul.

234
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,790
I have to show them
just how sweet Se Hoon is to me.

235
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,590
So today is D-Day.

236
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,430
- D-Day?
- Listen to me carefully.

237
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,890
We'll do the pretend play once more.

238
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,000
Pretend play?

239
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,860
Mom.

240
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,540
At this rate, Se Hoon will find out
you're faking your pregnancy.

241
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,570
Just play your part
right this one time. Okay?

242
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,910
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

243
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,880
Why did they go out of their way
to invite you to the Kunhyang house?

244
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,750
I didn't realize
the entire Design Team was invited.

245
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,020
If you're uncomfortable, don't come.

246
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
No.

247
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,090
I'm going to find out
why they invited me.

248
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,700
I'm not going to run from it.
I'll face it head-on.

249
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,970
Boldly.

250
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,770
Boldly.

251
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,370
Please, everyone, help yourselves.

252
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,480
Please care for
Young Chae and Se Mi.

253
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,610
Yes, Vice President.

254
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,010
Here, honey, try this.

255
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,750
You're too skinny.
You need to eat well for A Reum.

256
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,020
Thank you, Se Hoon.

257
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,260
So when's your due date?

258
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,260
Well...

259
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,470
I wish it were tomorrow.
I can't wait to meet our A Reum.

260
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,800
Se Hoon, you're making
the single ladies so jealous.

261
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,370
If you're so jealous,
why don't you get married?

262
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,640
Ha Neul,

263
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,080
why don't you hurry up
and marry my sister?

264
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,150
Director Jin Se Mi decided
not to stay single.

265
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,450
All because of
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul.

266
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,190
But hasn't that ship sailed?

267
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,690
It seems like
Vice Chairman Joo's heart is elsewhere.

268
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,730
Let's drop the subject.

269
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,630
This may be my home,
but this is a work function.

270
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,930
You didn't know?

271
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,770
- Se Mi and Ha Neul are dating.
- Joo Young Chae.

272
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,940
- Why are you saying such nonsense?
- Se Mi?

273
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,810
We'll give you our full support.

274
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,280
This is your chance,
so make it work.

275
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,880
Stop making things so awkward.

276
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,490
These braised ribs
are seasoned perfectly.

277
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,060
- Ha Neul, why not go comfort Se Mi?
- Stop it.

278
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,130
Stop what?

279
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,400
Stop playing with people's feelings.
It's malicious.

280
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,540
Malicious? Look who's talking.

281
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,240
You backstabbed me
for your Vice Chairman title.

282
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,610
Vice President Jin, please stop.

283
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,350
- Ha Neul, you stop too.
- Am I wrong?

284
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,120
If you have something to say to me,
let's talk in private.

285
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,060
Stop making a scene.

286
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Come outside.

287
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,800
Where do you think you're going?
I'm not finished.

288
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,000
- Let go of me.
- No.

289
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,870
Se Hoon, stop! People are watching.
Ha Neul, go, quickly!

290
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,270
Get back here!

291
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,140
- Young Chae, are you okay?
- Young Chae!

292
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,210
It hurts!

293
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,510
Cha Jung Won pushed me!

294
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,920
- Ha Neul, let's go to the hospital.
- Right. Young Chae.

295
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,960
Call my mom! Quick!

296
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,300
A miscarriage is no different
than giving birth.

297
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,700
That's why you need to rest
and recover properly.

298
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,510
My poor A Reum...

299
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,350
Wait.
Once Young Chae has calmed down...

300
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,790
You understand, don't you?

301
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,220
Yes, ma'am.

302
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,800
Really, the things you do...

303
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,610
Anyone watching would think
you actually had a miscarriage.

304
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,370
It felt like she was real.
My A Reum.

305
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,280
Then you can just have one.
A real A Reum.

306
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,610
Chairman Jin Tae Seok knows
the pregnancy was fake.

307
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,680
He'll know the miscarriage
was just an act, too.

308
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,450
I'll make sure
Chairman Jin Tae Seok keeps quiet,

309
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,060
so please, just clear your head
and get some rest for a few days.

310
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,420
Mom.

311
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,960
What if Se Hoon doesn't want me
now that I'm not having A Reum?

312
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,630
A miscarriage?

313
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,470
Why didn't you call me?

314
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,870
Dad told me not to...

315
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,910
What?

316
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,250
I heard Young Chae
had a miscarriage.

317
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,620
Why did you tell Se Mi
not to tell me?

318
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,220
Why do you think?

319
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,630
- What's that supposed to mean?
- There was no need...

320
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,800
Because it wasn't worth mentioning.

321
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,260
"Not worth mentioning?"

322
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,200
It was Se Hoon's baby,
your blood relative.

323
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,540
The pregnancy was a fake.

324
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,010
- I had my suspicions.
- This was all Gong Nan Sook's idea.

325
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,140
How did you find out?

326
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,980
I saw it with my own eyes.

327
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,550
I saw Young Chae
hiding the fake belly.

328
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,920
- How could they do such a thing?
- We can't tell Se Hoon, right?

329
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,330
Do you really think
it will stay a secret?

330
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,860
True.

331
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,300
Secrets have a way of getting out.

332
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,270
And yet,

333
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,340
there have been so many things...

334
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,740
I've wanted to hide forever
from you.

335
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,240
I don't want to hear your excuses.

336
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,420
This is breaking my heart.

337
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,290
To think that Hye Ra
would turn her back on me.

338
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,190
How can she do this to me?

339
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,900
Cha Jung Won...

340
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,170
I should have finished her
when I had the chance.

341
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,580
Here.

342
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,380
This will help you calm down.

343
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,650
Young Chae
must be going through a lot.

344
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,550
It was her first pregnancy.

345
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,150
I'm upset, too. It breaks my heart
just thinking about her.

346
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,420
You should get home.

347
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,690
Young Chae is probably
at Chairman Gong's house.

348
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,430
I should.

349
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,170
It hurts!

350
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,000
Cha Jung Won pushed me!

351
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,070
Are you still bothered by
what Young Chae said earlier?

352
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,580
No one blames you.
Don't blame yourself.

353
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,520
But will other people...

354
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,020
believe me like you do?

355
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,960
Maybe I'm overreacting.

356
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,760
I should just hope for
Young Chae's speedy recovery.

357
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,960
(Kunhyang Group)

358
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,000
Wait, what are you saying?
Because of Designer Cha Jung Won,

359
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,740
Designer Joo Young Chae
had a miscarriage?

360
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,770
I didn't get a good look,

361
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,010
but when Young Chae fell,
holding her belly,

362
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,580
she kept screaming and saying
Cha Jung Won pushed her.

363
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,120
- Don't spread baseless rumors.
- She's right.

364
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
You heard?

365
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,960
No, I wasn't saying
that's what actually happened.

366
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,360
That's right. You'd never do that.

367
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,730
Let's begin the meeting.

368
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,730
For next year's
Fall and Winter collection,

369
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,700
I'm thinking of going
with a tailored look.

370
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,880
We've lost our precious grandchild.

371
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,810
What are we going to do? Oh, dear.

372
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,950
This is pathetic.

373
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,720
Enough with the crocodile tears.

374
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,160
Don't you know? The walls have ears.

375
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,560
Why are you trying to spill secrets,
Honorary Chairman?

376
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,400
Whether or not I spill that secret
is entirely in your hands.

377
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,740
I, Jin Tae Seok, had Kunhyang
wrapped around my little finger,

378
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,510
but now I'm getting antsy
just wandering around like a loafer.

379
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,410
Who was it
that pushed me over the edge?

380
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,410
What? Did I kill Joo Sang Cheol?

381
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,480
I'm sorry.

382
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,380
I know it's been twenty five years,

383
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,650
I sincerely apologize.

384
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,650
Kneel.

385
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
What?

386
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,290
Kneel before me. Then I'll decide
if I'll forgive you...

387
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,130
or if I even feel like
considering it.

388
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,440
After all this, you expect me...

389
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,470
to get on my knees before you?

390
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,270
Has this old hag lost her mind?

391
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,140
That's right.

392
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,650
Young Chae's fake pregnancy?
Go on, tell the whole world!

393
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,220
You think
I'll so much as bat an eye?

394
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,590
Did you think that weak card
would work on me...

395
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,320
after I've already turned my back?

396
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,490
- Dream on!
- I'd sooner die...

397
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,900
than kneel before
a low-life loan shark like you.

398
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,470
Never.

399
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:54,340
Fine, hold out. I'll make sure
you can just play around forever...

400
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,010
and laze around
on a permanent vacation.

401
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,740
I can't stand the sight of you.
Get lost!

402
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,510
How much longer
do I have to stay in bed?

403
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,850
I'm so sick of this.

404
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Se Hoon?

405
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,730
You're awake?
Let's get you some porridge.

406
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,010
Try this.

407
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,510
- What's with you? You scare me.
- Just have one bite.

408
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,020
Without A Reum, Joo Young Chae...

409
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,060
is nothing to you, right?

410
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,790
I thought I'd feel that way.

411
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,240
You've suffered a lot because of me,
haven't you?

412
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,540
We can always have another baby.

413
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,110
Thank you, Se Hoon.

414
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,620
Let's focus on your recovery first,
Young Chae.

415
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,620
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...

416
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,390
Se Hoon, that brat.
He's not even taking my calls.

417
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,130
It's been a while, Madam Sa.

418
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,470
As expected, you're the only one
who worries about me...

419
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,770
What do you mean?

420
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,210
Cha Jung Won gave you
a painting as a gift?

421
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,780
So you're saying that Han Hye Ra...

422
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,590
made Cha Jung Won gallery director
to manage the group's slush fund?

423
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,520
That appears to be the case.

424
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,130
Bring me the slush fund records.

425
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,370
- What?
- Sir, you above all should know.

426
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,540
Until now,
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra...

427
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,340
I mean, the Chairman...

428
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,010
was the one in complete control
of the Kunhyang Group's slush fund.

429
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,310
There has to be an original
or at least a copy!

430
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,210
She took everything
as soon as she became Chairman.

431
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
What?

432
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,220
She even allowed Cha Jung Won
to manage the slush fund records?

433
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,690
I wouldn't know about that.

434
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,790
So Han Hye Ra has my hands
completely tied.

435
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,200
Han Hye Ra.

436
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,600
The person most precious to you...

437
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,430
was Cha Jung Won?

438
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,300
Just as I thought,
I can't leave her be.

439
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,040
Chairman Jin Tae Seok
must be absolutely furious.

440
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,010
I'm worried he'll try
to harm Cha Jung Won again.

441
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,280
I should have made sure
I poisoned his drinks that day.

442
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,920
Jung Won, you can't go anywhere
by yourself.

443
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,450
What happened to me once
was more than enough.

444
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,190
I'll never let it happen again.

445
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,030
I'll stay by Jung Won's side
and protect her.

446
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,930
Good. Until Jin Tae Seok
is finished for good,

447
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,900
I won't be able to sleep soundly.

448
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,750
Cha Jung Won.

449
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,950
You should have died that day.

450
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,790
That's how it was supposed to be.

451
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,030
Then...

452
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,000
neither of us would need
to go through all this.

453
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,840
(There is a 99.998 percent chance
of a biological relationship.)

454
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,340
Oh my goodness! So, it's true then?

455
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,780
Don't you think Chairman Han Hye Ra
ran her own test too?

456
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,780
She must have.

457
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,390
99.9...

458
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,790
Wait. Is this real?

459
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,100
I know. I was in denial myself,
but it turns out it's true.

460
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,130
Isn't it possible
you faked the results again?

461
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,870
Why on earth would I fake this?

462
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,240
I'm reeling from the shock myself.

463
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,540
Right, Manager Gu?

464
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,450
He's barely
holding it together himself.

465
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,110
I don't get it.

466
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,220
She's not his child,
but why is he staring blankly?

467
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Hey!

468
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,680
Chairman Han,
Cha Jung Won is in danger.

469
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,680
(A Graceful Liar)

470
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,270
Are you serious?
Did Jin Tae Seok do that to her...

471
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,670
knowing Jung Won
is his own daughter?

472
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,280
Could he really kill Cha Jung Won,
knowing she's his daughter?

473
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,350
Is a person's life a joke to you?

474
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,680
To think that little brat
could be my daughter.

475
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,780
I also told Jung Won...

476
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,290
that Jin Tae Seok
is her real father.

477
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,520
What if being his daughter
made him want to kill me even more?

478
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:22,430
If I'd known sooner,
I would've nipped it in the bud.

479
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,900
Oh my. You're pure evil.

480
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,730
