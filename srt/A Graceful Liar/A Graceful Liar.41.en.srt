00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,670
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,040
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,140
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,780
The anonymous post's IP traces
back to where?

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,150
The Kunhyang house annex?

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,350
The room that only Young Chae uses?

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,950
Why would Young Chae
do something like that?

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,450
Don't jump to conclusions, Father.

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,460
- Someone could be framing her.
- Who?

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,490
Who would frame the daughter-in-law
of the Kunhyang family?

11
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,130
Maybe someone else sees
Young Chae as a threat.

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,070
Se Hoon, what are you getting at?

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,240
Please keep this between us
until it's confirmed, Father.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,200
I need to find out
if it was really Young Chae...

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,910
or if someone else...

16
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,440
dared to target
the daughter-in-law of Kunhyang.

17
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,480
I will find out.

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,280
And what if
it really was Young Chae?

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,950
I will step in if it is.

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,720
Leaking dirt on her mother-in-law
to the press?

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,430
Trying to rattle Kunhyang Group?

22
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,700
Then she doesn't belong
in the Kunhyang family.

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,900
Does Mother know about this?

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,780
Mother.

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,080
You've started my portrait again.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,250
This time, I'll capture...

27
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,690
- your true self.
- It looks different from before.

28
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,260
You'll see when it's finished.

29
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,800
Warm and affectionate
on the outside,

30
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,470
but full of lies on the inside?

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,270
You must be capturing
the heartless woman...

32
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,010
who abandoned her child
with another man...

33
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,910
to become the lady
of the Kunhyang family.

34
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,440
Why did you do it?

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,220
Why did you abandon
your seven-year-old daughter?

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,520
How can you go on with such a serene
and happy look on your face?

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,620
So that's why you did it.

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,760
And to think how highly
I thought of you.

39
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,330
I thought of you as my own daughter.

40
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,660
How could you do something so vile?

41
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,930
You're despicable.

42
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,300
I don't need a daughter-in-law
like you.

43
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,770
Get out now.

44
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,640
- Get out of the Kunhyang house!
- You're kicking me out?

45
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,950
So you're abandoning
your daughter-in-law now too?

46
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,650
- What?
- I'm sure this is easy for you...

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,980
since it's not your first time.

48
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,720
So you hate me now, don't you?

49
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,960
You despise me
for abandoning my daughter...

50
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,060
and for betraying my ex-husband
and running away?

51
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,160
I can't say you're wrong.

52
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,100
If I were Su A...

53
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,930
If you were Su A?

54
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,170
I would never forgive you. Ever.

55
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,970
Who do you think you are
to say that to me?

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,510
Who do you think you are
to look at me like that?

57
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,010
Young Chae,
who do you think you are?

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
That's enough!

59
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,820
Young Chae is my wife.

60
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,350
You can't disrespect her, Mother!

61
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,920
Let's go.

62
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,130
(Episode 41)

63
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,270
Drink this.
It'll help you calm down.

64
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,610
It wasn't you, was it?

65
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,340
The anonymous post?

66
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,380
The article about Su A?

67
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,420
You think I did it too?

68
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,980
Of course not.

69
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,990
You're not someone
who would do that.

70
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,250
So besides you,

71
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,320
everyone else in this family
thinks I did it, right?

72
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,460
Well, the circumstances
are a bit suspicious.

73
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,530
The post was traced back
to the room you use by yourself.

74
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,930
It is the room I use by myself,

75
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,430
but that doesn't mean
I'm the only one who goes in there.

76
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,100
How many maids work
in the annex alone?

77
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,640
The Kunhyang Group secretaries,
your mother, father, even Se Mi...

78
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,270
Any one of them could get in
if they really wanted to.

79
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,540
Su A.

80
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,980
Don't tell me you think...

81
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,050
If it was Su A... No.

82
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,220
If it was Cha Jung Won,
who pretended to be you...

83
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,550
and kidnapped Park Kyung Shin,

84
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,990
she is more than capable
of doing something like that.

85
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,850
I'm not sure yet, though.

86
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,090
But I'll get to the bottom of this.
I swear.

87
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,430
Your mother must be so upset.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
She must think I really did it.

89
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,900
You're more worried
about my mother right now?

90
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,710
You're so kind-hearted.

91
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,080
That's why you always get hurt.

92
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,150
As long as you believe me,
that's all that matters.

93
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,980
Then even when I'm hurt,
it'll heal right away.

94
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,550
I still miss you,

95
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,350
and I miss you even when we're together,
my Young Chae.

96
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,890
I hope your feelings
remain the same forever.

97
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,260
They will.

98
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,060
Your name, Joo Young Chae,
is already engraved in my heart.

99
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,700
And it can never be erased.

100
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,040
- I love you, Young Chae.
- I love you too.

101
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,910
What?

102
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,050
Se Hoon defended Young Chae
to your face?

103
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,450
I should've gone after him.
I would've told him off.

104
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,350
Could Young Chae have
really done that?

105
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,120
It's very likely she did.

106
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,830
But thinking of why she did it...

107
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,760
It breaks my heart.

108
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,270
After how much you cared for her...

109
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,500
The nerve of her.

110
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,240
She spoke as if she were Su A.

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,710
She asked why I abandoned
my seven-year-old daughter.

112
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,040
And how I could go on living...

113
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,810
with such a serene
and happy look on my face.

114
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,250
She said I was despicable.

115
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,580
She's completely out of line.

116
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,420
To say such a vile thing
to her own mother-in-law.

117
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,950
So why are you different?

118
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,060
- What?
- Even Young Chae,

119
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,230
a total stranger,
is utterly disgusted by what I did.

120
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,960
- So how can you not be?
- Everything that happened...

121
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,600
was to be with me.

122
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,500
I was desperate for you,
and you wanted me too.

123
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,740
It was just lust and greed.

124
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,210
I was in love with what you had.

125
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,140
Just forget about the past.

126
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,910
Just focus on what we have to
deal with now.

127
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,020
I think I need to bring
Su A here soon.

128
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,420
Having her here with me...

129
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,830
would help me feel at peace.

130
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,200
Let me ask you one thing.

131
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,770
Why did your accident
from 25 years ago...

132
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,300
have to happen then?

133
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,110
And why is it that all this time,

134
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,480
you never even tried to find out
what really happened?

135
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,310
It was a hit-and-run.

136
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,390
You even stopped me
from looking into it.

137
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,390
Why is that?

138
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,960
What right did I have
to find out the cause?

139
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,560
I should have died back then.

140
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,430
Then I wouldn't be called the mother
who abandoned her daughter...

141
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,310
to chase an old love for money.

142
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,610
Do you regret it?

143
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,280
No.

144
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,750
Even if I were to go back
to that moment,

145
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,690
I'd make the same choice
all over again.

146
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,020
Even if it killed me.

147
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,230
Why do you keep saying
such morbid things?

148
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,930
If anything happened to you,
I couldn't have gone on living.

149
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,400
No.

150
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,230
- I would have followed you...
- I need to sleep. I'm tired.

151
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,510
That accident...

152
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,680
You didn't cause it yourself,

153
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,680
did you?

154
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,420
Gosh, I'm thirsty.

155
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,000
Ms. Jo, get me some water.

156
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,230
What, are your hands broken?
If you're thirsty, get it yourself.

157
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,600
You shouldn't mess with me, Ms. Jo.

158
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,670
If I tell Han Hye Ra that Jung Won
isn't who she says she is...

159
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,810
No.

160
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,680
What if I tell Han Hye Ra
that she's actually the real Su A?

161
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,150
You're the best, Mr. Cha.

162
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,020
I won't stop you.
Go on, tell her! Please!

163
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,420
Ki Beom. Don't ruin everything.

164
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,220
So if you tell her,
will you be okay?

165
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,830
Everyone will find out
you're the fake Su A too.

166
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,730
Ms. Jo.

167
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,030
You like Jung Won
living as the daughter-in-law...

168
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,570
of the Kunhyang family, don't you?

169
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,640
Who said I like it?

170
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,610
Does Jung Won slip you some money
behind Mr. Cha's back?

171
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,210
You little brat!
Every time you open your mouth,

172
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,510
you make my blood boil.
Get out of this house now!

173
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,350
I know her situation is complicated,
but she's Jung Won's friend.

174
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,120
Where is she supposed to go
at this hour?

175
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,120
Just looking at that brat's face
makes me want to...

176
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,420
throw up the rice cake
I ate ten years ago and got sick on.

177
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,790
Look how crude your mouth is.

178
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,430
You're just like Chairman Gong.

179
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,530
What?

180
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,100
- You must think I'm a doormat!
- Hey.

181
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,840
You don't scare me one bit.

182
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,310
It feels so good to finally land
a solid punch on Chairman Gong.

183
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,480
Ms. Jo.

184
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,180
- Watch out for my punches too.
- Gosh, I can't believe her.

185
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,350
I'm tired, so I think I'll turn in.

186
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,090
Good night!

187
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,960
That brat!

188
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,060
Gosh, that girl.
I wanted to smack her in the head.

189
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,630
- It was killing me to hold back!
- Come on.

190
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,030
She's joining
the Kunhyang family soon...

191
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,700
even if you don't tell her
to get out.

192
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,400
But she'll live with our Jung Won.

193
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,770
How will our sweet Jung Won...

194
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,110
- handle that rude witch?
- For goodness' sake.

195
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,720
I can finally see you
for who you are.

196
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,590
Your disgusting face
behind the mask.

197
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,770
What brings you rushing over here
before breakfast?

198
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,770
Did you get exposed
as the fake daughter-in-law?

199
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,940
If I had, would you just sit back
and watch the show, Chairman Gong?

200
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,340
You're the one who set me up
as the fake Joo Young Chae.

201
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,640
About her creating a new identity...

202
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,950
and having a child with another man.

203
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,720
Did Han Hye Ra find out
you were the one who leaked that?

204
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,980
Thanks to you, yes.

205
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,590
I heard your ringing voice clearly,
Chairman Gong.

206
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,020
So what?

207
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,860
Unfortunately,
the fake Su A, Young Chae,

208
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,530
was the one who recorded it...

209
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,830
and gave it to Vice Chairman Han.

210
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,960
All right, enough!
You don't have to spell it out.

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,770
And you'll still just stand by
and do nothing?

212
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,140
Will you just let me get kicked out
of the Kunhyang Family?

213
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,170
Hey. Han Hye Ra chewed me out too,
you brat.

214
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,740
She thinks I'm the one backing you.

215
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,080
But you are. You're my mother.

216
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,880
Now you're about to be kicked out,
suddenly I'm your "mother?"

217
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,580
You should have asked my permission
before you made your move.

218
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,380
And if I had?
What would be any different?

219
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,860
Look at this brat, glaring at me
and arguing back with every word.

220
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,860
That's how you raised Young Chae,
wasn't it?

221
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,630
I need to know.

222
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,030
- Know what?
- If you're still on my side.

223
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,370
You like Young Chae
playing the fake Su A, don't you?

224
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,340
If push comes to shove,
you'll just toss me aside, right?

225
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,910
You think I'll just take her side,
just because she's my kid?

226
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,920
You really don't know me at all yet,
do you?

227
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,220
I'm just watching to see
who comes out on top.

228
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,760
I always side with the winner,
with whoever is more capable.

229
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,900
If you don't want to get tossed,
step up your game.

230
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,770
Beat the fake Su A,

231
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,130
and captivate Han Hye Ra
and win her over.

232
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,540
Or get rid of her.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

233
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,210
Of the Kunhyang Association members,

234
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,240
you know some of them, don't you?

235
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,880
It'd be stranger if I didn't.
Isn't that Han Hye Ra's fan club?

236
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,620
They were pestering me to join,
and it was a pain to refuse them.

237
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,820
- But why do you ask?
- There's something you can do, Mom.

238
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,360
(The Crown Capital)

239
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,930
How's your husband's business
doing these days?

240
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

241
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,060
What's wrong?

242
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,400
I sent you ten big ones
about three months ago.

243
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,870
Wasn't it enough?

244
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,240
Of course I'll have to
lend you more.

245
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,840
I'm not Gong Nan Sook for nothing,
am I?

246
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,710
I'm the generous soul who swoops in
to make money rain on short notice.

247
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,010
That's me, Gong Nan Sook, isn't it?

248
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,390
Gosh.

249
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,460
Plus, I was curious if you were
running Kunhyang Association well.

250
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,460
And I have a rather urgent favor
to ask.

251
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,930
Madam Sa, let's get together.

252
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,370
What is she up to now?

253
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,000
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

254
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,870
What's the occasion?

255
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,680
You asked me
to come to the office, brother.

256
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,410
Are you buying me lunch?

257
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,210
Calling me brother
sounds so natural for you.

258
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,020
- Is everything that easy for you?
- It fits, doesn't it?

259
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,650
So what should I call you?

260
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,720
- Se Hoon?
- You call me brother,

261
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,990
but the look in your eyes...

262
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,220
Are you flirting with me right now?

263
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,090
Busted.

264
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,530
What?

265
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,270
I know you're off-limits,
but you're so my type.

266
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,400
I just can't help it.

267
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,270
- You're pushing your luck.
- I haven't done anything wrong.

268
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,040
It just means
you're that attractive as a man.

269
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,710
Whatever.

270
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,580
Su A.

271
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,880
You've been in Young Chae's room,
the one she uses by herself,

272
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,980
at the annex, haven't you?

273
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,620
Of course. Why?

274
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,590
Have you ever touched
her phone or tablet?

275
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,550
Are you accusing me right now?

276
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,890
The one behind the anonymous post
who leaked it to the press...

277
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,990
was your wife, Joo Young Chae.

278
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,000
What? You want me
to fund your business more?

279
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Yes.

280
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,380
I heard Jin Se Hoon was joining
and Kunhyang Group would invest.

281
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,780
We're leaving
Kunhyang Group out of it.

282
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,950
Jin Se Hoon decided
to partner with me personally.

283
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,280
Is the deal already signed
and sealed?

284
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
Yes, it is.

285
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,260
First the fake Su A,
then the fake Young Chae.

286
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,820
And now you too, CEO Joo,

287
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,330
are leaving me
completely out of the loop.

288
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,430
I'm offering you...

289
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,560
majority shareholder status
in Sky Question.

290
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,270
I would never leave you out.

291
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,100
Fine.
This majority shareholder role.

292
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,570
What's in it for me?

293
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,770
If I fail to run
Sky Question successfully,

294
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,480
the company could become yours,
Chairman Gong.

295
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,580
Then what's in it for you, CEO Joo?

296
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,180
When it comes to a card
that can keep Jin Se Hoon in check,

297
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,250
there's no better ace up my sleeve
than you.

298
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,030
Is Jin Se Hoon getting so greedy
that you need me as your trump card?

299
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,160
Are you worried?

300
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,730
It's reckless,

301
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,870
but is there any force
stronger than love?

302
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,470
All right, I'll consider it.

303
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,680
You're here, Young Chae.

304
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,050
Oh, dear.

305
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,250
I didn't know Su A was here.

306
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,320
I only bought enough for you and me.

307
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,790
I can't stand to watch this.

308
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,320
I'll take a rain check
on that lunch with you.

309
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Why was she here?

310
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,500
I called her here.
I had to ask her something.

311
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,370
I know you're suspicious of Su A.

312
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,070
- But...
- It's worse to let this linger.

313
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,570
I need to get to the bottom of it.

314
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,210
Do you really think Su A
would admit it, even if it's true?

315
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,550
She doesn't seem like the type
to just confess.

316
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,080
She's a tough one.

317
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,050
Captivating, isn't she?
And so intense.

318
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,490
She's not my type.

319
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,520
Even if she wasn't my sister,
I wouldn't be interested.

320
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,190
Liar.

321
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,630
Are you jealous
of your sister-in-law?

322
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,100
You seemed pretty jealous...

323
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,500
when you saw how close
Ha Neul and I were.

324
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,070
Was I?

325
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,770
This looks good.

326
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,610
Let's eat.

327
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,080
Su A, come on.

328
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,980
Don't just cry.

329
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,680
Tell me what's wrong.

330
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,750
I just suddenly missed you...

331
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,520
Hey, what's gotten into you?

332
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,930
What is it? Did Young Chae
do something again?

333
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,630
I told you, that's not it.

334
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,630
She did something all right.

335
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,240
- Se Mi, do you know something?
- Not for sure,

336
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,110
but it's obvious just by looking.

337
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,140
I just saw Se Hoon and Young Chae
a little while ago.

338
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,390
Why?

339
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,990
What? Is he leaving work already?

340
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,970
He's head over heels
in love with her.

341
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,370
We're at the office.

342
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,570
Mother will scold us
if she catches us like this.

343
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,840
So let her.

344
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,080
Hey, it's almost time
to start making dinner.

345
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,680
I was thinking we'd eat out.
Just the two of us.

346
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,120
Eating out, just the two of them,
without even telling Mom?

347
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,600
Se Hoon may not know any better,
but Young Chae should, right?

348
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,570
Come on. It's the honeymoon phase.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

349
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,900
But still,

350
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,210
I never thought
my own brother would suspect me.

351
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,540
- Suspect you of what?
- You mean...

352
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,540
the article released because
of the anonymous post?

353
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,510
- Wasn't it Young Chae who did that?
- We're not sure.

354
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,150
- Be careful what you say.
- He asked me if I did it.

355
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,350
- Right in front of Young Chae.
- What?

356
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,360
That's insane.
Se Hoon is crazy for Joo Young Chae.

357
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,930
I feel so wrongly accused.

358
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,040
Mom will make this right.
I'll find out who's behind all this.

359
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,810
How dare she mess
with my daughter, Su A?

360
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,210
Here.

361
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,550
You loved the yellow croaker so much
when you were little.

362
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,520
You'd finish a whole one
in a single sitting.

363
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,430
It's so good.
You should have some too, Mom.

364
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,360
Just watching you eat
is enough to fill me up.

365
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,230
What are you smiling at?

366
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,900
Because you have
such a beautiful smile.

367
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,570
You're so different
from my real mom...

368
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,810
- that it's making me cry.
- Goodness.

369
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,650
My baby's always been a crybaby,
hasn't she? Oh, my.

370
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,820
What's wrong with me?

371
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,890
What's wrong?
Are you not feeling well?

372
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,630
- I'll go wash my hands, Mom.
- Okay.

373
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,670
Pull yourself together,
Joo Young Chae.

374
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,800
Han Hye Ra is not your mother.

375
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,610
Why are you acting like a little kid
who's starved for affection?

376
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,310
You don't do feelings.

377
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,280
(Sky Question)

378
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,520
Ta-da!

379
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,460
Se Mi. You didn't even call.

380
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,060
What is it?

381
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,830
- You want me to sit?
- Here.

382
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,810
"I don't have time to hang out.
We can catch up later."

383
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,240
I knew you'd bail.

384
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,180
- Congratulations.
- For what?

385
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,380
You landed the exclusive deal with
Vice President Jin, didn't you?

386
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,310
Word got to you that fast?

387
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:48,590
Hello? I'm Director Jin Se Mi
from Kunhyang Fashion.

388
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,720
- I'm vital to Kunhyang's future.
- Gosh.

389
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,320
Thanks. I didn't expect
to be congratulated...

390
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,930
by Jin Se Hoon's sister.

391
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,530
Cha Jung Won... No.

392
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,500
How is Su A?

393
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,570
Is she like an older sister to you?

394
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,870
I couldn't stand her at first,
but lately, I feel sorry for her.

395
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,780
- Why's that?
- Your sister, Joo Young Chae.

396
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,180
I thought she seemed nice at first,
but she's actually really nasty.

397
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,150
She's cleverly using
Se Hoon's position...

398
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,520
and pinning the blame
for her own actions on Su A.

399
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,260
Like my mom
creating a new identity...

400
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,160
or stealing
a nameless artist's painting.

401
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,260
She wrote that anonymous post.

402
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,830
The article about Su A.

403
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,930
Young Chae leaked all of it
on purpose.

404
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,800
- Are you sure? Do you have proof?
- I'm 99 percent sure.

405
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,670
What do you mean
she pinned it on Su A?

406
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,010
She even manipulated Se Hoon
into stabbing Su A in the back.

407
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,680
Su A was crying her eyes out
in front of Mom.

408
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,380
I've never seen that look
on Mom's face before.

409
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,320
She's not going to let this slide.
If solid proof turns up,

410
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,950
your sister might get kicked out
of the Kunhyang family.

411
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,460
Shoot. I forgot my dinner meeting.

412
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,990
- I have to go. See yourself out.
- What?

413
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,500
Ha Neul!

414
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,370
We didn't even get to share
a single sip of wine again.

415
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,510
So tracking the IP address alone
is hard to tell who did it?

416
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,540
That's correct, sir.

417
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,250
We compared the annex's Wi-Fi logs
and the site access logs,

418
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,680
but it's difficult to pinpoint
who it was.

419
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,520
The room Young Chae uses alone...

420
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,250
- was the access point, right?
- That's correct, sir.

421
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,220
It's almost certain
that Young Chae was behind this,

422
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,690
but we're lacking a smoking gun.

423
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,260
Just because it came from her room
doesn't mean it was Young Chae...

424
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,770
Did you meet with Hwang Mi Soo?

425
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,240
You have nothing
to worry about, Chairman.

426
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,910
What about Vice Chairman?

427
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,580
Ms. Su A came, so they went
to the Kunhyang house together.

428
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Su A?

429
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,960
- Did you have dinner?
- We should eat together.

430
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,400
I'm a little late, right?

431
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:18,170
That's too bad.
Su A and I just finished dinner.

432
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,740
Oh, Su A is here?

433
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,410
Yes. She wanted to see the garden
by herself for a bit.

434
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,680
I'm going to go get changed first.

435
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,920
Found it.

436
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,550
What are you doing in here?

437
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,690
I thought you were looking around
the garden.

438
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,000
Why did you sneak into this room
like a thieving cat?

439
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,700
And what's that you're hiding
behind your back?

440
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
Don't be scared.

441
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,910
I'm your dad.

442
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,480
Su A's dad.

443
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,380
It's nothing.

444
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,110
I'll talk to Mom.

445
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,690
This must be
our daughter-in-law's phone,

446
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,790
seeing how it's in this room.

447
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,430
Why did you come into this room?

448
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,670
Why were you trying to steal
Young Chae's phone?

449
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,770
I wasn't stealing it.

450
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,010
The proof Young Chae wrote
the anonymous post is in there.

451
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,410
So Young Chae really did all that
with this phone?

452
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,350
Yes, Dad.

453
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,020
Su A, where are you?

454
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,220
Leave the phone with me.

455
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,020
Don't say a word about this
to your mom.

456
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,030
What are you two doing in here?

457
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,270
Just a little father-daughter talk.

458
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,900
You look like a caring father, dear.

459
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,070
Are you secretly wondering
how to hurt our Su A?

460
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,040
My nickname is Sweet Jin...

461
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,480
and Romantic Jin.

462
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,190
This is Young Chae's phone.
Go through everything.

463
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,460
Find out what she searched
and posted.

464
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,730
Understood, sir.

465
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,700
And what if we confirm
it was Ms. Young Chae?

466
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
Then...

467
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,870
I can't just let it slide.

468
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,240
What about Vice Chairman?

469
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,680
Keep this to yourself for now.

470
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,880
The number you have called
is currently unavailable...

471
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,880
Come on, pick up.

472
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,220
The number you have called
is currently unavailable...

473
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,360
Ha Neul.

474
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,230
Why are you at the Kunhyang house
at this hour?

475
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,270
Come on, we need to talk.

476
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,500
Ha Neul, what's gotten into you?

477
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,970
- Did something...
- I'll tell you on the way.

478
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,270
You're staying here, honey.

479
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,180
What do you think you're doing?

480
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,840
Have you forgotten who I am?

481
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,880
She's my woman
before she's your sister!

482
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,620
If something is wrong,
I should be the first to know...

483
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,220
Then you should've protected her better.

484
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,060
You're so lost in your romance that
you're blind to your wife's pain.

485
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,490
Isn't it pathetic
that you failed to even notice?

486
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,730
What happened?

487
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,960
The anonymous posts?
The thing with Su A?

488
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,800
I know that. I know they think
Young Chae did it...

489
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,230
and that everyone
in the Kunhyang family has it wrong.

490
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,200
Then you should have stopped them,
not egged them on.

491
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,100
Are you saying
I'm making things harder for her?

492
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,440
Have you forgotten
what Su A is like?

493
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,180
Who knows what lies she'll make up
to hurt Young Chae even more?

494
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,210
- Be specific.
- Both of you, stop it!

495
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,220
I'll handle my own problems.

496
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,150
You and Ha Neul, stay out of it.

497
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,080
Did you enjoy your dinner?

498
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,590
Mother, I should have told you
that Se Hoon and I were eating out.

499
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,460
- That was thoughtless of me.
- Or are you just overthinking it?

500
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,600
- What do you mean?
- Are you nervous...

501
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,100
that Su A
suddenly appeared, Young Chae?

502
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,910
But that's no excuse
to slander your sister-in-law.

503
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,210
Slander her?

504
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,910
The Kunhyang Association meeting
will be held here tomorrow evening.

505
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,320
It's where we'll formally introduce
our Su A.

506
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,490
Young Chae, I'm counting on you.

507
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,260
I should be the one asking you that,
Su A.

508
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,460
Let me have a look at you.

509
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,000
Please wait a moment.
Ma'am, please wait just a moment.

510
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,270
- Sir, Chairman Gong is...
- For goodness' sake. How annoying.

511
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:26,080
Oh, my, hello.
The Kunhyang home looks the same.

512
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,680
My dear,
I know I'm dropping by unannounced,

513
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,820
but I do hope I'm not intruding.

514
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,220
What brings you here at this hour?

515
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,920
In-laws don't need an appointment
to see each other, do they?

516
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,860
It's for our Young Chae,
to help her conceive.

517
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,500
Where is it?
I brought some herbal medicine.

518
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,630
An expensive one, at that.

519
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,950
Kunhyang house, just you wait.

520
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,450
Until Gong Nan Sook,
your real owner, takes over.

521
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,790
The Kunhyang house
is always so tranquil...

522
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,660
and dignified.

523
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,590
It feels just like my own home.

524
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,570
(A Graceful Liar)

525
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,670
There's
a Kunhyang Association meeting...

526
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,040
at the Kunhyang house today, right?

527
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,310
You can do this.
You're today's star, Young Chae.

528
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,010
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
I'm Jin Su A.

529
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,050
About that anonymous post.
What's the real story?

530
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,120
Just tell them you did it, Jung Won.

531
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,090
We found traces of someone
anonymously posting,

532
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,090
then deleting the log.

533
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,860
If it's proven Young Chae
tarnished my wife's reputation,

534
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,690
I may have to kick her out
of this family.

535
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,230
If you plan on kicking
my Young Chae out,

536
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,830
you'd better be prepared
to kiss our business goodbye.

537
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,970
I'm surrounded by enemies.
If even Se Hoon shuts me out...

538
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,100
Young Chae.

539
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,040
I can't forgive her.

540
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
