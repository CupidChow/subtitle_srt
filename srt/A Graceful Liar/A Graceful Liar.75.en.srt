1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,510
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,480
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,520
It seems our board of directors...

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,320
is split exactly down the middle.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,220
If only someone
could cast the tie-breaking vote.

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,490
There is.

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
I am Cha Jung Won.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,410
I have voting rights as well.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,480
I have voting rights as well.

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,050
Ms. Cha is merely a designer
in Kunhyang's Design Team.

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,480
- What voting rights?
- I am also a major shareholder,

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,220
owning five percent
of Kunhyang's shares.

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,490
- Is that true?
- It is.

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,060
Cha Jung Won,
in her capacity as my daughter,

16
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,430
has received a gift
of five percent...

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,030
of my 18 percent stake.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,140
Then Ms. Cha Jung Won does have
decision-making rights.

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,110
So, Cha Jung Won,
which of these two will you support?

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,220
I support
former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra.

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,440
All right, then.
For the position of chairman,

22
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,210
we appoint former Vice Chairman
Han Hye Ra. The matter is settled.

23
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,010
What do you think you're all doing?

24
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,720
You're kicking me out
to put Han Hye Ra in my place?

25
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,090
Says who?

26
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,390
This is all null and void!

27
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,090
Look here, Jin Tae Seok.

28
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,330
Read the room, would you?

29
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,400
You're the chairman, and yet...

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,000
you've been under investigation
by the prosecutors.

31
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,000
You're why our stock prices fell.
This is serious. Know your place.

32
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,040
I was released
due to insufficient evidence.

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,080
I've done nothing wrong.

34
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,110
An arrest warrant will be issued
the moment they find evidence.

35
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,680
You're still a suspect
in Cha Ki Beom's death,

36
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,250
not to mention the incident
with Cha Jung Won on the rooftop.

37
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,890
How can you have the audacity
to want the chairman's seat?

38
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,990
Have you ever heard
of innocent until proven guilty?

39
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,960
I'm not guilty of anything
until I'm convicted.

40
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,100
I'm the one who built Kunhyang
into what it is today,

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,600
and this is how you treat me?

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,400
He's right. This is outrageous.

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,370
How can you take his chairmanship
overnight?

44
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,870
If I wanted to kill Cha Jung Won,

45
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,010
why would I give her
a blood transfusion?

46
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,350
Why would I kill her...

47
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,420
and then give her my blood,
unless I'd completely lost my mind?

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,020
Does that make any sense?

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,020
Be that as it may,
the board's decision...

50
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,590
cannot be nullified.

51
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,060
I would like
to propose a new motion.

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,230
What if we appoint...

53
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,270
former Chairman Jin Tae Seok
as honorary chairman?

54
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,740
And one more thing.

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,140
Once I become the chairman,

56
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,810
I will officially appoint
interim Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul...

57
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,480
as the new Vice Chairman.

58
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,290
(Episode 75)

59
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,630
Making Jin Tae Seok
the honorary chairman...

60
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,500
That was a stroke of genius.
Absolutely brilliant.

61
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,230
It's like they say,
"Keep your enemies closer."

62
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,200
And appointing
interim Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul...

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,270
as the new Vice Chairman
was a good call, too.

64
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,080
Directors,
led by Vice President Jin Se Hoon,

65
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,180
will put up a big fight.

66
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,910
Leave that to me.

67
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,490
Without conclusive evidence,
it'll be hard to nail Jin Tae Seok.

68
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,120
Jin Se Hoon has the evidence.

69
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,460
- What is it?
- It's a video of Jin Tae Seok...

70
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,090
shoving Jung Won off the rooftop.

71
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,330
He might even have a full video
of the incident with Cha Ki Beom.

72
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,800
Wait, why would Se Hoon have that?

73
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,600
Young Chae, that little brat!
I ought to...

74
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,870
Oh my.

75
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,040
You had the video of
Ki Beom's incident, Chairman Gong.

76
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,050
Young Chae stole it?

77
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,150
It seems so.

78
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,220
Then what about the rooftop video?

79
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,120
- Who could've filmed it there?
- I think Young Chae did.

80
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,460
I just can't figure out...

81
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,570
why she would have gone up there.

82
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,400
Young Chae told me to meet her
on the rooftop.

83
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,340
She said she'd tell me who wrote
the distorted articles about my dad.

84
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,880
Seriously, Young Chae...

85
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,080
was so busy meddling in things
that were none of her business.

86
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,650
- I'll just...
- But Young Chae never showed up.

87
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,720
- Chairman Jin Tae Seok appeared.
- So she went there,

88
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,090
and she saw and filmed everything?

89
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,990
It's highly likely.

90
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,800
It's so hot in here, isn't it?
Is it just me?

91
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,900
Someone must have turned up
the heat.

92
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,870
(Kunhyang Group)

93
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,710
You couldn't win over the board,
and you let them do this to me?

94
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,680
This is no time for that.

95
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,690
If you make an enemy out of me,
you'll have no one.

96
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,990
Honorary Chairman?

97
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,160
They're trying to turn me
into a powerless figurehead?

98
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,360
You should be grateful
you're getting even that much.

99
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,400
Se Hoon,
you were supposed to stop them!

100
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,930
Han Hye Ra is the new Chairman?

101
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,400
- Joo Ha Neul will be Vice Chairman!
- Before that happens,

102
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,440
I'll take Joo Ha Neul down.

103
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,270
Cha Jung Won
is now a significant shareholder.

104
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,770
You didn't even know that?

105
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,980
Han Hye Ra, Joo Ha Neul,
and now Cha Jung Won.

106
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,280
Now, they're just obstacles
I need to overcome.

107
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,780
- What's your plan?
- Get Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

108
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,190
back on our side,
even if we have to blackmail her.

109
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,160
You think you can really deal
with Gong Nan Sook?

110
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,460
Just watch me.

111
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
But tell me,

112
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,360
are you really on my side?

113
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,400
Am I on your side?
Knowing you two killed my mother?

114
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,470
You're asking for the impossible.

115
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,880
Of course.

116
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,980
If it's not me,

117
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,020
who else would be on your side,
Father?

118
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,190
We need to get the two video files
Jin Se Hoon has.

119
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,660
That's the only way we can nail
Jin Tae Seok for good.

120
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,900
Han Hye Ra, the former Vice Chairman
you two so eagerly supported,

121
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,240
is now the Chairman.
You two must be thrilled.

122
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,910
And Joo Ha Neul is promoted
to the official Vice Chairman.

123
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,780
You have a killer look in your eyes,
Vice President Jin.

124
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,180
- It's almost scary to talk to you.
- You're scared already?

125
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,720
You convinced your mother,
whom you just met after 25 years,

126
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,690
to make you
the significant shareholder...

127
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,690
of Kunhyang Group?

128
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,090
She was well within her rights.

129
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,560
As the biological daughter
of Kunhyang's new Chairman.

130
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,560
Don't fool yourselves.
Kunhyang is mine.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,700
And I'll make sure of it.

132
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,670
Let's go, Vice Chairman Joo.

133
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,550
Cha Jung Won.

134
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,550
If I can't have you,
then I'll just have to destroy you.

135
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,550
Along with Joo Ha Neul.

136
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,490
Just you wait.

137
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,730
You're making Cha Jung Won
director of the Kunhyang Gallery?

138
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,630
The idea is to gradually expand
her influence.

139
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,040
What? If that position opens up,
I should be the one to get it.

140
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,370
Giving her five percent
of the shares was enough.

141
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,980
Why are you trying
to make her queen?

142
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,910
It involves managing
the Kunhyang Group's slush fund.

143
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,280
Gong Nan Sook, this isn't a job
you can take on yourself.

144
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,680
And you think Cha Jung Won
is up for the job?

145
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,150
She's my own flesh and blood.

146
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,650
She's more than capable.

147
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,090
Look at you. That's a mother's love.

148
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,660
- Am I right?
- I'm empowering her.

149
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,060
So she can stand on her own.

150
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,470
Cha Jung Won could end up
taking the fall for everything.

151
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,200
If Jin Tae Seok makes a comeback
and Jin Se Hoon gains power...

152
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,240
Wait.

153
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,210
If the story of Kunhyang's slush fund
breaks in the media...

154
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,480
- So Jung Won takes the fall?
- Of course.

155
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,310
That could happen.

156
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,780
That's a risk she has to take.

157
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,360
I don't care.
Handle your daughter as you wish.

158
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,190
That's your business.
Just keep your promise to me.

159
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,600
You're the face, and I'm the shadow.
Publicly, you're the Chairman,

160
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,100
but behind the scenes, so am I.

161
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,500
Just getting a seat at the table
isn't enough for me.

162
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,270
As long as I am the Chairman,

163
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,210
all decisions at Kunhyang Group
will be made by you and me.

164
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,450
We'll discuss them
and decide together.

165
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,320
Okay. Then we have a deal.

166
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,220
Then stick to the deal.
Don't give me the runaround again.

167
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,290
Got it?

168
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,460
First, remove the "interim" title
from Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul.

169
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,630
So we get the board on our side?

170
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,300
Are you hesitant because of Se Hoon?

171
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,740
No, it's because
of Young Chae, of course.

172
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,570
Do you need some time?

173
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,170
No, not at all.

174
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,340
If it's 49 versus 51,
I always choose 51.

175
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,810
Let's back Ha Neul. Let's do it.

176
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,650
Mom, you really did that?

177
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,990
Have this tofu
and straighten your life out.

178
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,620
Or else I'll kill you
with my own two hands!

179
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,860
Mi Hyang, please.

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,570
I did it. So from now on,
you have to let me help.

181
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,840
I'll do whatever it takes.
What do you need most right now?

182
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,640
- You don't have to do this, Mom.
- Don't say that.

183
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,310
It's too dangerous for you to do.

184
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,940
I can do anything.

185
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,480
Should I poison
Jin Tae Seok's drink next time?

186
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,220
Mi Hyang.

187
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,780
You can't do that.

188
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,950
Let me do it instead.

189
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,660
Of all the times
for my heart to skip a beat...

190
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,390
like a silly schoolgirl.

191
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,600
What would you have me do?

192
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,700
Vice President Jin Se Hoon
has two video files.

193
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,730
They're conclusive evidence.

194
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,770
We need you to retrieve them.

195
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,370
Manager Hwang,
you could be in danger too.

196
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,870
I've already come
to terms with that.

197
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,540
But there's something else
you all need to know.

198
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,650
It's about the death of
Vice President Jin's birth mother.

199
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,720
Chairman Gong Nan Sook
bribed a doctor...

200
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,060
and had Vice President Jin Se Hoon's
biological mother murdered.

201
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,290
Oh my goodness.

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,130
Why would Madam Gong
do such a thing?

203
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,800
When I kept pressuring the doctor
she bribed,

204
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
I found out Chairman Jin Tae Seok
was behind it all.

205
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,320
Now I think I understand
why Se Hoon changed so much.

206
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,560
How could Chairman Jin Tae Seok
go that far?

207
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,560
And Madam Gong is just as bad.
Is life that meaningless to them?

208
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,800
Chairman Han was framed for it.

209
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,070
So that Se Hoon would cut you out
of his life for good.

210
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,440
Why does Se Hoon...

211
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,780
- side with Chairman Jin?
- To be Chairman of Kunhyang Group.

212
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,340
He'll use Chairman Jin and then...

213
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,080
His real plan is
to take down Jin Tae Seok.

214
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,620
And after that,

215
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,290
- Se Hoon will use Madam Gong.
- We'll have to wait and see.

216
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,360
We'll see how Jin Se Hoon
uses Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

217
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,690
We might be able to turn this
to our advantage.

218
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,730
Young Chae, what are you doing?
I said kneel!

219
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,140
No. What did I do wrong?

220
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,340
You told Manager Gu
to steal my trump card.

221
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,080
As if that wasn't enough,
you just handed it to Jin Se Hoon?

222
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,080
I didn't just hand it over!
I dropped the USB in a wine glass,

223
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,420
so I had no choice
but to give it to Se Hoon...

224
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,420
Have you forgotten
who your mother is?

225
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,430
My goodness.

226
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,040
I'm sorry, Mom.
I'm the one who stole it.

227
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,140
That's not true.
I'm the one who stole it.

228
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,150
I'm so moved
I can barely see through my tears.

229
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,150
Hey, Gu Yeong Soo.
Whose assistant are you?

230
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,450
Is this how you repay my kindness?
You take me for a fool?

231
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,290
Never! How could I disrespect you?

232
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,160
To me, you're a raging fire!

233
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:47,300
And yet, you still stole the video
for Young Chae?

234
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,830
That makes it even worse, you punk!

235
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,300
If you work for me,
your loyalty should be to me!

236
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,910
Why risk your neck for Young Chae?
You idiot!

237
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,070
Mom, stop...

238
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,280
It's not Manager Gu's fault.
I'm the one who blackmailed him.

239
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,110
No, that's not true.

240
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,250
I was wrong to give in.

241
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,420
You two are a real piece of work.

242
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,060
I'll be the one to decide
who's to blame.

243
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,460
Both of you, get that video back.

244
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,730
I'll give you exactly one day.

245
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,630
Find out where Jin Se Hoon hid it,
and bring it to me.

246
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,640
Put it right here in my hand.
Or else...

247
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,210
Or else what?

248
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,570
I'm going to disown you,
you little brat.

249
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
And what about me?

250
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,210
You? You can just go back
where you came from, you idiot.

251
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,550
I refuse.

252
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,180
I'd rather die at your hands.

253
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,420
Let go of me!

254
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,690
Just go home, relax,
and take up knitting, you moron!

255
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,190
- You won't let go?
- I can't!

256
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,060
For crying out loud. Seriously...

257
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,500
You brats are such a handful.

258
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,610
I thought you were smooth
and complex, like Cognac.

259
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,450
You also said
you were intimidated by it.

260
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,650
You're the one losing your cool,
not me.

261
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,890
Why do you have to
make me feel so lonely?

262
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,220
Hye Ra.

263
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,400
You never had ambition or interest
in being the Chairman.

264
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,000
- So why now?
- Because I wrongly thought...

265
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,270
living in your shadow
would be happier.

266
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,500
You weren't mistaken.

267
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,040
Hye Ra was meant to always smile,
protected by me.

268
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,540
You'd be happier
living gracefully...

269
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,040
as the matriarch of Kunhyang.

270
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,010
That was your idea of happiness.

271
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,450
- I've changed.
- Changed?

272
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,250
I thought if I lived
the way you wanted,

273
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,690
at least you wouldn't harm
the people I hold dear.

274
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,530
That was the only thing...

275
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,260
I could do to protect them.

276
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,400
So it's for Cha Ki Beom
and Cha Jung Won again?

277
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,830
You're not that to me anymore.

278
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,140
You were the great sky, my universe
that protected me.

279
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,910
Now, I want to become my own sky
and my own universe.

280
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,380
And you think that's enough
to protect Cha Jung Won?

281
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,510
- At least I can cut off your limbs.
- I'm immortal.

282
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,620
I'm invincible.

283
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,590
This is just a momentary setback.

284
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,420
Do you have any idea
how much you're hurting me?

285
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,660
- I don't want to get rid of you.
- What a shame.

286
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,100
I've already taken you out.

287
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,370
Please leave. I'm tired.

288
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,740
Promote Se Hoon to Vice Chairman.

289
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,380
- That's something I'll decide...
- No, it's already been decided.

290
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,950
Se Hoon is the son you raised
with all your heart.

291
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,080
I'm not denying that. It's just...

292
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,150
- What?
- Se Hoon is becoming just like you.

293
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,520
He's my son.
Of course he takes after me.

294
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,290
And he will follow
in your footsteps?

295
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,900
That's the last thing I want.

296
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,530
As for Young Chae,

297
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,670
I still can't trust her.

298
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,470
Not sure
if she's even really pregnant.

299
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,050
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

300
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,090
(Kunhyang Group)

301
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,970
I can't just leave this
to Manager Hwang.

302
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,510
The evidence Jin Se Hoon has.

303
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,340
I have to find it myself.

304
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,460
Why is Cha Jung Won
in our dressing room?

305
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,910
Is this the original?

306
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,280
- Yes, it is.
- What if Hye Ra finds out?

307
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,180
She would never suspect...

308
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,250
that I was the one who stole it.

309
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,950
That's true.
To Hye Ra, Secretary Yoon is...

310
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,150
practically a sister.

311
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,820
I'll take my leave now.

312
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,930
Hye Ra killed your father.

313
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,440
Actually,

314
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,470
it might just be easier
for you to believe that.

315
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
Are you saying Han Hye Ra
wasn't the one who did it?

316
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,770
You want to know?

317
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,010
Tell me the truth.

318
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,110
Was it you?

319
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,250
(Do you want to format it?)

320
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,320
(Formatting USB drive)

321
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,390
(Format complete)

322
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,090
The evidence Hye Ra had is gone now.

323
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,260
No one knows
that I killed Cha Ki Beom.

324
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,230
Gong Nan Sook...

325
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,600
I have to find a way...

326
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,270
to make her team up with me.

327
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,160
Why are you going through my closet?

328
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,460
What are you doing
in my dressing room like a thief?

329
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,330
I still have some of my things here.
I was just grabbing them.

330
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,570
This late?

331
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,540
You're right. It is pretty late.

332
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,610
I'll come get them some other time.

333
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,290
So the USB
wasn't in the dressing room?

334
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,490
No. What about
the Vice President's office?

335
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,460
Manager Hwang looked for it,
but he said it wasn't there.

336
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,900
Where else would Jin Se Hoon
have put it?

337
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,910
He wouldn't use a cloud service
that could get hacked.

338
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,940
I'm sure he saved it
on a separate storage device.

339
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,380
That makes sense.

340
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,380
But about Young Chae...

341
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,150
Is she actually pregnant?

342
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,850
What makes you say that
all of a sudden?

343
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,460
Did something happen
to make you suspicious?

344
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,160
No, never mind.
I'm probably just overthinking it.

345
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,730
Father.

346
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,240
Is something wrong?

347
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,540
No...

348
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
What is this?

349
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,530
- You're faking this pregnancy?
- No, I'm not.

350
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,370
This padding and this belly binder.
What are these doing here?

351
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Tell me.

352
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,470
I said, tell me!

353
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,780
I'm begging you.
Please keep this a secret.

354
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,820
If anyone finds out
I faked the pregnancy,

355
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,790
it's over between me and Se Hoon.

356
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,990
How dare you fake a pregnancy
to deceive the Kunhyang family?

357
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,100
I doubt this was your idea alone,
Young Chae.

358
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,000
Was it Gong Nan Sook's idea?

359
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,470
My mom just blurted it out.

360
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,210
The OB-GYN results
and the ultrasound photos.

361
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,410
So this was all
Gong Nan Sook's doing?

362
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,810
Yes, Father.

363
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,520
Please keep it a secret.
I'll do anything you ask.

364
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,850
I'll have to think about that.

365
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,790
I'll find a way for me to survive...

366
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,320
and for you to survive too.

367
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,300
What?
Young Chae faked her pregnancy?

368
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,300
What kind of
garbage soap opera plot is this?

369
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,670
Just because you got kicked out
as chairman,

370
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,910
- are you writing fiction now?
- Shut your mouth!

371
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,480
Young Chae confessed everything.

372
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
Gong Nan Sook.

373
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,780
How dare you try
to scam the Kunhyang family?

374
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,880
Come on. You know, in my life,

375
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,550
I've been called a bad, pretty,
smart, and crazy witch.

376
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,320
I've been called every kind of witch
in the book.

377
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,130
But being called a scamming witch?
That's a new one. How creative.

378
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,730
How about I call Hye Ra and Se Hoon
and take Young Chae to the OB-GYN?

379
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,730
Gong Nan Sook.

380
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Spill it.
What kind of scheme did you cook up?

381
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,770
Come on, Mr. Jin.
Why are you acting this way?

382
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,080
Young Chae and Se Hoon
are both young and healthy.

383
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,150
If they just live happily,
a baby will come along in no time.

384
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,610
- It's not that big of a deal.
- So it was fake, wasn't it?

385
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,290
It was at first.
But that might not be true anymore.

386
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,460
- What?
- Come on. Must I spell it out?

387
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,560
Gong Nan Sook!

388
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,830
You scared me!

389
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,330
Jin Tae Seok,
you're acting very suspicious.

390
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,600
What's your angle?

391
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,640
- What are you talking about?
- I heard...

392
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,840
you gave Cha Jung Won
a blood transfusion.

393
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,110
Let's just say
I was feeling charitable.

394
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,450
I wonder why
you would bother to do that.

395
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,550
She has B-negative blood.
It's a very rare blood type.

396
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,920
Don't make me laugh.

397
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,720
You just wanted to tell Han Hye Ra
that you didn't intend...

398
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,220
to kill her daughter,
but actually saved her.

399
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,790
You were just trying to be the hero.

400
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,630
Stop trying to change the subject.

401
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,230
Don't think you can just
weasel your way out of this.

402
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:24,400
All right, fine. Then tell me
what you want. Spit it out.

403
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,370
Cut your ties with Han Hye Ra.

404
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
And then...

405
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,010
you'll join forces with me.

406
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,430
Chairman Han Hye Ra,
congratulations.

407
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,300
I will need everyone's support.

408
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,400
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul,

409
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,600
Congratulations on your appointment
as Vice Chairman.

410
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,170
Thank you for your vote
of confidence.

411
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,810
I'll do my best to be a credit
to Kunhyang Group.

412
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,130
(Chairman Han Hye Ra)

413
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,480
(Chairman Han Hye Ra)

414
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,620
This is just the beginning.

415
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,630
Honorary Chairman?

416
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,400
She's trying to turn me
into a powerless figurehead?

417
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,270
Han Hye Ra...

418
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,970
I'll make you realize...

419
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,140
how heavy the crown is soon enough.

420
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,680
It's more than you can handle.

421
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,180
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

422
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,060
The video showing the truth
behind Cha Ki Beom's death.

423
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,490
As long as this is in my hands,

424
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,930
the chairmanship of Kunhyang Group
will soon be mine.

425
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,370
Hey, what's up?

426
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,540
I can't stand watching Cha Jung Won
boss everyone around as team leader.

427
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,740
- If you had just done something...
- That's up to Se Mi to decide.

428
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,110
I guess Cha Jung Won...

429
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,250
must just be that good
of a designer.

430
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,310
Se Hoon!

431
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,520
Okay. Don't get upset.
You'll startle our A Reum.

432
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,920
Then for my sake...

433
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
Or...

434
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,460
for our A Reum's sake,
please do something about it.

435
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,790
You want me to take
the team leader position from Jung Won?

436
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,030
I can't do that.

437
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
That's not what I'm asking.

438
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,300
How about being
the sweetest husband in the world?

439
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:17,210
(Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul)

440
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,910
- What brings you here, Madam Gong?
- What do you mean, why am I here?

441
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,350
I came to congratulate my son
on becoming the Vice Chairman.

442
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,820
I'm exhausted.

443
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,790
You must be disappointed.
I bet you wanted Se Hoon to get it.

444
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,400
Whether it's my son-in-law or son,
since one of you made it, I won.

445
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,100
I don't even know...

446
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,800
why I supported you so hard.

447
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,870
It must be what's called attachment.

448
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,540
Actually, there's something
I wanted to ask you.

449
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,880
- Ask me anything, but go easy.
- This is going to hurt.

450
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,210
- What is it?
- Is Young Chae's pregnancy real?

451
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,580
You're not lying, are you?

452
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:07,360
My head is killing me.
I feel attacked from all sides.

453
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,860
Manager Gu, contact Dr. Jung.

454
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,260
I need my blood pressure checked.
I think it's going to explode.

455
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,230
What should our concept be
for the upcoming fall and winter season?

456
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,970
I thought the idea you brought up
last time was great.

457
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,410
The tailored look
using natural fabrics?

458
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,380
It's perfect for a fall collection.

459
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,980
Let's explore some more options.

460
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,650
Designer Kim Sung Hee, please report
on domestic brand trends.

461
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,950
Designer Ahn Ji Na
and Designer Joo Young Chae,

462
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,720
please compile a report
on haute couture from overseas.

463
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,020
- Okay.
- Got it.

464
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,600
Our oh-so-great team leader
will handle it all herself anyway.

465
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,730
Are you pouting
because you didn't make team leader?

466
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,770
The title is just a formality.
We're all equal as designers here.

467
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,910
What's important is creating
innovative designs together.

468
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,340
We may not see eye to eye
on everything,

469
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,310
but I hope
we can all put the team first.

470
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,750
- And compromise a little.
- She does have a point.

471
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,120
Wise words indeed.

472
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,430
How's the meeting going?

473
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,830
It is.

474
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,230
I'm here
to offer some encouragement.

475
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,070
Cha Jung Won,
I hear you're the new team leader.

476
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,700
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

477
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,340
Looking forward to working with you.

478
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,340
Thank you.

479
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,640
You're looking as handsome as ever,
Vice President Jin.

480
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,980
Se Hoon,
did you come here just for me?

481
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,680
Of course.
A man's got to look after his girl.

482
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,250
Se Hoon.

483
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,120
Vice President Jin,
let's remember we're at the office.

484
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,890
Was it that obvious?

485
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,000
We're still newlyweds, after all.

486
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,660
So please bear with us.

487
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,430
Tone it down.

488
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,500
Let's have my team members over.
Does it sound good?

489
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,640
Of course, that's a great idea.

490
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,170
To the Kunhyang house?

491
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,240
How about a housewarming
and team dinner?

492
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,750
Let's invite Ha Neul.
He's now a member of Kunhyang.

493
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,350
I'll give Ha Neul a call.

494
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,150
That sounds like fun.

495
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,460
All right.

496
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,870
Your blood pressure is 145 over 90.

497
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,040
Looks like you'll need to start
on blood pressure medication.

498
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,940
- We'll check your blood sugar too.
- I hate the hospital.

499
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,710
Your health is more important
than money or fame, ma'am.

500
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,410
I'll make an appointment
for you right away.

501
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,950
Stop pretending you care so much.

502
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Gosh, this is such a pain!

503
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,690
But I heard my pressure and sugar
are fine.

504
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,130
So why on earth do I have
to get my blood drawn?

505
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,530
You know a blood test can reveal
a lot about your health, right?

506
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,440
I heard you gave Cha Jung Won
a blood transfusion.

507
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Let's just say
I was feeling charitable.

508
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,980
I wonder why
you would bother to do that.

509
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:19,080
She has B-negative blood.
It's a very rare blood type.

510
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:27,860
That blood type. B-negative is rare?

511
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,360
Yes. Only about 0.1 percent
of the population has it.

512
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,570
Is that right?

513
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,570
You sent for me?

514
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,580
Last time, Grandma said this.

515
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
This is all your fault, you witch!

516
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,580
If only you hadn't egged them on!

517
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,850
No mother would do that to her kid!

518
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,250
May you burn in the underworld!

519
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,490
There's something more going on,
right?

520
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,490
I heard Jin Tae Seok gave
Cha Jung Won a blood transfusion.

521
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,730
And what's more,

522
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:09,370
they both have the same rare
B-negative blood type.

523
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,610
This is the first and last time
I will ever tell you the truth.

524
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,780
So now, you have to disappear,
don't you?

525
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,080
Something smells fishy.

526
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,360
(A Graceful Liar)

527
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,920
