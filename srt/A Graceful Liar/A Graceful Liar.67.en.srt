(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,320
Did you see the article?

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,820
Has Dad ever, even once,

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,220
laid a hand on you?

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,920
- Never.
- Did he ever have an affair?

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,160
- Never.
- Then why say that in the article?

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,830
Why?

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,470
Why is it nothing but lies?

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,570
You didn't know?

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,610
This is how
the Kunhyang Group operates.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,210
If you don't brace yourself,
you'll face even worse...

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,780
How could you make my dad out
to be an abuser?

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,950
You're not even human!

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,350
You're a devil!

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
Die!

18
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,530
Die!

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,030
Fine.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
Go on, kill me.

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,270
If that's what it takes
to satisfy your rage,

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,370
fine. Do what you have to.

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,050
Is what you have
really that precious to you?

24
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,790
Enough to be willing to die for it?

25
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,460
Because of you...

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,530
Because of Kunhyang Group!

27
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,430
You'd turn my late father...

28
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,500
into a criminal
just to protect what's yours?

29
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,710
Is that how badly you want
to protect it?

30
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,380
I'll protect what's mine.

31
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,920
And you do what you have to do.

32
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,490
I'm going to make
your life a living torment.

33
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,290
I will make you get on your knees...

34
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,390
and beg me to kill you.

35
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,290
Fine.

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,400
Do your worst.

37
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,730
I'll look forward to it.

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Jung Won.

39
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,280
Vice Chairman Joo.

40
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,390
Quickly take this child with you.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Hye Ra.

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,030
(Episode 67)

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,070
They say the office makes the man.

44
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,000
Sitting in this chair,
I feel like...

45
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,740
I'm the chairman already.

46
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,110
I thought you were home.
What brings you here?

47
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,440
Want to get lunch?

48
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,510
Was that article your doing?

49
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,310
It wasn't me.

50
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,520
They wrote this whole story...

51
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,750
to cover up my dirty laundry,
and you're saying it wasn't you?

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,090
It must be Gong Nan Sook
who did it behind my back.

53
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,290
Gong Nan Sook?

54
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,330
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

55
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,270
The person who deserves to be here
isn't you or me.

56
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,930
It's Gong Nan Sook.

57
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,270
I was a little shocked
by the article myself.

58
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,340
"A little?"

59
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,680
Snap out of it, Jin Tae Seok.

60
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,510
If you keep letting Gong Nan Sook
chip away at you like this,

61
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,520
one day, Gong Nan Sook is going to
swallow Kunhyang whole.

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,490
That pitiful loan shark,
Gong Nan Sook?

63
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,120
That arrogance of yours...

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,390
is going to cost you dearly...

65
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,660
if you're not careful.

66
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,300
Gong Nan Sook?

67
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,070
Sure, when pigs fly.

68
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,770
That's never going to happen.

69
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:06,280
For some reason, this dim sum
doesn't seem quite as good...

70
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,590
as what I had at the Kunhyang house.

71
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,460
You'll complain about anything,
won't you?

72
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,030
My grandmother says she's exhausted.

73
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,530
At her age, playing both sides
and working double-time,

74
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,160
it's no wonder she's exhausted.

75
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,800
Can't she get by
on the money I give her?

76
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,700
Why is she always sniffing around
the Kunhyang family?

77
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,710
I only go there to cook.

78
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,510
Grandma has not once said a word.

79
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,110
Right? I knew it.

80
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,920
I'm still Grandma's favorite,
a cut above the rest, right?

81
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,750
Of course.

82
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,120
You're nothing
but the scariest woman alive.

83
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,730
How could you barge
into someone's home unannounced...

84
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,230
to say hello
in the most hostile way?

85
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,800
Goodness me!

86
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,140
- My goodness!
- The sky's punishment is too kind.

87
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,570
You've lost your mind.
Look how violent you are.

88
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,840
You barge in here as you wish
and cross the line?

89
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,540
You're the one who crossed the line!

90
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,250
How dare you plant a garbage article
like that behind my back?

91
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,390
You startled me! That article?

92
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,990
I wonder what the big deal is.
What about it?

93
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,390
I was doing it for your own good.

94
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,390
See for yourself!

95
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,490
As soon as the article came out,
your reputation was restored,

96
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,700
and Kunhyang's stock even went up.

97
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,900
Shut up!

98
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,300
I have no intentions of
making Ki Beom out to be...

99
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,140
a domestic abuser
and even a cheater...

100
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,340
to restore my reputation.

101
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,280
I'm going to issue a retraction.

102
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,480
And how are you going to do that?

103
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,680
What?

104
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,750
That you abandoned
your seven-year-old daughter?

105
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,450
That you ditched your husband
when he was framed for murder?

106
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,420
And to hide the daughter
you found after 25 years,

107
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,030
you pushed your ex down the stairs.
Is that the story you'll run?

108
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,100
Get a grip, Han Hye Ra.

109
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,870
Who cares who released the article?

110
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,310
I made your past disappear cleanly.

111
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,210
The proper response is, "Thank you."

112
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,980
Whatever the decision,

113
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,580
if it has my name on it,
I'm the one who decides.

114
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,120
From now on,
stay out of my business.

115
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,190
This is your last warning.

116
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,790
Okay, I get it.

117
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,190
Unbelievable...

118
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,030
It's still so cozy in here.

119
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,900
It'll probably be empty for a while.

120
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,940
When you want to be alone...

121
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,480
or need a break,
you can come here anytime.

122
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,680
Think of it as your own space.

123
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,550
About that article...

124
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,220
Maybe former Vice Chairman Han
didn't release it.

125
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,030
What if Chairman Jin Tae Seok
and Gong Nan Sook plotted it?

126
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,860
It doesn't matter who was behind it.

127
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,500
They dragged my father's name...

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,500
through the mud.

129
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,210
How could they do that to a man...

130
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,640
who was wrongfully accused
and died before justice was served?

131
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,550
We have to find out who did this.

132
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,550
I'm going to let
the whole world know.

133
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,990
About the injustice
done to my father.

134
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,220
I'll show what monsters Han Hye Ra,
Jin Tae Seok, and Gong Nan Sook are.

135
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,330
I will expose them
for who they really are.

136
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,730
What's your plan?

(Damga Charcoal Grill)

138
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,410
How can this be?

139
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,750
He was such a kind
and warmhearted man.

140
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,520
And he was framed and died
because of that wench, Han Hye Ra.

141
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,990
And now they're calling him
a domestic abuser?

142
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,720
- A cheater?
- We both know the truth, Mom.

143
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,760
We know what kind of man Dad was.

144
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,530
It's enough to make your father
roll over in his grave.

145
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,000
How can we stand for this?

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,070
Do people with power, money,
and connections...

147
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,370
all lie as easily as they breathe?

148
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,910
Is it okay for them to just crush
powerless people like us?

149
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,440
I'm so devastated I could just die.

150
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,080
I'm going to make them
pay for everything.

151
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,710
I'm going to become powerful
enough to do it.

152
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,680
That's right, Jung Won.

153
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,150
You must become more powerful.

154
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,590
It's the only way...

155
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,560
to take on Jin Tae Seok,
Gong Nan Sook, and me...

156
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,660
to win.

157
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,660
I can't take this anymore.

158
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,100
I'm going to go after her...

159
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,400
and rip every single hair
out of Han Hye Ra's head

160
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,010
You can't get hurt.
That would kill me.

161
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,010
Jung Won...

162
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,110
If anything happens to you, Mom,

163
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,180
how would I survive?

164

From the time I was seven until now,

165
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,450

No, I was just in the neighborhood.

172

Would you care for a cup of tea?

173
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,790

I guess Jung Won and I
do have something in common.

180
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,750
You are mother and daughter,
after all.

181
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,490
As far as Jung Won is concerned,
her mother...

182
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,960
is Jo Mi Hyang and no one else.

183
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,400
The bond from raising a child
is a powerful thing.

184
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,370
Are you envious?

185
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,740
I suppose I am.

186
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,940
How pathetic and foolish of me
to think that...

187
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,940
when I don't even deserve
to be a mother.

188
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,750
That article...

189
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,550
That wasn't you, was it?

190
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,090
Was it Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

191
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,060
Or was it Chairman Gong Nan Sook?

192
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,230
Then why haven't you told Jung Won?

193
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,630
- If you won't, I will...
- Don't.

194
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,040
May I ask why?

195
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,570
Think about why
Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

196
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,480
would leak that story...

197
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,580
with Chairman Jin Tae Seok
turning a blind eye.

198
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,550
To provoke Jung Won.

199
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,290
To drive a bigger wedge
between Jung Won and me.

200
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,620
They want her to believe
that I framed Ki Beom...

201
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,490
and that I was the one
who killed him.

202
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,260
Then you have to stop them.

203
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,030
All I have to do is
push Jung Won away.

204
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,370
That way, Jung Won...

205
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,440
won't have to face
the worst-case scenario.

206
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,610
So that's why
you're being so cruel to her?

207
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,980
Telling her you're a bad mother?
That you should live as strangers?

208
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,680
The more Jung Won thinks of me
as her mother,

209
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,520
the more she'll get hurt.

210
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,460
- And the more she'll lose.
- Then what are you going to do?

211
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,260
And how is Jung Won supposed
to heal from that?

212
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,960
Jung Won will try to clear
Ki Beom's name.

213
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm sure she will.

214
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,500
But that process...

215
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,510
will be like a knife
twisting in your heart.

216
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,840
I'll endure it, willingly.

217
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,340
Why don't you...

218
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,180
join Jung Won to take down
Jin Tae Seok and Gong Nan Sook?

219
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,250
You still don't truly understand
who Chairman Jin Tae Seok really is.

220
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,750
Rather than fighting him recklessly,

221
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,420
it's better to stay under his thumb,

222
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,230
pretending you know nothing
and acting like you're not in pain.

223
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,860
It's better to just fall in line.

224
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,730
So what about Jung Won?

225
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,440
Are you just going to continue
to turn your back on her?

226
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,710
Wait, so you were the one
behind that article?

227
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,380
Why? What are you, Han Hye Ra's...

228
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,480
I mean...

229
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,780
my mother-in-law's lawyer,
defending her with blatant lies?

230
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,750
I don't know, just forget it!
It's too much of a pain to explain.

231
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,890
Han Hye Ra already barged in here
and made a scene.

232
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,190
She completely lost it
before leaving. It was so scary.

233
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,400
- Han Hye Ra knows it was you?
- Yes.

234
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,630
She must've been furious.

235
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,640
At least Han Hye Ra
isn't the type to go around...

236
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,570
blatantly planting
trashy tabloid stories like you.

237
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,700
Shut up, you little brat.

238
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,340
Anyway, are you keeping up
the pregnancy act?

239
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,380
Don't ask.
I'm going to lose my mind.

240
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,050
I got kicked out of the Design Team
and banished to the break room.

241
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,650
And I have to keep up this act
for the Kunhyang Family.

242
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,120
Let's see, what did I crave
when I was pregnant with you?

243
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,790
Didn't you always crave something,
whether you were pregnant or not?

244
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,060
That's because I'm full of wisdom,
you little brat.

245
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,290
Right.

246
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,200
Those little, unripe peaches?
The really green ones.

247
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,630
I bought a whole huge bag of them,

248
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,170
filled up my car,
and was driving home...

249
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,540
Let me guess,
you ate them all on the way home.

250
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,780
How did you know, Manager Gu?
You weren't my assistant then.

251
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,380
Working for you, Chairman,

252
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,050
I guess some of your intelligence
has rubbed off on me.

253
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,660
What's this?

254
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,830
Out of the 25 flavors of ice cream,

255
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,990
you want him to mix five flavors...
What is that?

256
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,960
Are you crazy? It's freezing out.
Who asks for ice cream?

257
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,800
It's a pregnant woman's prerogative.

258
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,070
I want to see if Se Hoon gets it.

259
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,970
No, not that.

260
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,710
Strawberries. No,
tell him you want wild raspberries.

261
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,310
- Not the frozen kind.
- Where can he find fresh ones now?

262
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,150
Exactly. Have him go get them.
You know how men are.

263
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,150
If the wife carrying his child
says she's craving something,

264
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,920
a man will go to the ends
of the earth to get it.

265
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,090
That's just how they're wired.

266
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,850
Right, Manager Gu?

267
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,690
I'm still a bachelor,
so I wouldn't know about that.

268
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,890
Ms. Young Chae,
are you craving wild raspberries?

269
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,400
I could go get some for you...

270
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,970
Why are you offering to get them?

271
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,500
You go on and take care of Dooly.

272
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,340
You look exactly like
that guy in that cartoon.

273
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Go!

274
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,350
Se Hoon, A Reum says that
out of those 25 ice cream flavors,

275
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,880
she's craving five different kinds.

276
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,950
And wild raspberries.
Not frozen, she wants them fresh.

277
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,420
I'm at my mom's now.

278
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,360
Bring them on your way here
from work.

279
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,090
Twenty-five flavors of ice cream?

280
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,030
Wild raspberries?

281
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,100
Where on earth do I find
wild raspberries?

282
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,970
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

283
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,340
Could you come to my office
for a second?

284
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,950
Wild raspberries, sir?

285
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,080
Where would we find those now?

286
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,020
You can pull off anything,
can't you?

287
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,390
It's what A Reum is craving.

288
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,090
Wild raspberries.

289
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,340
What else did you want?

290
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,240
Wild raspberries?
Those were pretty hard to find.

291
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,840
But instead...

292
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,510
I got blueberries, blackberries,

293
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,120
- and raspberries.
- Honestly,

294
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,590
I asked for a mix of five flavors,
not all 25.

295
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,390
Unbelievable.

296
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,690
But you said 25 flavors, didn't you?

297
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,430
It seems our Vice President Jin
isn't quite as sharp as he looks.

298
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,040
Ms. Young Chae was very clear
that she wanted wild raspberries.

299
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,510
Hey, Manager Gu, what are you doing?
The ice cream's melting.

300
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,680
- Hurry, put it in the freezer.
- Yes, ma'am.

301
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,580
She said wild raspberries...

302
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,620
What's with him?

303
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,360
I promise I'll find wild raspberries
for you later.

304
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,160
It's okay. I like blueberries, too.

305
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,670
A Reum, it's extra yummy
because Daddy got it for you, isn't it?

306
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,350
I am here to refute...

307
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,850
Kunhyang Group's account...

308
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,790
of my father,
Cha Ki Beom's, alleged violent past.

309
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,960
Kunhyang is spreading lies...

310
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,530
to tarnish my late father's name.

311
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,670
The father I knew growing up...

312
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,940
was the furthest thing
from a violent man.

313
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,870
He was the warmest person
I've ever known.

314
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,340
Kunhyang's official statement...

315
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,810
is nothing but a ploy
to avoid responsibility,

316
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,580
and it is an insult to the deceased.

317
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,260
What were you doing
that you're so jumpy?

318
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,490
You're one to talk, Se Mi.

319
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,030
Why'd you sneak in like that?

320
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,260
I'll apologize for what happened
with the design book.

321
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,270
And the articles about
your late father...

322
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,540
I'm sorry about that as well.

323
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,340
Se Mi.

324
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,640
It's still hard for you to see me
as your sister, isn't it?

325
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,880
The feeling's mutual, isn't it?

326
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,010
It is, for now.

327
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,950
But...

328
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,590
I don't want you to get hurt
because of me.

329
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:40,620
What if
I refuse to give up on Ha Neul?

330
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,860
Could you give him up?

331
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,170
Do you love Ha Neul that much?

332
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,400
Even so, we're half-sisters.

333
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,440
Do you like Ha Neul enough
to resent and hate me?

334
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,240
I hate it when you say
things like that.

335
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,780
It sounds like you're gloating
about how Ha Neul is already yours.

336
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,050
That's not what I meant.

337
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,680
I just wanted to know
how you really feel.

338
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,590
We're redoing the design meeting
for next year's new collection.

339
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,920
You'd better come fully prepared.

340
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,010
What's wrong? Why the long face?

341
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,410
Dad. Am I a mean person?

342
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,880
What? Where is this coming from?

343
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,350
My Se Mi is so kind
and sweet-natured.

344
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,650
I don't think I am.

345
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,250
I hate Cha Jung Won.

346
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,890
I hate her so much.

347
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,460
You still haven't convinced
Joo Ha Neul?

348
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,300
It's all because of Cha Jung Won.

350
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,900
can I help?

351
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,100
I wish she would just disappear.

352
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240

Se Mi!

355
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,720
How could you say
something so cruel?

356
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,760
I can't believe those words came
from your mouth.

357
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,860
I must be going crazy.

358
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,990
I'm sorry, Mom.

359
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,460
You shouldn't be apologizing to me.
You should apologize to yourself.

360
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm...

361
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,900
scared.

362
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,900
- What?
- Is liking someone...

363
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,540
supposed to be this scary?

364
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,880
I can't stand that
Ha Neul likes someone else,

365
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,350
especially when that someone
is your other daughter.

366
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,020
If it were anyone but Cha Jung Won,
I wouldn't be this furious.

367
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,220
Se Mi.

368
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,290
Jung Won...

369
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,930
has the trauma of me
abandoning her as a child,

370
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and her biological father
passed away.

371
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,970
But Cha Jung Won
blames you for that.

372
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,650
I haven't done a single thing
for Jung Won.

373
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,450
If Vice Chairman Joo could at least
be the one to love her...

374
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,590
I hate that even more.

375
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,990
Oh, Se Mi.

376
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,890
I will never let Cha Jung Won
take Ha Neul...

377
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,360
or you from me.

378

379
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,020
I want to share everything with you,

380
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,830
but I'm worried it would be
too painful for you.

381
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,500
Sleep well. Sweet dreams.

382
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,270
You're so warm...

383
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,970

385
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,680
I know it must be overwhelming
to suddenly take on such a big role.

386
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,490
- Do you think you can handle it?
- I'll do my absolute best.

387
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,420

What do you think you're doing,
Joo Young Chae?

391
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,780
You must be thrilled after
exiling me to the break room...

392
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,880
and stealing
my team leader position.

393

- You still don't see your mistake?
- Spare me the lecture.

It states you're required to report
to a designated place on site.

401
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,450
I'm sure it also says...

402
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,950
the duty to report to work
can be waived until further notice.

403
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,060

Could you ask Chef Hong
to come see me?

I'm not quite satisfied
with this year's kimchi.

wasn't the one who leaked the story,

but that crazy witch
Gong Nan Sook who did?

416
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,310
Yes, that's correct.

417
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,410
So don't hold...

to let her in...

- You clueless idiot!
- So it was you, you witch!

and framed him as a cheater.

Yes, Mother.

465
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,190
You need to add more seasoning.

466
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,570
Not like that. You have to get it
between every single leaf.

467

to be spread evenly.

To do this to my father,
who died unjustly,

522
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,510
is to kill him all over again.

523
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,180
I will absolutely not...

524
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,180
let this matter rest.

525
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,960
(A Graceful Liar)

526
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,860
I was just told Chairman Jin is
on his way to the press conference.

527
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,760
- Manager Gu, go take care of it.
- I'll get rid of Cha Jung Won.

528
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,030
Anyway, I should probably go too,
don't you think?

529
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,900
This is all your fault!

530
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,070
- May you burn in the underworld!
- Jung Won's in danger.

531
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,200
Chairman Jin went after
Cha Jung Won.

532
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,570
I can't just leave this
to Gong Nan Sook.

533
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,010
I'll have to deal with
Cha Jung Won myself.

534
