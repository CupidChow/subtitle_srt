1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,270
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,310
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,140
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,480
I can't just sit around and wait...

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,280
until the Kunhyang family
makes a decision.

6
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,220
Vice Chairman Han said
she needs more time.

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,550
I feel differently.

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,620
I'm done living
as the fake Young Chae.

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,230
- So you're going to live as Su A?
- No.

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,660
As Cha Jung Won.

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,470
From now on, I'm Cha Jung Won.

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,110
I'm going to live
as Han Hye Ra's daughter.

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,180
Okay, then. I'll look more into
what really happened to your father.

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,490
Why go to all this trouble
to help me?

15
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,590
Well...

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,290
I want to know how your father died,
and whether there was any foul play.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,660
And you need to know exactly
what your next steps should be.

18
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,270
And?

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,400
That you're no longer
my fake little sister.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,840
And that you've become
the most important person to me.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,640
That's what I've realized.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,050
For now, knowing my true feelings
is enough.

23
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,680
Besides, helping you helps me, too.

24
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,790
If, besides Han Hye Ra,

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,590
Jin Tae Seok and Gong Nan Sook
are also tied to Cha Ki Beom's case,

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,030
then the same must be true
for my father.

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,530
Are you saying
the ones who hurt your father...

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,570
could be Chairman Gong Nan Sook
and Jin Tae Seok?

29
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,370
I believe they're connected somehow.

30
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,540
So we want the same thing, then?

31
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,980
I'm glad.

32
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,210
That you've finally found
your true self.

33
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,580
Whatever happens,
don't waver from being Cha Jung Won,

34
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,120
and I hope you stand strong
and overcome this.

35
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,460
Hello, everyone.

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,530
My name is Cha Jung Won.

37
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,170
I'm a daughter of Vice Chairman
Han Hye Ra.

38
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,110
At one point,
I was also known as Su A.

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,680
What is the meaning of this?

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,610
We were planning to contact you
when the time was right.

41
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,180
And when exactly would that be?

42
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,620
Young Chae.

43
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,550
No. Right, Cha Jung Won.

44
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,750
Jung Won, please. Talk to me first.

45
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,220
You need to hear this, too, Se Hoon.

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,130
- I'm not your wife anymore.
- Then who are you?

47
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,060
Cha Jung Won?

48
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,270
Su A?

49
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,100
The woman who was my wife...

50
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,870
is now the daughter
Mother found after 25 years?

51
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,010
Am I supposed to just accept you
as my sister?

52
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,240
We need to talk.

53
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,690
Why the rush?

54
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,530
Was I supposed to wait
for you to summon me?

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,060
I've discussed this
with Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

56
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,140
How would you feel
about going abroad for a few years?

57
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,870
You can use the opportunity
to properly study design.

58
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,410
You want me to run away
and hide abroad?

59
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,740
Other than giving birth to you,

60
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,820
there's nothing I've done for you
or can do for you now.

61
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,950
Money?

62
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,290
I can give you plenty of that.

63
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,130
So, you're just trying
to pay me off.

64
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,500
I said I'd acknowledge you
as my daughter.

65
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,770
But I need time to sort things out.

66
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,800
For Se Hoon's sake, as well.

67
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,400
Are you afraid that
if people find out who I am,

68
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,570
everything you've built
will come crumbling down?

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,210
Nothing that I have
and am protecting...

70
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,980
can be taken from me.

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,650
You should just ask to be recognized
as my daughter and given a share.

72
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,520
It's a far cry from when you thought
Young Chae was the real Su A.

73
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,790
You're treating me so differently.

74
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,730
I was hurt to learn
that she was the fake Su A,

75
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,700
but that's less painful than
my daughter-in-law being my child.

76
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,430
You...

77
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,270
Your heart is brimming
with vengeance.

78
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,080
- Do you want me to just disappear?
- My choices, my desires...

79
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,410
Or call it greed, I don't care.

80
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,680
I won't try to deliberately erase...

81
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,720
or forget.

82
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,490
You killed my father.

83
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,460
That's not all.

84
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,630
I abandoned you, too,

85
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,660
Su A.

86
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,870
But you said you didn't abandon me.

87
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,600
You said there was an accident,

88
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,900
and that was why
you couldn't come get me.

89
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,610
You see, I knew.

90
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,550
That Tae Seok never wanted you.

91
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,880
But you still wanted to be
the lady of Kunhyang, didn't you?

92
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,220
Then you just so happened
to have an accident,

93
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,950
and by a miracle, you survived?

94
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,660
Were you destined to become the wife
of Kunhyang's Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

95
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,330
I abandoned you,

96
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,130
and I'm only now realizing that
I'd blocked it from memory.

97
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,470
I won't deny it anymore.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,010
It took me 25 years
to realize the truth.

99
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,210
I only chose to remember...

100
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,980
that I had been desperately
searching for you.

101
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,450
Did you also erase the memory
of pushing my father...

102
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,750
down the stairs at the gallery?

103
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,130
- Yes, I did it.
- Then you must pay for your crime.

104
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,570
Pay for what I've done?

105
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,200
Are you hoping I'll turn myself in?

106
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,640
That's not nearly enough.

107
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,870
You'll probably use Kunhyang's power
to evade the law...

108
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,010
or get a suspended sentence.

109
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,680
Because that's what power is.

110
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,420
You chased that power to become
the lady of the Kunhyang family,

111
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,790
and you even clawed your way up
to Vice Chairman of Kunhyang Group.

112
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,190
You ignored your own daughter
whom you just reunited with,

113
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,460
and now want to send her abroad.

114
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,190
Is that position
really worth all that?

115
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,270
But didn't you want to live...

116
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,140
as the fake Joo Young Chae?

117
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,400
You were trapped
in a world of lies, too.

118
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,710
Do you really think you've escaped?

119
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,350
It was like quicksand
you can never escape from.

120
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,650
After my father passed away,

121
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,250
I gave up that fake life.

122
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,660
I paid way too high a price.

123
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,730
At least I knew I was lying...

124
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,960
and living a fake life.

125
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,870
You, on the other hand,
still don't get it.

126
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,570
You're the one...

127
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,610
who's the real Ripley.

128
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,540
Fine.

129
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,550
You're right.

130
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,480
That's exactly who I am.

131
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,920
But you failed
to make your fantasy a reality.

132
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,290
I succeeded.

133
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,120
Look.

134
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,360
One of the top tycoon families
in the country is mine.

135
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,360
The one who can control Jin Tae Seok
of Kunhyang Group is me.

136
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,070
- How is any of that a lie or fake?
- It's a house of cards.

137
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,270
Depending on
Chairman Jin Tae Seok's decision,

138
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,680
- it could all collapse overnight.
- Jin Tae Seok.

139
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,950
I can destroy him whenever I choose.

140
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,250
This is my real strength...

141
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,790
and power, Su A.

142
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,260
There was a time I wanted
to climb higher and higher...

143
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,490
didn't care about stairs,

144
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,090
and just wanted to fly.

145
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,700
All the way up to the sky
where you were.

146
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,940
You still can.

147
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,870
- Because you're my daughter.
- Lies.

148
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,980
You want to hide the fact
that I'm your daughter.

149
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,550
Your position, fake name
and fake honor.

150
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,090
You're not willing to give up
a single bit of it.

151
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,790
Because I don't have to.

152
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,560
I can enjoy it more,

153
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,130
and then I might even
give it to you.

154
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,470
So don't even think
about taking it from me.

155
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,230
And forget this nonsense
about revenge!

156
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,040
What about the truth?

157
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,680
The fact that you caused
my father's death.

158
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,410
But the guilt was only fleeting,

159
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,280
- and now you'll just forget it?
- Guilt?

160
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,090
I'll carry that with me
for the rest of my life.

161
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,030
But the living must go on living.

162
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,260
So you'll deny the truth to live?

163
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,240
I need to know exactly how Dad died.

164
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,840
What do you mean by that?

165
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,740
You said that even after you pushed
my father down the stairs,

166
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,340
he was still alive, right?

167
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,180
What if something else
happened after that?

168
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,890
Whether the empire you've built is real,

169
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,750
or you're just a puppet
dancing on strings...

170
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,790
for Chairman Gong Nan Sook
and Jin Tae Seok...

171
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,560
and nothing more.

172
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,230
Don't you want to find out?

173
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,400
Until I find out that truth,

174
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,970
I'm not going anywhere.

175
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,140
That's why I have to live
in the Kunhyang house...

176
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,310
as Cha Jung Won,
daughter of Cha Ki Beom.

177
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,250
Chairman Jin wants to see you all
in the living room.

178
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,160
What? Cha Jung Won just barged
into the Kunhyang house?

179
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,960
All right. Keep an eye on her.

180
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,270
What are you talking about?

181
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,370
Jung Won went
to the Kunhyang house uninvited?

182
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,310
Who does Cha Jung Won take after
to be so driven and decisive?

183
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,810
Did she get it from Han Hye Ra?
This is so frustrating!

184
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,050
She's your supposed daughter, right?
So maybe she gets it from you.

185
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,020
At times like these,
I wish she were my daughter instead.

186
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,090
She'd be perfect.

187
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,460
CEO Joo.

188
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,790
You know Cha Jung Won
went to the Kunhyang house, right?

189
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,530
Now she's decided to end the act,
we have to respect her decision.

190
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,730
She is Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra's
biological daughter, after all.

191
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,670
Then I guess I should
storm the Kunhyang house soon.

192
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,300
To take my place
by Jin Se Hoon's side.

193
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,370
Next to him, in front, I don't care.
Try to charm him already, will you?

194
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,610
Hurry up!

195
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,620
This is the admissions paperwork
for New York Royal Art School.

196
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,620
If you study there for two years
and come back,

197
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,920
it'll be easier to reveal...

198
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,660
you're Su A,
Vice Chairman Han's daughter.

199
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,660
I've already told Vice Chairman Han
my decision.

200
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,360
I'm not going anywhere.

201
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,260
In the Kunhyang house,

202
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,300
I want to live as Cha Jung Won.

203
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,040
Does that mean you intend to live
as Mother's daughter?

204
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,470
- That's right.
- So you're ending things with me?

205
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,110
Because I have no other choice.

206
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,840
The place by your side...

207
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,450
must belong to Joo Young Chae.

208
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,320
(Application for Divorce
by Mutual Consent)

209
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,190
Divorce papers? Didn't you say
you'd never leave her?

210
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,430
Didn't you say
she's the only wife for you?

211
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,100
I am divorcing Joo Young Chae.

212
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,170
- What are you doing?
- I said I'm filing the papers.

213
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,300
And...

214
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,100
I am going to marry Cha Jung Won.

215
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,170
- Se Hoon.
- You brat.

216
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,740
Are you kidding me?

217
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,540
How can you marry
your own mother's daughter?

218
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,850
We're siblings in name only.
We don't share a drop of blood.

219
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,420
- We could be together abroad...
- Stop it.

220
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,790
That's ridiculous.

221
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,290
Or...

222
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,460
Mother and Father.

223
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,790
- You two get a divorce.
- Jin Se Hoon!

224
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,200
You pathetic fool.
You need to face reality.

225
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,730
And you expect to run Kunhyang Group
acting like this?

226
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,570
My life is meaningless without her.
More than Kunhyang Group,

227
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,070
- she's more important to me.
- Is Kunhyang just a joke to you?

228
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,480
Do you think
it's some mom-and-pop shop?

229
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,420
You said that even after you pushed
my father down the stairs,

230
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,220
he was still alive, right?

231
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,060
What if something else
happened after that?

232
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,760
Whether the empire
you've built is real,

233
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,130
or you're just a puppet
dancing on strings...

234
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,360
for Chairman Gong Nan Sook
and Jin Tae Seok...

235
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,330
and nothing more.

236
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,140
Don't you want to find out?

237
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,140
Su A.

238
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,880
Accept her into the Kunhyang family
as Cha Jung Won.

239
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,410
Honey.

240
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,410
- Mother.
- Mom!

241
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,280
We'll live together for a while...

242
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,350
and discuss what to do next.

243
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,490
Honey.

244
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,330
We need to talk.

245
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,140
They're all out of their minds.

246
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,010
You like wine, don't you?

247
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,150
It's a bit early for drinking...

248
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,080
Come on, it's the weekend.

249
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,990
That day...

250
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,460
I mean, the day Cha Ki Beom
met Vice Chairman Han.

251
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,060
You were with Chairman Gong,
weren't you, Manager Gu?

252
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,260
The video Jung Won got,

253
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,400
you were the one who sent it
to Young Chae first, weren’t you?

254
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,300
I had no idea Ms. Young Chae
would use it like that...

255
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,070
What matters is what you do now.

256
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,710
Not what happened in the past.

257
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,340
I heard you finished school
with Chairman Gong's help,

258
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,610
and you chose to be her secretary
to repay that kindness.

259
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,980
That's right.

260
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,520
If her actions are right or wrong...

261
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,950
or, even if it hurts people,

262
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,360
is just turning a blind eye
and helping her...

263
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,860
really how you repay her kindness?

264
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,660
- I know it's not, but...
- Are you afraid of Chairman Gong?

265
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,630
I've served her for 13 years.
She's the scariest person I know...

266
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,940
And yet you did as Young Chae asked.

267
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,670
When Young Chae was locked up
in the nursing home,

268
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,640
you're the one who helped her,
weren't you?

269
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,410
No, absolutely not.

270
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,180
So it is true.
I was just taking a wild guess.

271
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,590
Did you feel sorry for Young Chae?
You probably thought she had it all,

272
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,760
getting anything she ever wanted,

273
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,260
but she was cast out
and lacked her mother's approval.

274
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,130
Thank you for the wine.

275
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,840
You're a good man, Manager Gu.

276
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,610
About that day,

277
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,950
if you know everything
that went on at the gallery,

278
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,980
can't you find the courage
to speak up for them?

279
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,920
Someone was deeply hurt
by that incident,

280
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,420
and it would be a terrible injustice
if they never learned the truth.

281
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,220
For the man who died
and his daughter.

282
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,660
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,300
I can only hope Manager Gu...

284
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,010
is a good man.

285
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,740
Why should I discuss family business
with the fake Su A...

286
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,180
I mean, with you, Joo Young Chae?

287
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,250
Why do you ask?
Because I'm the real Joo Young Chae,

288
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,520
and your real sister-in-law.

289
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,050
In your dreams.

290
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,790
My brother
will remarry Cha Jung Won...

291
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,790
even if it means
getting our parents divorced.

292
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,230
What are you talking about?

293
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,630
What?
Jin Se Hoon is demanding a divorce?

294
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,770
What do we do?

295
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,200
I thought getting rid of her was it.

296
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,400
What do you mean, "what do we do?"

297
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,470
I just have to put the pressure
on Jin Tae Seok again.

298
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,150
Why did you say you'd accept Su A
as Cha Jung Won...

299
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,450
without discussing it with me?

300
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,120
That's not what we discussed.

301
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,520
She's not the type to just leave
if we try to send her abroad.

302
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,790
- It would be better to...
- Better to what?

303
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,190
Keep her close.

304
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,420
And keep an eye on her.
I'd feel less anxious that way.

305
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,000
"Keep your friends close,
and your enemies closer?"

306
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,570
Is Cha Jung Won...

307
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,670
really your enemy?

308
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,670
She's your daughter, after all.

309
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,870
Anyone threatening the Kunhyang family,

310
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,940
no matter who it is...

311
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,940
is my enemy.

312
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,220
She believes I killed her father.
That makes her more dangerous.

313
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,490
Just because she's my daughter,
my own flesh and blood,

314
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,890
everything I've accomplished so far,

315
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,860
Kunhyang,
which you and I built together.

316
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,530
You think I'd let that fall apart?

317
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,700
You have a point.

318
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,930
It's better than not knowing what
she might be planning for years.

319
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,270
Maybe this is better.

320
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,110
You'll live in the Kunhyang house
as Cha Jung Won?

321
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,580
What about me?
Do I mean nothing to you?

322
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,790
I've just gone back to being me,
Se Hoon.

323
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,290
Don't defy the Chairman
or the Vice Chairman anymore.

324
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,930
You still don't understand
how I feel?

325
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,690
I don't need any of it.

326
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,870
I don't need Kunhyang Group
as long as I have you by my side.

327
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,130
That's a lie.

328
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,410
- What?
- I know you're angry and betrayed.

329
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,270
So just take it all out on me.

330
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,340
- And stop whining.
- Whining?

331
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,510
Is that all you see this as?

332
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,680
You're only saying this because you
think your father won't disown you.

333
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,620
And you think you're the only heir
to Kunhyang Group.

334
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,990
- Am I wrong?
- Then what am I supposed to do?

335
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,790
I have to do something.

336
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,660
I can't ever let you go,

337
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,300
but if you're Mother's daughter,
that makes you my sister.

338
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,100
And I'm just supposed
to accept this?

339
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,170
- Is that even possible?
- I'm not just your sister.

340
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
What do you mean?

341
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,040
I came back
to the Kunhyang family...

342
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,340
to find the truth
about my father's death...

343
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,710
and make the real killer pay
for what they did.

344
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,720
Whether it's Vice Chairman Han
who gave birth to me...

345
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,980
or Chairman Jin,

346
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,090
I will never forgive them.

347
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,620
I'm going to fight...

348
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,190
the Kunhyang family
and Kunhyang Group you belong to.

349
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,290
After all this,
can you still see me as your wife,

350
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,800
as the woman you love?

351
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,540
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

352
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,580
You can order at the kiosk.
Do you need a hand with that?

353
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,650
I can manage.

354
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,220
You're Jin Tae Seok's secretary,
aren't you?

355
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,290
- That's right, Ms. Jo Mi Hyang.
- So what are you doing here?

356
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,990
Did Jin Tae Seok send you?

357
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,330
My husband is gone now,

358
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,870
- why are you still harassing me?
- That's not it.

359
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,770
- I was just passing by.
- Just passing by?

360
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,870
I just really like barbecue.

361
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,950
This place is pretty famous.
Word has gotten around.

362
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,450
Eat up and enjoy.

363
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,690
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

364
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,460
The Kunhyang Group Chairman's secretary...

365
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,800
coming here to eat barbecue
by himself?

366
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,800
He's definitely up to something.

367
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,480
CEO Joo.

368
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,110
Are you busy right now?

369
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,920
CEO Joo Ha Neul?

370
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,430
Care for a drink?

371
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,230
Just one shot would be fine.

372
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,330
For crying out loud!
Is it really this hard...

373
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,370
to get one person, Jin Se Hoon,
under control?

374
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,580
Chairman Jin, how can we do business
if you can't even handle him?

375
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,040
You can't put all the blame
on Se Hoon.

376
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,510
His wife's identity
changed overnight.

377
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,120
He has a good reason to be upset.

378
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,020
So you'll just let them divorce?
Is that it?

379
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,450
Of course not.

380
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,920
He can't get a divorce by himself.
Not when you're standing in the way.

381
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,890
Even if Se Hoon signs the papers,

382
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,860
all Joo Young Chae has to do
is refuse to sign.

383
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,800
But what if Jin Se Hoon
forces it through anyway?

384
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,370
Well, it's not impossible.
He is my son, after all.

385
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,470
- He only has eyes for one woman.
- Jin Tae Seok!

386
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,840
- Throwing a fit again?
- How can you expect me not to?

387
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,980
Forget about bringing Cha Jung Won
into the Kunhyang house,

388
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,450
and focus on making Young Chae
Jin Se Hoon's wife!

389
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,290
Or else...

390
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,350
Or else what?

391
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,220
What you, Jin Tae Seok, did...

392
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,490
after Han Hye Ra pushed Cha Ki Beom
down the stairs at the gallery.

393
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,170
I'll expose it all to the world.

394
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,140
What brings you here?

395
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,540
- I was just passing by.
- Do you feel...

396
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,740
guilty about what happened to him?

397
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,280
Guilty?

398
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,340
That day,

399
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,050
what happened
in front of the gallery.

400
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,220
I know you watched the whole thing
from start to finish.

401
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,690
I don't know
what you're talking about.

402
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,760
Wherever Chairman Jin Tae Seok goes,

403
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,890
you're always there, aren't you?

404
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,660
Besides what happened
between Vice Chairman Han...

405
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,500
and Cha Ki Beom,

406
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,900
I know there's more that you know.

407
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,440
That secretary knows everything
about what happened to Ki Beom?

408
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,650
- What do you want?
- I want to know the truth.

409
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,290
I am a shadow.

410
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,260
I cannot think, judge, or make decisions.

411
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,160
That's how I've always lived,

412
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,660
and that's how
I'll continue to live.

413
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,130
Thanks for the drink.

414
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,550
What was that all about?

415
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,620
What do you mean
that secretary knows everything?

416
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,490
- Throwing a fit again?
- How can you expect me not to?

417
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,600
Forget about bringing Cha Jung Won
into the Kunhyang house,

418
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,070
and focus on making Young Chae
Jin Se Hoon's wife!

419
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,000
Or else...

420
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,400
Or else what?

421
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,010
What you, Jin Tae Seok, did...

422
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,210
after Han Hye Ra pushed Cha Ki Beom
down the stairs at the gallery.

423
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,280
I'll expose it all to the world.

424
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,850
Shut up! You think
a pathetic video like that...

425
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,620
can be used to blackmail me?

426
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,520
What you did to Joo Sang Cheol.

427
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,350
How about I expose that too?

428
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:16,490
Isn't it better to remove the bug
from your office?

429
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,960
I'll handle it.

430
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,770

(Kunhyang Group)

432
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,940
I was just about
to call you, actually.

433
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,380
You bugged my office?

434
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,450
Is that how little you trust me?

435
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,690
Are you upset?

436
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,620
I just missed the sound
of your voice.

437
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,960
I can't go a moment
without hearing it.

438
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,730
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

439
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,940
There's one in my office, too.

440
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,870
Why would you do
something like this?

441
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,410
The CCTV cameras don't record audio.

442
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,790
The Owner Risk Team installed them
in our offices for security.

443
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,220
Then why didn't you tell me?

444
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,760
I knew you'd be uncomfortable,
feeling like you're always watched.

445
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,430
This piece of junk.

446
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,400
Don't ever put it
in my office again.

447
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,130
Fine. I'll tell the Owner Risk Team.

448
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,900
I'll make it crystal clear.

449
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,570
Shall we head home together,
my beautiful wife?

450
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,440
You go on ahead.

451
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,750
I have one more thing
to take care of.

452
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,520
Was getting
into the Kunhyang house a success?

453
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,690
Ha Neul...

454
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,800
I mean, Mr. Joo, what about you?

455
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,730
Mr. Joo?

456
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,000
That's much better.

457
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,470
We're not brother
and sister anymore.

458
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,580
I managed to contact Manager Hwang
and Manager Gu,

459
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,680
but they've been Chairman Jin...

460
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,280
and Chairman Gong's
most trusted aides for ages,

461
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,780
so they won't be easy to crack.

462
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,190
Manager Hwang went
to my mom's restaurant?

463
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,790
But why?

464
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,490
That's what I find strange.

465
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,030
Something must be weighing
on his conscience.

466
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,970
For someone as unflappable
as Manager Hwang...

467
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,200
to suddenly have a change of heart?

468
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,310
I'm surprised you asked to see me,
Mother.

469
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,510
- "Mother?"
- Se Hoon and I...

470
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,280
broke off our engagement,
but you are still my mother.

471
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,520
Don't you have something for me?

472
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,660
You mean this, don't you?

473
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,260
You must have been quite shocked.

474
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:13,200
That Se Hoon's wife was an imposter
posing as Joo Young Chae,

475
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,940
- claiming to be your real daughter.
- Where's the original memory card?

476
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:21,140
I'm still trying to decide...

477
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,410
whether I should give it to you or not.

478
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,380
What do you want?

479
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,180
I don't have any ulterior motives.

480
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,190
I'm just worried...

481
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,490
about you and Se Hoon.

482
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,360
What do you think would happen
if this photo got out?

483
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,970
Will a job in the Design Team do?

484
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,170
And one more thing.

485
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,700
Something that's truly important.

486
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,070
To restore my relationship with you?

487
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,080
And you don't want
to get back together with Se Hoon?

488
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,950
I'm done desperately
holding on to a man...

489
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,580
who doesn't want me.

490
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,820
I want to succeed in my career.

491
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,290
Using a fashion designer position
at Kunhyang as a stepping stone.

492
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,790
Mending your relationship with me?

493
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,990
- Is there any way I can help?
- Let me help you instead.

494
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,160
I'll be your eyes and ears.

495
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,130
We'll see about that.
Let's start with what you call me.

496
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,240
- Call me Vice Chairman.
- Yes, Vice Chairman.

497
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,710
You'll join Kunhyang's design team
next week.

(Kunhyang Group)

499
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,960
Welcome, Ahn Ji Na and Kim Sung Hee.

500
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,990
I look forward to working with you,
Director Jin.

501
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,360
I'm so thrilled to be working
in the Kunhyang design team.

502
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,170
It's nice and cozy.
Is it just the three of us?

503
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,900
Two more people will be joining us.

504
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:03,510
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

505
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,400
So we meet again.

506
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,570
- Cha Jung Won.
- Joo Young Chae.

507
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,310
Looks like we can finally
go head-to-head.

508
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,150
Right?

509
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,250
(Voice Recording)

510
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,790
President Jin,
there's been an accident.

511
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,620
You have to help me.

512
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,130
You're telling me Joo Sang Cheol
died in some kind of accident?

513
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,400
And why is that my problem?

514
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,800
You can't do this to me.

515
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,740
Don't you know I haven't signed
the investment papers yet?

516
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,310
If this project falls through,
your chairmanship is over too.

517
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
I almost forgot.

518
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,380
I have the perfect solution.

519
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
Cha Ki Beom.

520
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,750
A real pain in the neck
works at that construction site.

521
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,650
Don't you worry about a thing.
Just go home and rest.

522
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,990
Tomorrow, the sun will rise again.

523
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,030
Really?

524
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,530
Will the sun really rise tomorrow?

525
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:29,200
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

526
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,170
(From)

527
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,140
(A Graceful Liar)

528
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,400
I'm Cha Jung Won.

529
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,540
I went by Joo Young Chae for a while
for personal reasons.

530
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,510
Ms. Cha, what right do you have
to be a designer for Kunhyang?

531
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,450
Why haven't you officially announced
that you're my daughter?

532
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,410
The truth is still an unfamiliar
and heavy burden.

533
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,550
You killed my father.

534
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,350
How can you act like it's nothing
in front of me?

535
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,090
- That's right. I killed him.
- Are you even human?

536
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,890
There's nothing more vile
and terrifying than a human being.

537
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,630
Gong Nan Sook, you're the one...

538
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,400
who killed Joo Sang Cheol.
