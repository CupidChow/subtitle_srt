1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,170
(All characters, locations, organizations,
and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,040
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,240
(This production followed all guidelines
for young actors.)

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,680
Did you want to see me
just to give me this?

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,320
Our two chance encounters...

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,220
Yes, the locations were a coincidence.

7
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,390
But I already knew who you were.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,300
I just found out a few days ago
from a magazine.

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,670
I don't really follow the business world,

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,470
so I had no idea
you were Vice Chairman Han.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,240
That made me even happier.

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,440
That slight wariness toward a stranger.

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,950
An ingrained sense of consideration,
humility, and courtesy.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,380
I knew none of it was an act.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,280
I'm not Young Chae.

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,220
I'm Cha Jung Won.

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,460
That's what I came here to tell you.

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,930
Thank you...

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,160
for entering the new designer contest
at Kunhyang Fashion.

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,500
Ma'am, actually...

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,170
Young Chae, your design captivated me.
"Innovative" doesn't begin to cover it.

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,340
You have such a strong
and distinct vision.

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,380
(A modern take on a matador's suit)

24
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,120
(Ornate baroque patterns
meet a modern suit silhouette)

25
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,190
(A fusion of classic and contemporary)

26
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,860
That's my design.

27
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,360
Not Joo Young Chae's.

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,600
You're saying this design is mine?

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,000
You're the one who submitted it,
aren't you?

30
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,170
(A fusion of classic and contemporary)

31
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,210
(Profound, luxurious, and dramatic)

32
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,740
I wanted to compliment you.

33
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,150
I wanted to introduce myself before
your blind date with my son, Se Hoon.

34
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,850
Now, it's your turn, Young Chae.

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,760
What was it you wanted to say?

36
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,420
Pardon?

37
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,530
Well...

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,670
When I realized that the person
I'd met twice by chance...

39
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,170
was actually Vice Chairman Han
of Kunhyang Group,

40
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,410
I started to worry.

41
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,910
That maybe...

42
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,440
That maybe?

43
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,910
That you might think I knew
who you were all along,

44
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:24,050
and was just putting on an act
to get on your good side.

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,280
Were you?

46
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,450
What?

47
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,090
Please. You blush at the slightest joke.

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,460
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

49
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,270
I'm truly sorry.

50
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,330
Not at all.

51
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,270
I wouldn't have said anything either,
if I were you.

52
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,440
I completely understand your position.

53
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,510
You're exceptionally considerate.

54
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,920
(Episode 5)

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,120
Hey! Young Chae!

56
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,760
Seriously. Come on.

57
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,130
Barging in again in broad daylight?

58
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,730
Let’s just stick
to what we’ve always done.

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,030
Let's meet once or twice a year.

60
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,000
Good grief.

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,940
I know you're my daughter,
but how did you get so deviously clever?

62
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,410
"Deviously clever?" That's an insult.

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,480
No, I mean, how did you come up
with such a brilliant little scheme?

64
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,580
Just get to the point.

65
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,050
I don't want to drag this out with you.

66
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,320
Oh, it's just because you're so cute.

67
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,160
What are you doing?
If you keep that up, you'll ruin my face.

68
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,490
The new designer contest
at Kunhyang Fashion?

69
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,930
Yes.

70
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,630
I entered out of boredom.
I'm not going for the interview.

71
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,630
End of discussion!

72
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,840
- No way. You're going.
- No, I'm not!

73
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,840
Young Chae, come on.

74
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,440
I said, don't even dream about it.

75
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,810
If you can just become a designer
at Kunhyang Fashion, then...

76
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,880
- I can't hear you!
- Joo Young Chae!

77
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,450
You're so annoying.

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,420
This is a huge opportunity for you.

79
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,390
Do you have any idea how much
the Kunhyang family will adore you?

80
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,630
I couldn't care less.

81
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,670
Young Chae, don't you feel
the least bit sorry for your mother?

82
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,500
Is your life the only one that matters?

83
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,570
What about me? What about my life?
What about my love?

84
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,540
I told you, love is just something
that comes and goes in a flash.

85
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,450
It's like a dream you wake up from.
A mirage.

86
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,750
Just go on the blind date first.

87
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,890
And then you'll ace your interview.
Then my whole plan will fall into place.

88
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,490
- Okay?
- Do whatever you want.

89
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Young Chae, wait...

90
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,530
She's going to do what I say anyway.
She just has to get under my skin first.

91
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,500
Who does she take after?

92
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,310
Talent that can pass a blind screening.

93
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,710
That, and that alone,

94
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,810
is the only weapon you need
to survive in this world.

95
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Understand?

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,290
I didn't stop to think how upset you'd be.

97
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,420
When I couldn't care less
whether I got in or not.

98
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,960
Then why did you steal my design again?

99
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,430
Wasn't stealing from me in high school
enough for you?

100
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,400
I want you to congratulate me, Jung Won.

101
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,200
You have the nerve to ask me
to congratulate you?

102
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,940
You thief.

103
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,430
Oh, this looks amazing!

104
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,670
It's almost too pretty to eat.

105
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,710
As always, your Caprese salad is amazing.

106
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,780
An equal mix of apple, carrot,
and cabbage.

107
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,120
Your CCA juice is served.

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
No way.

109
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,150
Come on, it's good for you
on an empty stomach.

110
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,090
Espresso, please.

111
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,390
Drink this, and I'll get you one. Deal?

112
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,390
Deal.

113
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,900
This feels better.

114
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,870
You know, sometimes, I imagine...

115
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,010
it'd be nice living with you forever.

116
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Forever?

117
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,850
Why would I do that?

118
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,280
No, why would you?

119
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,680
Why do you think?

120
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,620
Because Cha Jung Won
is my one and only best friend.

121
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,460
A design that meant the world
to your best friend.

122
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,430
You stole it twice.

123
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,330
And here you are, smiling so brightly.

124
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,730
Joo Young Chae.

125
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,070
I imagine...

126
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,470
putting poison in your coffee
every morning.

127
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,940
Something darker and more potent
than any espresso.

128
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,710
A single drop would be enough
to take your last breath.

129
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,080
That jerk. I told him not to call,
and he actually listens?

130
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,180
With a smile as bright as that,

131
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,820
I wonder if you'd die just as beautifully.

132
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,190
What should I do with you?

133
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,860
My most beautiful...

134
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,660
and worst friend, Young Chae.

135
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,930
About Park Kyung Shin...

136
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,130
What about him?

137
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,530
Did he get in touch?

138
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,630
No. The opposite.

139
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,740
Since when has he ever listened
to me so well?

140
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,410
So, you're not over him yet.

141
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,480
What?

142
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,380
So what are you going to do
about Jin Se Hoon?

143
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,380
- What about the arranged date?
- Oh, that?

144
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,020
I'm just my mom's puppet,
and Jin Se Hoon is Vice Chairman Han's.

145
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,460
Hey, it's all just a setup.

146
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,960
So when's the blind date?

147
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,930
The day after tomorrow at five, I think?

148
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,970
My mom's nagging me about the interview
for the designer job at Kunhyang Fashion.

149
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,900
Then it's really over
with Park Kyung Shin.

150
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,580
I'll protect this love of yours.

151
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,080
I'm the one who loves you most
in the world.

152
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,210
I'm your best friend, after all.

153
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,320
I didn't expect you to call me first.

154
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,360
Young Chae has a blind date in two days
with Jin Se Hoon of Kunhyang Group.

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,100
Are you just going to give up?

156
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,110
I can't help it, I guess.

157
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,310
I was planning to help you.

158
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,750
How? What could you possibly do to help?

159
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,550
If I were to help you,

160
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,620
can you promise you'll love Young Chae,
no matter what?

161
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,130
Are you scared that you could be drowned?

162
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,270
What a coward.

163
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,470
Young Chae's mom.

164
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,100
She's terrifying.

165
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,840
Then you have to run away. Far away.

166
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,580
But first.

167
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,350
You have to die.

168
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,830
Are you ready, son?

169
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,860
Are you coming with me, Mother?

170
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,370
I just wanted to pop in
and see how you were doing.

171
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,410
Oh, for a second there, I thought
you'd hold my hand like I was a kid.

172
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,710
In a mother's eyes, even a grown child
is still someone to worry about.

173
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,720
The child is always on her mind
and making her anxious.

174
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,320
That's just how mothers are.

175
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,190
"Are you sincere? You're not my real mom."

176
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,660
Can you read minds now?

177
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,730
Instead,

178
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,730
you were born from my heart,

179
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,400
my son.

180
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,700
Hey.

181
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,670
Wear this tie.

182
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,050
You gave me this for my last birthday.
It's a lucky charm.

183
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,850
Are you two worried I'm going to
blow this whole thing?

184
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,660
Even if you don't like her, don't be rash.
Give her three dates.

185
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,430
Joo Young Chae might call it off first.
Don't get too cocky.

186
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,300
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

187
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,100
If Romeo and Juliet
had actually gotten together,

188
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,140
do you think they'd have been
happy together? Never.

189
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,880
So, you're saying unfulfilled love
is more beautiful?

190
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,050
Who cares about being the star
of some tragic novel?

191
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,220
I want a real love story.

192
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,650
I want Park Kyung Shin.

193
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,430
(Kyung Shin)

194
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,530
Kyung Shin, where are you?

195
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,630
Who is this?

196
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,410
What? The hospital?

197
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,280
- What is it, Young Chae?
- Oh, no. What am I going to do?

198
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,810
Kyung Shin was rushed to the ER
for overdosing on sleeping pills.

199
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,280
What?

200
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,180
I'm going to die without him.

201
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,620
What about the arranged date?

202
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,860
And how are you going
to handle your mother?

203
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,390
Oh, what do I do?
If I can get through this arranged date...

204
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,300
Jung Won.

205
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,100
Listen to me very carefully.

206
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,170
I have to save my man. So...

207
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,700
I need you to save me.

208
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,070
Go on the arranged date
with Jin Se Hoon for me.

209
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,270
Pretend you're me.

210
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,810
- You want me to die?
- Face death to live.

211
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,020
Only when you're ready to die
can you truly live.

212
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,290
So, I should fake my own death?

213
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,590
Timing is everything.

214
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,560
It has to be before
Young Chae's date with Jin Se Hoon.

215
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,280
Mr. Jin Se Hoon?

216
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,020
Joo Young Chae?

217
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,290
You don't remember me?
We met a few times when we were kids.

218
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,300
Was it that long ago?
I don't think we've ever met.

219
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,900
So,

220
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,670
no formalities?

221
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,070
You started it.

222
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,980
Are you offended?

223
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,250
No.

224
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,180
It feels friendly. I like it.

225
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,690
I knew you'd be a handful,

226
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,950
and you've definitely got spunk.

227
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,090
I like it a lot.

228
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,990
Straight to the flirting?

229
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,760
And does that usually work for you?

230
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,400
Not you. Your portfolio.

231
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,170
What?

232
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,780
(My Friend Jung Won)

233
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,030
There you are.

234
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,730
- How's Kyung Shin? Is he okay?
- What?

235
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,570
Yes, thankfully.

236
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,770
Are you going to stay at the hospital?

237
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,610
No, I have to leave tonight.
Or else my mom will catch me.

238
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,210
- Where to?
- I'm going to Paris.

239
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,710
What about your interview?

240
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,410
Well, you can just go for me.

241
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,190
- What?
- I mean, do you have a better idea?

242
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,500
You didn't even call.

243
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,770
You could've at least texted me, Ha Neul.

244
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,140
I was dragged here straight
from the hotel. Sorry.

245
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,310
Is the one in red
the friend you're living with?

246
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,380
What?

247
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,150
Jung Won, you remember
my mom and my brother, right?

248
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,520
It's nice to meet you.

249
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,220
You look a little familiar.

250
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,060
Are you Young Chae's best friend
from high school?

251
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,290
Can I get you some tea?

252
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,760
You don't have to do that.
Just have a seat.

253
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,460
No, go ahead and bring me a cup.

254
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,700
It's got to be better than whatever
grapefruit tea Han Hye Ra would serve.

255
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,910
Mom, she's Young Chae's friend.

256
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,320
- Why are you making her get you tea?
- It's fine.

257
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,650
Jung Won's good at that stuff.
Cleaning, laundry, you name it.

258
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,950
Perfect.
She saves us from having to hire help.

259
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,790
(Savings Account: Cha Jung Won)

260
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,930
My goodness, our Jung Won
is such a good daughter.

261
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,630
Now, what should I do with all this money?

262
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,680
I'm out of my mind.
Who do I think I am, wanting a house?

263
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,550
I mean, unless we're talking
about a palace.

264
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,420
And who's going to let you live
like a queen in a palace?

265
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,060
Is that how you talk to your bride-to-be?
What will you do if I just run off?

266
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,660
You've got a point.

267
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,470
After all, making a midnight escape
is your specialty.

268
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,970
I was pregnant. What choice did I have?
We had to elope.

269
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,510
If I hadn't,
my mom would've broken both my legs.

270
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,610
Don't take it so seriously.
You're scaring me.

271
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,380
Am I scaring you? Hardly.

272
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,710
The only person
you're scared of is Su A...

273
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,350
I mean, do you have anyone else
besides Jung Won?

274
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,680
Right, our Jung Won.

275
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,450
You're not scared of anyone, are you?

276
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,960
I am. Exactly two people.

277
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,960
- You and our Jung Won.
- Oh, come on.

278
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,230
I'm serious.

279
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,600
Who could stand a chance...

280
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,600
against the father and daughter
who trapped a runaway like me for decades?

281
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,740
You've been through a lot too. I know.

282
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,750
You were born with a restless heart,
like a girl with spring fever year-round.

283
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,080
You should have lived true to your nature.

284
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,920
Why'd you settle down with a guy like me?

285
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,260
Because just looking at you
makes me feel like that girl again.

286
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,690
What can I do
when you still make my heart flutter?

287
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,400
And I'd be a fool not to know it.

288
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,400
Would it have killed you
to say that sooner?

289
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,240
Ten years, twenty years...

290
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,940
No, even if it takes hundreds of years,

291
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,940
I'll make you happier than you'd ever be
living in some palace.

292
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,510
How's that for a big, fat lie?

293
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,980
You just had to ruin it, didn't you?

294
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,620
You're a dry cleaners owner's wife.
So you need to live like one.

295
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,260
And don't do something foolish
like asking Jung Won for money.

296
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,800
When have I ever done that?
I've never done that.

297
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,300
Even if Jung Won...

298
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,570
gives you her last dime
to help pay for our wedding,

299
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,840
you should say no.

300
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,470
- It's like bleeding a stone dry.
- You think I don't know that?

301
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,480
We can't be the kind of parents
who bleed their own child dry.

302
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,420
What are you doing?
Go set the table for dinner.

303
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,790
How dare you treat me like an evil stepmom
who'd cheat her own stepdaughter?

304
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,860
I'm not cooking tonight. I refuse!
It's always about dinner! Am I your chef?

305
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,530
Unbelievable...

306
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,430
They say menopause is scarier...

307
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,640
than puberty.

308
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,970
So, I'm asking,
what did you think of Jin Se Hoon?

309
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,540
- I could tell you'd like him.
- So you thought he was all that?

310
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,280
Is he impressive?

311
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,010
Is that even a question?

312
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,450
Just tell me already! What was he like?

313
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,690
He's a tough guy with a heart of gold.

314
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,760
That has a certain charm.

315
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,260
So, the bottom line is you both approve?

316
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,400
So, did Se Hoon like her too?

317
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,640
He said he was absolutely crazy about her.

318
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,780
Wedding preparations will be fast-tracked.
And they'll set a date before we know it.

319
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,550
Mom, I'm tired. I need to rest.

320
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,050
All right. I'll lay off for tonight.

321
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,290
Come on, Ha Neul. Let's get going.

322
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,460
Let's go!

323
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,100
I'm going to Australia on business.
I'll be back before you know it,

324
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,970
but I need you to help
with Young Chae's wedding preparations.

325
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,510
Young Chae can handle it fine on her own.
And her friend will be there to help.

326
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,710
Is it because you aren't her real brother?

327
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,120
- Mother.
- Who will walk Young Chae...

328
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,920
down the aisle
and give her away to Jin Se Hoon?

329
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,090
That would be you.
She doesn't have a father too.

330
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,320
I'll be more involved.

331
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,590
How's business going with Jin Se Hoon?

332
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,760
We're just getting started.

333
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,600
Just for one month.
One month is all I need.

334
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,200
Buy me some time, Jung Won.

335
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,740
Until I find a place in Paris,

336
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,770
and Park Kyung Shin is back on his feet.

337
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,840
What do you mean?

338
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,480
I need you to do what you do best.

339
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,050
Pretending to be me.

340
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,120
Pretend to be you and meet Jin Se Hoon,

341
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,250
meet with Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra,

342
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,860
- and prepare for the wedding?
- Yes, for now.

343
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,290
Why?

344
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,160
Because my mom has to believe
I'm the one marrying Jin Se Hoon.

345
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,770
What if I end up falling for him?

346
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,100
Go ahead.

347
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,000
That's your talent for sure.

348
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,040
You don't think I can?

349
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,470
What if it goes beyond just dating?

350
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,840
Hey! Jin Se Hoon has standards, you know.

351
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,280
As if he'd end up with someone like you.

352
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,250
Someone like me?

353
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,780
Poor, with only a high school diploma?

354
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,820
The girl who can imitate you,
but never actually be you?

355
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,150
There you go.

356
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,990
Young Chae.

357
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,560
If you're going to ask for a favor,
at least do it with some respect.

358
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,960
I am asking. Please, do this for me.

359
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,700
I told you, it's only for a month!

360
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,400
I'm going to give my mom an ultimatum.
That I'll die without Park Kyung Shin.

361
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,910
I'll take it from there.

362
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,470
Just hold on until then
without my mom finding out.

363
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,180
So my only job is to fool your mom?

364
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,180
- That's all that matters right now.
- And when you come clean? What about me?

365
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,220
When everyone finds out I'm an impostor?

366
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,750
What will that make me?

367
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,060
You?

368
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,990
You couldn't care less
if I get hurt, could you?

369
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,060
Feeling on top of the world one minute
and crashing down the next.

370
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,330
You don't care how that makes me feel,
do you?

371
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,300
Seriously...

372
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,540
Are you going to do it or not?

373
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,870
If I do it,

374
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,580
what's in it for me?

375
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,210
What is it you want?

376
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,650
The new designer position
at Kunhyang Fashion.

377
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,050
I'm going to take my spot back.

378
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,220
But in the process,

379
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,220
what if I actually want to become you?

380
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,190
I'll think about it later.

381
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,660
Name it.

382
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,130
You never know.

383
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,500
I might just give you
whatever you ask for.

384
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,200
For a lying thief like you,
Joo Young Chae,

385
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,140
I don't know if I want to
give my consideration, pity,

386
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,840
or even a conscience.

387
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,410
Right now, I don't even know
what’s going on in my heart.

388
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,410
What if I really...

389
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:01,080
end up wanting to steal your man,
your life, everything?

390
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,550
Then I really might...

391
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,920
just take it all.

392
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,590
What are you talking about?

393
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,860
I just want you to do well.
I don't want anything.

394
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,500
We're friends, after all.

395
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,370
You're right.

396
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,070
We're friends.

397
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,970
I was being too sensitive.

398
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,540
We both were.

399
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,840
(Job Application)

400
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,670
Playing Joo Young Chae for a month.

401
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,240
The risk makes it
all the more thrilling and seductive.

402
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,050
- Joo Young Chae taught me.
- Ms. Joo,

403
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,220
your qualifications are very impressive.
Your design skills are exceptional too.

404
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:11,620
- Have you applied anywhere besides us?
- I have not.

405
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,260
With a resume like this,

406
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,960
you must have had plenty
of opportunities overseas.

407
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,830
So why did you only apply to us?

408
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,230
I was intrigued by the blind screening.

409
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,870
I wanted to be evaluated
solely on my talent.

410
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
But your name is revealed
at the interview stage,

411
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,070
so aren't you just
using your mom's connections anyway?

412
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,340
But when you reviewed my portfolio,
you had no idea who I was.

413
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,380
I guess you have a point.

414
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,580
Anyone who saw that design portfolio...

415
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,820
wouldn't want to let that talent go.

416
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,890
Whether her name
was Joo Young Chae or not.

417
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,650
I agree.

418
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,190
The final results will be announced
this afternoon.

419
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,860
Successful applicants
are notified by text.

420
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,830
We wish you the best of luck.

421
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,670
This position is rightfully mine.

422
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,870
Not as Joo Young Chae,

423
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,910
but as Cha Jung Won.

424
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,850
Ms. Joo, congratulations on being accepted
as a designer at Kunhyang Fashion.

425
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,930
Congratulations.

426
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,530
It seems you wanted to be a designer
more than you wanted to be my wife.

427
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,600
It was always my dream
to have my own brand.

428
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,430
Why the past tense?

429
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,410
My mother was so against it.

430
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,780
So she wasn't against it this time?

431
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:43,510
On the contrary. She was thrilled
since I got in purely on my own merit.

432
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,420
Me too.

433
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,620
Joo Young Chae, daughter of Gong Nan Sook,
is one thing.

434
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,060
But Designer Joo Young Chae,
the future star of our design team...

435
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,560
is far more attractive to me.

436
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
So,

437
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,770
you do know how to smile like that?

438
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,400
I smile a lot, you know.

439
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,910
It's always been a gentle smile.

440
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,550
From now on, I want you
to smile brightly like this.

441
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,610
Like sunshine.

442
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,550
Sunshine?

443
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,720
Wearing this mask of Joo Young Chae,
I'll try my hand at dating Jin Se Hoon.

444
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,730
Why?

445
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,530
Because I want to.

446
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,970
Don't you dare go easy on me.

447
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,400
Okay!

448
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,880
Hi, Ha Neul.

449
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,580
Jin Se Mi.

450
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:56,650
So you do remember my name.
I thought I was just a face in the crowd.

451
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,990
Get your workout in and go.

452
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,190
Aren't you meeting up with Se Hoon?

453
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,420
Se Hoon's here?

454
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,190
He said Joo Young Chae
was coming with him.

455
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,630
Since when is she just "Joo Young Chae"
to you?

456
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,330
She's about to be your sister-in-law.

457
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,130
When my brother isn't around,
I call you Joo Ha Neul, or "giant jerk."

458
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,740
Move.

459
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,770
- What are you doing after your workout?
- Work.

460
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,480
Let's have dinner.

461
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,610
Fine, whatever. Move.

462
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,420
What should we get?

463
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,490
- Hey, over here.
- Hey.

464
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,400
Ha Neul said he could make it.
You two are always so swamped.

465
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,340
It's hard to even get you both for a meal.

466
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,880
I'm just going to wash my hands.

467
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,760
What are you doing here with Se Hoon?

468
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,960
Because for now,
I have to be Jin Se Hoon's fiancee.

469
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
What are you talking about?

470
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,970
- Does Young Chae know about this?
- She does.

471
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,070
In fact, this was Young Chae's idea.

472
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,080
Where is Young Chae right now?

473
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,810
Talk about dramatic siblings.

474
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:34,020
Come on, they're just really close.

475
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,920
I bet Joo Young Chae is
a sweet little sister.

476
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,350
Unlike you.

477
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,390
Keep it up.
I'll take it all out on Joo Young Chae.

478
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,430
Haven't you heard that a sister-in-law
can be worse than a mother-in-law?

479
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,100
So is there anything else you want?

480
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,540
Lobster? Filet mignon?

481
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,370
Gosh, that's even more pathetic.

482
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,040
Just act normal.

483
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Okay.

484
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,680
You're going to be unbearable
once you're married.

485
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,220
You should drop that
"single by choice" thing too.

486
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,290
This whole
dating-with-marriage-in-mind thing...

487
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,020
It's surprisingly thrilling.

488
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,060
You've fallen for her already?

489
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,560
What kind of guy falls that easily?

490
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,730
Look at you. You're so smitten.

491
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,600
Well,

492
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,610
Joo Young Chae said she likes
my side profile.

493
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,050
So you mean until Young Chae gets back
in a month to sort this out herself,

494
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,680
you've agreed to pretend to be her?

495
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,590
- Yes.
- Jung Won, you know this is wrong.

496
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,490
I thought you were a good person,
Jung Won.

497
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,860
Stop hiding behind Young Chae's request
and ask yourself...

498
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,430
what you're really doing.

499
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,370
Why do I always have to be the good one?

500
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,870
Why do you assume I'm the only one
who wants what she has and takes it?

501
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,940
Young Chae has stolen from me too.

502
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,110
She took the most precious thing I had.
Not once, but twice.

503
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,680
No, three times.

504
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,420
(Jin Se Hoon)

505
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,530
I don't care.

506
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,260
This is how I'm going to live now.

507
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,230
Even if it's just a fantasy
that ends in a month,

508
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,270
compared to living as Cha Jung Won,

509
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,140
with no hope or future,

510
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,840
this is better.

511
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,190
(A Graceful Liar)

512
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,610
Looks like Joo Young Chae
has completely stolen your heart.

513
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,450
That is a bit much,
but she's fun to be with.

514
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,150
He's not seeing Joo Young Chae.
He's seeing me, Cha Jung Won.

515
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,160
When this little game of pretend is over,
the world will be cruel to you again.

516
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,860
For the first time in my life,
I feel alive.

517
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,900
You've gotten awfully brave
for someone freeloading here.

518
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,000
How dare you pretend to be Young Chae?
I ought to grind you into dust.

519
