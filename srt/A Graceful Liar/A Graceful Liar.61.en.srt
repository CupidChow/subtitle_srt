1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,310
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,780
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,210
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,520
What are you doing in here?

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,180
What is it?

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,090
- Is it dirt on Chairman Gong?
- Stay out of this.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,990
No way. Let me see.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,130
You never know.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,530
- I might be able to help.
- Help how?

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,330
My goal is to stop
being Chairman Gong's puppet.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,930
And that's why I need Jin Se Hoon.

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,800
I'm dying for a chance to stab
Chairman Gong Nan Sook in the back.

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,370
Why should I trust you?
You're too greedy and impulsive.

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,940
Come on,
let's just see what's on here.

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,180
Ha Neul.

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,690
- You'll get hurt. Be careful.
- Mom.

17
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,990
Come here.

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,260
My sweet boy.

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,530
My little boy fell right asleep.

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,030
Stay healthy for a long time,
my Ha Neul.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,270
So Chairman Gong
had this side to her?

22
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,510
She never showed me
that side of her.

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,620
So this really is yours.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,550
Oh, my!

25
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,460
- What are you doing? Give it back.
- Oh, my!

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,490
Give it back, Manager Gu!

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,160
- Manager Gu.
- What do you think you're doing?

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,230
What do you think you're doing?

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,810
- Oh, my!
- Spit it out! Now!

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,650
I was told to make sure
no thieves could take anything.

31
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,350
Chairman Gong ordered me
to guard this place like a watchdog.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,390
So we're thieves now?

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,920
Then why were you ransacking
the chairman's room?

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,520
Manager Gu.

35
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,000
So, why did you invite me here
when you don't even like me?

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,430
No, scratch that. Let's be honest.

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,070
You can't stand the sight of me.
So why did you ask me to dinner?

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,440
That was a wonderfully quiet
and delicious dinner.

39
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,680
I enjoyed it.

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,580
Of course. It's my favorite place.
If they served bad food,

41
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,350
do you think I would let that slide?

42
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,920
Do you really enjoy people
being afraid of you wherever you go?

43
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,790
And do you enjoy everyone gushing,
"Vice Chairman Han, you're lovely?"

44
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,620
Is putting on that pretty little act
all the time so great?

45
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,390
It's not about liking it or not.
It's second nature.

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,000
Goodness.

47
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,060
So you're saying
you're a natural-born liar.

48
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,740
From someone who changes their story
12 times a day,

49
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,100
you've got some nerve.

50
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,740
Whatever. Get to the point.
Why did you ask me here?

51
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,040
It was nothing.
I just wanted to have dinner.

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,050
Who do you take me for?
A complete idiot?

53
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,280
I'm Gong Nan Sook.
I can smell a lie from a mile away.

54
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,880
What? Did you lure me out here
to send someone to my house...

55
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,350
to steal the Cha Ki Beom video?

56
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,030
So the video
isn't at your house, is it?

57
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,230
You think I'd hide it that easy,
so anyone could steal it?

58
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,300
You're dealing with Gong Nan Sook.

59
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,160
I wasn't sure, though.

60
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,240
You won't give me the video,
will you?

61
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,970
- Not right now.
- What?

62
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,780
You won't give it to me
even after Young Chae has the baby?

63
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,110
- We'll see when the time comes.
- Gong Nan Sook, why would you...

64
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,480
Who knows what the future holds?
If my son, Joo Ha Neul,

65
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,350
and one of your daughters,
Cha Jung Won or Jin Se Mi,

66
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,850
was to start discussing marriage,

67
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,920
that might change things.

68
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,160
Are you upping the ante again?

69
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,960
Are you scheming to use me again?

70
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,930
There's an old woman who adores me.
She once told me...

71
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,570
that you're an even scarier witch
than I am.

72
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,570
What?

73
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,670
Why don't you go ahead
and prove it to me?

74
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,210
Then I'll get right down
on my knees...

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,580
and say, "Here you are.
Please take it."

76
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,810
I just might.

77
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,220
But do you really think
it'll be that easy?

78
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,190
I'm Gong Nan Sook.

79
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,590
Some people even call me
Queen Nan Sook.

80
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,530
- Beating me won't be easy.
- So you want to beat me?

81
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,300
Is that your goal, Gong Nan Sook?

82
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,660
I don't know.

83
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,770
The thought of you
on your knees before me...

84
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,570
and answering me so meekly...

85
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,140
is just so sweet and satisfying.

86
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,570
In your dreams!

87
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,880
Really? All right, then.

88
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,450
Fine. Then let's become
in-laws twice over.

89
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,110
I like it. Let's do it.

90
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,420
Thank you for the meal,
lovely Ms. Han.

91
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,990
See you later.

92
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,830
I guess I'll just have
to show you...

93
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,500
how much more frightening I can be.

94
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,970
Ha Neul brought Manager Hwang
from Kunhyang...

95
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,570
and turned the house upside down?

96
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,940
- Young Chae, you helped them?
- I've always been very curious,

97
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,210
so I wanted to see
what Ha Neul was looking for.

98
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,580
So, did they find anything?

99
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,890
Why are you looking at Manager Gu?

100
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,960
Don't tell me you stopped them.

101
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,960
I ate the USB.

102
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,630
What? You ate what?
You ate the USB? Which one?

103
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,670
- I don't know.
- You just ate it without knowing?

104
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,970
It was nothing special.
I saw what was on it.

105
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,940
- Saw what?
- A home video of Ha Neul as a baby.

106
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,910
I see. A video like that
was still around?

107
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,280
You really doted on him.

108
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,880
That's a look
I've never seen you give me.

109
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,120
That wasn't about me.

110
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,220
He was just at the age
where everything is cute.

111
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,320
He was cute when he was mad
or even when he glared.

112
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,390
He was even cute when he had a fit.

113
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,460
That's the age when he heard
he was cute until he got sick of it.

114
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,560
But he's not even
your biological son.

115
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,430
Why did you look at him like he was
the center of your universe?

116
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,100
I don't get it. It's so frustrating.

117
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,670
Just get out of my way!

118
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,080
Why are you pining for someone
so far out of your reach?

119
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,250
I wasn't pining.

120
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,820
You need to go, now.

121
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,630
- Sorry?
- The USB.

122
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,360
You have to release it, don't you?

123
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,630
That's the original.

124
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,130
I don't feel the urge yet.

125
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,900
If I don't get that back
in my hands soon...

126
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,000
- You'll bury me at sea?
- Use your head. You think I would?

127
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,510
It'd be a burial in poop, you jerk.

128
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,980
- Understood.
- Go, now!

129
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,980
Yes, ma'am.

130
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,950
Stay healthy for a long time,
my Ha Neul.

131
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,420
How could...

132
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,290
the woman who said that
turn into such a monster?

133
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,490
Are you talking about
Chairman Gong Nan Sook?

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
Please have a seat.

135
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,610
Well, I couldn't find the video.

136
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,280
If it's not at her house,
could it be at the office?

137
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,580
She has so many secrets,

138
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,550
so she needs a place
to hide things like that.

139
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,320
Forcing it out of her
will be difficult.

140
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,420
It'd be best
if she gave it up willingly,

141
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,550
but that won't be easy.

142
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,590
She'll demand something more valuable
in return for the video.

143
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,890
She tried to make a deal.

144
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,960
She wants to arrange a marriage
between one of my daughters...

145
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,630
and you, CEO Joo.

146
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,870
There she goes again.

147
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,310
Forcing Young Chae and Se Hoon
was already a huge overstep.

148
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,940
And Se Mi...

149
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,440
has deep feelings for you.

150
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,980
I never imagined that
you and both my daughters...

151
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,520
would become so deeply intertwined.

152
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,350
It hurts me just to think
about Jung Won,

153
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,260
so I could only ask
for you to be by her side for me.

154
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,330
You don't have to worry about Se Mi.

155
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
I'll handle it.

156
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,070
I'm counting on you.

157
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,070
Please make sure
Se Mi doesn't get hurt.

158
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
I will.

159
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,010
Actually, today...

160
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,610
is the day I'm getting
an answer from Jung Won.

161
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,910
You told her how you feel?

162
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,750
Yes.

163
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,820
Joo Ha Neul only has eyes
for Jung Won.

164
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,060
What's going to happen to Se Mi?

165
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
You're here early.

166
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,410
Yes.

167
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,060
Why does it have to be me?

168
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,830
Well...

169
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,500
They say love...

170
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,070
isn't about looking at each other...

171
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,940
but about looking
in the same direction together.

172
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,110
Just like us.

173
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,250
I love you...

174
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,390
because I can't help but love you.

175
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,250
There's no other reason.

176
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,730
Loving someone...

177
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,730
feels like the hardest challenge
there is.

178
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,900
I'm not ready to love you yet.

179
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,170
I am. I have been for a long time.

180
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,910
I can't love you.

181
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,220
That's the only way
I can protect you.

182
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,420
Maybe you can handle love
and revenge at the same time,

183
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,390
but I can't.

184
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,160
My heart is already filled
with so much hatred and rage...

185
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,660
for Han Hye Ra, Gong Nan Sook,
and Jin Tae Seok.

186
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,770
- Let me share that hate and anger.
- That's not something I can share.

187
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,810
When you're exhausted
and struggling,

188
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,880
I want to be the one to comfort you.

189
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,180
I want to take on your pain
as my own.

190
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,550
Even your revenge.

191
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,890
- I want to get it for you.
- My revenge?

192
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,790
Why would you get it for me?

193
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,760
Because I love you.

194
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,700
In this life, you and I...

195
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,340
are friends and allies
on the same path.

196
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,440
It can't be anything more than that.

197
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,310
Do you take me for a fool?

198
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,350
What we shared when I was so down,

199
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,420
that was all real.

200
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,430
You love me too, Jung Won.
Don't deny it.

201
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
You know me.

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,870
Something like that
means nothing to me.

203
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,370
I was just using you...

204
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,040
for the feelings you had for me.

205
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,290
Look me in the eyes!

206
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,460
Why are you pushing me away?

207
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,060
Why do you insist on standing alone
in a cold, desolate field?

208
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,870
Because it's easier that way.

209
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,840
- Because it's safer.
- Is my love...

210
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,340
what's making you uncomfortable?

211
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,940
Does it put you in more danger?

212
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,640
You deserve someone much better,

213
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,780
someone kind,
incredibly considerate,

214
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,680
and worthy of being loved...

215
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,760
That's a lie.

216
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,890
You want me too.

217
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,730
I can feel your heart racing.

218
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,140
I see sadness and love in your eyes.
So why are you denying it?

219
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,940
There's a reason.

220
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,910
There's just no reason...

221
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,050
why it has to be you.

222
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,040
Joo Ha Neul isn't even
Gong Nan Sook's biological son.

223
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,480
If I set my mind to it,
I can hurt him anytime, right?

224
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,180
This is for the best.

225
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,780
I can't drag Ha Neul down with me.

226
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,550
I won't be the one
to push him off a cliff.

227
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,060
Slow down. You'll get indigestion.

228
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,760
Here, try some of this meat too.

229
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,530
I'm working on a new dish,
and it's to die for.

230
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,340
It's so good that if two eat
and one dies,

231
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,440
the other won't even notice.

232
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,140
I'm trying to eat.

233
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,010
You're being so loud.

234
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,040
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

235
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,520
You're right.
I wouldn't notice if you died now.

236
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,850
My goodness. My sweet girl.

237
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,260
I guess CEO Joo's love isn't enough.

238
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,720
What should I do for you?

239
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,630
What? Hye Ra had Ha Neul...

240
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,630
search your house?
Why would she do that?

241
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,770
I imagine she was looking for proof
that you killed Cha Ki Beom.

242
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,010
The video?

243
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,910
How would Hye Ra know about that?

244
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,240
Beats me.

245
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,540
One of your closest cronies
must have snitched.

246
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,320
None of my people would do that.
Who would dare to backstab me?

247
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,050
I'd tear them limb from limb
if they did.

248
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,320
- What if Han Hye Ra betrayed you?
- There you go again, playing games.

249
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,130
Hye Ra? Betray me?

250
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,060
Even if the world split in two...

251
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,500
No, if it shattered into 100 pieces,
Hye Ra would never betray me.

252
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
She couldn't.

253
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,870
You're never going to take off
those rose-colored glasses, are you?

254
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,640
He'll have to be burned
by Han Hye Ra,

255
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,010
the woman he's madly in love with,
before he wakes up.

256
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,180
Name your price.

257
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,650
- For what?
- Cha Ki Beom's video. How much?

258
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,420
You think money can bribe me
when I run a financial firm?

259
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,460
Do you think I'm short on money...

260
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,160
that I'd do business with you?

261
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,360
What's with the act?
Money is all that matters to you,

262
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,700
Miss Money-minded.

263
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,170
You want it in stocks instead?

264
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,100
I have something else in mind.

265
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,910
- Like what?
- I'll give you my son, Ha Neul,

266
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,010
as a son-in-law,

267
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,180
and you give me a daughter of yours
to be my daughter-in-law.

268
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,180
What?
You want to be in-laws twice over?

269
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,470
In this life, you and I...

270
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,100
are friends and allies
on the same path.

271
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,340
It can't be anything more than that.

272
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,880
You confessed and got rejected,
didn't you?

273
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,550
I guess it's true then.
I was just throwing it out there.

274
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,260
Young Chae, what about you?

275
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,260
Are you happy as a daughter-in-law
of the Kunhyang family?

276
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,230
I am. Extremely.

277
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,900
Even if Se Hoon doesn't love you?

278
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,700
I told you I'm happy.

279
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,930
He treats me well, you know.

280
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,340
Why do you ask?
You don't believe me?

281
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,240
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,310
I should've cared for you better
as a brother.

283
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,550
You got rejected, and suddenly,
you feel sorry for me?

284
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,220
Are you worried
about your only little sister...

285
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,820
when we're not even blood-related?

286
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,390
I've never once thought of us
as not being blood-related.

287
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,360
Just act like you always do.

288
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,930
Right. Typical sibling stuff.

289
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,230
Hey, you little brat,

290
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,630
are you pleased that I got rejected?

291
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,870
No...

292
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,870
But why Cha Jung Won, of all people?
Jin Se Mi is so much better.

293
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,540
I wish it were that simple.

294
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,410
If I could just weigh pros and cons
and pick the better person.

295
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,350
Just bite the bullet, like I did.

296
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,750
Jin Se Hoon...

297
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,590
That's not why you chose him.

298
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,960
- What?
- Young Chae, examine your heart.

299
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,030
If you didn't really like Se Hoon,

300
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,630
or if you didn't think
you could ever love him,

301
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,530
you wouldn't be acting this way.

302
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,340
Don't act like you know everything.

303
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,470
Stop pretending you care about me.

304
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,810
Go drown your heartbreak in alcohol
all you want.

305
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,920
Is CEO Joo really going to end up
with Cha Jung Won?

306
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,190
Grandma has said...

307
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,130
that their bond is not one
you can tear asunder.

308
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,800
Chef Hong is off his game.

309
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,140
Why? Do you know something?

310
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,340
Ha Neul confessed his feelings
to Jung Won,

311
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,980
- and he got rejected.
- What?

312
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,510
Seriously? Who is this Cha Jung Won,
turning down our CEO Joo?

313
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,780
This is just so ridiculous.
I don't know what to think.

314
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,390
She should be thankful
when she lived with Jin Se Hoon.

315
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Anyway,

316
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,260
has Grandma really lost her touch?
How old was she again?

317
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,130
Was she two hundred? Three hundred?

318
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,370
You startled me.

319
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,170
Young Chae almost miscarried a baby
that doesn’t even exist!

320
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Mom!

321
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,940
You're so irritating.

322
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
I'm out of here.

323
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,540
Fine. Just go on...

324
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,980
and live as a member
of the Kunhyang family forever.

325
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,050
What's wrong? Is Grandma sulking?

326
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,250
Right now, I'm just Chef Hong.
And I'm the one who's sulking.

327
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,060
Oh, my.

328
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,130
Hey, at least finish the story
before you go.

329
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,630
So things between Cha Jung Won
and CEO Joo fell through?

330
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,900
So what should I do?
Should I support Jin Se Mi?

331
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,800
I don't know.
Why is this so complicated?

332
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,710
Darn, my head is killing me.

333
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,110
Really? So Ha Neul
isn't dating Cha Jung Won?

334
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,420
I told you,
it was Ha Neul who got rejected.

335
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,650
- Who's Jung Won to reject Ha Neul?
- Se Mi?

336
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,020
This is where
you're supposed to be happy.

337
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,230
Young Chae, please help me
get with Ha Neul.

338
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:28,330
Don't you worry.
I'm on your side, Se Mi.

339
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,540
What's with the chitchat so late?
You have work tomorrow.

340
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,890
A special treat, just for Dad.

341
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,190
That's my girl!

342
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,130
- Smells nice.
- Dad.

343
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,470
Thanks.

344
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,240

more than anything.

am going to do whatever it takes
to be with Ha Neul.

who come on too strong.

354
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,230
Did I come on too strong
with Ha Neul?

Just dial it back a bit.

356
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,970

Timing?

359
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,250
Did you do something...

360
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,590
so that CEO Joo and Jung Won
wouldn’t end up together?

361
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,750
No.

362
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,120
It's cute that Se Mi
would even think that.

363
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,560
This isn't something
to be dismissed as "cute."

364
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,160
You've made her believe that
whenever there's a problem,

365
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,730
she can just run to Daddy
and he'll fix everything.

366

for their daughters.

you were rooting for CEO Joo Ha Neul
and Cha Jung Won...

to get together, were you?

370

You still don't get it, do you?

371
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,450
You can use money and power
to take whatever you want,

372
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,590
but you can't own a person's heart.

373
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,990
I know.
Just like you chose my heart...

374
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,360
over my power and my money.

375
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,570
- Rest up. I'll check on Se Mi.
- Just leave her be.

we're talking about.

Up until two years ago,
it was definitely blind hiring.

It's completely different.

no first-round design evaluation.

00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,980
Did you put on a suicide vest
to take down Kunhyang with you?

516
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,150
You'll be consumed by pain and fear
more terrifying than the fiery pit.

517
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,450
You want to oust Vice Chairman
and put Se Hoon in her place?

518
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,020
I'm saying that for Han Hye Ra,
the woman you're so crazy about,

519
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,520
a nuke has just dropped in the form
of her daughter, Cha Jung Won.

520
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,060
You should know someone...

521
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,530
with nothing to lose
is the most dangerous.
