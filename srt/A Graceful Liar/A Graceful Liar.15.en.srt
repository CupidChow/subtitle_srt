(in this drama are fictional.)

00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,210
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,450
What's going on here?

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,080
And where's the bed?

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,950
Mr. Park Kyung Shin,
it's time for your sedative...

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,290
- Where did the patient go?
- That's what I want to ask.

8
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,390
Where did Park Kyung Shin go?

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,700
One moment.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,770
Hello?

11
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,400
Is the CT scan for
VIP patient Park Kyung Shin tomorrow?

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,970
The patient is missing.

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,370
No, he can't move on his own.

14
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,040
He disappeared
along with the gurney.

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,510
(Blocked Number)

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,490
- Park Kyung Shin?
- Why are you desperate to find him?

17
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,190
It looks like you really miss
Park Kyung Shin.

18
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,610
Is that you, Joo Young Chae?

19
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,410
Have you forgotten my voice already?

20
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,420
- I'm hurt.
- Where are you?

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,580
If I tell you,

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,520
will you come running
and give me a hug?

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,550
Let's meet and talk.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
(Recording)

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,190
Of course, we should meet.

26
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,630
You're imitating me so well
that I have to praise you for it.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,640
From a dirt-poor family,
a high-school-educated part-timer,

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,310
the daughter of a murderer
has really made it big.

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,410
Who should be the one
walking down the aisle?

30
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,980
Jin Se Hoon is totally my type.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,920
I'll put an end to your game
of pretend soon.

32
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,650
- Wait.
- Don't hang up.

33
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,630
Who was that?

34
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,630
Young Chae.

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,840
(Episode 15)

36
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,980
What did they say
to shock you so much?

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,480
It wasn't a call
from Park Kyung Shin.

38
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,190
Even though I thought it couldn't be
Park Kyung Shin,

39
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,290
my gut kept telling me...

40
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,130
The reason I took you...

41
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,530
to the hospital
without telling you first...

42
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,660
I know. You don't have to tell me.

43
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,100
Park Kyung Shin.

44
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,970
We have to find him quickly.

45
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,640
If we ask Kunhyang's Owner Risk Team
to find him, they'll...

46
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,640
I'll find him... No,

47
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,880
let my family take care of it.

48
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,580
Please.

49
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,790
You won't tell the chairman
and the vice chairman, right?

50
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,160
Is that possible?

51
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,130
You know how good
Kunhyang's intel is.

52
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,640
Just don't say anything first,
Se Hoon.

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,370
If a problem arises,
then I'll tell the vice chairman,

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,040
no, your mother.
I'll ask her for help myself.

55
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
All right.

56
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,660
Park Kyung Shin could have escaped.

57
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,060
Not alone, but with someone's help.

58
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,930
I checked
the hospital's CCTV footage,

59
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,460
and the footage from the time
he disappeared was erased.

60
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,070
So it was planned?
Either a kidnapping or he staged it?

61
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,840
Could it be...

62
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,340
What? Spit it out.

63
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,770
Do you think Young Chae took him?

64
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,350
Young Chae isn't back in Korea yet.

65
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,110
How do you know?

66
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,820
She called for money a few days ago.

67
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,790
I looked into it,
and she was in Milan.

68
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,020
Then why did she call me?

69
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,390
Young Chae called you?
What did she say?

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,490
She made it sound like
she was with Park Kyung Shin.

71
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,230
What else? What else did she say?

72
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,330
She said she'd put an end
to my game of pretend soon.

73
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,870
Young Chae, that crazy girl.

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,510
Our family's entire fate
rests on this marriage.

75
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,740
- I'll check the list of arrivals.
- No, don't.

76
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,410
Young Chae is my daughter.
She wouldn't leave a trace.

77
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,250
Unless...

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,590
she came
on an acquaintance's private jet.

79
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,260
Manager Gu.

80
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,930
Check to see if any private jets
at Incheon and Gimpo...

81
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,860
came in from Paris or Milan.

82
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,860
Investigate all of them...

83
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,630
from a week ago until today.

84
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,640
If Young Chae is back,

85
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,800
she'd have looked
for Park Kyung Shin first, right?

86
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,110
She must have come
to the fashion show.

87
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,440
Hey, go with her.

88
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,210
Text me as soon as you check
the private planes' arrival status.

89
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Okay.

90
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,420
The old woman speaks.

91
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,560
Yes, Grandma.

92
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,560
Abandon...

93
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,030
your real daughter.

94
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,900
Only then will the Gongs thrive
for generations.

95
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,670
What is this nonsense?

96
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,970
Chef Hong. Have you lost your touch?

97
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,180
I was only relaying
what the old woman said.

98
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,750
The interpretation is up to you,
Chairman.

99
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,820
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

100
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,250
Telling me to abandon my Young Chae.

101
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,090
I thought it was a load of nonsense.

102
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,460
Hey. Did you find anything?

103
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,530
Yes. A private plane from Milan
arrived at Incheon three days ago.

104
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,370
Was Young Chae on it or not?

105
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Wait.

106
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,690
Zoom in on this woman
in the sunglasses.

107
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,130
- It's Young Chae.
- It's Young Chae.

108
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,670
Young Chae is back.

109
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,640
It must be time for me...

110
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,610
to go back to being Cha Jung Won.

111
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,020
What do you want to do?

112
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,520
If I want something,

113
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,590
will it happen the way I want?

114
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,230
No one gets everything
they want in life.

115
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,830
First, I need to find out
if Young Chae has Park Kyung Shin.

116
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,200
I'll worry about the rest
after that.

117
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,010
My mother has probably
sent her people to look for him.

118
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,250
(Joo Young Chae 1)

119
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
What is it?

120
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,190
It's a recording
of Young Chae's call.

121
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,720
I'd like you to run a voice analysis
to see if it's really Young Chae.

122
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,790
We've confirmed Young Chae's return
on the CCTV.

123
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,860
And you still think the caller
might not be Young Chae?

124
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,470
There's one thing that bothers me.

125
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,670
She was overly hostile towards me,

126
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,270
even though I'm only posing as her
at her request.

127
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,310
If it were Young Chae,

128
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,080
she wouldn't have said that.

129
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,380
Lately, AI voice manipulation crimes
have been on the rise.

130
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,850
We should check it out.

131
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,020
(Kunhyang Group)

132
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,800
Who could have taken
Park Kyung Shin?

133
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,240
My dear son,
what are you thinking of so deeply?

134
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,580
Would you like some tea?

135
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,310
No.

136
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,320
I hear Park Kyung Shin...

137
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,820
has disappeared.

138
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,090
How did you know?

139
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,220
Because I've been keeping an eye
on Park Kyung Shin.

140
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,630
Young Chae's family said
they would handle it,

141
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,500
but I can't just pretend
I don't know...

142
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,630
Of course not.

143
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,640
A model who was on our stage
has gone missing.

144
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,170
If the police are not an option,

145
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,970
we should at least use
our Owner Risk Team to find him.

146
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,180
It could make things worse.

147
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,080
And Young Chae asked me not to.

148
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,050
To give her time?

149
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Yes.

150
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,620
If Park Kyung Shin staged this...

151
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,890
to provoke Joo Young Chae...

152
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,900
Then he would've needed
an accomplice, right?

153
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,600
If there's a woman
who still loves Park Kyung Shin,

154
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,400
she could probably kidnap him.

155
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,340
Whether it was staged
or a kidnapping,

156
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,710
who's the prime suspect?

157
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,410
The one you met
in the hospital room.

158
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,480
Her name was Cha...

159
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,510
I'm Cha Jung Won.

160
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,220
Cha Jung Won.

161
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,690
Cha Jung Won.

162
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,600
Do you know someone
named Cha Jung Won?

163
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,680
- Who?
- Cha Jung Won.

164
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,480
I heard she was Park Kyung Shin's
ex-girlfriend.

165
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,350
You'll get hurt. Leave it.

166
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,690
You really don't listen.

167
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,900
- Let me see.
- I said I was fine.

168
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,900
Cha Jung Won.

169
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,370
Are you that surprised just
by hearing her name?

170
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,710
What happened between you two?

171
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,610
Did she...

172
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,410
bully you?

173
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,710
How did you know...

174
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,180
about Cha Jung Won?

175
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,620
It wasn't me.
It was Vice Chairman Han.

176
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,260
No, my mother had an encounter.

177
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,560
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
had an encounter?

178
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,430
With whom?

179
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,960
She went to visit Park Kyung Shin,
and she was there.

180
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,370
This won't do.

181
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,880
I thought you were tough,
but you hurt your finger and knee.

182
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,020
What did your mother...

183
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,290
talk to Cha Jung Won about?

184
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,720
Why are you looking at me that way?

185
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,490
I'm wondering if I should marry you.

186
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,230
- Are you wavering?
- That's what I want to ask you.

187
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,830
Me? Am I wavering?

188
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,540
Get a grip, Cha Jung Won.

189
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,810
Don't fall for Young Chae's tricks.

190
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,470
Why can't you answer right away?

191
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
You're being a baby.

192
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,350
Acting all cute again.

193
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,120
Answer me.

194
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,220
I already did.
You heard me, Se Hoon.

195
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,720
I love you.

196
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,300
I have to find out
what Young Chae is plotting.

197
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,540
Why is Jung Won not answering?

198
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,680
I must have called her
a hundred times.

199
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,350
Go find her.

200
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,320
Where? The department store?
Jung Won quit that job.

201
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,720
No, her rich friend's house.
She's been living there.

202
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,420
Then you go, Ki Beom.

203
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,730
What if he sees Jung Won
all cuddled up with Jin Se Hoon?

204
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,500
My dream of becoming an in-law
to a rich family will be over.

205
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,030
Nevermind. I'll go.

206
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,170
I'm going to wash up,
so set the table for me.

207
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,410
Food.
That's all you ever talk about.

208
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,680
Pick up, will you!

209
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,490
I don't need a drinking buddy.

210
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
Me neither.

211
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,330
Just pretend you're drinking alone
because I will be.

212
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,380
What are you going to do
about Young Chae?

213
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,710
First, I have to catch her.
I'll decide after I catch her.

214
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,120
- Aren't you worried?
- Worried?

215
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,520
Why worry about a grown woman?
She should be worrying about me.

216
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,930
You're worried about Young Chae,
aren't you?

217
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,660
Yes, very much.

218
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,540
Young Chae is my daughter.

219
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,100
She never lacked money or backing.

220
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,240
Whatever she wanted to do or have,

221
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,010
I let her have everything
she wanted.

222
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,910
So much that it was overflowing.

223
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,650
- Until she was sick of it.
- That was the problem.

224
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,950
That she never lacked anything.

225
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,590
Except for one thing.

226
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,090
And what's that?

227
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,330
You, Mother.

228
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,730
You were so busy.

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,100
I'm not your real son,
but I needed love.

230
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,000
Imagine how Young Chae
must have felt.

231
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,640
Who do you think I was busy for?
It was all to give her a good life.

232
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,770
And not because you wanted
a good life for yourself?

233
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,840
Listen here.

234
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,810
Me living a good life meant
that Young Chae also...

235
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,110
She must have been lonely.

236
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,920
Even more than me.

237
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
Young Chae...

238
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,730
was lonely?

239
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,930
That's just spoiled nonsense.

240
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,870
When did she have time to be lonely?

241
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,110
To survive this world, a fiery pit
hotter than the abyss,

242
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,480
you have to keep your eyes wide open
and fight tooth and nail for a shot.

243
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,190
- I still have a meeting.
- You have a visitor.

244
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,970
You haven't had lunch yet, have you?

245
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,000
Surprise!

246
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,080
Honey cookies, too?

247
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,620
It's nutty.

248
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,390
You're a good cook.

249
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Are you with me?

250
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,090
What are you curious about,
my dear daughter-in-law?

251
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,770
I heard you met...

252
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,140
Cha Jung Won.

253
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,470
I did.
Is she someone you know, my dear?

254
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,580
Yes.

255
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,380
What kind of person is she?

256
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,080
Cha Jung Won?

257
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:22,290
What kind of person am I?

258
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,420
She graduated from
the fashion department...

259
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,590
She dropped out
in her sophomore year...

260
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,360
Her family seemed to be
quite well-off.

261
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,860
My family is dirt poor.

262
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,900
Her design skills were excellent.

263
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,700
As for my design skills,

264
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,140
I'm confident I have talent.

265
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,110
Goodness.

266
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,720
Did I ask something
I shouldn't have?

267
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,320
Not at all.

268
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,290
It's understandable
why Park Kyung Shin liked her.

269
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,420
If they're together,

270
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,590
it would not be kidnapping.
They would've run away for love.

271
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,900
- So...
- I shouldn't worry?

272
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Yes.

273
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,090
(Kunhyang Group)

274
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,560
Cha Jung Won...

275
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,900
That name sounds so familiar.

276
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,000
Did you call for me?

277
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,370
There is a woman named Cha Jung Won.

278
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,710
I've jotted down a simple profile.

279
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,370
Look her up.

280
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,640
Not Park Kyung Shin...

281
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,610
If we find Cha Jung Won,
we'll find Park Kyung Shin too.

282
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,650
Understood.

283
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,720
Why did my daughter-in-law
look so sad?

284
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,930
Why...

285
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,860
did she look hurt?

286
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,060
Is she still...

287
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,700
in love with Park Kyung Shin?

288
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,970
That would be very troublesome.

289
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,510
So a model named Park Kyung Shin...

290
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,380
was dating
our future daughter-in-law,

291
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,380
and now he's missing?

292
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,520
That's right, Chairman.

293
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,990
I thought she seemed
modest and pure,

294
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,720
for Gong Nan Sook's daughter.

295
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,990
Vice Chairman Han
must be very disappointed.

296
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,860
She'll likely use
Secretary Yoon's help...

297
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,630
to find Park Kyung Shin.

298
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,430
I'll find him first.

299
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,600
Leave it.

300
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,200
Just watch and see
what Vice Chairman Han does.

301
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,910
So I should just stay out of it
and not help at all?

302
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,480
Don't even let her know
you're watching.

303
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,810
I'll keep that in mind.

304
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,290
Honey, shall we go home together?

305
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,490
I'll be down in a flash.

306
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,580
You weren't answering,
so I was about to come find you.

307
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,750
I came because I saw your text.

308
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,660
I made this for you, Dad.

309
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,490
You like honey cookies.

310
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,590
It's too dry. I don't like it.

311
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,460
Honey cookies are perfect
with cinnamon punch.

312
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,900
Give it to me. I'll eat it.

313
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,510
So delicious.

314
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,240
It's to die for.

315
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,920
Is the article true or a lie?
Just tell me that.

316
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,190
It's fake news.

317
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,920
That's what Manager Kim said.

318
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,190
The guy's family is so powerful...

319
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,560
that tabloids
often write about them.

320
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,660
Right?

321
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,060
That's right.

322
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,760
How much of it is fake?

323
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,970
Your face is plastered all over it.

324
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,230
What about your name? Ms. Joo?

325
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,300
Your mom is Chairman Gong?

326
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,010
A daughter from another family is...

327
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,410
in marriage talks
with Jin Se Hoon's family.

328
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,410
I think the article
mistook me for her.

329
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,020
So you have nothing to do
with the guy in the article?

330
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,320
No.

331
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,950
No? Then why did you let
your picture be taken like that?

332
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
We met by chance
at a cooking class...

333
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,460
and went
to the parking lot together.

334
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,100
The reporter took it
from a weird angle.

335
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,730
What about Mr. Hiccups?
Does he know?

336
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,440
The girl he's supposed to marry
became the subject of this gossip.

337
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,370
How upset must he be?

338
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,950
Tell Mr. Hiccups to come over.

339
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,180
Tell him I want to have
a drink with him.

340
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,450
He was just here.
Why ask him to come again?

341
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,250
Just call him if I tell you to.

342
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,660
(Jin Se Hoon)

343
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,630
I'll be right there.

344
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,400
I have to go to work.

345
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,300
What part-time job are you
doing these days?

346
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,170
It must cost a lot of money
to dress up like that.

347
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,940
I make a lot.

348
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,070
I got a job as a designer.

349
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,320
I'm scared to death.

350
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,190
How could you lie so smoothly?

351
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,190
I saw you in a new light.

352
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,890
I did it so Dad doesn't worry.

353
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,700
What about Mr. Hiccups?

354
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,130
I'll take care of it.

355
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,970
- Just pretend you don't know.
- Until when do I have to pretend?

356
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,700
Soon...

357
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,500
I'll reveal it.

358
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,840
I'm happy.

359
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,110
But on the other hand,

360
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,510
I'm upset.

361
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,420
Is it because...

362
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,490
you're ashamed of
your father and me?

363
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,090
Because we're uneducated and lowly.

364
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,730
And your father even has
a criminal record.

365
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,430
Are they a family we can even
dare to look at?

366
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,530
If I were you, I'd hide it too.
A hundred times over.

367
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,810
No. I'm not ashamed.

368
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,340
It's just not the right time yet.

369
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,650
Please be patient
for a little longer.

370
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,750
Okay.

371
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,950
If you say so, then it must be true.

372
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,120
Keep it a secret...

373
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,550
from Dad that Jin Se Hoon
is the one I'm marrying.

374
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,160
Please, Mom.

375
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,190
Okay, I understand.

376
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,030
Don't worry.

377
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,330
I'm counting on you, Mom.

378
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,580
What's the point of just keeping
Ki Beom quiet?

379
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,680
I have to defuse
this time bomb beforehand.

380
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,890
It was a good thing I got his number
the second time he came.

381
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,120
(Mr. Hiccups)

382
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,130
Mr. Hiccups...

383
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,630
Wait, you're CEO Joo Ha Neul, right?

384
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,770
She must have been surprised
by the article.

385
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,410
(Jin Se Hoon)

386
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,450
Se Hoon. What's up?

387
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,350
Omakase?

388
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,190
I'll pass today.
I have a prior engagement.

389
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,060
Who is the man
our Jung Won is marrying?

390
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,130
Is it you, or...

391
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,800
is it that Jin something
in the picture?

392
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,900
I'm dying of curiosity.

393
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,440
What's the truth?

394
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,940
It's Jin Se Hoon.

395
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,420
It wasn't intentional,
but unavoidably,

396
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,980
I ended up lying.

397
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,050
I apologize.

398
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,200
It was true.
I'm so happy I could die.

399
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm going to be in-laws
with a rich family.

400
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:58,030
Se Hoon is a good guy.

401
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,610
He'll be very good to Jung Won.

402
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,870
You know each other?

403
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:08,550
- Yes.
- So that's why you helped Jung Won?

404
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,350
- I'll be going now.
- Hey, Mr. Hiccups.

405
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,520
I have a favor to ask.

406
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,960
Yes, what is it?

407
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,700
Please keep this a secret
from Ki Beom...

408
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,600
that the Jin something guy
is Jung Won's real partner.

409
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,410
- I understand.
- And one more thing.

410
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,210
Could you meet Ki Beom just once?

411
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,590
Could you tell him that you
are Jung Won's partner?

412
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,890
Jung Won's father is so honest
and hot-tempered...

413
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,060
that I'm worried
something might happen.

414
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

415
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,010
Who was that?

416
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,750
It's a secret.

417
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,150
How's it going?

418
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,090
Should I really...

419
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,430
I mean, shouldn't my family
be concerned?

420
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,200
It'll be revealed soon.

421
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Revealed?

422
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,130
Not figured out?

423
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's the same thing.

424
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,500
How far have you gotten?

425
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,840
There's an accomplice,
whether it was staged or a kidnapping.

426
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
And?

427
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,650
And that accomplice is...

428
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,420
- Park Kyung Shin's ex-girlfriend.
- Cha Jung Won?

429
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,290
- That's right.
- Anyone could have guessed that.

430
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,260
Did you find something
more specific?

431
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,400
A crucial clue will come out soon.

432
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,230
Let's drink.

433
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,210
What's that?

434
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,840
What's wrong? Let's just go.

435
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,270
- No...
- Let's go.

436
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,280
Come on.

437
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,180
Let's go.

438
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,370
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

439
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:43,970
No...

440
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,170
Let's go. I'm a little tired.

441
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,740
But Ha Neul will be here soon.

442
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,150
Young Chae. You look pale.

443
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,050
Why isn't Ha Neul here yet?

444
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,020
Let's go.

445
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,390
Goodness.

446
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,330
Look who it is.

447
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
I almost didn't recognize you.

448
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,870
New boyfriend?

449
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,400
Now that I see your face,
I recognize you.

450
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,670
Hello, Vice President Jin Se Hoon.

451
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,280
I'm...

452
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,810
the man who once promised
to marry this woman.

453
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,820
What?

454
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,890
You must be out of you mind.

455
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,760
If you're drunk, go home.

456
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,660
I'm not the crazy one. You are.

457
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,960
Do you know what kind of woman
she is?

458
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,430
She's dirt poor,

459
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,230
a part-timer with
a high school diploma,

460
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,240
and a murderer's daughter,
Cha Jung Won...

461
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,610
- Dirt poor...
- From a dirt-poor family...

462
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,780
- A part-timer.
- A high school grad...

463
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,490
The daughter of a murderer
has really made it big.

464
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,990
It was Noh Min Gu.

465
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,120
Not Young Chae.

466
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,500
(A Graceful Liar)

467
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,920
Who else was there
besides Park Kyung Shin?

468
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Are you interrogating me?

469
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,090
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

470
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,830
One of the guys who chased me a lot
in high school.

471
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,900
Lies.
Did Ms. Cha Jung Won reject you?

472
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,870
She's posing as Joo Young Chae
and will marry a rich family's heir.

473
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Don't you think that guy Noh Min Gu
has Park Kyung Shin?

474
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,240
Right now, we can't rule out
that possibility.

475
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,670
Who are you?
Who are you to kidnap me?

476
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,040
Did Chairman Gong Nan Sook
order this?

477
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,080
It wasn't of my own accord.

478
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,880
Did you kidnap Park Kyung Shin?

479
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,220
Why would I kidnap the man
I loved to death?

480
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,580
I have to get my place back.

481
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,020
