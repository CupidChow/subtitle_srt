1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,170
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,240
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,280
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,350
Why do I always have to be
the good one?

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,950
Why do you assume I'm the only one
who wants what she has...

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,720
and takes it?

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,760
Young Chae has stolen from me too.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,930
She took the most precious thing
I had. Not once, but twice.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,860
- No, three times.
- What are you talking about?

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,590
Joo Young Chae.

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Not you again.

12
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,530
(Did you take my design book,
by any chance?)

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,400
She read it and didn't even reply?

14
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,070
She would've denied it
if she hadn't taken it.

15
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,110
The first time could be a mistake
or a moment of greed.

16
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,910
But if it happens
twice or three times,

17
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,940
it's a different matter.

18
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,780
That's just pure greed.

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,510
Young Chae.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,790
So Young Chae stole your design book
and took off?

21
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,830
For the new designer contest
at Kunhyang Fashion,

22
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,530
she stole my design
and submitted it as her own.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,300
Just like in high school.

24
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,030
- What do you mean?
- You don't know...

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,470
how she
got into New York Royal Art School?

26
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,340
The designs she submitted
for her application...

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,310
They were yours?

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,110
Why would Young Chae do that?

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,850
Go find out for yourself.

30
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,050
See which one of us is lying.

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,120
Even if that's true,

32
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,360
that doesn't justify
what you're doing right now.

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,430
- This is the wrong choice...
- I don't care.

34
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,060
This is how I'm living my life now.

35
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,360
Even if it's just a fantasy
that ends in a month,

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,630
compared to living as Cha Jung Won,

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,500
with no hope or future,

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,270
this is better.

39
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,680
So is that why...

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,150
you went on the arranged date
with Se Hoon?

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,620
Does Young Chae know about this?

42
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,890
Yes.

43
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,460
If Mother finds out,

44
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,660
you're going to be
in serious trouble.

45
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,070
The same goes for Young Chae.

46
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,270
(Jin Se Hoon)

47
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,310
Young Chae said it herself.

48
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,610
"Buy me some time. Just one month."

49
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,550
"All I need is one month."

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,180
One month?

51
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,830
She wants to wait a month
before getting married?

52
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,160
Yes.

53
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's date for another month
before we decide.

54
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,700
Oh, so I haven't made the cut yet?

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,910
No, not yet.

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Ha Neul.

57
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,810
Hey, help me out here.

58
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,750
Oh, I completely forgot
I have plans.

59
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,950
I'll head out first.

60
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,250
Hey, wait.

61
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,860
(Episode 6)

62
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,030
So Joo Young Chae said that herself,
that she wants to date for a month?

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,470
Yes.

64
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,110
That's rich. She's in no position
to play hard to get.

65
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,810
Is she really trying
the crown prince...

66
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,810
of the Kunhyang family?

67
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,280
She probably just doesn't want
to seem too easy.

68
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,750
You fell for it way too easily.

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,320
Hey.

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,190
Looks like our son is quite taken
with Joo Young Chae.

71
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,750
I wouldn't say "taken,"

72
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,090
but she's fun to be around.

73
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
And...

74
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,130
- And?
- She's poised, yet down-to-earth.

75
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,030
She has a strong sense of self,
but she's also very warm.

76
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,070
He's fallen for her, indeed.

77
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,110
That's such a relief.
It's all up to him now.

78
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,880
Well, it makes the challenge
all the more exciting.

79
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,850
Oh, please. This is pathetic.

80
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,150
It sounds like you'll need
some backup.

81
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,870
(Joo Young Chae 2)

82
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,170
(Joo Young Chae 2)

83
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,710
Well, now, if it isn't CEO Joo.

84
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,340
And to my home, of all places.

85
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,850
When'd you get back from Australia?
You didn't even call.

86
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,650
And what? You would've come
to pick me up?

87
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,250
It's not like you'd want me to.
Maybe if I were Young Chae.

88
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,760
Speaking of Young Chae,
why won't that girl answer my calls?

89
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,960
I was tempted to storm over there.

90
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,530
I'm only being patient because
she and Se Hoon are doing so well.

91
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,270
Soon, I'm meeting with Chairman Jin
of the Kunhyang family...

92
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,340
to sign our joint
Hainan duty-free shop project.

93
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,670
Do you want to come along, CEO Joo?

94
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,340
Han Hye Ra is sure to be there.

95
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,110
Aren't you moving too fast?
Young Chae isn't even married yet.

96
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,480
He who hesitates is lost.

97
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,850
The contract is a 60-40 split.

98
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,950
I had to fight so hard
for that 60 percent.

99
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,590
That's Chairman Gong Nan Sook
for you.

100
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,560
So, are you coming or not?

101
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,330
You can handle it on your own.
You're a one-woman army.

102
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,770
That goes without saying.

103
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,100
Since you're here,
you might as well go see your room.

104
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,000
How dare you impersonate Young Chae?

105
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,800
I wouldn't be Gong Nan Sook
if I let you get away with this.

106
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,640
You despicable witch.

107
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,190
(Dad)

108
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,300
- Dad.
- Why do you sound so down?

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,210
You're the one who sounds down.
Have you been drinking?

110
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,980
You can tell? Just one glass.

111
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,480
- Me too.
- With your friend?

112
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,820
No, Young Chae is asleep.

113
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,460
Then why are you up moping
all by yourself?

114
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,360
You're one to talk.

115
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,530
- Too worried about me to sleep?
- I am, you silly.

116
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,600
Text me your address.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,440
A dad should know where his daughter
lives, after all.

118
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,870
I wanted to send you
some homemade food.

119
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,150
It's okay.
My friend doesn't eat much,

120
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,250
so the fridge is already packed
with leftovers.

121
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,280
Isn't she your friend
from high school?

122
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,090
She was the first friend
of yours to bring home.

123
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,020
- You remember Young Chae?
- Of course I do.

124
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,890
She ate all my soy-marinated crabs
in the blink of an eye.

125
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,160
Oh, did she?

126
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,000
All right.
I'll send you the address.

127
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,930
Just don't send too much.

128
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,570
Hearing your voice means...

129
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,080
- I can finally sleep soundly.
- Me too.

130
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,810
It's so good to hear
your voice, Dad.

133
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,440
(Gong Nan Sook)

134
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,080
Congratulations, Chairman Gong.

135
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,010
You two are the ones
who deserve congratulations.

136
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,950
For successfully launching
a joint investment project with me.

137
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,450
It's an honor for our family.

138
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,930
Aren't we all just parents here
to help our children succeed?

139
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,200
Let's be honest here.
It's the other way around.

140
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,170
You're the ones benefiting from
our children's relationship.

141
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,970
She has such a lovely way
with words.

142
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,970
The more I see of her,
the less I like her.

143
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,080
You chose to live as Young Chae
on borrowed time...

144
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,650
all because people started
being nice to you?

145
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,720
Or because you thought
you'd get more...

146
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,920
and shine brighter like her?

147
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,790
That's right.

148
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,960
When this little game
of pretend is over,

149
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,930
the world
will be cruel to you again.

150
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,190
I'm trying not to think
about that right now.

151
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,730
It's hard enough trying
to figure out...

152
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,030
how to live as Joo Young Chae
for one more day.

153
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,030
When Young Chae comes back,

154
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,740
she'll take
her life back mercilessly.

155
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,110
It will feel like it's being stolen.
Even though it was always hers.

156
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,450
And you're still going to go through
with this?

157
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,480
It's nerve-racking,

158
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,320
and I'm terrified of being
caught at any moment.

159
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,660
But it's thrilling.

160
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,260
Being in the spotlight,
getting all this applause.

161
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,030
It feels like I'm flying.

162
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,670
After that,

163
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,010
I feel like crashing back down.

164
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,040
It's like being on a roller coaster.

165
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,210
Don't tell me...

166
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,150
you're enjoying this.

167
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,660
I...

168
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,030
feel alive.

169
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,900
For the first time in my life.

170
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,670
Thank you for your kindness.

171
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,310
What if I'm the one to expose you?

172
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,020
Don't be afraid.
Joo Ha Neul won't be able to do it.

173
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,390
He'd never do that.
Not if it meant hurting Young Chae.

174
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,830
If that's the choice you're making,

175
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,990
then I'll respect it.

176
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,010
Oh, dear.

177
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,920
I can skip the other stuff,
but I have to get her a ring.

178
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,520
The venue, the wedding dress,

179
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,130
and the honeymoon.
Money's going to be really tight.

180
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,890
A set of dishes.

181
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,730
Forget it.

182
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,180
I've never seen this before.

183
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,320
Jo Mi Hyang.

184
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,460
I can't believe
she actually did this.

185
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,260
Goodness!

186
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,300
It's just...

187
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,900
It's so pretty!

188
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,770
It looks like it was made for you.

189
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,100
Sir. You certainly have a good eye.

190
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,940
(Jewelry Box)

191
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,350
Oh, my.

192
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,280
Ki Beom?

193
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,320
Right now?

194
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,360
Gosh, you. You miss me already?

195
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,060
All right. I'll be there in a flash.

196
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,430
You two are so lovey-dovey.

197
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,400
So, are you going to go
with the one you have on?

198
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,070
You don't waste any time, do you?

199
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,380
I have to come back with my fiance.
It's our wedding ring, after all.

200
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,250
- Can I put this on hold?
- Yes, please.

201
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,420
(Jewelry Box)

202
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,190
Did he secretly buy me
a diamond ring?

203
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,090
Ki Beom!

204
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,600
Ki Beom!

205
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
How did you find this?

206
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,700
What if he found
Jung Won's bankbook as well?

207
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,570
Wasn't buying it in secret enough?
You had to hide it too?

208
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,280
Where did you get the money?
Are you stashing cash away from me?

209
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,110
Like I have any money to stash away.

210
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,050
Thank goodness.

211
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,650
He still hasn't found
Jung Won's bankbook.

212
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,390
How badly must I have wanted it
to have bought it in secret?

213
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,460
Unbelievable. You've got some nerve.

214
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,460
Who should be angry
at whom right now?

215
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,200
Then what do you want from me?

216
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,200
Can't I even say that to you?

217
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,440
Oh, just stop it.

218
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,780
Gosh. This is so frustrating.

219
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,710
Oh, for crying out loud.

220
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,520
My goodness.

221
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,260
Did you change the passcode?

222
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,460
Oh, yes. Young Chae did.

223
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,000
Good. That was smart.

224
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,130
Keeps that worthless model
from waltzing in and out of here.

225
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,400
Where's Young Chae?

226
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,310
She's not home yet.

227
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,140
That girl.
Why is she ducking my calls?

228
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,780
I've been spoiling her lately,

229
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,010
and it's gone to her head.

230
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,380
- How about some tea?
- Forget the tea. Anything to eat?

231
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,890
Pardon?

232
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,920
A snack? You don't know how to cook?

233
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,920
Just give me a minute.

234
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,900
What's that over there?

235
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,900
Her taste has gone downhill.

236
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,180
- Sit down.
- Enjoy it comfortably.

237
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,020
I said, sit down.

238
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,890
Are you scared of me?

239
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,060
You're just intimidating.

240
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,370
What was your name again?

241
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,670
It's Cha Jung Won.

242
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,570
Jung Won. You're like a daughter.
So I'll drop the formalities.

243
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,310
Okay.

244
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,840
Whose house is this?

245
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,080
It's Young Chae's.

246
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,950
Wrong. It's Gong Nan Sook's house.
Young Chae's money is my money.

247
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,390
Then why is it that this house
doesn't feel like Young Chae's here,

248
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,860
and more like her friend,
Jung Won's?

249
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,600
Can one person moving in
really change a place's entire vibe?

250
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,370
You seem so proper and quiet,
but are you bolder than Young Chae?

251
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,610
Not at all.

252
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,680
I was cleaning and organizing,
and I just got carried away.

253
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,880
Does the help move furniture around
and rehang paintings without asking?

254
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,420
Is that something
you're allowed to do?

255
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,850
For someone living here for free,
you've got a lot of gall.

256
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,520
I'll put everything back
where it was.

257
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,760
I'm done.

258
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
When Young Chae comes home,
tell her to call me.

259
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
If she ignores my call again,
she'll have to pay for it.

260
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,190
This is nothing. I can handle this.

261
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,460
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

262
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,040
Yes, Vice Chairman.

263
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,770
Tomorrow?

264
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,650
- Grapefruit black tea?
- It's your favorite.

265
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,950
How did you know?

266
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,160
To think you remembered that...

267
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,570
- Are you always so observant?
- Only when something interests me.

268
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,970
Well, thank you for your interest.

269
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,410
My son would also appreciate
that kind of attention.

270
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,520
He may seem cynical on the outside,
but he's actually very warm-hearted.

271
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,020
He's quite popular with the ladies,
and he's well aware of it.

272
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,060
Please don't get easily impressed,

273
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,600
nor give up on him easily.

274
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,430
Why would you say that?

275
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,770
His birth mother fell ill
when he was young...

276
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,540
and has been
in a nursing home since.

277
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,610
And that's where I came in.

278
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,510
My son...

279
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,310
I cherished him and held him closer
than I did my own daughter, Se Mi.

280
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,150
But...

281
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,790
he must be starved for affection.

282
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,390
That's why he proposed to Ahn Ji Na
after dating for only three months.

283
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,930
So Se Hoon falls hard and fast.

284
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,930
But on the flip side, once he's done
with someone, he's ruthless.

285
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,040
That's why I suggested we date
for about a month first.

286
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,940
I didn't mean I wasn't interested
or that I was giving up.

287
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,740
So you're saying
your feelings for each other...

288
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,110
are more important than the promise
between our families?

289
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,250
Yes.

290
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,820
Let's get acquainted for a month
as my potential daughter-in-law.

291
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,820
Thank you for being so considerate.

292
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,090
Would you mind giving me a tour?

293
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,670
This is your friend's room?

294
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,970
Yes. My best friend from high school
stays over sometimes.

295
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,580
Who's the artist?

296
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,580
Did you paint this?

297
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,020
The technique, the brushwork...

298
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,560
They're like the one
in your design book. Am I right?

299
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,290
I can't deny it.

300
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,400
No, I don't want to deny it.

301
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,500
I still have a lot to learn.

302
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,640
I imagine
you must have had an easy life.

303
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,870
It's like someone who hit the bottom
and is now soaring.

304
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,680
I can see ambition,
and there's depth.

305
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,280
- You have a gift.
- She's seeing me for who I am,

306
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,050
not as Joo Young Chae
but as Cha Jung Won.

307
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,650
Of all the things I possess,

308
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,190
she's acknowledging
my greatest gift.

309
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,720
Thank you.

310
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,270
I mean, what kid didn't have
a teddy bear like that growing up?

311
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,220
I completely lost track of time.

312
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,820
That's what happens
when I'm with you.

313
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,650
Me too.

314
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,950
Eighteenth floor.

315
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,220
I thought shipping
would be too slow,

316
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,250
so I brought it myself. Here you go.

317
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,120
So you just decided to barge in
without calling?

318
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,630
You're my daughter living in Seoul.
Of course I'm going to come see you.

319
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,600
Gosh, this place is incredible.

320
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,170
Where's your friend?

321
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,870
Young Chae's not back yet.

322
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,370
You look different
every time I see you, sweetie.

323
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,440
These are Young Chae's clothes.

324
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,610
They look really expensive.
Should you be accepting them?

325
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,750
She has a lot.

326
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,450
It's not good to get used
to taking handouts.

327
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,620
I pull my own weight.

328
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,620
No, actually, I give her more
than she gives me.

329
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,730
More? Like what?

330
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,730
- But you don't have a dime.
- Dad!

331
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,900
When you only see the finer things
in life, it makes you greedy.

332
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,870
That's just human nature.

333
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,610
Just trust me like you always have.

334
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,140
I know what I'm doing.

335
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,010
All right.

336
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,350
Well, I feel better
now that I know where you are.

337
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,080
- I'll get going.
- What, already? Stay for dinner.

338
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,280
I can whip something up.

339
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,150
I'm just happy I got to see you.
Don't worry about dinner.

340
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,920
Besides, this place is too fancy.
I feel out of place.

341
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,690
I'm afraid I'll scuff the place up.

342
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,190
- I'm off.
- Oh, hold on a second.

343
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,160
Here, take a cab.

344
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,800
Hey!

345
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,130
You're trying to squeeze blood
from a stone.

346
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,170
I can just take the bus. Here.

347
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,870
But I've been leeching off of you
for over 30 years.

348
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,040
Well, then.

349
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,280
Let me leech just 20 dollars back.
How about it?

350
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,630
You're asking if I actually like
Young Chae?

351
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,530
Do you like her because she is
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter?

352
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,200
Or do you like her for who she is?

353
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,640
- What's the difference?
- There's a big difference.

354
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,910
So, ignore the family partnership,
and just evaluate her as a person?

355
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,210
Something like that.

356
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,480
I did meet her, knowing she was
Chairman Gong's daughter,

357
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,720
so I can't guarantee
that's not a factor.

358
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,350
But...

359
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,120
But what?

360
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,490
She's unique.

361
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,490
Is that a compliment or an insult?

362
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,700
A compliment.

363
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,970
Someone who gets more interesting
the more you get to know them.

364
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,100
Joo Young Chae was right about that.

365
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,070
I guess I'll need another month
with her to know for sure.

366
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,270
The look in your eyes has changed.

367
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,210
You're not angry. You're excited.

368
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,580
Ha Neul, I'm telling you.
I'm fired up.

369
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,260
(Madam Gong Nan Sook)

370
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,590
Yes, Mother. I'm having a drink
with Se Hoon right now.

371
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,790
How are things going
with him and Young Chae?

372
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,030
Tell Vice President Jin...

373
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,670
that I want to have a meal
with him soon, just the two of us.

374
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,140
Okay.

375
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,980
Young Chae.

376
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,820
Why haven't you been
answering my calls?

377
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,620
Sorry. I was busy on a date.

378
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,790
Come by the house sometime.

379
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,620
We need to pick gifts
and your dress.

380
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,830
I'll talk it over
with Se Hoon first.

381
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,500
- Speaking of Se Hoon...
- He's here with me. I have to go.

382
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,740
He's with her?

383
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,480
Hey, CEO Joo. Are you sure
you're with Jin Se Hoon now?

384
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,950
(Call ended, Voice changer)

385
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,020
(Recorded Voice 1)

386
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,390
If you want to pass as me,
you have to have my phone.

387
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,390
My mom won't be fooled
by just the phone.

388
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:29,890
You'll have to disguise
your voice too.

389
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,860
Just cover for me for one month.

390
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,340
Call me as soon as you get to Paris
and get a new phone.

391
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,040
Seriously, if it weren't for you,

392
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,270
I would've lived my entire life
as my mom's puppet.

393
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,840
I'm glad I could help.

394
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,750
We really are true friends.

395
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,050
Thanks to you, I found my true love,

396
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,620
and thanks to me,
you get to play princess.

397
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,220
Right?

398
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,720
You're right. We're true friends.

399
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,060
This is only until
Young Chae gets back.

400
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,960
This whole act of living as her.

401
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,470
But when Young Chae comes back,

402
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,170
then what does that make me?

403
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,150
(Kunhyang Wedding Shop)

404
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,620
We need to pick out
Young Chae's wedding dress.

405
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,390
Come to the hotel wedding shop
by 4 p.m. tomorrow.

406
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,060
Chairman Gong is rushing things.

407
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,870
Young Chae, that brat.

408
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:51,410
I'm sure she's scheming something
with her friend.

409
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,080
How have you been?

410
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,620
Oh, you're here.

411
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:03,520
My, you look more dashing
every time I see you.

412
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,420
You're really something else,
Vice President Jin.

413
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,060
You're always too kind.
I'm flattered.

414
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,660
My, you're so humble too.

415
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,200
- Where's Young Chae?
- Come on, have a seat.

416
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,140
Young Chae will be here any minute.

417
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,200
I spoke to the hotel's wedding shop.
Go take a look at some dresses.

418
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,310
Does Young Chae know I'm coming?

419
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,010
No, I just told her we were going
to try on some dresses.

420
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,680
Why?

421
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,580
Oh, it's nothing.

422
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,460
Surprised to see me?

423
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,130
Young Chae.

424
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,880
What do you mean, Young Chae?

425
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,620
Why are you calling her Young Chae?

426
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,600
Hey! You conniving witch.

427
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,170
How dare you impersonate
my daughter?

428
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,770
What do you mean,
she's not Young Chae?

429
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,940
Just tell me what's going on!

430
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,760
(A Graceful Liar)

431
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,080
So you really do like me.

432
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,820
Maybe I should take out a billboard.
"Se Hoon loves Young Chae."

433
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,550
If you're ever in a bind,
just call me, "Mother."

434
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,460
Young Chae,
can't I just keep being you?

435
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,460
Who on earth are you?

436
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,430
Are you even really
Young Chae's friend?

437
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,200
I asked you, where is Young Chae?

438
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,730
Regardless of your intentions,
you must be more careful.

439
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,770
Joo Young Chae or not,
I can't stop thinking about you.

440
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,210
Whether I'm with you or not.

441
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,580
