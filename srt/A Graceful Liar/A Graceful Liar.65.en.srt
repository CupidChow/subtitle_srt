00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,010
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictional.)

00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,280
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,610
(Electing the Interim Vice Chairman)

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,350
Let's hear a brief statement
from each candidate.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,760
I know Kunhyang's systems
and its people...

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,790
better than anyone.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,330
In a crisis, it's vital that someone
who knows the firm...

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,600
and is experienced takes the lead.

10
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,300
Kunhyang is not some small company
that will just last a year or two.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,000
For a hundred,
even two hundred years,

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,610
it must stand
as a great pillar of this nation.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,680
Can we really entrust...

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,010
a company like Kunhyang
to just anyone?

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,660
I was born a Kunhyang man,
and I will die one.

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,390
I'm confident I am the right person
to overcome this crisis.

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,830
Kunhyang is clearly in a crisis right now.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,600
To overcome this,

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,800
I believe we must view the problem
as objectively as possible.

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,170
While respecting Kunhyang's methods
and strengths,

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,170
I will adapt to current realities.

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,110
I won't take my duties lightly
just because this is temporary.

23
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,920
I will get the job done.

24
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,320
I believe both candidates...

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,260
are more than qualified.

26
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,690
It's a shame
that I can only choose one of you.

27
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,630
- Chairman, you must make a choice.
- I agree with that.

28
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,740
The interim Vice Chairman will be...

29
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,020
CEO Joo Ha Neul.

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,590
Chairman Jin,
what do you think you're doing?

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,030
- Are you messing with me?
- You yourself said...

32
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,130
you would abide by
Chairman Jin's decision.

33
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,300
Yes, I did say that.

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,270
But you're just doing this
to mess with me, aren't you?

35
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,250
(Episode 65)

36
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,020
(Kunhyang Group)

37
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,520
You're trying to double-cross me?

38
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,790
So you want to start something,
is that it?

39
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,000
Gosh. Relax.

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,130
You'll lose what little dignity
you have left.

41
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,200
Forget about my dignity!
This is going to kill me.

42
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,800
What is this ridiculous trick?

43
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,940
We had a deal!
We agreed to back Jin Se Hoon.

44
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,980
A deal? I made no deal with you.
I did no such thing.

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,480
- You jerk of a chairman!
- Hey!

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,680
Let's try to be
a little more dignified.

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,320
My Hye Ra might get the wrong idea.

48
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,960
What if she really thinks
I kissed you or something?

49
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,990
Are you seriously
playing games with me?

50
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,890
Look at you. You're faltering.

51
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,300
Don't even think
you can weasel your way out of this.

52
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,830
I'm pulling all my investment funds!

53
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,670
For crying out loud.
You're threatening me with money again.

54
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,740
It's your son, Joo Ha Neul.

55
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,680
No matter how you slice it,
you're the one who wins, aren't you?

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,710
Ha Neul is surprisingly principled.
He's not a pushover.

57
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,650
He'll give you a major headache too,
Jin Tae Seok.

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,980
It's a temporary position.

59
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,650
My successor as
Chairman of Kunhyang...

60
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,160
is Jin Se Hoon anyway.

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,030
Can I take you at your word?

62
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,890
Why did you choose Joo Ha Neul?

63
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,100
I can't believe you made a decision
like that right to my face.

64
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,670
Goodness. I guess
we both got stabbed in the back.

65
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,500
I'm absolutely fuming.

66
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,540
This is CEO Joo...

67
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,340
Not anymore.

68
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,610
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul's office.

69
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,550
Have a seat.

70
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,890
May I?

71
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,390
Of course. It's your seat.

72
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
Right.

73
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,630
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

74
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,600
(Kunhyang Group)

75
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,770
Do you think
I'll be able to handle this?

76
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,840
Of course. I recommended you.

77
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,810
But...

78
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,950
Why did you choose me,
and not Se Hoon?

79
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,820
That's a tough question.

80
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,860
Before you hand the reins over
to Vice President Jin Se Hoon,

81
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,790
did you just think of me
as a placeholder?

82
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,430
This position is
about leading Kunhyang Group.

83
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,730
There's no room for placeholders.

84
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,070
So, can I take that to mean
you trust me?

85
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,610
At the end of the day,
business is about people.

86
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,510
So it's important
who the captain is.

87
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,610
If the captain is a person
of poor character,

88
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,080
it leads to chaos,
and the whole ship goes off course.

89
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,120
So you trust my character?

90
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,730
Even though this is temporary,
I'll do my best...

91
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,790
to live up to your expectations.

92
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,630
Don't think of it
as a temporary position.

93
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,130
Because I'm already thinking
about what comes next.

94
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,310
So you're curious why I chose
Joo Ha Neul over you.

95
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,610
Yes.

96
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,550
I just can't accept it.

97
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,680
I want someone with a backbone.

98
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,550
Someone who can overcome
any adversity.

99
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,320
Are you saying
I don't have a backbone?

100
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,590
I made a deal with him.
If he dates Se Mi,

101
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,820
I'd give him the vice chairman position.

102
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,190
But Joo Ha Neul turned me down.

103
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
I know.

104
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,160
What makes me angrier...

105
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,860
is that you forced him the position
even when he refused.

106
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,310
You knelt before Gong Nan Sook?

107
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,940
Chairman.

108
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,980
How could my son bow down
to a low-life loan shark?

109
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,210
Does Gong Nan Sook own
Kunhyang Group?

110
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,020
There's a limit to
how you can disgrace me.

111
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,420
When I heard Vice Chairman Han
recommended CEO Joo over me,

112
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,390
- I assumed you would be swayed.
- That was a rash assumption!

113
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,300
And that's why I didn't choose you.

114
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,530
And is that all?

115
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,230
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

116
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,940
You'd hand over two percent
of your shares to beg...

117
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,810
for the vice chairman position?

118
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,280
To Gong Nan Sook?

119
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,050
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

120
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,150
I know everything about Kunhyang.
It's my business to know.

121
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,450
In order to gain ten things,

122
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,690
I thought it was acceptable
to give up one.

123
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,860
That was my judgment.

124
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,220
Your judgment!

125
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,660
Your judgment was wrong.

126
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,360
And that's the bigger problem.

127
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,970
Don't disappoint me any further.

128
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,570
Don't be so sure that your position
as Kunhyang's heir is guaranteed.

129
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,240
First, you need to become
a bigger man.

130
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
Am I clear?

131
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,580
Yes, Chairman.

132
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,450
You can go now.

133
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,320
CEO Joo Ha Neul...

134
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,380
I mean...

135
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,420
it's time for
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul to arrive.

136
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,510
You think you've won, don't you?

137
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,040
I don't expect your congratulations.

138
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,740
I know how upsetting
this must be for you.

139
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,650
- I completely understand.
- Just cut the nonsense!

140
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,050
It's just a temporary position.

141
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,220
And you'll be sitting
on pins and needles.

142
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,520
Because the moment I get a chance,
I'm going to take you down.

143
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,960
If you've got what it takes,
be my guest.

144
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,330
Feeling confident, are you?

145
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,460
I'm just going to focus on the job
I've been entrusted with.

146
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,830
And I'm going to be grateful for it.

147
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,870
I look forward to working with you.

148
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:24,040
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

149
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,280
What could you be
disappointed about?

150
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,880
You got what you wanted...

151
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,280
and gave the position
to Joo Ha Neul.

152
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,560
You're very disappointed in me,
aren't you?

153
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,030
You recognized my potential
more than Chairman ever did.

154
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,800
You were my most vocal supporter,
Vice Chairman.

155
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,600
- That's right. And I still do...
- Are you afraid?

156
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,600
That if I became Vice Chairman...

157
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,440
and took over Kunhyang,

158
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,970
what you did to my mom would get out
for the whole world to see?

159
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,580
Is that what you're afraid of?

160
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,550
Is that why you're doing everything
you can to hold me back?

161
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,610
That's enough.

162
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,450
Am I wrong?

163
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,190
If you want the truth, Se Hoon,
find out every last detail yourself.

164
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,160
Find out who really did that
to your birth mother.

165
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,290
So you're saying it wasn't you?

166
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,890
If you're going to accuse me,

167
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,230
bring me solid proof.

168
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Fine.

169
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,340
I'll find out myself
who was behind...

170
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,700
my mother's senseless death.

171
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,710
Do that first. It's not too late
to confront me then.

172
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,210
You'd better brace yourself.

173
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,650
Bring it on.

174
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,390
Congratulations.

175
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,260
I didn't expect you
to support me, Chairman.

176
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,300
Neither did I.

177
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,530
May I ask
why you suddenly changed your mind?

178
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,770
Just a whim.

179
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,670
Chairman.

180
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,740
You seem gentle,
but you're a tree with deep roots.

181
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,010
Its branches may sway,
but it will never break.

182
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,480
That's high praise.

183
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,520
And about Se Mi and you...

184
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,120
Is that still out of the question?

185
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,890
It's because of Cha Jung Won,
I assume?

186
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,030
My feelings for Jung Won aside,
it would never work with Se Mi.

187
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,000
To me, Se Mi is
just like a little sister.

188
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,010
I can't force your heart.

189
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,780
But then again,
a heart can change so easily.

190
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,280
Anyway,

191
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,920
I know you'll do well
as Vice Chairman. I'll be watching.

192
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,390
Yes. I'll be in touch.

193
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,840
Were you waiting for me?

194
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,040
I wanted to congratulate you
on becoming Vice Chairman.

195
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,810
Thanks.

196
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,480
Don't worry about anything today.
Just celebrate with the nice folks.

197
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,690
Look at all that steam.

198
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,390
They're so perfectly white and long.
So pretty.

199
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,830
Good grief.

200
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,670
I just feel awful.

201
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,970
Grandma says you're the one
acting even more awful.

202
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,170
Grandma.

203
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,080
Don't you start.
I'm a complete wreck right now.

204
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,380
My amazing son-in-law
just got defeated.

205
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,750
So what?
He got defeated by your own son.

206
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,220
Come to think of it,
that upsets me even more.

207
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,990
That's because you let Han Hye Ra
steal your son from you.

208
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,590
Stop rubbing salt in the wound.

209
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,360
You're far too greedy.

210
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,190
There's no end to it.

211
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,200
Come on!

212
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,030
- That's filthy.
- Darn it! I'll just rip it apart!

213
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,340
You're throwing a tantrum
like a child.

214
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Darn it.

215
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,140
He's so good at twisting the knife.

216
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,810
Gosh, I'll just rip it all apart!

217
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,010
Did you even bother to think
about my feelings?

218
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,150
Oh, my!

219
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,520
My goodness. How is it that...

220
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,460
the rice cake
sticks right on your face?

221
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,030
What a talent.

222
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,160
Mother!

223
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,640
Seriously.

224
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,410
My handsome son-in-law,
you must have been so startled.

225
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,010
What happened?

226
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,980
You said the board members
were in your pocket.

227
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,780
So? Are you saying it's my fault
you're not Vice Chairman?

228
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,820
Isn't it?

229
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,220
How could I know Jin Tae Seok
would betray me like that?

230
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,960
And how could he give
the vice chairman title...

231
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,090
to a punk who isn't even the heir?

232
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,130
That punk is Joo Ha Neul.

233
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,130
He is your son, Chairman Gong.

234
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,800
You think I need you
to tell me that?

235
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,330
Could it be...

236
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,940
that you...

237
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,870
were secretly
backing CEO Joo Ha Neul all along?

238
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,340
If that were true,
would I be comfort-eating right now,

239
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,310
trying to swallow my rage?

240
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,280
I can't even face Ha Neul.

241
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,250
I openly opposed my own son
as his mother...

242
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,390
at the board meeting.

243
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,420
How do you think he'd feel?

244
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,260
Imagine how devastated he must be.

245
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,590
Do you really think Ha Neul
is going to sympathize with you?

246
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,260
He's convinced you're the one
who killed his father.

247
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,600
You know that too?

248
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,900
It hurts. Stop twisting the knife.

249
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,740
I didn't realize
you were capable of feeling pain.

250
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,310
Whatever.
Let's just figure out our next move.

251
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,040
Let Ha Neul have
that measly interim position.

252
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,780
You can be the permanent Vice Chairman,
Se Hoon.

253
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,220
Of course I will.

254
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,720
But it's still frustrating.

255
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,490
What? Their vibe feels different.

256
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,460
Se Hoon.
To take our minds off things,

257
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,160
how about we go home
and have a glass of wine?

258
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,030
You're pregnant.
You shouldn't be drinking wine.

259
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,860
What?

260
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,570
Oh, you're right.

261
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,410
You're supposed to be pregnant.
Get it together.

(Damga Charcoal Grill)

263
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,850
Oh my goodness.

264
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,520
CEO Joo is the new Vice Chairman
of Kunhyang Group?

265
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,280
Am I dreaming?

266
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,150
It's an interim role.
I'm just filling in for now.

267
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,190
Who cares? Let me have
a major company's vice chairman...

268
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,630
pour me a drink.

269
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,260
Mom, you're pressuring him.
Take it easy.

270
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,900
No, it's fine.
It feels pretty great, actually.

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,430
All right, let's make a toast
to celebrate!

272
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,070
- Here we go.
- All right.

273
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,710
- Cheers.
- Do you mind if we join you?

274
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,580
Perfect timing. Come on, sit down.

275
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,180
Isn't that Han Hye Ra's secretary?

276
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,680
- Hello.
- I invited them.

277
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,520
- Please take a seat.
- If CEO Joo invited you,

278
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,590
I guess you can sit down.

279
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,330
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

280
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,630
- Congratulations.
- Cheers!

281
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,040
So, when is your first day?

282
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,710
Next Monday.

283
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,510
You two can commute together
from now on.

284
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,580
It's not like employees
ever meet Vice Chairman.

285
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,110
Why not?
It's reassuring to have an ally.

286
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,820
I think it'd be great to have lunch
and support each other when needed.

287
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,190
If you like the idea, just say so.
Don't make our CEO Joo...

288
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,960
I mean, don't make Vice Chairman Joo
feel awkward.

289
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,440
I'll be the one who needs help
from you two.

290
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,210
I'll be counting on you both.

291
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,540
I will do my very best
to be of assistance.

292
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,050
I'll do my best to serve as a bridge
between you and Vice Chairman Han.

293
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,280
There are many factions
working against me.

294
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,550
When times get tough,
I'll be relying heavily on you both.

297
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,600
- All right, let's have a big toast!
- Okay.

298
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
Oh, right.

299
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,570
For a toast, how about we use "STR?"

300
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,610
- "STR?"
- "S" for Smoothly.

301
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,950
"R" for Thickly.

302
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,910
Rhythmically!

303
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,550
Rhythmically!

304
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,220
- STR!
- STR!

305
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,220
I know one too.

306
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
How about "LIEG?"

307
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,630
Love in every glass!

308
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,700
- Love in every glass!
- Love in every glass!

309
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,600
- LIEG!
- LIEG!

312
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,380
He's not even answering?
I was calling to congratulate him.

313
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,390
You really didn't have to
walk me home.

314
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,920
I felt like talking a walk.

315
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,420
Thank you.

316
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,760
For accepting
the vice chairman position.

317
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,300
That just makes me want to do
an even better job.

318
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,230
You'll do great.

319
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,820
You were with Ha Neul
this whole time?

320
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,230
We were just celebrating...

321
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,960
Why would Ha Neul be celebrating
with you?

322
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,100
It wasn't just the two of us.
We were with other nice folks...

323
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,040
Why are you one of his nice folks
he'd celebrate with?

324
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,410
Se Mi.

325
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,780
This isn't the office.
At home, treat her like your sister.

326
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,150
My sister?

327
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,920
How can she be my sister?

328
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,990
She may be your daughter,

329
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,560
but I'll never accept her
as my sister.

330
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,750
Goodness.

331
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,290
Do you want to go on a date
with me tomorrow?

332
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,690
- Just the two of us?
- Yes.

333
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,540
The pasta was amazing.

334
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,080
It was 200 times better
than the pasta we had in Italy.

335
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,210
It tasted even better because
I had it with you after a long time.

It is also the card of choice.

Choice?

342
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,320
You must choose each other
with equal conviction,

343
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,520
but the scales aren't balanced.

344
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,770
You're carrying a heavy truth
all by yourself.

You seem strong, but deep down,

346
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,680
you're filled with fear and guilt.

00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,280
Please tell my mom something
to lift her spirits.

00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,860
Once the truth comes out,

350
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,790
your relationships
will be transformed.

351
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,540
Oh, my.

352
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,910
I guess it's not going to work out
with Ha Neul and me.

353
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,980
My poor legs.
You can't force the heart.

354
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,110
I hate Cha Jung Won
because Ha Neul likes her.

355
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,520
Oh, dear. Come here.

356
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,560
I'm heartbroken too.
Do you like CEO Joo that much?

357
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,790
- He's Vice Chairman now.
- Right. Vice Chairman.

358
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,560
Vice Chairman Joo is a good man.

359
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
But...

360
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,800
Me or Cha Jung Won?
If you could only pick one?

361
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What?

362
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,710
What kind of question is that?

363
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,780
It has to be me, no matter what.

364
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,950
Gosh, my baby.

365
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,320
You're still such a baby.

366
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,020
Joo Ha Neul and my Se Mi...

367
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,960
How can I set them up?

368
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,530
Ha Neul has stayed out
for several nights in a row again.

369
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,410
Hey, Manager Gu.
Go to bed if you're sleepy.

370
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,880
I'm fine, ma'am.
I'm not sleepy at all.

371
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,140
You want me to hit you
with a rice cake?

372
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,150
A rice cake?

373
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,750
It's amazing when it's dipped
in some sweet syrup.

374
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,350
Shall I bring some out
for a late-night snack?

375
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,850
The fact that I've kept you around
this long...

376
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,520
proves that I must be way too nice
for my own good.

377
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,030
In that case,
I will behave nicely...

378
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,200
- and just go to bed.
- Go on.

379
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,700
Hey, stop.

380
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,630
You'll be
on top of things tomorrow, right?

381
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,840
Tomorrow? What's happening tomorrow?

382
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,040
Isn't tomorrow
when we get the results...

383
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,940
for the Young Chae design analysis?

384
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,150
Oh, I completely forgot.

385
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,180
How could you forget that?
Young Chae's future is riding on it.

386
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,080
Gosh.

387
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,150
What are you scheming now?

388
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,020
Scheming? Don't be ridiculous.

389
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,590
- Go on, get to bed. Hurry.
- Yes, ma'am.

390
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,100
I figured I should congratulate you.

391
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,240
You must be mad I got the position
and not Se Hoon, whom you supported.

392
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,210
At first, yes.

393
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,910
How could he lose
when I was the one backing him?

394
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,510
I handed it to him on a platter,
but he failed to take it.

395
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,450
That fool can't fend for himself.

396
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,290
So, what's your next scheme?

397
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,950
How you're going to drag me down...

398
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,360
- and make Se Hoon Vice Chairman...
- Well done.

399
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,600
You earned that position.
Now, do a good job.

400
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,100
What are you doing?

401
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,900
Don't fool yourself into thinking
this makes me your puppet...

402
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,470
Whatever. I'm so tired.
Why am I suddenly so sleepy?

403
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,570
I should get to bed.

404
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,940
Go on. You look tired too.
Sleep tight.

- Good morning.

It's the new Vice Chairman.

Congratulations on your appointment,

- Congratulations.

Thank you.
I'll be counting on your support.

Please help me out a lot.

- We look forward to it.
- We look forward to it.

I look forward to working
with you all.

(Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul)

421
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,700
It's your first day.
You must be excited...

422
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,410
and pressured too, I bet.

423
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,040
I just hope I can live up
to your expectations.

424
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,410
I'll need your guidance.

(Kunhyang Group)

429
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,640
Joo Ha Neul is my boss now?
That's ridiculous.

430
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,980
The results are in?

431
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,180
I'm on my way.

432

- How long have you been here?
- Are the analysis results in?

433
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,930
Everything's settled
with my mom, right?

434
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,170
Team Leader Joo,
please compose yourself.

435
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,040
She wouldn't go back on her word,
would she?

436
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
You’re just a loan shark...

437
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,420
and you dare summon me,
the chairman of Kunhyang Group?

438
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,650
"Lowlife."

439
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,560
That word always
used to be attached to my name.

440
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,030
- I wonder why you dropped it today.
- Did you miss me that much?

441
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,630
Why do you keep summoning me?

442
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,200
It's time to decide.

443
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,530
Decide what?

444
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,370
Decide if you're still in this boat
with me or not.

445
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,470
Why rock the boat now?

446
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,800
We've always been partners
in the same boat.

447
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,170
A crocodile and its plover.

448
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,180
I was absolutely furious about
the interim vice chairman appointment,

449
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,510
but I'll let it slide
just this once. However...

450
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,120
- However?
- Cha Jung Won.

451
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,320
What did she do now?

452
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,720
I hear she's hell-bent on destroying
Young Chae in the Design Team.

453
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,230
But didn't Joo Young Chae
steal the design book?

454
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,030
Does the truth even matter?

455
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,700
So what scheme are you
proposing this time?

456
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,600
I'll handle it. And that goes for
that witch Cha Jung Won too.

457
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,700
Are you saying you're going to
get rid of Cha Jung Won?

458
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,340
I would have torn her to shreds
a dozen times already.

459
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,580
No more holding back.

460
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,180
Count me out.
If Han Hye Ra finds out...

461
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,380
I said, I'll handle it.
You're such a coward.

462
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,460
You're certain, right?

463
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,030
You must accept the result,
whatever it is.

464
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,280
Here are the results
from the analysis.

465
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,350
(Design Analysis Report)

466
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,690
According to the analysis,

467
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:43,160
the two designs were created
by two different people.

468
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,730
Drawing one is a match
with Cha Jung Won's design book,

469
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,870
and drawing two is a match
with Joo Young Chae's design book.

470
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,940
You're sure about this?

471
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,740
I staked out their office
and made the swap...

472
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,610
with the fakes we prepared.

473
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:12,120
Gosh, Young Chae.
The things I do for you.

474
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,660
So you'd better do your part.

475
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,860
Designer Cha Jung Won.

476
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,030
You framed an innocent person
and threw the company into chaos?

477
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,070
I don't accept these results.

478
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,110
Designer Joo Young Chae is the one
who stole my design.

479
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,810
That's enough, Cha Jung Won.

480
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,010
This is just pathetic,
don't you think?

481
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,080
I knew you had a victim complex,

482
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,650
- but now it's just pitiful.
- Something is wrong.

483
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,690
I'll expose the truth.

484
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,190
No. A designer like you
has no place here.

485
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,930
Submit your resignation.

(A Graceful Liar)

487
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,700
There's no way
Jung Won would lie about this.

488
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,100
Can't you just listen to me for once
and believe what I'm saying?

489
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,570
Chairman Gong is really something.

490
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,440
How did she make the fakes
so convincing?

491
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,410
You're telling me
Designer Cha Jung Won...

492
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,710
framed Designer Joo Young Chae?

493
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,650
You have to pretend to know nothing.
My entire future is at stake.

494
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,820
You stole Jung Won's design book,
didn't you, Designer Joo Young Chae?

495
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,450
- What should we do with Young Chae?
- She needs to be taught a lesson.

496
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,890
I'll prove that
lies and cheating won't prevail.
