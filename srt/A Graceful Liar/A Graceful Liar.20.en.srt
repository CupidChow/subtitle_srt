1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,210
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,280
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,650
This is so cute.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,160
It really suits your style.

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,790
Just what I'd expect from a manager
at Kunhyang Fashion.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,300
I'll show you this
when you start as our new designer.

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,370
Yes, of course, Manager.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,710
A music box?

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,450
It's my most prized possession.

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,880
It looks like an antique.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,250
When I was little, I couldn't sleep
without this little thing.

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,720
Now, when I can't sleep,

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,490
I play it instead of
taking a sleeping pill.

15
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,330
Like a lullaby?

16
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,810
What's wrong?

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,890
It's nothing.
I have a similar music box.

18
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,520
One that plays the exact same song.

19
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,060
What a coincidence.
You don't see many in this style.

20
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,900
I guess they were popular back then.

21
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,870
When I was a kid and I'd get fussy,

22
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,400
my mom would sing me
that same song as a lullaby.

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,140
She said it was the only way
I'd fall asleep.

24
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,310
I guess all moms are alike.

25
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,780
Even Chairman Gong?

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,650
She's a mother, after all.

27
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,890
(Episode 20)

28
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,290
It still doesn't feel like my room.

29
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,190
Even after 25 years,

30
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,030
Mom still hasn't come back.

31
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,940
Hush now, hush now, my sweet baby

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,880
- You're sleeping so soundly
- I love your lullabies, Mom.

33
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,680
Su A, can't you sleep?

34
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,260
Isn't that the thing
that plays music?

35
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,640
Is it the lullaby Young Sun
used to sing for you?

36
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,370
What's on your mind?

37
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,780
Young Chae.

38
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,010
You liked her even more than I did,
didn't you?

39
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,250
Let me.

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,190
But what about now?

41
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,620
Have you had...

42
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,190
a change of heart?

43
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,830
And why would my dear son
think that?

44
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,900
I'm starting to get worn out.

45
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,400
Even my own mother, whom I thought
was my biggest supporter,

46
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,010
is starting to look at Young Chae...

47
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,810
with disapproval.

48
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,420
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

49
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,940
No one can win against time.

50
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,840
I can see myself aging every day.

51
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,380
You're still beautiful.

52
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,050
No, you get more beautiful
every day.

53
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,750
You're lying.

54
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,290
I'm not lying.

55
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,360
I mean it.

56
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,860
In my eyes,

57
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,160
you're the most beautiful woman
in the world.

58
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,940
There's probably no man who can lie
as charmingly as you do.

59
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,780
About our future daughter-in-law...

60
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,980
Hasn't she passed the last test yet?

61
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,620
I thought it was.

62
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,320
But things just keep coming up.

63
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,020
She's innocent and graceful,

64
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,530
and very warm-hearted, that's true.

65
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,890
Something feels off, doesn't it?

66
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,030
Should we postpone the wedding?

67
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,770
Not just anyone would do that.

68
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,840
She wasn't even a close friend,

69
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,770
but you let her stay at your place,
gave her food, and clothes.

70
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,680
The more people have,
the more they want.

71
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,510
Their greed just grows and grows.

72
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,620
That must be what happened
with Cha Jung Won.

73
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
You poor thing.

74
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,330
Goodness. You must be upset.

75
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,240
You have such a comforting,
motherly scent.

76
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,610
I told you
we should postpone the wedding.

77
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,210
No.

78
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,510
Let's move it up.

79
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,810
The kids' wedding.

80
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,250
Why?

81
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,620
We should judge our daughter-in-law
for who she is and trust our gut.

82
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,090
That's the right thing to do.

83
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,460
These external matters...

84
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,090
are for us, the adults, to resolve.

85
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,860
Let's not make...

86
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,230
their lives any harder.

87
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,690
Gosh.

88
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,400
I wonder if Park Kyung Shin
is asleep.

89
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,630
Don't get any funny ideas.

90
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,000
Hey, we're on the same side.

91
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,770
It's not fair
to not even let me move.

92
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,600
It's unbelievable how relaxed he is.

93
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,100
Seriously, how can he sleep
after everything?

94
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,840
Young Chae and Park Kyung Shin
are sleeping like babies,

95
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,550
while we're just sitting here
wide awake.

96
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,880
I can't sleep.
How about a glass of wine?

97
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,750
No drinking on the job.
Stop bothering me and shut up.

98
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,990
Fine, suit yourself.

99
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,980
What a magnificent aroma!

100
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,550
It's like a party in my mouth.

101
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,790
Are instant noodles
against the rules too?

102
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,760
Maybe I'll just make one.

103
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,310
One's never enough.
Two packs are the only way to go!

104
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,360
Back when I was job hunting,
I was always hungry no matter what.

105
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,700
Whenever my allowance ran out,

106
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,100
I'd always get this weird craving
for instant noodles.

107
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,500
But it wasn't soju I wanted.

108
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,110
It was cheap convenience store wine.
I have no idea why I craved it.

109
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,850
Go on, have a taste.

110
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,980
Instant noodles
with fine wine like this?

111
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,720
It's a meal fit for a king.

112
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,590
I wouldn't trade it for anything.

113
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
I'm good.

114
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,060
All right, suit yourself.

115
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,600
Wait.

116
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,870
You'll get sick
if you fight your cravings.

117
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,900
We do all this just to put food
on the table.

118
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,680
Come on, you can't just have one.

119
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,820
Here. You've got to have
at least three glasses.

120
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,700
I told you, no funny business.

121
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,100
It's not for you.
The last glass is mine.

122
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,170
I'm going to savor every last drop.

123
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,550
You're not even going to ask
if I slept well?

124
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,580
Sit up straight.

125
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,230
Will this only end if I die?

126
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,730
Then just get it over with.

127
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,530
I just want to rest.

128
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,110
In my head,
I've killed you a dozen times over.

129
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,010
Stop with the act.

130
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,410
I'm losing the little pity
I had for you.

131
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,920
Hey, Joo Young Chae,
you're pitying me? That's rich.

132
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,150
Go ahead, ask anyone on the street.

133
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,090
Right now, between the two of us,

134
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,890
who do they think is more pathetic?

135
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,030
So you think I'm the pathetic one?

136
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,460
Yes.

137
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,800
Who are you to pity me?

138
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,200
Haven't you ever heard
of breakup etiquette?

139
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,310
How could you betray me?

140
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,010
Even love has an expiration date.

141
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,280
Your obsession
just made it expire sooner.

142
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,290
Take a look in the mirror.
Look at the state you're in.

143
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,220
It's pathetic.

144
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,130
The state I'm in right now?

145
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,430
I can't believe it myself.

146
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,130
This feels like a nightmare.

147
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,400
But Kyung Shin.

148
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,540
You don't get to feel sorry for me.

149
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,470
Your life...

150
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,110
is in my hands now.

151
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,170
Why didn't you answer your phone?
I was worried sick.

152
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,240
Kunhyang's youngest, Jin Se Mi,

153
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,810
saw Joo Ha Neul
and your dad together.

154
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,350
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
showed up then, too.

155
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,080
You've got to be kidding me.

156
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,620
Let me go!

157
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,820
We don't have time for this.

158
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,360
Noh Min Gu has escaped.

159
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,760
He escaped? Are you sure?

160
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,760
I searched the other rooms, but...

161
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,870
The number you have called
is unavailable.

162
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,170
You will be forwarded to voicemail.

163
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,900
That punk.

164
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,770
How dare he ignore my call?

165
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,480
CEO Joo...

166
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Drop the formality.

167
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,750
Vice Chairman Han asked...

168
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,750
if you and I were
planning to get married?

169
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,290
Did she?

170
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,860
Yes.

171
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,420
I gave her a vague answer.

172
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,390
As for your father,

173
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,060
I think we should
tell him the truth soon.

174
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,470
I'll handle it
before things get more complicated.

175
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,500
I'll do it.

176
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,140
Your dad is going to be
so disappointed.

177
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,480
Are you seriously worried
about my dad,

178
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,010
Cha Ki Beom, right now?

179
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,750
- You're worried?
- I don't want him to get hurt.

180
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,850
If we keep lying,

181
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,190
we'll have to pile on bigger lies.

182
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,760
It'll become a mountain of lies.

183
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,590
Is there anyone who doesn't lie?

184
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,430
No one.

185
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,700
But...

186
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,140
I just don't think a lie
should become a swamp.

187
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
A swamp?

188
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,310
You mean the more you struggle,

189
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,780
the deeper you sink into it?

190
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,480
At least, from one of the families,

191
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,120
you must get out
of this swamp of lies,

192
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Joo Young Chae.

193
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,300
You got drunk on just a bit of wine
and let that little rat get away?

194
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,630
Mom, that's enough.

195
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,100
It's not Manager Gu's fault.

196
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,440
That punk Noh Min Gu tricked him.

197
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,710
He's been through so much for us.

198
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,510
So why did you involve
a guy like that?

199
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,180
You think Noh Min Gu is just going
to keep his mouth shut?

200
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,250
That you're Joo Young Chae,
not Cha Jung Won,

201
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,120
and that you convinced him
into kidnapping Park Kyung Shin.

202
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,090
He's going to be blabbing it
all over town.

203
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,560
How are you going to deal with
the fallout from that?

204
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,160
I hated Park Kyung Shin so much
that I wanted to kill him.

205
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,030
But I couldn't do anything alone,
so what choice did I have?

206
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,030
My goodness. To think my daughter,
Joo Young Chae,

207
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,240
has turned into a ticking time bomb
that could go off at any moment?

208
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,940
I will handle this, Chairman.

209
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,550
- And how are you going to do that?
- Please, just leave it to me.

210
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,820
You get one chance to make up
for your mistake.

211
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,150
Don't you forget it!

212
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,060
Yes, Chairman.

213
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,570
This tofu's texture is like meat.
In fact, it's even better than meat!

214
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,910
Why don't you have some too?

215
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,440
Watching you enjoy your meal
is filling enough for me, Chairman.

216
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,880
You sound just like a grandma.

217
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,280
Right. You said it's because you're
possessed by a grandma's spirit.

218
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,820
Yes, ma'am, that's right.

219
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,220
Is she really all that?

220
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,390
How did she predict
that one of them would escape?

221
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,130
The old woman says,

222
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,230
- Go on.
- one is fated to be a fugitive,

223
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,100
and the other is fated to die.

224
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,740
I'm just the messenger
for what she says.

225
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,510
So, then...

226
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,340
Is the one who's fated to die...

227
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,980
a man or a woman?

228
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,650
Revealing heaven's secrets too often
will shorten my own life, Chairman.

229
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,490
For today, please enjoy your meal
and get your strength back.

230
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,620
I just gave you the money,
and this is what I get?

231
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,330
You want to get struck dead for
flashing money around like that?

232
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,630
It's always money with you!
I should break your wrist!

233
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Goodness!

234
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,500
I'm sorry, Grandma! I'm sorry!

235
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,810
I nearly choked on my tofu.

236
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,280
That startled me.

237
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,650
Gosh, seriously...

238
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,060
Goodness!

239
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,490
Are these my shoes?

240
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,330
Was he hiding them
as a surprise for me?

241
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,430
Wait, are these Ki Beom's?

242
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,300
These white shoes...

243
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,480
But you love white shoes.

244
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,950
- Try them on.
- What?

245
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,830
I only wore them to play guitar.
People would make fun of me now.

246
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,400
Who cares what they think?
What matters is what you think.

247
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,230
I like them too.

248
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,370
You do? And what about you?

249
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,700
I like them too.

250
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,740
You do?

251
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,310
Since you both like them,
I like them too.

252
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,280
Here you go.

253
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,190
I'm hungry. Get me some food.

254
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,960
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

255
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,590
You must've loved the white shoes
Han Young Sun picked.

256
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,590
You bought them behind my back.

257
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,000
What are you talking about?
I didn't buy them.

258
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,270
Have you been seeing
Han Young Sun again?

259
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,400
Why would I see her again?

260
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,200
Then did they fall from the sky
or pop out of the ground?

261
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,280
Look...

262
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,450
As a matter of fact,
they did fall from the sky. Why?

263
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,810
What are you saying?

264
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,050
Joo Ha Neul.

265
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,820
That kid with the hiccups...

266
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,790
gave them to me as a gift.

267
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,620
CEO Joo Ha Neul did?

268
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,120
Are you serious?

269
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,290
For goodness' sake.

270
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,390
- Hey.
- Goodness.

271
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,730
He said they were for me,
his future father-in-law.

272
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,530
He bought them for me
at the department store.

273
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,300
They're a really special gift, then.
What have I done?

274
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,000
And to think I treated them
so poorly...

275
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,280
That poor hiccuping boy.
He must be going through so much.

276
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,410
I'm hungry. Give me some food.

277
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,680
Whatever.

278
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,420
Did you find out
where Noh Min Gu is?

279
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,060
I have to go there right now.

280
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,270
Go on. Don't worry about me.

281
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,810
I won't leave Park Kyung Shin
and run away, Manager Gu.

282
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,410
You put a GPS tracker on me,
remember?

283
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,550
You've probably bugged me too,
haven't you?

284
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,290
Just stay here.

285
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,090
It's safer for you here.

286
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,390
I won't get you into trouble again.

287
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,130
Go catch Noh Min Gu.

288
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,470
Yes.

289
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,990
Noh Min Gu is at my house.

290
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,940
(From Joo Young Chae 1,
Noh Min Gu is at my house.)

291
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,050
Look at this...

292
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,480
The pitiful, penniless Cha Jung Won...

293
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,820
has really managed
to reinvent herself.

294
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,120
What are you doing here?

295
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,630
Gosh, listen to that attitude.

296
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,230
You're just like Joo Young Chae.

297
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,760
No, actually, you're way better
than her.

298
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,400
The person who worked with her
to hide Park Kyung Shin...

299
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
was you, wasn't it?

300
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,000
Where is Park Kyung Shin now?

301
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,770
Hey, why are you worried about him?
Joo Young Chae can handle it.

302
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,980
You...

303
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,580
Did Joo Young Chae cut you loose?

304
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,810
I wasn't sure who the prisoner was.

305
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,180
I barely made it out of there alive.

306
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,350
Escape?

307
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,720
Where were you?

308
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,590
I'm not telling you for free.

309
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
What do you want?

310
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,360
Help me get out of the country.

311
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,100
You want me to help
a criminal like you?

312
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,270
Look who's talking.

313
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,140
What about you?
You're nothing but a bundle of lies.

314
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,840
You're trying to steal her life
to marry into a rich family.

315
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,380
Do you think
you're pure as the driven snow?

316
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,550
Stop pretending you're a swan.

317
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,850
You're just a crow.

318
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,090
And if I refuse?

319
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
You insolent brat!
Are you out of your mind?

320
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,840
Are you trying to ruin this wedding?

321
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,640
Are you trying
to destroy our family?

322
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,260
(Kunhyang Group, Han Hye Ra)

323
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,530
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

324
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,970
(No Caller ID)

325
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Who is this?

326
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
Cha Jung Won?

327
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,350
If you refuse?

328
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,220
I've got nothing to lose.
I'm dead either way.

329
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,090
Then I'll take you down with me,
Cha Jung Won.

330
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,430
Darn it!

331
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,030
Do you just appear out of thin air?

332
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,940
You're everywhere at once.

333
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,470
You're acting like you're
Joo Young Chae's guardian angel.

334
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,510
CEO Joo Ha Neul.

335
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,810
Do you have a thing
for Cha Jung Won?

336
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,210
Shut up.

337
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,750
What's your game, Noh Min Gu?

338
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,220
Don't worry. I'm not here
to reminisce about some old flame.

339
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,320
Where are Young Chae
and Park Kyung Shin?

340
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,890
Darn it.

341
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,990
Why don't you ask...

342
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,190
your formidable mother,
Chairman Gong?

343
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,900
My mother has them both?

344
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,370
Goes to show you can't see
what's right under your nose.

345
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,340
I can't tell you where they are.

346
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,110
I don't have a death wish.

347
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,410
But...

348
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,810
if you help me flee the country,

349
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,580
I promise...

350
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,850
I'll never tell anyone
that Cha Jung Won is an impostor.

351
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,190
I'll take that secret to my grave.

352
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,070
We should report that scum
and have him locked up.

353
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,930
And how am I any different?

354
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,670
That's what Noh Min Gu said.

355
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,410
He asked whether I would still be
pure and innocent if I stole...

356
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,240
Young Chae's life to marry
into a rich family.

357
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,450
Get rid of Noh Min Gu for me.

358
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,650
Far away.

359
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,520
It's the only way I can truly live
as Joo Young Chae.

360
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,920
No...

361
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,760
It's the only way
I'll be able to breathe.

362
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,190
You want me to help him for you?

363
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,470
You're not scared anymore?

364
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,970
Not afraid at all?

365
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,500
I am scared.

366
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,170
I'm terrified.

367
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,310
But...

368
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,980
stronger than my fear...

369
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,880
is my desire to live...

370
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,380
as Joo Young Chae completely
and without anyone getting in my way.

371
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,050
Please, help me, Ha Neul.

372
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,790
(Kunhyang Group)

373
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,140
- It's pitch-black.
- Leave the lights off.

374
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,250
You're either fearless
or you're crazy.

375
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,620
One of the two.

376
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,590
To come all this way
to find me yourself.

377
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,560
And here I thought you were supposed
to be so gentle and kind.

378
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,400
Appearances can be deceiving.

379
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,610
Didn't that ever occur to you
that I could be even scarier...

380
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,280
than Chairman Gong Nan Sook?

381
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,650
You think this is going to scare me?

382
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,150
If you were to know
who I really was,

383
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,150
you'd probably pass out.

384
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,960
I know exactly who you are.

385
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,430
Cha Jung Won.

386
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,700
You're a daughter of Cha Ki Beom
and Jo Mi Hyang,

387
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,400
and you're the one
who kidnapped Park Kyung Shin.

388
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,270
You're wrong.

389
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,740
I am not Cha Jung Won.

390
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,080
Then who are you?

391
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,320
Who are you?

392
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,220
Joo Young Chae.

393
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,560
I'm the real daughter
of Gong Nan Sook.

394
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,660
I am Joo Young Chae.

395
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,240
(A Graceful Liar)

396
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,680
Do you know where this guy
Noh Min Gu is?

397
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,880
He's right under your nose.

398
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,680
He definitely said
Noh Min Gu was right under my nose.

399
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,680
Then it must be the company,
the house, or here.

400
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,990
Whether you break down the door...

401
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,220
or drill the lock, just open it now.

402
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,990
I know I shouldn't,

403
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,730
but I still want to get on.

404
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,660
Why? What's great about a swing?

405
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,600
You get to go so high.
It's like you have wings.

406
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,730
I'm sorry it was all a lie, Dad.

407
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,300
You're saying
you're not marrying Joo Ha Neul?

408
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,470
It was a lie.

409
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:03,310
CEO Joo and I never even dated,

410
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,640
let alone being engaged.

411
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,550
