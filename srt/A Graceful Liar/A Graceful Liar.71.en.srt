1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,170
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,340
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,650
Ladies, I need your help.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,750
To get through this crisis,

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,590
we need to sway the board,
but it's not easy.

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,420
So you want us to sway the board?

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,430
On what grounds?

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,990
Chairman Jin Tae Seok...

10
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,130
needs to step down,
even if it's just for a short while.

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,470
My thoughts exactly.

12
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,700
Does the Chairman know about this?

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,170
There's no way...

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,880
he'd willingly step down.

15
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,310
I know Kunhyang's image
has taken a hit lately,

16
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,310
but do we really need to threaten
the chairman's position?

17
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,650
If we can't have the best option,
we have to settle for the next best.

18
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,920
Okay, everyone,
let's think about this.

19
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,660
Our Kunhyang Association's heart
is the Kunhyang Group.

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,890
If we don't protect Kunhyang,
who will?

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,200
Am I right?

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,700
She's right. The stock's dropping,
which is a problem as it is.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,770
If we can't clean up
this mess properly,

24
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,010
all the charity work
the Kunhyang Association has built up,

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,280
and even our foundation's records,
could be ruined an instant.

26
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,110
Now, this is about...

27
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,750
all of us eating well
and living well.

28
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,560
Everyone,
loyalty is what defines us.

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,190
Let's be the ones to save
Kunhyang Group.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,660
Okay?

31
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,200
Let's do this! All right.

32
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,580
You look so much prettier.

33
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,960
You're a tough one to kill,
Cha Jung Won.

34
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,740
Dad tried to kill Cha Jung Won.

35
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,490
What's wrong?

36
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,960
I don't feel so good,
so I'm going to head out first.

37
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,510
How touching. Anyone would think
you two were married.

38
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,780
What are you doing here?

39
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,780
Se Mi asked me
to come with her, but...

40
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,290
- Where's Se Mi?
- Apparently, she changed her mind.

41
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,890
Since I was here,

42
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,620
I thought I'd stop by and see her.

43
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,770
I wished you would disappear.

44
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,370
But...

45
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,950
It's so boring
in the Design Team without you.

46
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,650
There are no designs to steal,

47
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,220
and it's driving me nuts,
so just wake up already.

48
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,570
Se Mi, what's wrong?

49
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,570
Did you get in trouble
with your mom?

50
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,980
You went to Cha Jung Won's hospital room,
didn't you?

51
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,950
Just for a quick visit.

52
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,880
Is that what this is about?

53
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,350
Why did you do it?

54
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,860
Do what?

55
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,060
I saw you.

56
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,500
I saw you press the pillow down
on Cha Jung Won's face.

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,770
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

58
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,700
Are you tired, Se Mi?

59
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,170
As a kid,

60
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,240
you'd cry about a monster
in the closet...

61
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,380
whenever you got sleepy.

62
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,610
I must have seen it wrong.

63
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,280
You would never do
something like that.

64
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,550
Of course not.

65
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,750
Right, Se Mi?

66
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,030
Your dad?

67
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,170
Why would your father do
something like that?

68
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,740
I wish I were just seeing things.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,710
I hate Cha Jung Won so much...

70
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,680
that I might have imagined it
without even realizing.

71
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,980
Mom,

72
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,850
I'm scared.

73
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,650
I hate Cha Jung Won.

74
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,520
- I hate her so much.
- How...

75
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,060
can I help?

76
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,590
I wish she would just disappear.

77
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,630
Forever.

78
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,230
Do you think it's because of me
that Dad tried to do...

79
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,070
something so horrible to her?

80
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,200
Se Mi.

81
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,840
You know how kind and wonderful
your father is.

82
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,350
Just like you know,
he's the best dad in the world.

83
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,460
Grandma.

84
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,900
Teaming up with Han Hye Ra
was the right move, wasn't it?

85
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,200
Why are you asking me?

86
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,100
Hasn't Grandma made an appearance?

87
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,600
Grandma is supposed
to be sleeping at this hour.

88
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,270
Chef Hong,

89
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,340
level with me.

90
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,210
There isn't a Grandma, is there?
It's always just been you, right?

91
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Why, you!

92
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,680
I'm so appalled that I'm wide awake now,
you little wench.

93
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,120
Goodness. I'm just getting confused!

94
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,490
Is that any reason to lose faith?
You wicked wench!

95
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,860
Grandma is enraged.

96
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,330
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,130
Let me ask just one thing.

98
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:08,000
That Cha Jung Won girl,
will she live or die?

99
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,300
She says her fate
hangs in the balance.

100
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,840
She says
it's up to the child's will to live.

101
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,910
Darn it,
even I could have said that.

102
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,450
One minute I believe,
the next I don't.

103
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,450
Why, you...

104
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,320
You have to have sharp ears,
don't you?

105
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,410
Come back.

106
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,380
Don't go any further.

107
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,920
Come to Mom.

108
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,340
Jung Won,

109
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,140
you need to wake up now.

110
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,310
That's the only way
you can hate me more...

111
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,020
and despise me.

112
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,680
(The Crown Capital)

113
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,350
I'm sure Jung Won will wake up soon.

114
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,790
Come on, Hye Ra.

115
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,160
Could you please stop
the fake crying?

116
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,130
You're giving me
a splitting headache.

117
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,100
I hate feeling this way.

118
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,730
What feeling is that?

119
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,040
That feeling
where you have what I don't.

120
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,810
It's a warm, fuzzy feeling,
like motherly love, but it stings...

121
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,740
Whatever it is, I hate it.

122
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,650
I much prefer to be
cool and detached.

123
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,550
That's right.
I forgot you're cold-blooded.

124
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,650
Talk about hypocrisy.

125
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,860
The Kunhyang Association
made its move.

126
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,060
The board meeting...

127
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,460
is going to go our way.
I'm sure of it.

128
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,630
"Our way?"

129
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,130
Gong Nan Sook and Han Hye Ra...

130
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
are a "we" now?

131
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,340
This feels so gross and weird.

132
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,240
Strange? It's downright unpleasant.

133
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,810
To think I have to team up
with a vulgar loan shark.

134
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,750
Hey, that's one thing
I can't stand being called.

135
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,850
But that's what you are.
A vulgar loan shark.

136
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,450
You're beginning to sound
just like me.

137
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,720
How annoying!

138
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,290
Tomorrow,

139
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,230
I'm doing an official interview.

140
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,140
Recently,

141
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,440
regarding the death of Cha Ki Beom,

142
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,440
there has been a lot of speculation,
hasn't there?

143
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,820
I'd like to take this opportunity
to set the record straight.

144
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,390
On the day of Cha Ki Beom's death,

145
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,260
I was at the scene.

146
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,000
That day,

147
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,000
we met on the stairs
of the Kunhyang Gallery,

148
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,470
and we had an argument.

149
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,340
As he tried to calm me,
Cha Ki Beom...

150
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,780
fell down the stairs.

151
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,280
It was an accident.

152
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,210
Are you saying
you pushed Cha Ki Beom?

153
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,650
What?

154
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,290
Hye Ra is giving an interview
at our house?

155
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,490
All right, keep me posted.

156
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,130
She didn't say a single word to me.

157
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,340
I saw
former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra...

158
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,940
and Chairman Gong Nan Sook meeting,
just the two of them.

159
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,570
Hye Ra and Gong Nan Sook?

160
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,780
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

161
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,050
I went to see Chairman Gong
last night.

162
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,660
"Our way?"

163
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,060
Gong Nan Sook and Han Hye Ra...

164
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,130
are a "we" now?

165
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,300
This feels so gross and weird.

166
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,200
Strange? It's downright unpleasant.

167
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:14,110
To think I have to team up
with a vulgar loan shark.

168
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,940
Tomorrow,

169
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,810
I'm doing an official interview.

170
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,850
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

171
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,560
What's your plot with Han Hye Ra?

172
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,320
Se Hoon.

173
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,960
Did you see something?

174
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,200
- You weren't listening, were you?
- I couldn't help but overhear.

175
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,570
What could make two sworn enemies
join forces?

176
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,840
What do you mean "join forces?"
That's absurd.

177
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,710
Why would I ever want to join forces
with Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra?

178
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,010
That frail woman was ousted
from her vice chairman seat.

179
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,580
You had better not have.

180
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,280
Han Hye Ra killed my mother.
I will never forgive her.

181
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,350
Of course.
You should never forgive her.

182
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,220
That's right. Of course.

183
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,790
And anyone who teams up
with someone like her...

184
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,330
is someone I can't forgive either.

185
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,130
Am I clear?

186
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,030
I do. Of course I do.

187
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,440
But between you and me,
there's Young Chae, and...

188
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,480
What's her name? A Reum!
We have A Reum, don't we?

189
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,150
Let's think about A Reum.

190
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,620
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

191
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,250
Something felt off.

192
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,120
I must first stop her interview.

193
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,560
Cha Ki Beom is my daughter's father.

194
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,130
Why would I want to hurt him?

195
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,360
I assure you
that it was an accident.

196
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,470
And then what?

197
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,300
What happened?

198
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,570
I don't know...

199
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,640
the precise details yet.

200
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,940
Because I had no choice
but to leave the scene.

201
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,680
You left the scene?

202
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,180
Leaving an injured man behind?

203
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,650
There was someone else...

204
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,720
at the scene.

205
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,990
I trusted that person
and left everything in their hands.

206
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,530
It was my mistake.

207
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,290
Who was it?

208
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,730
Was it...

209
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,600
Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

210
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,000
The exact details of the situation
have not yet been confirmed.

211
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,800
I will make sure
the truth comes out...

212
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,840
as soon as possible.

213
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,940
I will reveal everything...

214
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,940
that followed.

215
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,280
That's up to the authorities.

216
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,880
- Are you willing to cooperate?
- Of course.

217
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,590
If I deserve to be punished,
I will readily accept it.

218
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,960
Running from my responsibility
is something I will never do.

219
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,130
No...

220
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,770
I will uncover the truth myself.

221
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,780
What's going on?

222
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,450
Chairman Jin Tae Seok is coming now?

223
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,030
Jin Tae Seok is on the move.

224
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,500
We have to make sure
the interview gets published.

225
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,830
Manager Gu,
go to the Kunhyang house now.

226
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,440
- Ma'am?
- Go there...

227
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,710
and drag Reporter Ma here
before Jin Tae Seok gets to him.

228
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,170
Yes, ma'am.

229
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,450
Vice Chairman Joo? It's me.

230
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,420
You want me to stop Jin Tae Seok?

231
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,620
It's urgent.

232
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,750
Madam Gong,

233
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,390
why are you helping
former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra?

234
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,460
Helping her? Please.

235
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,300
In my book,
the only person I help is myself!

236
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,130
It's all for me,

237
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,170
but it's good for you
and good for Han Hye Ra too.

238
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,140
More importantly, Cha Jung Won
could wake up at any time.

239
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,840
What would she want most?

240
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,710
To clear her innocent father's name.

241
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,980
Exactly. Now get a move on.

242
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,780
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

243
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,110
Madam Gong...

244
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,930
Where is Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

245
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,600
With Se Hoon?

246
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,780
Reporter Ma, come with me quietly.

247
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,310
Why does Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

248
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,580
want to see me?

249
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,780
Just go with him quietly.

250
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,450
It's the only way we can avoid
Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

251
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,150
I'm sorry, but I'm completely lost.
What is going on?

252
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
Whatever story you're chasing,

253
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,690
the integrity you had
as a rookie journalist,

254
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,290
I'm asking you to find that again,
just this once.

255
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,660
I'm begging you.

256
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,810
There's no way
we can avoid Chairman Jin.

257
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,910
I know.

258
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,150
Not unless you have
an invisibility cloak.

259
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
Chairman!

260
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,800
- Vice Chairman Joo?
- Joo Ha Neul?

261
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,530
What brings you home at this hour?

262
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,470
Shouldn't you be at the office
right now?

263
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,240
Did former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
call you here?

264
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,720
It's very cold out.
Would you mind if I came in for tea?

265
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,830
You gave an interview?

266
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,400
Ever since I stepped down
as Vice Chairman,

267
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,870
I guess a lot of people were curious
about how I was doing.

268
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,270
I'm sure they were.
You're a celebrity, aren't you?

269
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,870
Your fashion, your daily life,
all of it.

270
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,410
I hope you didn't say anything
to harm Kunhyang.

271
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,540
Se Hoon.

272
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,110
I'm part of Kunhyang too.
Why would I do that?

273
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,580
Vice President Jin,
this concerns you too.

274
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,450
You and the Chairman must hear it.

275
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,220
It's about our partnership.

276
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
Let's go inside.

277
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,440
The lines are so sleek.

278
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,480
I'm such a genius. Props to me.

279
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,550
To hear you talk,
anyone would think you did it alone.

280
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,090
Designer Kim Sung Hee,
you did your part, too.

281
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,190
I'll give you that.

282
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,790
It's so bland.

283
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Where's the corsage I designed?

284
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,160
- That's what gave it its edge...
- Nope!

285
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,560
Don't talk to me about things
that lower productivity.

286
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,800
Maybe you can help out,
Joo Young Chae.

287
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,740
This is...

288
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,210
- Make the waist tighter.
- Okay.

289
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,460
What's going on?

290
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,990
You did that on purpose
because you hate me, didn't you?

291
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,730
Did you forget I'm pregnant?

292
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,660
It must be an accident.

293
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,060
She wouldn't have done it
on purpose.

294
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,230
I did it on purpose.

295
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,200
It's exactly what you did
to Jung Won.

296
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,740
Jung Won is in the ICU as we speak,

297
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,910
and I suddenly got so angry,
I just lost control.

298
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,240
What are you talking about?

299
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,510
I never intentionally poked
Jung Won.

300
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,410
- I saw it. You stabbed her.
- Darn it, shut up!

301
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,520
I honestly forgot you were pregnant.

302
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,550
Designer Kim Sung Hee.

304
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,760
This is not something
I can just overlook.

305
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,600
I don't know what came over me
for a moment.

306
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,800
It will never happen again.

307
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Director Jin.

308
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,170
As the team leader,
I share some of the responsibility.

309
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,400
I'll make sure nothing like this
happens again.

310
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,940
What?

311
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,940
How about a team dinner to bond?

312
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,010
So we can clear up
any misunderstandings.

313
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,980
- Yes.
- I'm not really in the mood...

314
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,760
What is it you want from me?

315
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,000
Are you trying to stop me
from publishing the article?

316
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,130
Then you'll have to pay me double,
no, triple what I was offered.

317
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,800
Why, you...

318
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,770
Listen to this punk.
He loves money more than I do.

319
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,510
If you act like that, it won't work.
Maybe I'll just publish the story.

320
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,870
Publish it right now, then.

321
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,270
What?

322
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,610
Do you have any idea
why I brought you here?

323
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,920
- Manager Gu, you tell him.
- Yes, ma'am.

324
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,790
But I don't know a single thing.

325
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,790
Get out.

326
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,390
Ma Sang Ki, come here and sit.

327
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,660
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

328
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,760
Open your laptop.

329
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,370
Start writing!

330
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,970
- What?
- Write Han Hye Ra's interview!

331
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,340
Write it now!

332
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,680
Look how slow you're typing.
Can't you go any faster?

333
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,050
You're suggesting Sky Question be
a subsidiary of Kunhyang?

334
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,990
Yes, I would like you
to consider it.

335
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,220
Without even discussing it with me,
your partner?

336
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,530
While I'm Vice Chairman at Kunhyang,

337
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,660
running another company
at the same time...

338
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,800
wouldn't be a good look
to the public.

339
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,830
It could also be misconstrued as me
looking out for my own gain.

340
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,540
You just want to drop the "interim"
from your title.

341
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,170
You think anyone is foolish enough
not to know that's what you want?

342
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,310
Go on.

343
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,810
If it's a Kunhyang Group subsidiary,
we can appoint a professional CEO.

344
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,280
And for the time being,
even as an interim,

345
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,050
I want to focus solely
on my duties as Vice Chairman.

346
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,150
- It's worth considering.
- Chairman!

347
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,290
It will also greatly contribute...

348
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,190
to Kunhyang's future business
competitiveness.

349
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,490
Let me think about it some more.

350
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,160
Se Hoon, stop getting so worked up.
I'm the one who makes the decisions.

351
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,170
Why now, of all times?

352
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,100
Why are you cornering me
and the Chairman with business talk?

353
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,200
Don't you have some other motive?

354
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,740
You're one to talk,
Vice President Jin.

355
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,780
Instead of just reflexively
opposing everything I do,

356
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,580
I'd like us to discuss the future
of Kunhyang together.

357
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,590
This is how men grow.
By butting heads.

("New: Marinated LA Short Ribs")

360
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,870
What's good here
that we'll be raving about later?

361
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,100
Wait. This is where we came
for our work dinner last time, right?

362
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,710
That's right.
The one Cha Jung Won's mother runs.

363
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,540
That smells delicious.

364
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,150
Director Jin, let's get some meat.
I can't resist a smell like this.

365

(Damga Charcoal Grill)

366
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,650
Ma'am, we're here!

367
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,550
Welcome, everyone.

368
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,460
It would've been so nice
if our Jung Won could have come too.

369
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,190
You must be so worried.

370
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,900
I'm sure Jung Won will wake up soon.

371
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,170
Thank you.
Please, order anything you want.

372
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,600
What should we get today?

(Damga Charcoal Grill)

374
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,910
Our new special is a huge hit.

375
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,820
This is so good.

(Damga Charcoal Grill)

377
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,860
You came? I didn't think you would.

378
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,590
This place again?

379
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,560
Is this the only restaurant in town?

380
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,260
Don't knock it till you try it.
It just melts in your mouth.

381
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,800
I thought you said
you were on a diet.

382
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,430
I'm starting tomorrow, okay?

383
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,670
Good call, Team Leader Ahn.
You're very wise.

384
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,060
Joo Young Chae, are you sure
you should be drinking?

385
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,200
Gosh, I thought this was water.
I only had a tiny sip.

386
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,470
And after all that bragging
about being pregnant...

387
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,570
That shameless little brat.

388
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,140
Is she even really pregnant?

389
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,410
Maybe she's lying
about the whole thing.

(Jin Se Hoon)

391
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,820
What?

392
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,490
What's this?

393
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,460
Se Hoon,
did you cook all this for me?

394
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,930
It looks delicious.

395
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,060
It's for A Reum.

396
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,380
It's delicious. I'll give you that.

397
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
You don't like it?

398
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,120
A man who can cook is so sexy.

399
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,720
I don't just cook for anyone,
you know.

400
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,590
I'm telling you,
it's really delicious.

401
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,730
Right. That's good.

402
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,700
I'm glad A Reum seems to like it.

403
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,340
It's okay.

404
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,100
For now, A Reum comes first,

405
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,080
but Se Hoon is starting to open up
to me too.

406
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,120
Well, isn't this nice?

407
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,320
Father, would you like to join us?

408
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,490
I'm a father-in-law
who can take a hint.

409
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,600
Young Chae, after you finish eating,
let's talk in my study for a bit.

410
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,300
Yes, Father.

411
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,120
What do you mean
you couldn't find it?

412
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,890
The video with the full story
of the Cha Ki Beom incident?

413
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,590
I searched her house and office,
but it's not there.

414
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,130
This is a problem, Joo Young Chae!

415
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,830
Father, I think you startled A Reum.

416
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,130
I'm starting to feel some cramping.

417
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,570
I'll give you a few more days.

418
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,070
But I won't wait long.

419
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,450
Take down Chairman Jin Tae Seok
at the board meeting?

420
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,820
You, me, and Han Hye Ra.

421
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,690
The three of us should be enough,
don't you think?

422
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,750
Se Hoon will side with
Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

423
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,760
He's just trying
to save his own skin.

424
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,930
Even if we team up, it's difficult
to take down Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

425
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,130
It'd be perfect if Han Hye Ra's interview
sways opinion,

426
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,170
but it's an all-or-nothing gamble.

427
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,580
How could Chairman Jin Tae Seok
have possibly known...

428
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,920
about the secret interview
we planned...

429
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,720
in my own study?

430
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,660
Hye Ra, don't you trust me?

431
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,460
I'm a little hurt you'd even ask.

432
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,500
If I can't trust you, Min Jung,
who can I trust?

433
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,370
I'll prepare for the board meeting
meticulously.

434
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,450
Doctor!

435
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,050
Cha Jung Won moved her hand!
Please, come quickly!

436
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,880
("Han Hye Ra admits she was there
for the first time!")

437

("Claims Cha Ki Beom fell
by accident")

438
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,280
("I will cooperate
with the investigation.")

439
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,480
("I have nothing to hide.")

(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

442
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,530
(Admits to leaving the scene
in someone else's care.)

443
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,300
So, what's on the agenda
for today's board meeting?

444
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,600
The damage
to Kunhyang Group's image,

445
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,970
and what to do about Han Hye Ra,
who was behind the interview.

446
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,010
- That's the discussion...
- No.

447
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,110
We're here to expose
everything you've done...

448
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,280
and how far you've dragged down
Kunhyang Group.

449
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,480
That's what this meeting is about.

450
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,320
So, it's a showdown to see who wins.

451
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,560
I love watching a good fight.
Time to get the popcorn.

452
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,180
(A Graceful Liar)

453
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,700
Former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra,
you will retract your interview.

454
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,840
And Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul,
you will resign immediately.

455
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,640
The one who murdered...

456
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,780
Joo Ha Neul's biological father,
Joo Sang Cheol,

457
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,040
is none other than
Chairman Jin Tae Seok himself.

458
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,510
Are you telling me to step down
as chairman?

459
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,550
That's right.

460
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,480
You've made Chairman Jin Tae Seok
into an enemy.

461
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,790
You must prepare
for his retaliation.

462
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,120
You're saying Chairman Jin Tae Seok
will try to kill me again?

463
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,420
Anything that doesn't bend breaks.

464
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,290
It's okay to hide behind me now.

465
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,860
Then I guess I'll have to die again.

466
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,400
Pity complicates things.

467
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,730
I should've killed
Cha Jung Won then.
