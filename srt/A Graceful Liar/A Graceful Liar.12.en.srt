00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,210
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,210
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,080
(Episode 12)

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,800
(Jin Se Hoon)

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,230
(Jin Se Hoon)

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,770
Do we really have to go this far?

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,870
If you're really not up for it,
you can just leave.

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,070
I'll make something up.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Let's go in.

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,650
Hey, what are you doing?

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,080
We're supposed
to get married, right?

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,620
We have to at least look the part.

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,370
Oh, my! Come on in.

15
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,940
Oh, hi. Hello.

16
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,070
Don't worry,
I'm not some stuffy old prude.

17
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,980
When? I'm sorry, what?

18
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,190
Did you grow up overseas
or something?

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,120
Why can't you
give a straight answer?

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,690
When are you getting married?

21
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,930
Dad, why are you overreacting?
We're not that serious yet.

22
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,600
Then why are you two
joined at the hip?

23
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
Why did you accept
the five-carat diamond?

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,770
Well...

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,970
Well, what?

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
You tell me.

27
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,680
We're just getting to know
each other.

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,480
So you're "just getting to know
each other" again? Is that it?

29
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,280
- You want me to give you a lesson?
- No.

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
Dad!

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,350
Jung Won, get your head on straight!

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,820
You should get a grip yourself.
Have you lost your mind?

33
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,820
Why aren't you acting like yourself?
You always said she was precious,

34
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,860
and you never once
laid a hand on her.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,760
How can I not be losing my mind
right now?

36
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,830
A girl should not run around
with this guy and that guy.

37
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,600
I'm not just some random guy!

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,270
- What?
- I'm going to marry Jung Won.

39
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,710
Now, that's more like it.
I knew you'd say that all along.

40
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,880
Hey, you...

41
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,780
Go bring us some drinks.

42
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,110
What? We just finished dinner.

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,220
I said go get them, so go get them.

44
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,430
She's not back yet?

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Is she asleep?

46
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,780
- The number you dialed...
- What?

47
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,680
is unavailable. Please leave
a message after the tone.

48
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,520
Joo Young Chae is at it again.
Is this her femme fatale act?

49
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,060
Why would you say
we're getting married?

50
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,460
Tell me about it.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,360
I'm sorry. You went through
a lot because of me,

52
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,040
and I know meeting my dad again
couldn't have been easy.

53
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Do you know
that lies come in different colors?

54
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,510
I do.

55
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,510
A black lie...

56
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,550
is a lie told with malicious intent.

57
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,090
A red lie...

58
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,160
is dangerous...

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,320
like hiding a crime.

60
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,730
A gray lie...

61
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,530
is when you don't want
to go to work,

62
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,030
so you say you feel a little sick.

63
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,530
Something like that, right?

64
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,600
Right. It's a mix of truth and lies.

65
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,840
- And then there's a white lie.
- A well-intentioned lie.

66
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,110
Like the lie you told today?

67
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,680
I didn't want to make
things difficult...

68
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,820
for you...

69
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,650
or for your father.

70
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,720
No,

71
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,530
I just didn't want
to see you get hurt.

72
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,440
What color do you think...

73
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,540
the lies I tell are?

74
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,450
They're nothing but black lies.

75
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,750
I was afraid my dad
would get hurt today,

76
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,790
but that's just an excuse.

77
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,360
If it's too hard,

78
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,830
you can just stop lying.

79
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,570
- But if I stop here...
- I told you before.

80
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,740
As long as I can see this
through to the end,

81
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,470
I don't care if it's all fake.

82
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,680
She is a Ripley, without a doubt.

83
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,680
A liar who passed off...

84
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,350
her friend's name and life
as her own.

85
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,860
If only she were a shameless,
wicked Ripley and nothing more,

86
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,290
it would've been so much easier...

87
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,630
because then I could
just despise her.

88
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,600
Seeing her makes me angry.

89
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,730
And it hurts.

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,070
When I see her,

91
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,770
I want to...

92
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,770
to reach out to her.

93
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,780
You're drunk.

94
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,850
Let's call it a night, Young Chae.

95
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,620
So what color lie is this one?

96
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,990
Ha Neul?

97
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,740
I feel a bit better.

98
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,350
What kind of brother
didn’t even catch his sister...

99
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,750
when she was about to fall?

100
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,220
Joo Young Chae.

101
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,990
Stumbling drunk is not a good look.
Walk straight.

102
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,930
You're so mean.

103
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,600
This is how real siblings talk.

104
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,430
Hey, wait for me!

105
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,040
Hurry up before I ditch you.

106
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,810
Ditch me?

107
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,810
You know how much
I hate that word...

108
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,260
You're just plain mean, Ha Neul.

109
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,030
I'm going to run to the pharmacy.

110
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,440
They'll all be closed by now.

111
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,550
- What's this for?
- For your cut. Tie it on.

112
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,120
It's that handkerchief again.

113
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,160
It's not like I asked for your help.

114
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,270
Is that any way
to treat your sister?

115
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,640
Go to a hospital, then.

116
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,340
For a little scrape?
Don't be ridiculous.

117
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,480
Fair enough.

118
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,580
- You could at least get me a taxi.
- A taxi? We're right here.

119
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,980
Or you could give me
a piggyback ride.

120
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,290
What?

121
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,890
Or just ditch me.

122
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,940
Are you really leaving?

123
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,270
Just like that?

124
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,380
What are you waiting for? Get on.

125
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,530
You're so warm.

126
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,630
Thank you, CEO Joo.

127
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,130
I mean...

128
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,200
Ha Neul.

129
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,410
Are you asleep?

130
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,550
Young Chae? Are you asleep?

131
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,190
Aren't you going to sing her
a lullaby?

132
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Se Hoon? What are you doing here?

133
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,630
What am I doing here?

134
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,540
That's not really a question for me,

135
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,270
considering I am
at my fiancée's house.

136
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,070
I'm the one
who should be asking you.

137
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,410
What's going on here?

138
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,380
I mean, how could you...

139
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,350
give your thirty-something sister
a piggyback ride?

140
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,720
She had a little too much to drink
and scraped her knee.

141
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,590
What? She's hurt?

142
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,060
Hey! What are you doing?
Get her on my back!

143
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,770
You can go now.

144
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,440
I'll take Young Chae home.

145
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,220
What was that about?

146
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,120
Felt like my girl was just snatched
right from under me.

147
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,090
Get a grip, Joo Ha Neul.

148
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,910
- Se Hoon.
- Just stay still.

149
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,650
CEO Joo, I mean...

150
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,080
Where's Ha Neul?

151
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:48,590
Why did you ignore my calls
to drink with your brother?

152
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,890
I'm not just some random guy!

153
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,060
- What?
- I'm going to marry Jung Won.

154
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,170
And how much did you have to drink
to end up scraping your knee?

155
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,470
Why aren't you answering me?

156
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,940
- Answer my question...
- So I can't drink with my brother?

157
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,440
What is it, Se Hoon? Do you own me?

158
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,780
Once we're married,

159
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,180
are you planning
to just lock me up in the house?

160
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
No...

161
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,820
That's not it. It's just...

162
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,520
It felt wrong.

163
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,430
Someone is jealous here.

164
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,000
I’m going crazy, Joo Young Chae,

165
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,440
- because I love you.
- You're driving me crazy, too.

166
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
Because you're just so adorable.

167
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,270
Su A...

168
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,240
When you abandoned her 25 years ago,

169
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,710
she was as good as dead to you.

170
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,610
You can’t grieve for her...

171
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,440
after showing up only now.

172
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,580
I didn't abandon her.

173
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,020
I was going to come back for her.

174
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,190
Once I get Tae Seok's permission,

175
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,960
I'll go get you.

176
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,530
Tae Seok...

177
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,990
will accept Su A, too.

178
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,830
After all, she's my daughter.

179
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,620
What about Su A?

180
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,590
Tae Seok.

181
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,060
My Su A...

182
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,370
She's gone.

183
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,940
What do you mean, she's gone?

184
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,270
Please, just tell me what happened.

185
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,540
You said you left her with a woman
named Jo Mi Hyang, right?

186
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,140
Yes.

187
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,410
I went there, but nobody was home.

188
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,390
- They could've just moved.
- I have my men looking into it.

189
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,960
You can't be moving around yet.

190
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,890
It was a bad accident.

191
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,430
Ms. Han Young Sun,
how are you feeling?

192
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,300
Doctor.

193
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,230
When will I be able to...

194
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,570
walk again?

195
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,940
You had a depressed
frontal bone fracture...

196
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,210
and an orbital bone fracture
along with severe damage to your chest.

197
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,240
You've undergone three surgeries.

198
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,850
Recovery will take
more than six months.

199
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,850
Doctor, please, you have to
help me get better.

200
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,580
I have something I need to do.

201
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,280
We'll do everything we can.

202
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,090
But your top priority
right now is to rest.

203
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,620
I've given you a sedative,
so please get some rest.

204
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,630
Tae Seok, I have to find Su A.

205
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,700
- I'll go myself...
- You need to focus...

206
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,870
on getting better.

207
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,740
I'll find Su A, whatever it takes.

208
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,570
You trust me, right?

209
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,890
Cha Ki Beom has refused your visit.

210
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,960
I have to see him.

211
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,770
He knows where my daughter is.
Please, you have to let me see him.

212
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,970
I'm sorry, ma'am.

213
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,770
Then please give him this message.

214
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,600
He'll probably refuse again.

215
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,140
Please just ask him
where our Su A is.

216
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,740
I'm begging you. Just tell him that.

217
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,980
I suggest you don't come back again.

218
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,910
Goodbye, ma'am.

219
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,950
Su A...

220
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,590
(Cha Su A. May you be free from pain
and play to your heart's content.)

221
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,760
So back then, our Su A...

222
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,230
was already gone?

223
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,170
A car accident...

224
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,710
How could
something like that happen?

225
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,710
That's what Mi Hyang told me.

226
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,250
Our Su A,

227
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,550
right up until the day
of the accident,

228
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,620
spent every single day,
all day, by the door,

229
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,790
just waiting.

230
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,160
She was convinced her mom
was coming for her.

231
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,330
And on that day,

232
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,760
she thought she saw someone like you
in a car,

233
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,230
and she ran after it...

234
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,940
Su A...

235
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,910
Forget about Su A now.

236
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
Erase her.

237
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,880
- And let go of your guilt.
- My guilt?

238
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,290
You're right.

239
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
I'm so sorry for Su A.
My heart aches.

240
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,120
It's absolutely tearing me apart.

241
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,660
But you...

242
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,360
What you did to her is unforgivable.

243
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,430
What?

244
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,830
- Unforgivable?
- If you hadn't become a murderer...

245
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,900
I'm innocent.

246
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,840
You know that very well, don't you?

247
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,170
That I'm not capable
of such a thing.

248
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,070
Then you should have told the truth.

249
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,940
Why did you go to prison?

250
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,810
You should've done anything
to protect Su A!

251
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,150
You're the one
who failed to protect her!

252
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,250
The moment I went to prison,

253
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,090
you callously abandoned that child
and ran off.

254
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,790
A car accident, you say?
You couldn't move for months?

255
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,300
Stop it. Just stop.

256
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,070
You didn't care that I was innocent,
did you?

257
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,540
You wanted to dump your kid
and leave a loser like me,

258
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,440
so you could live the good life
with your new husband?

259
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,910
You're right.

260
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,250
Such a twisted fate.

261
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,790
I made a clean break.

262
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,940
What's that smell?
Something's fishy.

263
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,400
Is it flowers or grass?

264
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,940
What's this?

265
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,280
Ki Beom.

266
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,480
Is he cheating on me?

267
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,600
Are you hurting?

268
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm having a hard time too, girl.

269
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,370
So is he really having an affair?

270
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,610
What am I going to do?

271
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,650
(Incorrect Passcode)

272
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,050
He said he didn't want
to change the password

273
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,420
because he was forgetful.

274
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,750
But when did he change it?

275
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,660
Oh, no.

276
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,600
Over my dead body.

277
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,430
I won't stand for this.

278
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,400
After all the years I've dedicated
to Ki Beom?

279
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,570
Does he really think
I'm just going to let this slide?

280
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,020
Unbelievable.

281
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,360
It's so hot.

282
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,030
Did you change the password
for the house again?

283
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,260
I bought this house for my daughter,

284
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,330
but why do you keep changing it
on a whim? You insolent brat.

285
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,670
Respect your grown daughter's privacy,
Chairman Gong.

286
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,640
I don't have much time.
I must meet my future mother-in-law.

287
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,780
So, I should just get to the point,
is that it?

288
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,820
Stay away
from all official functions.

289
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,420
I said not to take any pictures,
and not to let anyone take yours.

290
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,190
What are you, a teenager?
Rebelling against me like this?

291
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,900
I didn't realize
my picture was being taken.

292
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,700
You didn't know? You sly little fox.

293
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,470
Do you think
I can't see right through you?

294
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,340
At these official events,

295
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,270
you want to pass as Joo Young Chae,
don't you?

296
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
Chairman Gong...

297
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,080
I mean, wouldn't that be better
for you, Mother?

298
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,880
So, why are you so upset?

299
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,560
(Kunhyang)

300
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,420
Check the Crown Capital's
stock charts,

301
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,490
not to mention Kunhyang Group.

302
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,430
They've skyrocketed
in just a few days.

303
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,440
As if some stupid stock chart matters.

304
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,270
You don't really think it's stupid,
do you?

305
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,480
Every time my face gets posted
on social media,

306
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,810
the Crown Capital's prestige grows.

307
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,880
It won't be long before it's on par
with Kunhyang Group.

308
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,550
Mom.

309
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,120
Don't get cocky
over a stroke of luck.

310
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,720
There's nothing to be proud of.

311
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,190
One wrong move, and it's not just
your reputation that'll be ruined,

312
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,530
and mine too.
It's just a matter of time.

313
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
And one more thing.

314
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Cha Ki Beom.

315
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,170
Remember that your father's life
is in my hands.

316
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,450
Chairman, you've come all the way
to the Vice Chairman's office.

317
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,950
You could have just summoned me
to your office if you needed me.

318
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,520
You're not quite up to
a full schedule yet.

319
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,190
You don't really need to attend
the board meeting.

320
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,330
I can't just do
whatever I feel like.

321
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,030
Besides, I'm feeling much better.

322
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,330
About the other day.

323
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,940
What exactly did you do that had you
sick in bed all that time?

324
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,180
We'll talk later.

325
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,710
This isn't the place to discuss it.

326
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,750
So something did happen, then?

327
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,880
Thank you for understanding.

328
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,860
I do have something
that might cheer you up.

329
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,730
(Kunhyang Heir's Fiancée is
Designer Joo Young Chae...)

330
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,630
(Cozy Date Photos at Auction
Going Viral on Social Media)

331
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,170
Our daughter-in-law is
quite the influencer.

332
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,740
Every move she makes,
Kunhyang's stock prices go up.

333
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,280
She really is a lucky charm.

334
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,080
She said she's coming over
tonight, right?

335
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,350
- Yes.
- What a shame!

336
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,850
I have an important meeting.

337
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,550
I'm actually glad
you won't be there.

338
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,320
That means I get to have
our dear daughter-in-law all to myself.

339
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,930
The use of perspective is so unique.

340
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,630
From a distance, it's so serene,

341
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,840
but up close, the brushwork
is just so delicate.

342
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,240
How did you know I love
this artist's style so much?

343
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,850
I didn't know.

344
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,280
- What?
- I bought it...

345
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
because it's one I love.

346
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,820
- Then Vice Chairman Han...
- Mother.

347
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,360
Yes, Mother, I just had a feeling
you'd like it.

348
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,560
Since you appreciate my art.

349
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,830
This is better than any medicine,

350
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,260
or any doctor.

351
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,930
This painting you gave me
is the best cure of all.

352
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,170
Seeing you so happy
makes me happy too, Mother.

353
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,240
That reminds me.
You like fashion shows, don't you?

354
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,710
Of course.

355
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,080
It's my dream to have my own brand.

356
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,950
Then you are cordially invited
to the Kunhyang Fashion show.

357
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,690
I'm so excited.

358
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,820
You're my personal ray of sunshine.

359
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,660
I have to make you part
of our family soon.

360
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,090
I can't wait
to be your daughter-in-law either.

361
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Really?

362
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,100
You can't wait to marry me?

363
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,800
Becoming your mother's daughter-in-law
comes first.

364
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,610
Looks like someone's about
to burst with jealousy.

365
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,480
Being my mother doesn't
get you off the hook.

366
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,310
Joo Young Chae is supposed...

367
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,650
to only have eyes for me
and only smile for me.

368
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,620
Only we can
exchange loving glances...

369
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,350
- Let's go.
- Hey, where are you going?

370
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,820
Our dear daughter-in-law is hungry.
Time to eat.

371
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,400
Oh my!

372
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,470
A special dish for you,
Chairman Gong.

373
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,600
This should help you
regain your strength.

374
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,510
Thank you, Chef Hong.

375
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,010
Long time no see, Chef Hong.

376
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,710
CEO Joo, are you a parking ticket?

377
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,250
A parking ticket?

378
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,280
You've got "fine" all over you.

379
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,350
Right.

380
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:53,020
Chef Hong, how are your dad jokes
so consistently unfunny?

381
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,290
I'll work on it.

382
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,230
Good grief.

383
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,700
This broth is so rich.

384
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,770
Thank you.
Please call on me anytime.

385
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,700
Until next time, Chef Hong.

386
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,440
Are you going to stare
at that tablet at the dinner table?

387
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,150
You're the one who needs
to see this, Mother.

388
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
What is it?

389
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,620
(Kunhyang Heir's Fiancée is
Designer Joo Young Chae...)

390
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,150
(Cozy Date Photos at Auction
Going Viral on Social Media)

391
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,430
That Cha Jung Won girl is becoming
more trouble than she's worth.

392
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,070
Actually, she's been a huge asset
to our family so far.

393
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,800
It's a good thing
if this is just pure luck,

394
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,070
but what if it's not?

395
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,340
Are you suggesting Cha Jung Won
is doing this intentionally?

396
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,610
If that's the case,

397
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,620
wouldn't that be more
of a survival instinct...

398
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,950
than a premeditated plan?

399
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,220
So if the whole world knows her
as Joo Young Chae,

400
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,790
she thinks I can't make her disappear
without a trace?

401
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,100
And what if I end up needing her
to continue the business with Kunhyang?

402
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,430
Then I guess you'll have a choice
to make, Mother.

403
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,040
My daughter, Joo Young Chae,
or Cha Jung Won playing my daughter?

404
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,040
I hope it doesn't come to that.

405
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,150
I've lost my appetite.

406
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,850
Hey! What do you mean
you've lost your appetite?

407
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,290
(Incoming Call)

408
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Hello?

409
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,360
Young Chae?

410
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,170
Young Chae! Hey, Joo Young Chae.

411
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,870
Mom, it's me.

412
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Where are you?

413
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,270
I'm still in Milan.

414
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,040
At least you're alive.

415
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,640
What's with your voice?

416
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,550
Aren't you happy to hear
your daughter is alive?

417
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,850
Why wouldn't I be?
Of course, I'm happy.

418
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,620
Then why do you sound
so unenthusiastic?

419
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,850
Maybe I shouldn't come back, then.

420
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,520
Of course you have to come back...

421
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
when the time is right.

422
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,130
The time?

423
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,830
Is there a wrong time
for me to come back?

424
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,400
Don't be ridiculous.

425
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,570
Do you have enough money?

426
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
I'm running low.

427
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,170
I'll wire you plenty.

428
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,410
Whether it’s Milan or Paris,
go wherever you want.

429
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,740
And do whatever you want.

430
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,710
I'm in the middle of dinner
right now.

431
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,750
Chef Hong made me
his special abalone short rib soup.

432
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,950
I'll wire you the money
right after I'm done eating.

433
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,430
That should buy me some time.

434
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,340
What was that about?

435
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,870
She didn't even tell me to lie low.

436
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,980
Hey, watch the models, not me.

437
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,350
I am.

438
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,060
All right.

439
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,450
Not bad.

440
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,000
Park Kyung Shin?

441
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,650
(A Graceful Liar)

442
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,110
You've got some nerve
showing your face here.

443
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,580
Do you have a death wish?

444
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,940
I deserve to die for what I've done.

445
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,250
A love worth dying for?

446
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,550
Why would you put Park Kyung Shin
on stage at a time like this?

447
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:27,290
To see if Joo Young Chae is truly worthy
of being my son's partner.

448
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,690
That's what I wanted to find out.

449
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,960
Jung Won.

450
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,530
I'll deal with Park Kyung Shin first,
then I'll take back my life.

451
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,260
Just you wait.

452
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,570
I'll admit Jin Se Hoon is my type.

453
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,070
