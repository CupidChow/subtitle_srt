(in this drama are fictional.)

(This production followed

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,420
- Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,390
- Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,930
- Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,930
- Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,440
- Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,640
- Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,480
- Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,450
May I...

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,190
love you?

13
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,580
Jung Won.

14
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,820
(Episode 60)

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,090
Jung Won, what's wrong?

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,860
Was my confession too much for you?

17
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,760
I was touched.

18
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,300
And I've been waiting
to hear you say that.

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
But?

20
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,370
I...

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,010
don't deserve your love.

22
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,370
What?

23
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,680
I was Se Hoon's wife.

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,580
I married him while pretending
to be Joo Young Chae.

25
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,420
After what I've done,

26
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,950
how could I possibly
accept your love?

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,320
Is that news to me?

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
I know all of it.

29
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,630
I've watched you suffer for so long.

30
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,600
I was even angry with myself
for not being able to stop you.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,570
The life I've lived...

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,300
and the life I have ahead of me.

33
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,270
It's a thorny path.

34
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,580
Just being with me...

35
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,180
will be difficult
and weigh you down.

36
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,720
It's hard for me
to even love myself.

37
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,490
So why would you?

38
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,520
Don't be ridiculous.

39
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,860
You have no idea how beautiful
and radiant you are.

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,010
Just looking at you
brings tears to my eyes.

41
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,540
Why does someone as lovely as you
have to suffer so much?

42
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,180
- A person this kind...
- I'm not kind.

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,350
And I'm not lovely either.

44
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,660
I wanted to soar as high as I could.

45
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,690
I was drowning in a sea of lies.

46
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,360
For that sin,

47
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,870
I lost my dad.

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,970
I don't want to lose you too.

49
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,950
I even loved your lies.

50
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,650
I prayed you'd find your way back
to your true self. And now you have.

51
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,120
Cha Jung Won.

52
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,920
Be my woman.

53
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,170
Just give me a little time.

54
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,440
Don't make me wait too long.

55
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,280
I've already waited long enough.

56
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,670
Chairman Jin.

57
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,150
You and Se Hoon are over, right?

58
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,350
Yes.

59
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,260
I've noticed CEO Joo Ha Neul
is quite fond of you.

60
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,760
- He's a good person.
- Is that all?

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,740
That's all it had better be.

62
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,970
Why do you think
I'm letting you off the hook...

63
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,610
when I know
you're Hye Ra's daughter?

64
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,480
Although I'm such a pain,

65
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,810
if something were to happen to me,

66
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,380
you know it would hurt
Vice Chairman Han.

67
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,390
That's right.
That's how much I love Hye Ra.

68
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,920
But the thing is,

69
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,820
I guess I'm a father too.

70
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,860
My daughter, Se Mi,

71
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:27,230
is so in love with CEO Joo Ha Neul
that she cries to me about him.

72
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,640
And when a father
sees his daughter cry,

73
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,870
it breaks his heart.

74
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,540
I think I deserve to be loved
by a good person...

75
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,110
- and to give my heart to someone.
- Give it up.

76
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,650
You can't tell me
who to love, Chairman.

77
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,650
What if I decide to make
Joo Ha Neul pay?

78
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,390
Joo Ha Neul isn't even
Gong Nan Sook's biological son.

79
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,760
If I set my mind to it,
I can hurt him anytime, right?

80
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,660
So if my feelings for Ha Neul
continue to grow,

81
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,440
- you're going to hurt him?
- You catch on quick.

82
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,790
Did Ha Neul confess his feelings?

83
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,260
Does nothing stay private
in this family?

84
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,990
So he did.

85
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,130
It must have been so moving
that you're even in tears.

86
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,200
Did you agree to start seeing him?

87
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,100
It hasn't even been that long
since you and I broke up.

88
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,570
How can I start dating
someone new already?

89
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,840
Really? Are you going to...

90
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,510
turn him down?

91
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,880
I don't have the luxury
for games like love right now.

92
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,450
It's a luxury.

93
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,450
Right. It is a luxury.

94
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,120
It's not right for us
to be alone together.

95
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,190
Please leave me alone.

96
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,490
All right.

97
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,170
What are you doing here?

98
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,840
We're married.
And still newlyweds, mind you.

99
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,340
- So it's natural we share a room.
- Only officially.

100
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,580
- And unofficially?
- Do I have to spell it out?

101
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,680
I'm tired. Get out.

102
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,190
Then where am I supposed to sleep?

103
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,620
Aren't there tons of empty rooms
at the Kunhyang house? Pick one.

104
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,930
- Pick 2, pick 10. I don't care.
- No.

105
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,060
It has to be this room.

106
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,700
For our A Reum's sake.

107
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
A Reum?

108
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,440
Can't you feel it?

109
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,810
Our A Reum?

110
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,310
Your child.

111
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,850
If you like this room so much,

112
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,480
you can sleep here.
I'll take another room.

113
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,380
Se Hoon. Jin Se Hoon...

114
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,390
He has to give me a chance
if we're ever going to have a child.

115
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,260
What?
Alone in your newlywed bedroom?

116
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,800
Honestly, how are you so useless?
You can't even win over Jin Se Hoon?

117
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,470
I'm a nervous wreck.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,100
What if it gets found out
that I'm faking this pregnancy?

119
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,670
We absolutely can't let that happen.

120
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,370
Young Chae, you need to act fast.

121
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,210
The second you get the ring,
just whisk him away on a honeymoon.

122
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,080
Honeymoon? He won't even agree
to one night in a hotel.

123
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,420
Just kidnap
and sleep with him already!

124
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,750
I can't exactly do that for you,
can I?

125
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,860
Do I have to chew your food
for you too?

126
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,320
You useless, frustrating girl!

127
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,460
This is all Cha Jung Won's fault.

128
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,730
Cha Jung Won? Why?
Is Jin Se Hoon still hung up on her?

129
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,530
You think it's just Se Hoon?

130
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,670
Ha Neul also confessed his feelings
to her today.

131
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
What?

132
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,870
Right, okay, I get it.
Hang up for now.

133
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,280
Hey, you need your beauty sleep.
Hang up.

134
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,250
What? She just hung up?

135
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,520
This is so frustrating.

136
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,160
Ha Neul confessed to Cha Jung Won?

137
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,860
I figured
he'd stay out again tonight.

138
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,930
But I guess he's still coming home.

139
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,950
This is a first.

140
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,350
What do you want?

141
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,860
I know it's hard for you to see me.

142
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,260
But we need to talk.

143
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,760
Ha Neul, I know you hate my guts,

144
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,230
but this agonizing, ugly feeling
must feel like our twisted bond.

145
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,540
That's what's driving me crazy
with anger.

146
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,500
I can never forgive you.

147
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,570
And I will make you pay.

148
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,640
Then why do you look so sad?

149
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,780
Of all people, why did your mom
have to kill your father?

150
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,380
Is that what's so painful?

151
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,150
I know my father
wasn't a good person.

152
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,290
And you could have been the victim,
not the aggressor.

153
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,490
Exactly. So, as they say,
"Hate the sin, but not the sinner."

154
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,400
Isn't that how the old saying goes?

155
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,300
Everyone has an excuse.

156
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,040
But that doesn't change the fact
that you killed my father.

157
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,010
- So why aren't you doing anything?
- I am.

158
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,380
So slowly and deeply
that you won't even notice...

159
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,710
as I shake them
to their very foundation.

160
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,180
You can look forward to it.

161
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,120
Yes, I know you will, CEO Joo.

162
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,050
Once you set your mind to something,
you see it through, don't you?

163
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,260
You'll stab me in the back
or the heart.

164
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,990
But I wonder how fatal a blow
that would be for me.

165
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,930
Am I a joke to you?

166
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,870
No, quite the opposite.

167
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,070
I've never met anyone
who is as committed as you...

168
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,540
once they decide to do something.

169
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,970
So, speaking of which,

170
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,510
will you see this through
with Cha Jung Won...

171
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,210
even though I tried to stop you?

172
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,580
My feelings haven't changed.

173
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,920
Okay. Message received.

174
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,820
What's that supposed to mean?

175
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,420
If you're so sure of your feelings,
then see it through to the end.

176
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,520
You just told me to give up on her.
Why the sudden change?

177
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,930
Was forcing Se Hoon and Young Chae
into a fake marriage not enough?

178
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,630
Plan C.

179
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,000
Jung Won is Han Hye Ra's daughter.
And Ha Neul, you're my son.

180
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,670
If you two get together,
the Kunhyang family will be mine.

181
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,770
Your son?

182
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,040
Dream on.

183
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,550
My feelings for Jung Won
are sincere,

184
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,020
and I refuse to be used
by your blind greed.

185
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,550
Okay, I get it.
So don't let yourself be used.

186
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,760
Love her all you want.
You absolutely must get married.

187
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,820
Okay?

188
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,270
Is it still that precious to you?

189
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,840
Everyone has at least one memory
they hold dear to their heart.

190
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,080
For me, that's this drawing
Su A made when she was little.

191
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,680
I have no problem with the drawing.

192
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Then what is it?

193
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,220
It's about Se Mi.

194
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,020
- She's fallen for Joo Ha Neul.
- But Joo Ha Neul...

195
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,860
has feelings for Jung Won.

196
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,130
Whose side are you on?
Between your two daughters?

197
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,370
Are you really asking me to choose
between Jung Won and Se Mi...

198
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,170
- and say which one I love more?
- Yes.

199
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,270
That's right.

200
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,510
Se Mi...

201
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,780
is bright and beautiful,

202
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,820
and she's sharp and capable.
She couldn't be more lovable.

203
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,450
She is my daughter, after all.

204
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Jung Won...

205
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,490
is a constant heartache.

206
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,300
It's so constant...

207
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,900
that I sometimes think
it'd be better to just cut it away.

208
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,840
It sounds like you're saying
you might cut her off someday.

209
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,740
I just might.

210
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,950
I'll take care of Se Mi.

211
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,380
After all,
CEO Joo's feelings matter as well.

212
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,620
I wish she could just get over him.

213
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,390
But...

214
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,090
it seems Se Mi is truly in love.

215
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,260
And that's
what's tearing me up inside.

216
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,510
What's the special occasion?

217
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,210
You want to have
a sleepover with me?

218
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,210
What about Dad's jealousy?

219
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,680
He's crazy about his wife,
and he dotes on his daughter.

220
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,750
But I got his permission.

221
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,160
- Mom...
- Are you that happy?

222
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,130
Are you that happy?

223
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,930
I am.

224
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,280
I love this.
It's just the two of us, Mom.

225
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,050
- How many years has it been?
- You're still just a little baby.

226
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,920
Time for bed. I'll hold you tight.

227
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
You smell so nice, Mom.

228
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,630
Do you want me
to play the music box?

229
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,500
No. I just want you to sing to me.

230
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,390
Se Mi,

231
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,530
you've always had plenty of love
from me and your dad,

232
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
but Su A...

233
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,240
I mean, Jung Won has had
a very difficult and lonely life.

234
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,510
If you take...

235
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,680
CEO Joo Ha Neul from her too,

236
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,310
Jung Won...

237
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,480
will have no one left.

238
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,680
What am I supposed to do, Se Mi?

239
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
(Kunhyang Group)

240
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,870
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

241
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,140
Shall we move on to
the interview now?

242
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,840
So, how did you two meet?

243
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,610
It was a complete coincidence
at first.

244
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,180
I was shopping
at the Kunhyang Department Store.

245
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,750
I accidentally...

246
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,220
spilled coffee
all over Se Hoon's clothes.

247
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
I see.

248
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,160
- And what happened?
- I offered to pay for the cleaning,

249
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,730
but Se Hoon said
I could buy him dinner instead.

250
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,870
And that's how it all started.

251
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,240
Didn't your families know each other
for a long time?

252
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,410
We may have met briefly
when we were young,

253
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,040
but I didn't realize it was her.

254
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,980
So you fell for her at first sight?

255
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,520
That's right.

256
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,650
Where did you go for the honeymoon?

257
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,050
- Jeju Island...
- The Maldives!

258
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,020
Se Hoon...

259
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,260
travels so much for work,
so he must've gotten confused.

260
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,860
We went to the Maldives, remember?

261
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,430
Right.

262
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,400
Those cocktails we had
while watching the sunset...

263
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,800
I can still taste
how sweet they were.

264
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,870
I heard you're pregnant.

265
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,040
- A honeymoon baby?
- No. We're just newlyweds.

266
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,450
You know how it is.
We just couldn't help ourselves.

267
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,580
You don't know the gender yet,
do you?

268
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,250
Not yet.

269
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,160
Our baby's nickname is A Reum.

270
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,860
- A Reum is the nickname?
- Yes.

271
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,530
Se Hoon came up with it.

272
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,970
Hoping for a beautiful baby,
just like the mother.

273
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,200
There are rumors...

274
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,410
that Kunhyang's daughter-in-law
was switched.

275
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,380
Is that true?

276
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,380
The woman
at the Kunhyang Association event...

277
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,850
at the orphanage...

278
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,820
seemed to be someone else.

279
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,850
Reporter Ma.

280
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,190
Maybe you should
get your eyes checked.

281
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,550
What?

282
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,290
A woman's entire look can change
with makeup and a different outfit.

283
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,830
The daughter-in-law
for the Kunhyang family...

284
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,500
has always been me, Joo Young Chae.

285
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,370
I see.

286
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,770
Are we done taking photos?

287
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,200
That's enough for today.

288
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,470
I believe you have more than enough.

289
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,640
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

290
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,380
I've done everything you wanted,
Chairman Gong.

291
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
So now,

292
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,720
hand it over.

293
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,990
The video from the gallery incident.

294
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:43,660
What's the big rush?
The baby isn't even born yet.

295
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,430
What good are wedding photos
and exchanging rings...

296
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,670
when my Young Chae...

297
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,970
is spending her nights all alone
in her newlywed bedroom?

298
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,870
Please just be a bit more patient.

299
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,540
My son, Se Hoon,
is just like his father.

300
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,650
It's not easy for him to let go
of the person he gave his heart to.

301
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,120
That's my point exactly.

302
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,850
A Reum, Da Rong, Bo Ram, whatever...

303
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,260
That baby has to be born first.

304
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,420
Then people will say Young Chae
truly belongs with Jin Se Hoon.

305
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,990
That's how it works, isn't it?

306
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,800
So you're just going
to keep stalling?

307
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,230
You're not giving me that video,
are you, Gong Nan Sook?

308
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,700
Jin Tae Seok's fate
is in that video.

309
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,400
You think I'd just give it away?

310
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,540
Of course not.

311
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,290
(Director Jin Se Mi)

312
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,020
Here are the first screening results
you requested.

313
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,130
(High School Graduate)

314
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,930
- What is this?
- I reviewed every design book.

315
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,400
I did an initial sort of the ones
that met a certain standard.

316
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,210
I've also added my comments
to each of the evaluation forms.

317
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,840
I told you to make the first cut
based on educational background.

318
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,680
Do you make a habit of
ignoring your superiors?

319
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,350
If we filter them by education
without seeing their designs,

320
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,420
then it isn't
truly blind recruitment.

321
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,090
When we give an order like that,
there's always a reason.

322
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,550
Then educational background
should've been a rule...

323
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,660
from the start.

324
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,260
It's supposed
to be blind recruitment.

325
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,760
Using a different standard is wrong.

326
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,760
What did you just say? "Wrong?"

327
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,000
People poured their hearts and souls
into these design books.

328
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,070
It's cruel to just toss them out
without even looking at them.

329
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,510
Designer Cha Jung Won
does have a point.

330
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,210
Your ring is gorgeous.

331
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,180
Is that a sapphire?

332
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,050
It looks just like the one
Princess Diana had.

333
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,020
Of course.

334
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,950
I'll say this for Designer Ahn,
you've got a sharp eye.

335
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,190
This is a workplace.
Save the personal talk for later.

336
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,460
The work that Designer Cha Jung Won
couldn't handle.

337
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,660
Designer Ahn Ji Na and I...

338
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,230
will take over.

339
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,330
But you're already the team lead
for next year's new collection.

340
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,670
Can you really handle it?

341
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,200
What choice do I have?

342
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,310
My assistant is falling short,
so I have to pick up the slack.

343
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,110
All right, then.
Designer Joo, you finish it up.

344
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,300
It's for you.

345
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,430
Sorry about yesterday.

346
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,600
So you do know you were wrong?

347
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,470
The number is the same.

348
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,480
Why offer to judge them?
What are you so afraid of?

349
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,420
Are you afraid the flaws...

350
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,650
in the blind recruitment process
will be exposed?

351
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,530
We both submitted my design.
And it was blind recruitment.

352
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,760
But you were accepted,
and I was rejected.

353
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,070
What does that tell you?

354
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,000
What's the point
of bringing that up now?

355
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,170
We both ended up as designers
at Kunhyang Group.

356
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,210
I married into the Kunhyang family,

357
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,110
and you're
Vice Chairman Han's daughter.

358
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,640
You're saying I submitted
your work as my own?

359
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,180
Says who?

360
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,350
- I didn't.
- Then I'll be the one to expose...

361
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,920
that you stole my design
and submitted it as your own.

362
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,450
Stop this nonsense.

363
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,520
Instead of wasting time on this,
get on Director Jin's good side.

364
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,500
She glares daggers at you
because of Ha Neul.

365
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,250
Why are you giving this to me?

366
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,090
I thought she would like it more
if it came from you.

367
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,260
You should give it
to Jung Won yourself.

368
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,040
I don't even have the right
to do that as her mother.

369
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,070
Not since she was Su A.

370
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,380
I...

371
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,980
abandoned Su A.

372
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Were you really the one...

373
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,920
who tried to frame
Jung Won's father as a murderer,

374
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,050
Vice Chairman Han?

375
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,790
Is that what Jung Won told you?

376
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,660
She said she heard
an audio recording...

377
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,360
and that it could have been faked.

378
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,860
I never did that.

379
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,790
Then why did you say
you abandoned Su A?

380
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,100
I was in a car accident.

381
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,270
I was hospitalized for six months,

382
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,470
and I lost contact with Su A.

383
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,770
I didn't want to spend my life
as a poor laundromat owner's wife.

384
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,810
Even so, I told myself
I had to keep going for Su A's sake.

385
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,710
That's what I made myself believe.

386
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,920
A kind husband, even if he was poor.

387
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,120
A daughter who was
the apple of my eye.

388
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,590
I convinced myself that was
all this life had in store for me,

389
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,260
and I lived that way,
day after day. But...

390
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,170
Is that when you met
Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

391
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,700
He and I...

392
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,640
were first loves back in college.

393
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,480
But he was married and had a son.

394
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,620
It all started the moment
I saw that diamond ring.

395
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,090
I didn't even realize at the time...

396
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,860
that my heart was already straying.

397
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,390
Here's your birthday present!

398
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,570
I was just a social climber
at heart.

399
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,870
I wanted to soar as high as I could.

400
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,610
I will climb higher and higher.

401
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,510
I want to see where the top is...

402
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,750
and what's at the end of the sky.

403
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,250
I'm going to see it
with my own two eyes.

404
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,960
When Ki Beom was framed for murder,

405
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,260
my excuse became crystal clear.

406
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,870
There was no way I could live
my whole life as a murderer's wife.

407
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,970
But Jung Won... I mean,

408
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,500
you could have taken Su A with you.

409
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,710
I realized Tae Seok didn't want her.

410
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,880
I had to make a choice.

411
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
I...

412
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,650
can't do a single thing
for that child,

413
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,220
nor do I have the right to.

414
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,790
I can't even call myself her mother.

415
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,160
But you can, CEO Joo.

416
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,670
You want me...

417
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,970
to stay by Jung Won's side?

418
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,240
Jung Won harbors a deep resentment
for you, Vice Chairman Han.

419
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,950
She blames you for her dad's death.
No, actually,

420
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,120
she believes she's the one
who's truly to blame.

421
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,950
What do you mean?

422
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,060
She thinks that
because she lived a lie,

423
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,420
the price she had to pay...

424
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,490
was her father’s life.

425
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,730
She's blaming herself for it.

426
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,600
The one who killed her father.

427
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,870
It really wasn't you, was it,
Vice Chairman Han?

428
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,870
If you could just clear up
that misunderstanding with Jung Won...

429
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,280
It was all Jin Tae Seok's doing.

430
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,680
But I don't have any proof.

431
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,850
I'm sure Chairman Gong Nan Sook
has a video.

432
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,850
If I managed to place Young Chae
by Se Hoon's side,

433
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,460
Chairman Gong was supposed
to give me that video. But...

434
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,060
Don't trust her.
She will never give it to you.

435
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,730
It's the only thing
that will help Jung Won move on.

436
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,900
I have to find proof
of who did that to Ki Beom,

437
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,370
and whether it was really
Jin Tae Seok.

438
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,940
It's probably
at Chairman Gong's house.

439
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,920
Yes, Madam Gong. It's me.

440
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,860
I was hoping you could spare time
this evening.

441
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,130
Would you be free
to join me for dinner?

442
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,040
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

443
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,810
What's this?

444
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,850
I hear you're a bachelor.

445
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,850
I'm sure you don't have a wife
at home making you food.

446
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
Just take it.

447
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,250
That's really not necessary.

448
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,820
I hardly ever eat at home.

449
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,760
Then give it to someone else
or just toss it.

450
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,170
Yes, Vice Chairman.

451
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,370
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

452
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,110
I've got a bad feeling about this.

453
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,710
Why would Han Hye Ra ask to see me?

454
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,750
And out of the blue,
she asks me to dinner?

455
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,950
Manager Gu,
you can go home for the day.

456
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,020
Thank you.

457
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,990
So, does that mean
my time is my own tonight?

458
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,530
Are you going to let me finish?

459
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,130
Yes, please continue
to the very end.

460
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,500
While I'm enjoying a nice dinner
with Han Hye Ra...

461
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,870
What is it you need me to do?

462
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,050
You two...

463
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,120
Did Vice Chairman Han send you
to help me?

464
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,260
- She did.
- She did.

465
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,590
All right, Secretary Yoon,
I need you to keep watch out here.

466
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,030
And call me the minute
Madam Gong gets here.

467
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,330
Yes, understood.

468
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,300
- Manager Hwang, you're with me.
- Right.

469
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,750
CEO Joo Ha Neul...

470
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,380
and Manager Hwang of Kunhyang?
What are you two doing here?

471
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,190
Manager Hwang and I
were just going to grab a drink.

472
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,390
Why don't you join us, Manager Gu?

Are you expecting a burglar tonight?

Don't ask questions.
Just do what you're told.

477

Don't let them take a single thing.

478
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,780
I've actually quit drinking.

- Come on, have a drink.

484
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,850
Be direct. Why did you ask me here?

485
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,380
I enjoyed our dinner.

486
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,320
There's an old woman who adores me.
She once told me...

487
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,750
that you're an even scarier witch
than I am.

488
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,160
Then I'll have to prove it, won't I?
That I'm much scarier than you.

489
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,690
I'm still not ready to love you.

490
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,330
I'm ready. I have been for a while.

491
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,660
You love me too, Jung Won.
Don't deny it.

Hye Ra had Joo Ha Neul
search your house? Why?

She was probably looking for proof
that you killed Cha Ki Beom.
