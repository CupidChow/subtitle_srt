1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,310
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,680
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,310
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,900
Park Kyung Shin?

5
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,090
Jung Won, how have you been?

6
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,620
I'm back.

7
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,170
- What? Park Kyung Shin is in Seoul?
- Yes.

8
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,870
Where is he now?

9
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,270
He's scheduled to walk as a model
for the Kunhyang Fashion show.

10
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,040
You can't be in here.
Please step out.

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Come out here for a second.

12
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,720
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,890
I should be asking you that.
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,590
You went to Paris.
You should've made a life there.

15
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,500
Do you two know each other?

16
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,270
You were great on the runway.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you.

18
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,070
Am I supposed to introduce myself?

19
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,880
This is Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
of Kunhyang Group.

20
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,310
Thank you for having me.

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,750
I heard you were making waves
in Paris and Milan.

22
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,450
So I was curious.

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,220
- You've exceeded my expectations.
- You're too kind.

24
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,530
My future daughter-in-law
has an eye for models, too.

25
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,930
My future daughter-in-law, I mean...

26
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,740
How long have you and Young Chae...

27
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,110
known each other?

28
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,810
We met by chance at a gathering
for people in the fashion industry.

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,430
(My Dear Son)

30
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Excuse me a moment.

31
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,230
What, were you worried
your fiancée and I ran off together?

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,300
We're hanging out backstage.

33
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,040
All right, I'll be right there.

34
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,340
The Chairman is here.

35
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,180
Okay.

36
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,510
See you around.

37
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,750
What was she talking about?
Why did she call you Young Chae?

38
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,760
- Why is she calling you that?
- You have no right to question me.

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,630
Keep your voice down and follow me.

40
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,900
(Information, VIP Lounge)

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,150
Are you here to check up on
the fashion show?

42
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,250
I never doubted the show
would be a huge success.

43
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,390
I'm here to give my Vice Chairman
a comfortable ride home.

44
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,790
The Chairman giving
the Vice Chairman a ride?

45
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,360
There you go again, being playful.

46
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,860
I'm not joking.

47
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,760
I always mean it.

48
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,230
And what about our son?

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,440
He's glued to her side.

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
He went to get Young Chae.

51
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,370
Why?

52
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,640
Are you getting a bit fed up with...

53
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,280
Se Hoon being
so attached to his fiancée?

54
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,650
Quite the opposite.

55
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,820
Our son is
the spitting image of you.

56
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,420
He'll be a kind and gentle husband.

57
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,830
Let's go, just the two of us.

58
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,560
If you'll take my arm, do it right.

59
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,330
We're in public. People will talk.

60
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,630
Come on, who's watching?
It's just us.

61
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,870
I guess we're invisible then.

62
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,350
No, we're just shadows.

63
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,420
Shadows?

64
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
Hold on!

65
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,190
If not in the dressing room,

66
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,730
don't you think he might have
bolted somewhere else?

67
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,860
Park Kyung Shin's car is still
in the parking lot.

68
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,370
- He's still in the vicinity, then.
- Yes.

69
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,430
Let's go.

70
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,870
What's your game?

71
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,140
Why does Kunhyang's Vice Chairman
think you're Young Chae?

72
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,680
It's complicated.

73
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,250
Did you make me fake my own suicide
to get rid of Young Chae?

74
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,520
It's what Young Chae wanted.

75
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,790
She asked me to do it
because she wanted to be with you.

76
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,430
- I'm just filling in for her...
- Lies!

77
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,490
You wanted Young Chae's life,
didn't you?

78
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,860
This is all your fault.

79
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,630
If Young Chae and I
hadn't run off like that,

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,370
Young Chae and I wouldn't have
ended up like this.

81
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,740
She was just too possessive.

82
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,240
I felt like I was
suffocating to death!

83
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,310
- Keep your voice down.
- That son of a gun.

84
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,080
Tearing him to pieces
wouldn't even be enough.

85
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,380
You ruined everything!
You, Cha Jung Won!

86
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,060
Where's Young Chae now?

87
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,460
- I don't know.
- Did you dump her for someone else?

88
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,060
- You just left her?
- I would've died if I hadn't.

89
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,930
She wouldn't even let me
leave the house!

90
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Young Chae is...

91
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,000
out of her mind.

92
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,670
She's completely lost it.

93
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,280
- That...
- This is all your fault!

94
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,150
So I've finally found you,
you worthless scumbag.

95
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,750
Get him up.

96
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,860
You've got a lot of nerve
showing your face here.

97
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,390
Do you have a death wish?

98
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,600
- I was wrong.
- Wrong?

99
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,230
You should've considered the outcome
before you did something wrong!

100
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,400
Do you think I'm going to
let you get away with this?

101
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
Take him away.

102
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,540
- Come with me quietly.
- Help me! Jung Won!

103
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,680
What do you mean, Jung Won?
Who's Jung Won?

104
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,920
That's Young Chae.
My daughter, Joo Young Chae.

105
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,650
Got it?

106
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,750
Drag him out of here!

107
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,630
Is Mom really taking
Jung Won's side?

108
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,040
A love worth dying for?

109
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,870
Jung Won.

110
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,410
First, I'll deal with Park Kyung Shin,
then I'll take back my life.

111
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,180
Just you wait.

112
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,100
Now that I think about it,
Jin Se Hoon is totally my type.

113
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,510
Se Hoon.

114
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,440
Mother's with Father,
so why are you wandering alone?

115
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,910
You weren't answering
your phone, either.

116
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,480
I was meeting someone.

117
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,750
You must be starving.
Want to grab a bite?

118
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,490
I'm exhausted today.
I just want to rest.

119
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,930
- I'll take you home.
- No, I can get home on my own.

120
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,100
I'm good.

121
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,330
I'll go ahead. Talk to you later.

122
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,750
This is Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
of Kunhyang Group.

123
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,090
Thank you for having me.

124
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,120
So, Vice Chairman Han was the one
who put Park Kyung Shin on stage?

125
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,490
My future daughter-in-law, I mean...

126
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,200
How long have you and Young Chae...

127
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,270
known each other?

128
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,570
We met by chance at a gathering
for people in the fashion industry.

129
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,410
Don't tell me...

130
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,480
She hasn't figured it out, has she?

131
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,420
You wanted Young Chae's life,
didn't you?

132
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,220
This is all your fault.

133
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,520
If Young Chae and I
hadn't run off like that,

134
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,220
Young Chae and I wouldn't have
ended up like this.

135
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,730
What if Park Kyung Shin
messes everything up?

136
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,730
Do you think I'm going to
let you get away with this?

137
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,960
Take him away!

138
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,200
Come with me quietly.

139
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,030
Help me! Jung Won!

140
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,570
What if Chairman Gong really does
have Park Kyung Shin drowned?

141
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,180
No, that's crazy.

142
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,540
But if Park Kyung Shin
disappeared...

143
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,880
no one would ever know
I'm not Young Chae.

144
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,650
But can I really just let him die?

145
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,220
Darn it.

146
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,960
The person you have reached is...

147
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,460
Come on, pick up.

148
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,500
This is driving me insane.

149
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,630
(Joo Young Chae 1)

150
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,610
(Jin Se Hoon)

151
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,110
Hey, Se Hoon. What's up this late?

152
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,950
You need a drinking buddy?

153
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,150
Okay.

154
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,860
Young Chae.

155
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,830
Just stop calling already.

156
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,810
Hey, what's the fire?

157
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,350
I guess there really is a fire.

158
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,920
Slow down.

159
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,520
Park Kyung Shin.

160
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,560
You know that bastard too?

161
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,200
When I was set up on a blind date
with Joo Young Chae,

162
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,230
my friends warned me against it.

163
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,870
They said she's seriously involved
with some younger model.

164
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,310
Jin Se Hoon.

165
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,510
Feeling insecure?

166
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,550
Why even bring up a loser like him?
It makes you look pathetic.

167
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,380
That bastard is always in my way.

168
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,990
I was tempted to just...

169
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,690
kill him with my own bare hands.

170
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,330
Get him up.

171
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,000
You've got a lot of nerve
showing your face here.

172
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,310
Do you have a death wish?

173
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,780
- I was wrong.
- Wrong?

174
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,150
You should've considered the outcome
before you did something wrong!

175
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,250
Do you think I'm going to
let you get away with this?

176
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,720
Take him away!

177
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,390
Come with me quietly.

178
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,790
(Restroom)

179
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Mother did that?

180
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,800
Look, Se Hoon,
put out your own fire.

181
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,830
I must go
before a bigger one starts.

182
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,710
Any guy near Joo Young Chae
won't get away with it.

183
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,250
I don't care who it is.

184
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,030
Gosh, that's cold.

185
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,900
Stupid fools should've added
hot water.

186
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,600
I've committed a grave sin.

187
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,400
You dare cheat on my Young Chae?

188
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,110
Please, spare me.

189
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,710
You said you committed a grave sin.
Then you should pay with your life.

190
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,450
Please, just spare my life.
I'll do anything you say.

191
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,680
Your life?

192
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,250
That's worth nothing.
It'll all be over in a moment.

193
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,550
It'll be quick.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

194
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,210
Feels like your limbs are torn off,
doesn't it?

195
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,080
And your heart feels like
crows are pecking at it, right?

196
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,620
Just kill me already.

197
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
I said kill me, darn it!

198
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,050
Now you finally understand,
don't you?

199
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,950
That you'd be better off dead.

200
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,260
I don't know where Young Chae is.

201
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,030
I can't tell you what I don't know.

202
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,860
That doesn't matter.

203
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,200
Young Chae is alive.
That's all that matters.

204
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,630
I'm not interested in
her whereabouts.

205
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,730
Then why are you trying to kill me?

206
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,210
Because you're in the way.
Your very existence is a problem.

207
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:00,080
What the heck are you talking about?
Can you please make some sense!

208
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,550
All this noise is giving me
a headache.

209
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,600
What brings you here?

210
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,970
Park Kyung Shin!

211
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,200
Park Kyung Shin, open your eyes!

212
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,400
Park Kyung Shin!

213
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,610
Please.

214
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,710
Park Kyung Shin, come on,
open your eyes!

215
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,850
What do you think you're doing?
What if he really dies?

216
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,120
So what if he dies?
What are you going to do about it?

217
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,620
Mother!

218
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,760
You want to know
why you almost died?

219
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,130
First.

220
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,370
You dared to talk back to me,
Gong Nan Sook.

221
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,740
And second.

222
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,940
You knowing that Cha Jung Won is
impersonating my daughter.

223
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,880
No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

224
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,880
I've never met Cha Jung Won
or Joo Young Chae.

225
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,520
You'd better keep it that way
unless you really want to die.

226
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,210
I thought I fell asleep
without a blanket.

227
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,950
No answer when I rang.
Used the master key.

228
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,990
Park Kyung Shin is fine.
Make sure you eat.

229
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,500
CEO Joo Ha Neul?

230
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,530
How did he know about what happened
with Park Kyung Shin?

231
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,240
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

232
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,780
Gosh, he still won't even answer
my calls.

233
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,580
Please leave
a message after the tone.

234
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,500
A date?

235
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Yes.

236
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,440
I'm fine,

237
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,370
- so don't say anything.
- I haven't said a word yet.

238
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,540
"Park Kyung Shin."

239
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,410
"Don't worry about him."

240
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,980
How did you know?

241
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,880
You think you're the only
mind reader in the family?

242
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,260
Young Chae is a beautiful, bright,
and charming young woman.

243
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,930
It's more of a problem if she's 30
and has never had a boyfriend.

244
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,860
As someone who's broken off
an engagement myself,

245
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,700
do you really think
I wouldn't understand?

246
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,270
But...

247
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,800
I am curious about one thing.

248
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,970
Why now, of all times,

249
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,470
did you decide to bring
Park Kyung Shin into the picture?

250
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,410
I first thought it was a coincidence
or that he was just messing with me.

251
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,820
It was a final test.

252
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,920
I had to see if Joo Young Chae
was truly worthy of my son.

253
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,330
If she had the strength of character
not to be swayed,

254
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,400
even when her infamous ex-boyfriend
showed up.

255
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,000
That's what I wanted to find out.

256
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,870
So, what's the verdict?

257
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,270
It looks like you're the one
who needs to be stronger.

258
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,210
So, how do I look?

259
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Dashing.

260
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,520
Are you going somewhere fancy?
The opera?

261
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,720
A classical concert?

262
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,890
Seriously?

263
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,960
But you're going dressed like that?

264
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,390
Hey, what? What's wrong with it?

265
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,770
Men in this family just have
a different idea of fashion.

266
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,350
Why didn't you tell me...

267
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,050
that Ahn Ji Na comes here too?

268
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,820
This is her first day.

269
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,750
I guess she's tracking
my every move.

270
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
She's relentless.

271
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,960
Let's just ignore her.

272
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,230
She'll get tired of it eventually.

273
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,900
It'll be less painful if she cuts off
someone who's lost interest.

274
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,370
Come on, let's get this done.

275
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,650
Reporter Ma.

276
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,280
Jin Se Hoon of Kunhyang Group
and his fiancée...

277
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,250
are at a cooking class right now.

278
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,520
Don't miss your chance
to get a very exclusive shot.

279
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,110
Let me get that for you.

280
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,600
Here.

281
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,300
You know, a new wedding hall opened
at the intersection.

282
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,600
The hall is small,
but it's pretty and clean.

283
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,270
- Totally my style.
- Fine. Let's book that one.

284
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,540
Without even seeing it?

285
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,150
Didn't you say
you've already seen it?

286
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,510
I don't care. Anywhere is fine.

287
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,850
Whose wedding
are we even planning here?

288
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,550
This is our wedding.
How can you be so uninterested?

289
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,130
What, are you possessed
by a hungry ghost?

290
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,130
We can swing by
and see it tonight, I guess.

291
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,360
Do you just swing by
and get married?

292
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,530
I can't do it like that.
I'd rather not get married at all.

293
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,970
Now what? What's the problem?

294
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,970
What do you want?
The entire department store?

295
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,240
- You're having one, aren't you?
- Having what?

296
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,150
An affair!

297
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,080
I can't even respond
to something that ridiculous.

298
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,690
You think you can play dumb
and I'll just look the other way?

299
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,990
Darn it.

300
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,030
Then what's this?

301
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,000
This is obviously
a woman's lipstick, isn't it?

302
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,640
You didn't care that I was innocent,
did you?

303
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,980
You wanted to dump your kid
and leave a loser like me,

304
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,810
so you could live the good life
with your new husband?

305
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,250
That's right.

306
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,600
Is this Young Sun's lipstick?

307
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,340
Don't be ridiculous.

308
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,310
Cut the nonsense.

309
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,410
Where are you running off to
in the middle of lunch?

310
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,180
I knew it.

311
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,090
So he still hasn't gotten
over Young Sun.

312
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
What am I going to do?

313
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,710
Is he going on a date?

314
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,940
No, he wouldn't be getting
business cards made,

315
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,010
and he wouldn't be getting
wedding invitations printed there.

316
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,460
Ki Beom.

317
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,560
It's not the anniversary
of her death.

318
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,900
So why is he even here?

319
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,310
(Cha Su A. May you be free from pain
and play to your heart's content.)

320
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,460
(Jo Jung Won)

321
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,430
Jung Won.

322
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,940
I...

323
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,010
No, your new dad
remade this for you.

324
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,880
I'm truly sorry.

325
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,950
Please forgive me.

326
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,770
Mi Hyang.

327
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,100
Why did you make
my dear Jung Won's plaque?

328
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,210
Why is Cha Su A's name on a plaque
just sitting there?

329
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Ki Beom.

330
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,620
Did you bring Young Sun here?

331
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,570
My gosh...

332
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,600
It's one thing if it's me,

333
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,140
but how could you be the one
to erase dear Jung Won like this?

334
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,710
It's the only way...

335
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,450
to cut ties for good.

336
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,050
It's the only way
for my dear Jung Won...

337
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,290
to never be tangled up
with that monster again.

338
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,060
I'll take all of it.

339
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,600
Even the punishment meant for you.

340
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,400
Who do you think you are,
taking my punishment for me?

341
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,140
My poor little Jung Won.

342
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,770
You stupid fool!

343
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,280
Go on, cry.

344
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,710
Cry it out.

345
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,280
Just cry here in my arms.

346
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,090
Let it all out.

347
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,630
(Cha Su A. May you be free from pain
and play to your heart's content.)

348
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,040
Mom!

349
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,110
You know how...

350
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,850
a student who's falling behind
has to study even on the weekends?

351
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,020
It's not studying, it's reading.

352
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,520
It'd be one thing
if it were literature or a novel.

353
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,760
I'm defenseless when you have
that look on your face.

354
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,900
Go ahead. Whatever it is.

355
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,540
I'm ready.

356
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,240
That day.

357
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,450
I met Cha Ki Beom.

358
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,220
What about Su A?

359
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,420
Did you find her?

360
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,830
Su A...

361
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,600
She's no longer with us.

362
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,670
It's all my fault.

363
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,740
If I had just acted sooner,
my dear Su A...

364
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,450
wouldn't have died so senselessly.

365
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,320
- Honey.
- Don't!

366
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,220
This is your fault.

367
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,620
Honey?

368
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,290
While I was in the hospital
recovering from surgery,

369
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,130
did you even try to find Su A?

370
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,360
I had been searching for 25 years,

371
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,770
and I still wasn't able to find out
if she was alive.

372
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,530
Were you trying to stop me
from finding her?

373
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,040
You already knew that Su A
was gone, didn't you?

374
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,770
Didn't you?

375
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:53,940
Honey,
how could I have known and not told?

376
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,010
You expect me to believe
you didn't know?

377
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,920
Is there anything
beyond Kunhyang's reach?

378
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,150
I told you, I missed my chance.

379
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,390
By the time I went to find her,
Jo Mi Hyang had left with Su A,

380
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,490
and by the time I tracked down
their new address and got there...

381
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,330
You should have gone immediately.

382
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,730
If you had acted a little sooner,
our Su A would still be alive.

383
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,140
She'd be safe in my arms.

384
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,270
- Hye Ra.
- I resent you.

385
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,240
- Hye Ra.
- I resent you.

386
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,380
Hye Ra!

387
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,340
Hye Ra.

388
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,850
I can't even begin to imagine...

389
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,550
the pain you must be feeling.

390
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,550
It's all my fault.

391
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,160
I don't know what came over me.

392
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,230
If not me,
who else would you open up to?

393
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,100
You can blame me all you want.

394
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,000
Let it out.

395
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,310
I'm so used to getting my way...

396
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,940
that I took it out on you.

397
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,180
I'm sorry.

398
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,050
No, I'm the one who should be sorry.

399
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,630
But if you're lying to me,

400
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,370
if it's your fault
we never found our Su A,

401
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,470
I will never forgive you!

402
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,040
(A Graceful Liar)

403
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,870
They clearly went to great lengths
for these shots.

404
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,870
Have you made contact?

405
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,340
It's the cooking class parking lot.

406
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,440
Any idea who the tipster is?

407
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,510
Why would you do this?

408
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,170
What's in it for you, Ahn Ji Na?

409
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:07,440
Why does this Joo Young Chae seem like
a completely different person?

410
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,080
You're not Joo Young Chae, are you?

411
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,050
Are you sure it's Park Kyung Shin?

412
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,250
He has full-body contusions
and pulmonary edema.

413
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,020
That means he was assaulted.

414
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,320
Did they find the attacker?

415
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,450
Park Kyung Shin, you said I was
all you needed, didn't you?

416
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,220
That I was more precious
than your own life?

417
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,590
How dare you abandon me?

418
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,460
I gave up my name and world for you.

419
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,560
Answer me! Who in the world are you?

420
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
