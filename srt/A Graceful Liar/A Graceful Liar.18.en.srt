1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,910
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,270
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,210
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,650
Cha Jung Won?

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,550
Me?

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,020
Don't be ridiculous!

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,950
I'm Joo Young Chae.

8
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,550
What did you just say?

9
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,460
You want me to say it again?

10
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,490
I am Joo Young Chae.

11
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,160
Your fiancee.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,380
What do you think you're doing,
causing a scene here?

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,780
Are you Cha Jung Won?

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,950
Did you just call me
Cha Jung Won, Mom?

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,850
You're the one who started
Cha Jung Won's Game.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,120
You know this woman too?

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,730
I know her all too well.

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,800
She's the leech who latched
onto Young Chae and bled her dry.

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,600
Anyone who messes with my daughter
will die by my hand.

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,740
Your daughter? Who's that?

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,240
The fake one, Cha Jung Won?

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,110
That's enough.

23
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,050
She gets the message.

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,450
Stop it, Mom.

25
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,460
Hey! Tell them who you are now!
I can't stand this anymore!

26
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,230
Why don't you just go around telling
everyone you're Joo Young Chae?

27
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,740
I hear lots of people are pretending
to be my Young Chae anyway.

28
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:41,970
Fine.

29
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,010
That's a great idea.

30
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,110
- That's right. I'm Joo Young...
- Shut it, you brat!

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,980
Please, stop.

32
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,950
Let her be.
A woman like that deserves it.

33
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,930
- Manager Gu.
- Yes.

34
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,860
- Take her away!
- Let me go!

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,700
I won't stop until I kill you!

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,430
You crazy wench!

37
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,170
You must have been startled,
Vice President Jin.

38
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,040
I'm sure Young Chae
is more startled than I am.

39
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,650
You two should get some rest.

40
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,620
I'll handle the rest.

41
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,360
(Episode 18)

42
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,270
"Our Young Chae?"

43
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,040
Is that what you call
that wench, Cha Jung Won?

44
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,410
The one
who "messes with your daughter?"

45
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
Was that me?

46
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,880
Why are you suddenly making a scene?

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,320
I know, and you know,
all about this little pretend play.

48
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,950
Still, you hit me in front of
Jung Won? Have you lost your mind?

49
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,560
You're lucky all I did
was hit you, you little brat.

50
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,030
What?

51
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,700
Do you have any idea
what you're running around doing?

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,670
You're just adding fuel to the fire.

53
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,140
One false move,
and we go off a cliff,

54
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,640
and you're pushing me to the edge.

55
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,870
Isn't it the other way around?

56
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,480
What?

57
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,440
To save your own skin,

58
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,750
you humiliated your only daughter
in front of a total fake.

59
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,750
If I hadn't, you would've screamed,
"That's right, I'm Joo Young Chae!"

60
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,220
"I was so crazy about a guy that
I ran to Paris and she filled in."

61
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,590
"And Gong Nan Sook here
was in on it the whole time."

62
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,060
You would have blurted it all out
to Jin Se Hoon.

63
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,130
Because I feel like
I'll go crazy if I don't!

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
If you ruin it all and go crazy,
then I'll lose my mind,

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,140
and our business and this family
will all go down the drain.

66
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,910
You think I, Gong Nan Sook,
would just stand by as it happens?

67
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,040
Don't use the family or the business
as an excuse.

68
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,680
You only ever think about yourself.

69
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,850
You don't ever care
what happens to me.

70
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,350
Get a grip, you brat!
Stop being so emotional.

71
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,790
This is about the next 10, 20,
even 100 years of our lives.

72
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,230
No. I'm putting things back
the way they were, right now.

73
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,330
I've had enough...

74
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,270
of you, and of that wench,
Cha Jung Won.

75
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,610
(Kunhyang Group, Han Hye Ra)

76
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,980
Han Hye Ra?

77
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,850
- Were you about to call this woman?
- And what if I was?

78
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,220
She was even nice enough
to give me her business card.

79
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,190
She said she wanted to see me again.

80
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,130
Again?

81
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,360
You met Han Hye Ra?

82
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,230
In Park Kyung Shin's hospital room.

83
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,630
So? What did you say to her?

84
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,970
You mean, back then?

85
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,370
She asked for my name.

86
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,280
Joo Young Chae.

87
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,850
Say that again.

88
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,380
You said what?

89
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
I told her I'm Joo Young Chae.

90
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,190
Gosh, stop!

91
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,020
You insolent brat!
Are you out of your mind?

92
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,360
Are you trying to ruin this wedding?

93
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,160
Are you trying
to destroy our family?

94
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,230
That hurts!

95
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,570
Unbelievable.

96
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,570
Why? What's wrong
with me being myself?

97
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,940
That's right!
I'm calling off this wedding.

98
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,710
You, Mom, and this whole family!

99
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,710
I'm going to bring it all
crashing down.

100
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,560
I'm only going to ask you
one more time.

101
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,800
Did you really tell Han Hye Ra...

102
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,730
that you're Joo Young Chae?

103
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,130
And what if I did?

104
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,300
Even if you are my own daughter,

105
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,210
I can't let this slide.

106
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,680
That woman, Cha Jung Won.
She's completely lost her mind.

107
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,350
How could she say
she's Joo Young Chae?

108
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,460
And calling Chairman Gong "Mom."

109
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,560
If it weren't for someone like you
who truly trusts me,

110
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,360
people would've believed Jung Won.

111
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,630
- She sounds so convincing.
- For Jung Won,

112
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,840
she might actually believe she's me.

113
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,440
It's an illness.

114
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,180
How did she get to this point?

115
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,980
- Jealousy.
- Just jealousy?

116
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,350
Is that enough
to make you want to kill someone?

117
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,790
There's no motive for murder
stronger than jealousy. None at all.

118
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,090
When Cain killed his brother Abel,

119
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,030
it was all because of jealousy.

120
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,570
Because Abel was the one chosen.

121
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,600
They say there's a fine line
between jealousy and admiration.

122
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,680
Jung Won should've just stopped
at admiring me.

123
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,410
Can people really control
feelings like that?

124
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,080
Everyone's capacity is different.

125
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,680
It's a shame.

126
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,190
Why can't she just accept
that some things are out of reach?

127
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,220
So to Cha Jung Won,

128
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,220
you're like her Abel?

129
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,760
I'm scared.

130
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,100
Of what Jung Won might become.

131
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,440
She can never go back
to how she was, can she?

132
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,570
Don't even feel sorry for her.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,170
That woman is disturbed.

134
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,840
No, a criminal.

135
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,580
Don't see her again.
Block her number.

136
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,050
Do you think that will change
how she feels?

137
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,720
Maybe if I listen to her more,
comfort her, and...

138
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,190
I'm telling you, there's no point.
She's not worth it.

139
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,160
A woman like her needs
to be cruelly abandoned.

140
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,790
It's the only way she'll learn.

141
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,590
We should just have her committed.

142
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,030
And if you won't let it slide?

143
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,830
If you can't forgive me?

144
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,640
My pretty daughter.
Mommy hurt you again, didn't I?

145
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,750
But sweetie, you know
I'm not just an ordinary mom.

146
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,290
If you really told Han Hye Ra
that you were Joo Young Chae,

147
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,660
then just like your father...

148
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,030
You'd...

149
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,390
drown me?

150
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,210
I was lying.
I didn't say I was Joo Young Chae.

151
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,410
I know.

152
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
You do?

153
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,180
Of course I do.

154
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,920
If you'd said
you were Joo Young Chae,

155
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,120
Han Hye Ra would have stormed in here
and caused a scene.

156
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,520
And you think Jin Tae Seok
would just sit back and do nothing?

157
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,620
By the way,

158
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,430
so Han Hye Ra gave you
her business card?

159
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,700
She must have asked for your name.
So, what did you tell her?

160
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,070
And where do you work?

161
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,640
- And your name?
- It's Cha Jung Won.

162
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,240
Are you out of your mind?

163
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,310
Wait,

164
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,010
actually, it's better that she thinks
you're Cha Jung Won.

165
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,680
That way,
if you run into Han Hye Ra again,

166
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,550
there's no risk of getting caught.

167
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,690
Might as well just tell me
to live as Cha Jung Won.

168
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,660
Only for as long as Cha Jung Won
needs to be you.

169
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,900
- That might be for the best.
- Mom!

170
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,830
Chairman.

171
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,400
Something urgent has come up.

172
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,810
Chairman Jin Tae Seok is making
a move?

173
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,370
Did they find out where
Park Kyung Shin is?

174
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,810
Yes. The tip came from
a very reliable source.

175
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,140
You know the one.

176
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,680
So where is he?

177
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,450
(The Crown Capital)

178
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,980
- He was here.
- There's no doubt.

179
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,520
He couldn't have gotten far.

180
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,020
It looks like he knew we were coming
and made a run for it.

181
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,820
Someone...

182
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,490
must have tipped him off.

183
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,760
(Kunhyang Group)

184
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,530
If we just barely missed him,

185
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,870
then someone must have
tipped him off.

186
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
It must be one of my secretaries.

187
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,540
How on earth are you
managing your people?

188
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,670
I'm sorry, sir. It was my mistake.

189
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,740
Find out who it is.

190
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,080
Which one of those jerks
betrayed me.

191
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,610
Yes, sir.

192
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,280
I was curious
what Gong Nan Sook was up to,

193
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,750
so I had my people dig around.

194
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,890
But this is turning into something
bigger than I expected.

195
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,460
This involves our daughter-in-law.

196
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,990
Big or small,
I need to be kept in the loop.

197
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,630
We also need to find out
who spirited away...

198
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,470
Cha Jung Won, Park Kyung Shin,
and Noh Min Gu.

199
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,900
I'll see to it.

200
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,510
Of all places,

201
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,880
why the Crown Capital?

202
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,950
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

203
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,960
Why do you keep summoning me, sir?

204
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,500
Because you're the real power here,
aren't you, Manager Hwang?

205
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,470
- I'm not in the mood for jokes.
- Did the chairman chew you out?

206
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,480
You still haven't found
Park Kyung Shin, have you?

207
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,180
I'm not at liberty to say.

208
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
So that's a no.

209
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,520
Is Cha Jung Won the prime suspect
in Park Kyung Shin's disappearance?

210
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,360
- Is that right?
- You'll have to ask the chairman.

211
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,920
So she is the prime suspect.

212
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,790
If there's nothing else,
I'll be on my way.

213
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,930
Manager Hwang,

214
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,770
you didn't say a thing.
I'm just a master at reading people.

215
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,780
Maybe you should go play
the claw machine.

216
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,180
My dear Manager Hwang.

217
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,560
So, Chairman Gong has Cha Jung Won.

218
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,830
Hey, Se Hoon.

219
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,400
What? Cha Jung Won
was at my sister's place?

220
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,090
Even burning in fire is too good
for a jerk like you.

221
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,060
I can't stand the sight of him.
Get him out of my face. Now.

222
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,430
Before I decide to bury him alive.

223
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,610
For goodness' sake.

225
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,850
Mom, how did you know to grab
Park Kyung Shin and bring him here?

226
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,280
Is there anything I don't know?

227
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,700
Somebody, help! I'm in here!

228
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,530
Seriously, this guy
must have a death wish.

229
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,870
Who are you people?
You're not the cops, right?

230
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,070
Who sent you?

231
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,940
Chairman Gong Nan Sook sent us
to escort you to a safe location.

232
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,950
Joo Young Chae's mother?

233
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,850
Hurry up. Kunhyang's Owner Risk Team
is on its way.

234
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,460
How am I supposed to know you work
for Chairman Gong Nan Sook?

235
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,130
We're running out of time,

236
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,830
so we'll have to do this
the hard way.

237
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,000
Hey. Wait, hold on!
Wait! Joo Young Chae!

238
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,940
Get Joo Young Chae! Get her!

239
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,150
So you planted your own people
inside Kunhyang.

240
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,820
It's Business 101.

241
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,560
You barely escaped,
thanks to my mom.

242
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,130
If Chairman Jin Tae Seok had gotten
his hands on you,

243
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,000
you would've confessed
to everything.

244
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,430
Thank you so much, Chairman.

245
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,040
But is it all right if I leave now?

246
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,040
I think my work here is done.

247
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,040
Let him go, Mom.
He'll just get in the way.

248
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,380
Sit.

249
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,950
What? Why?

250
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,790
But, ma'am...

251
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,790
Oh, Mother.
I'm on Joo Young Chae's side.

252
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,390
Why do you keep treating me
the same as Park Kyung Shin?

253
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,920
"Mother?" You little brat!

254
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,630
He's right, Mom. Just let him go.

255
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,560
This is why you still have
a long way to go.

256
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,470
Guys like Noh Min Gu
are the biggest headaches.

257
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,870
What do you think will happen
if we just let him go?

258
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,970
He could run to the police
and turn himself in,

259
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,010
or tell Cha Jung Won and Jin Se Hoon
that we have Park Kyung Shin.

260
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,180
No. Hey, I would never do that.

261
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,820
Young Chae, you don't trust me?

262
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,420
Hey, you really think I did
all this just for money?

263
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,450
Yes. It was all about the money.

264
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,920
What?

265
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,520
You paid him?

266
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:28,960
How much?

267
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
About 500,000 dollars.

268
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,560
Are you out of your mind?

269
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,170
You throw money around like you have
no idea what it's worth,

270
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,440
and you just took it?

271
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,340
- Hey, Noh Min Gu.
- Yes?

272
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,870
Whose money do you think that was?

273
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,940
Joo Young Chae's?

274
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,710
Don't make me laugh.
That's my money. Gong Nan Sook's.

275
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,050
Yes, of course.
I'll never forget your generosity.

276
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,090
I won't waste a penny of it.
I'll use it to turn my life around.

277
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,660
Says who?

278
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,990
Mom, just make a decision already!
I'm tired.

279
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,500
Do you really think what you did
was worth 500,000?

280
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,360
Absolutely. If things went wrong,
I'd be in cuffs.

281
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,430
My life was on the line...

282
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,370
Exactly. And money comes and goes.

283
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,470
- So cough it all up.
- I can't do that.

284
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,110
The 300,000 of it
went to pay off my crypto losses.

285
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,150
Another 100,000
paid for my mom's surgery back home.

286
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,750
And I need the last 100, 000
as seed money to start my life over.

287
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,320
- Please, just let me go.
- You're not going anywhere.

288
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,790
Not until you've
worked off every penny.

289
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,890
Then what am I supposed to do here?

290
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,600
You'll clean, do the laundry,
and cook.

291
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,600
And treat Miss Joo Young Chae here
with respect so you don't upset her.

292
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,900
Are you telling me I have to stay
here with these jerks?

293
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,070
Do you have a better idea?

294
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,910
So when exactly is this
"better idea" going to show up?

295
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,780
My goodness.

296
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,880
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

297
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,190
Chairman Jin, I'm honored
you're calling me yourself.

298
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,420
Tomorrow?

299
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,130
Yes. Of course, I'll come see you
in person. Yes.

300
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,240
What brings you here
before your shift?

301
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,480
Are you okay?

302
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,180
You must've been really shaken up.

303
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,680
What's with the sudden kindness?

304
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,550
Is this the brother-sister act?

305
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,860
(Tranquilizer, Alpdem)

306
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,560
I thought you had some guts,

307
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,060
but you lost your nerve the second
Joo Young Chae showed up?

308
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,860
How many of these did you even take?

309
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,130
What's the big deal
about taking sleeping pills?

310
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,470
If one pill doesn't work,
I take two, or three...

311
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,340
Because you want to escape
into sleep?

312
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,210
If I can escape,
even for a moment...

313
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,010
If you're doing this Pretend Play,
then do it right!

314
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,180
Get a grip!

315
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,780
- Stop it!
- And drop the polite act!

316
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,020
We have to act like siblings
even when we're alone, right?

317
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,520
The walls have ears.

318
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,290
What am I even doing? Darn.

319
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,070
Were you worried your "fake" sister
was struggling due to your real one?

320
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,200
Ha Neul.

321
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,310
Don't worry.

322
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,610
Even if I want
to run away sometimes,

323
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,980
my wish to marry into a rich family
is ten, a hundred times stronger.

324
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,420
So no matter how hard it gets,

325
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,450
you have no intention of quitting?

326
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,990
Young Chae...
No, I mean, Jung Won...

327
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,030
Do you know where she is?

328
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:57,530
Chairman Gong...
I mean, doesn't Mom say anything?

329
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,910
I can't believe she's keeping it
a secret from you too.

330
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,580
Madam Gong hasn't been answering
my calls since yesterday.

331
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,250
But I heard Mom took Jung Won,

332
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,450
so what do you think she's planning?

333
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,850
I should go.

334
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,850
I have a meeting with Cha Ki Beom.

335
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,920
My dad?

336
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,290
Why?

337
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,430
What?

338
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,530
Your dad and CEO Joo Ha Neul are
meeting at the department store?

339
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,700
Yes, just the two of them.

340
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,440
Does your family still think
he's your future husband?

341
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,140
How can I tell them I'm pretending
to be Joo Young Chae?

342
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,110
Did CEO Joo readily offer
to help you with this?

343
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,280
Not exactly readily,
but thankfully, yes.

344
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,010
I wonder what his motive is.

345
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,250
I really can't figure him out.

346
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,090
I'm worried something might happen.

347
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,090
Manager... I mean, Sung Hee,

348
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,790
could you please
keep an eye on them for me?

349
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,630
Okay.

350
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,490
First, I'll have to find out
which brand's store they're in.

351
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,030
That girl, Cha Jung Won.

352
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,470
The place where she used Noh Min Gu
to imprison Park Kyung Shin.

353
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,010
Why do you think it was
the Crown Capital?

354
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,140
That's a very good question.

355
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,880
I never dreamed she'd dare to hide
right under my nose.

356
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,650
That's impossible without help
from an insider.

357
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,520
Gosh, subordinates.
Even for the smallest of scraps,

358
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,220
their loyalties can't be kept
from shifting so easily.

359
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,030
It's always the one you trust most
who betrays you.

360
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,500
And why would you be an exception,
Chairman Jin?

361
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,500
You'd better keep a close eye
on your own people.

362
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,000
About Cha Jung Won.

363
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,240
She despises our daughter-in-law.
Do you know her?

364
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,850
Well, she came over to our house
a few times in high school,

365
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,310
so I know her by sight.

366
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,220
Did she seem twisted enough
to do something so awful?

367
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,760
Would Chairman Gong have paid
that much attention to her?

368
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,560
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Who knows what she was plotting?

369
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,600
It's true that there are many
two-faced people in this world.

370
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,040
When's the board meeting?

371
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,380
I have some documents
to prepare for it.

372
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,480
Please ensure this isn't leaked
before the wedding.

373
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,980
I'm trusting you to handle it.

374
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,830
She's a lot more composed
than I expected.

375
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,900
It's like she knows Park Kyung Shin
was in the Crown Capital warehouse,

376
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,370
and that he got away...

377
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,640
right before we arrived.

378
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,040
Do you think Chairman Gong
is involved?

379
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,450
She may not be involved in
Park Kyung Shin's imprisonment,

380
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,820
but I'm sure she had a hand
in his escape.

381
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,720
You think Chairman Gong has a mole
on Kunhyang's Owner Risk Team?

382
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,230
Look into all the locations...

383
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
connected to Chairman Gong.

384
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,330
Cha Jung Won, Park Kyung Shin,
and Noh Min Gu...

385
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,500
must be hiding out in one of them.

386
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,610
- Understood.
- Don't report this...

387
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,270
to Manager Hwang.

388
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,110
Handle this on your own.

389
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,210
I will keep that in mind.

390
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,020
You're saying...

391
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,350
Cha Jung Won is Cha Ki Beom's
adopted daughter?

392
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,120
That's right.

393
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,460
He thinks my Young Chae
is Cha Ki Beom's adopted daughter.

394
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,760
About Cha Jung Won.

395
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,770
Maybe the reason she did all this...

396
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,270
is something else entirely,
don't you think?

397
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,940
What are you getting at?

398
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,910
Surely you remember...

399
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,180
what you and I did...

400
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,380
twenty-five years ago.

401
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,290
Mr. Jin.

402
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,060
There's been an accident.

403
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,890
You have to help me.

404
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,830
You're telling me Joo Sang Cheol
died in some kind of accident?

405
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,200
And why is that my problem?

406
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,770
Mr. Jin,

407
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,070
you can't do this to me.

408
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,080
Don't you know I haven't signed
the investment papers yet?

409
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,750
If this project falls through,
your chairmanship is over too.

410
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,890
Goodness. Our Madam Gong
is getting feisty again.

411
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,590
I almost forgot.
I have the perfect solution.

412
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,630
Cha Ki Beom.

413
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,400
A real pain in the neck
works at that construction site.

414
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,970
Don't you worry about a thing.
Just go home and rest.

415
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,070
Tomorrow,

416
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,080
the sun will rise again.

417
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
Really?

418
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,980
Will the sun really rise tomorrow?

419
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,290
Why are you bringing that up now,
of all times?

420
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,090
That girl, Cha Jung Won,

421
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,330
is perhaps getting revenge for
her father's unjust imprisonment?

422
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,390
No.

423
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,130
How can you be so sure?

424
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,130
There is absolutely no way.

425
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,930
You can rest easy.

426
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,810
Gosh...

427
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,480
Lunch is almost ready.
Where are you off to?

428
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
What?

429
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,650
On a date.

430
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,660
Unbelievable. Does he think he can
cheat on me so openly?

431
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,490
Then again, it seems like
he's meeting someone important.

432
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,760
Right. Come on, this way.

433
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,230
Right in here.

434
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,640
Sir, it's really all right.
I rarely get to wear a suit.

435
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,000
Nonsense.

436
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,640
Aren't you going to wear one
for your wedding?

437
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,010
I already have a regular tailor.
You don't have to spend so much.

438
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,480
- What, you don't trust my taste?
- No, of course not.

439
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,650
I've run a dry cleaning shop
for 30 years.

440
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,420
I can tell how high-quality a suit is
just by looking at it.

441
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,750
Of course.

442
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,090
You think I dragged you here
because I have money to burn?

443
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,160
This is a one-time deal.

444
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,030
So just keep quiet and stay put.

445
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,100
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

446
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,070
Yes, could you show us
your finest wool suit?

447
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,070
Something that'll look perfect
on him.

448
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,940
Of course. Just a moment, please.

449
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
Okay.

450
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,610
This material and style are
our most popular right now.

451
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,210
Gosh, this is nice.

452
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
I don't think
this is really my style.

453
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,360
How about we look at something else?

454
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,890
Don't you trust my judgment?

455
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,060
Come on, try it on. Quick.

456
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
Right this way, sir.

457
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,610
Look at that!

458
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,850
See? It's all about the right match
between the man and the suit.

459
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,980
When you stand next to our Jung Won,
both of you...

460
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,220
will be dazzling, right?

461
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,590
But, sir,
this has got to be expensive.

462
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,390
It's fine. I'll just eat ramyeon
for a month.

463
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,300
I love eating ramyeon
more than anything in the world,

464
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,300
even more than grilled beef ribs.

465
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,430
- Come on.
- No, really. My wife, Mi Hyang,

466
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,640
Jung Won's mom won't let me
eat ramyeon. Says I'll get a gut.

467
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,510
I see.

468
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,310
- Ready to check out?
- Yes, how much is it?

469
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,810
Yes, your total comes
to 1,990 dollars.

470
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,790
That's just perfect.

471
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,920
- I'll take it.
- Yes, right this way.

472
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,830
Cha Ki Beom.

473
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,630
A man who wants to give
more than he has.

474
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,470
He has such a warm heart.

475
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,540
He's not the kind of person
who would hurt my father.

476
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,510
CEO Joo.

477
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Hello.

478
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,640
Manager Kim, hello.

479
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,850
Look who it is! Jung Won's mentor.

480
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,220
It's been a while, sir.

481
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,550
Manager Kim.

482
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,290
I have a favor to ask.

483
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,600
CEO Joo, these are the shoes
from the list you mentioned.

484
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,370
Father.

485
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,780
I'd like to buy you
a pair of shoes as a gift.

486
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,450
What? No.

487
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,310
I work at the dry cleaner's all day.

488
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,780
I have no use
for fancy shoes like these.

489
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,520
No, really, I don't.
I'm telling you.

490
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,390
Forget it.

491
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,220
Gosh!

492
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,430
Darn, those are sharp, right?

493
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,030
- Try them on.
- What? Me?

494
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,340
Goodness!

495
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,610
They look perfect on you.

496
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,710
You think so?

497
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,150
Gosh!

498
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,380
All right. Gosh!

499
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,420
These must cost a fortune.

500
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,020
Guess I'll eat ramyeon for ten days.

501
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,690
Ten days? Ramyeon?

502
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,730
Ramyeon... Gosh.

503
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,540
- Thank you.
- Yes.

504
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,370
I should get going.

505
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,410
I sure know
how to pick a son-in-law.

506
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,380
You're too kind.

507
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,090
So, CEO Joo Ha Neul...

508
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,500
is Ki Beom's future son-in-law?

509
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,170
(A Graceful Liar)

510
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,230
Can you please put in a good word
with Mom for me?

511
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,100
- Tell her to let me out.
- What do you think...

512
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,600
of Noh Min Gu and Park Kyung Shin?

513
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,300
The old woman said...

514
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,200
one is fated to be a fugitive,
and the other is doomed to die.

515
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,470
How do you know Ha Neul?

516
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,640
CEO Joo Ha Neul is marrying
my daughter soon.

517
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,140
About Cha Jung Won,
