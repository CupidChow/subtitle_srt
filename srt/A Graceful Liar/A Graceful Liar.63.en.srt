1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,270
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,880
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,340
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,180
Our stock price hasn't just dropped.
It's plummeted.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,720
We need to show that Kunhyang
is holding itself accountable.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,420
So I should show them
I'm taking responsibility,

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,760
- is that it?
- Yes, that's right.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,690
I object to
Vice President Jin's proposal.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,600
- I'm for it.
- I agree.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,700
I second it.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,300
What do you think you're all doing?

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,940
Are you trying to go up against me?

13
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,110
- So you're all in, is that it?
- Calm down, Chairman Jin.

14
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,480
It's not like we're deciding
right this second.

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,110
At the next board meeting,
we should discuss...

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,280
Vice Chairman Han's resignation
in more depth.

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,120
- Something along those lines...
- That won't be necessary.

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,900
I will step down...

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,400
from the position of vice chairman.

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,310
That is a very wise decision.

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,550
So impressive, Han Hye Ra!

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,280
Bravo!

23
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,150
Vice Chairman Han.

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,720
The vice chairman position
isn't a job...

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,390
you can just quit on a whim.

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,460
He's right.

27
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,690
You must think of Kunhyang Group
as a whole.

28
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,300
On one condition.

29
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,170
What condition?

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,800
Until a new vice chairman is named,
the interim vice chairman...

31
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,710
will be of my choice.

32
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,260
Voluntarily resigning?
That's not like you.

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,300
Why were you so reckless?
You didn't even say a word to me.

34
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,370
I had to restore
the group's image first.

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,740
I'm going to take responsibility
for my own mess.

36
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,070
But why just give up
your position right away?

37
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,710
What's there to worry about
when you're here holding the fort?

38
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,850
I'm a major shareholder,
Vice Chairman or not.

39
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,950
I still hold influence at Kunhyang.

40
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,720
That may be true,
but what about my reputation?

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,790
I knew you'd have been against it
if I told you beforehand.

42
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,160
And I had to save face for Se Hoon
as the heir to Kunhyang.

43
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,030
Se Hoon, that little punk!

44
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,830
He still misunderstands me.

45
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,300
About what happened
to his birth mother.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,810
I can practically hear Gong Nan Sook
cackling with joy.

47
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,980
She's so desperate to take you down,
and she's not even hiding it.

48
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,220
This is so satisfying!

49
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,250
I'm so happy...

50
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,390
I'm crying tears of joy.

51
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,390
Oh my goodness.
I have to stop laughing.

52
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,390
I'm going to get wrinkles.

53
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,960
The fact that Vice Chairman Han
voluntarily resigned...

54
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,030
makes you so happy
that you're actually crying?

55
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,270
Hey! Han Hye Ra,
who acts all high and mighty,

56
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,700
got her due, didn't she?

57
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,170
It's so satisfying!

58
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,870
It's like a massive weight
I've carried for ten years...

59
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,410
has just been lifted.

60
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,680
Watching Han Hye Ra's downfall...

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,250
is more entertaining
than making money.

62
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,190
I'm enjoying it too.

63
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,020
What?

64
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,090
Have you always just said
whatever popped into your head?

65
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,360
Even if you're dying to speak,
learn to hold it at least three times.

66
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,900
That's how one maintains
their dignity.

67
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,470
Excuse me. I've lost my appetite.

68
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,800
Sit down.

69
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,010
How can you leave the table
when your parents are still eating?

70
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,080
Her face, once so warm and soft,
just completely changed.

71
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,950
I felt like I'd been thrown naked
into the Arctic.

72
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,050
She knows you're not her daughter.
I'd say you got off easy.

73
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,290
If it were anyone else...

74
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,720
If it were me,
I could've had you drowned 39 times.

75
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,860
And it still wouldn't be enough.
That's right.

76
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,700
But if she resigns,
who's next in line?

77
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,430
Mom?

78
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,440
Everyone's telling me I should.

79
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,810
They're all making a huge fuss, but...

80
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,910
So who is it?

81
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,910
Vice Chairman Han
will decide for herself.

82
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,210
She's going to pick Jin Se Hoon.

83
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,510
Really?

84
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,920
Se Hoon is going to be
the vice chairman?

85
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,750
You could say it's just a formality
at this point.

86
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,860
They do what Gong Nan Sook says.
What choice do they have?

87
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,090
Don't just hand it to him
on a silver platter.

88
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,730
What?

89
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,570
Tell him to start treating me
like a real wife.

90
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,640
No. Tell him you'll make him
the vice chairman...

91
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,540
only if he loves me.

92
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,840
Do you really think you can bargain
for someone's heart?

93
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,110
When are you going to stop
being so childish?

94
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,450
Stay out of it.

95
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,280
You should worry about
winning Cha Jung Won back.

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,520
No, you're on the wrong track.

97
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,750
It's not Cha Jung Won.

98
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,290
Why don't you stick with Jin Se Mi?

99
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,430
You think I'm the same person I was
just because we spoke for a minute?

100
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,030
Don't you ever interfere
with who I see again.

101
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,970
You don't have the right.

102
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,010
He's really losing his temper.

103
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,440
Mom, you must've done something
to upset him, right?

104
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,850
He's just been so angry lately.

105
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,920
Young Chae, on second thought,
you have a point.

106
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,150
The vice chairman position is
like a prize.

107
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,620
I can't just hand it over
to Jin Se Hoon...

108
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,030
on a silver platter, can I?

109
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,490
Ask Chef Hong.

110
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,530
He'll know what to do.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,660
Chef Hong is mad at me these days.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,330
Still, I guess I'll try calling him,
just in case.

113
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,370
The number you have called
is currently unavailable.

114
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,510
Leave a message...

115
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,340
See? He's not picking up.
I told you he's mad.

116
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,810
But still,
how could he ignore my call...

117
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,450
even if he is upset?

118
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,880
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

119
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,560
To clean the octopus,
rub it with flour and rinse.

120
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,790
Rinse well, then marinate in lemon,
rice wine, and soup soy sauce.

121
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,060
What about the clams?

122
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,030
Scrub them with coarse salt,

123
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,200
and purge in salt water
for 30 minutes.

124
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,950
This hits the spot!

125
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,920
The secret to octopus soup is...

126
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,880
to let the natural flavors shine.

127
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,150
So you don't add chili seasoning, right?

128
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,120
They say
a single small octopus can make...

129
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,760
a collapsed cow jump to its feet.

130
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,590
It's the ultimate superfood.

131
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,900
When I was little,

132
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,570
I remember I used to eat this
on special occasions.

133
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,810
Did your mom make it for you?

134
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,380
You poor thing.

135
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Will I...

136
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,020
be able to pull this off?

137
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,480
Don't ask me.

138
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,450
If Chairman Gong finds out,
she’ll be really upset.

139
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,890
I heard you had a sixth sense.
It must be true.

140
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,790
Cosmic secrets will shorten my life.

141
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,430
You just learn cooking from me.

142
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,200
I'd like to take you on
as my apprentice.

143
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,200
I'd like that too.

144
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,870
Chef Hong, you're here.

145
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,210
What is that wonderful smell?

146
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,740
- Is it octopus soup?
- Please, have some.

147
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,960
This really hits the spot.

148
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,570
Please come cook in our kitchen
more often, Chef Hong.

149
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,070
Just say the word,
and I'll be here in a flash.

150
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,440
I haven't had octopus soup
in a long time.

151
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,980
It's so rich and hearty.
It really hits the spot.

152
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,950
And grilled Korean bellflower root too.

153
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,980
It's as healthy
as wild ginseng, right?

154
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,190
It's crispy on the outside
and moist inside. Please enjoy.

155
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,460
It's delicious.

156
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,690
But why is Chef Hong here?

157
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,930
Madam Gong will be furious
if she finds out.

158
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,490
I'm the one who's furious.

159
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Why?

160
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,730
Please enjoy your meal.

161
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,670
What's his deal?

162
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,880
Do you know what this is?

163
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,620
Octopus?

164
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,960
It's even yummier
than bean sprout soup.

165
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,360
It's octopus soup.
Eat up, my dear Su A.

166
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,030
You need to eat well
to grow up big and strong.

167
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm sorry,
but I have to excuse myself.

168
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,020
Is she feeling unwell?

169
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,260
She must have a sob story
about the octopus soup.

170
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,290
And she called me rude
when I got up during a meal.

171
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,770
Thank you for the meal.

172
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,540
Why?

173
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,040
For goodness' sake.

174
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,870
Can't we have
one peaceful meal around here?

175
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,080
Dad, this grilled bellflower root
is delicious.

176
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,950
It tastes like a cracker, so nutty.

177
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,050
You're right.
It's as crunchy as a cracker.

178
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,190
It's so delicious, isn't it, Se Mi?

179
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,260
What? Chef Hong is
at the Kunhyang house?

180
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,500
You didn't know?

181
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,670
The Grandma you serve
must be furious.

182
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,370
Oh my goodness. You brat,
you're not making any sense.

183
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,270
Chef Hong is just sulking
over nothing.

184
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,210
He holds a grudge.

185
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,980
What if the Kunhyang Family
ends up stealing Chef Hong?

186
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,520
I just called to tell you
to get a grip, Madam Gong.

187
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,020
You need to get a grip, Young Chae.

188
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,520
Just focus on getting Jin Se Hoon.

189
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,260
Don't let him get all hung up
on Cha Jung Won. You have to...

190
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,130
This is exactly why I hate talking
to you on the phone.

191
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,630
I'm hanging up!

192
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,100
Hey, wait! Young Chae!

193
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,070
That little brat!
I ought to just wring her wrist!

194
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,210
What's that?

195
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,880
It's nothing, ma'am.

196
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,180
I saw you hide it.

197
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,750
Hand it over
while I'm still asking nicely.

198
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,550
What is this? Wait a second.

199
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,090
It smells...

200
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,360
Spit it out! Now!

201
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,070
Did you poop out the USB?

202
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,370
I did.

203
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,740
Good job! You couldn't have done
any better!

204
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,640
But did you really have to bring it
to me like this?

205
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,540
Does this mean I no longer have to
clock in at the bathroom?

206
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,950
Right, of course.

207
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,250
Now, get back!

208
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,820
Let's just keep our distance
for now.

209
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,990
Thank you, ma'am.

210
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,560
- All right, go.
- Yes, ma'am!

211
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,490
Did he...

212
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,560
really have to bring it like that?

213
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,400
Still, he got it done.

214
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,470
Until a new vice chairman is named,
the interim vice chairman...

215
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,440
will be of my choice.

216
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,140
Does she already have
someone else in mind?

217
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,310
Who could it be?

218
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,420
The new vice chairman?

219
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,790
Did you hear something
from Chairman Gong Nan Sook?

220
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,890
Of course.

221
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,620
Who's the front-runner?

222
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,190
That all depends on me.

223
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,500
What's it got to do with you?

224
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,100
- Vice Chairman of Kunhyang Group...
- You're asking who I am?

225
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,070
The wife of Jin Se Hoon,
the next Chairman of Kunhyang Group?

226
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,740
Don't count your chickens yet.

227
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,340
I'm Chairman Gong's daughter.

228
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,910
Right now, no one has more pull
with Chairman Gong than I do.

229
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,280
Not sure what happened with Ha Neul,

230
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,780
but she had
a major falling-out with him.

231
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:01,090
I thought Chairman Gong backed me.

232
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,290
That might be the case,

233
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,190
but it’s not confirmed yet.

234
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,320
What? Are you messing with me?

235
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,730
- I'm dead serious.
- What?

236
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,200
I'm warning you that you'll lose
the vice chairman position...

237
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,970
if you keep treating me this poorly.

239
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,310
Let's say something were to happen
to my position.

240
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,750
Could you...

241
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,820
step in and take my place?

242
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Me? The Vice Chairman
of Kunhyang Group?

243
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,790
If that happened,
I would finally have some power.

244
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,730
The power to face...

245
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,330
Chairman Jin Tae Seok
and Gong Nan Sook.

Stop being so nosy, kiddo.

249
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,590
Were you hurt? Come here.

250
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,600
Let me see. It's not swollen...

251
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,530
Stop messing around.

252
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,900
Rather than me,

253
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,270
Se Mi is a better match...

254
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,070
for Ha Neul.

255
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,280
I'm at the playground
near your place, Jung Won.

256
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,220
I'll be waiting.

257
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,400
It's been two hours already.

258
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,070
There's no way he's still waiting.

259
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,200
Oh, this is warm.

260
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,270

261
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,240
I can wait longer.

262
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,810
Even if I freeze solid right here,

263
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,850
I'll keep waiting.

(Sculptural waves showcase

266
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,170
What are the odds...

267
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,640
of two different people
creating portfolios...

268
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,080
with the exact same composition?

269
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,280
A similar layout
is entirely possible.

270
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,080
But even the art style is similar.

271
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,290
So much so, it could be one person.

272
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,490
Team Leader Joo does have a point.

273
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,430
The arrangement itself
could easily be similar.

274
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,330
Why do you have it out for me?

275
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,770
Am I to blame for your failure
to get into the New York Royal Art School?

276
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,600
Is it my fault you got rejected
from Kunhyang?

277
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,340
Why do you make up lies
about the past...

278
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,740
to make a fool out of me?

279
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,840
There's no need to get so upset.

280
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,010
If you have nothing to hide,
then all you have to do is prove it.

281
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,450
That's right.

282
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,850
Anyone can see they look like
they were made by the same person.

283
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,520
If you didn't steal it,
you must have copied it.

284
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,790
Prove you didn't do it,
Joo Young Chae.

285
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,390
Why don't you prove that I stole it?

286
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,760
Shouldn't that come first?

287
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,070
Stop making baseless accusations.

288
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,530
There is a way to prove it.

289
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,870
Really?

290
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,370
What is it?

291
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,440
Why don't they do a live drawing,

292
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,610
and we can have it
professionally analyzed...

293
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,980
to see if the style matches
the design book?

294
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,080
What you just suggested
would be conclusive.

295
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,250
Are you okay with that?

296
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,960
See? She's hiding something.

297
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,900
Team Leader Joo,
get the analysis to clear this up.

298
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,700
That's the only way
to clear your name.

299
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Fine!

300
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,470
If it really is your work,
I'll apologize to you publicly.

301
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,840
But what if
it's the other way around?

302
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,480
You'll have to pay the price
for what you did.

303
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,050
You have to publicly admit you lied
about your education and career.

304
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,390
You have to accept it
if the New York Royal Art School...

305
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,720
revokes your degree.

306
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,930
If Kunhyang Group deems you
unqualified as a designer,

307
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,690
you'll have to resign.

308

That's never going to happen.

309
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,530
Just you wait.

310
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,270
Because you're the one
who's going to pay the price.

What if Joo Young Chae stole
Cha Jung Won's design?

314
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,480
I wouldn't put it past
Joo Young Chae.

315
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,280
The story about her being
a top anonymous designer...

316
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,580
in Paris and Milan...

317
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,520
- must be fake, right?
- We need to check the facts first.

318
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,690
And if it is true?

319

I have to protect you, Se Mi.

320

Then I have to
take Joo Young Chae's side.

321
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,800
What about Cha Jung Won?

322
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,540
So to keep
Joo Young Chae and me safe,

323
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,070
you have to hurt Cha Jung Won.

324
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,470
Can you really do that?

325
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,110
I'll handle it.

326
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,850

- It'll only be a few days.

nor Director Jin can find out before I do.

Yes, ma'am. I'll make sure of it.

333

whatever support she needs.

334
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,130
Understood.

- Call me if you need anything.
- I will, Secretary Yoon.

in the Design Team.

345

- is mine to take.
- Is it that serious?

00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,970
It'll be handled soon.

00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,720
Until a new vice chairman
is appointed,

350
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,920
who do you have in mind
for the interim vice chairman?

351
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,490
Se Hoon?

352
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,990
No.

353
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,890
Then who?

354
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,590
CEO Joo Ha Neul.

355
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,770
We're on break right now.

356
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,140
Come on in. Have a seat.

357
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,450
- What can I get for you?
- I've already had lunch.

358
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,120
Oh my, you didn't have to
bring anything.

359
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,660
So you finished
all those side dishes?

360
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,000
One good turn deserves another.
Couldn't you bring one steamed bun?

361
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,230
Would it have killed you?

362
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,370
- What's this?
- A present for you.

363
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,810
I won it for you in a claw machine.

364
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,070
Oh my gosh, it's so cute.

365
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,940
- Does it look like me?
- Not in the slightest.

366
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,610
You're much prettier.

367
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,880
I know. The doll's much prettier.

368
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,050
I meant you, Ms. Jo.

369
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,160
Why him?
He's not even with Kunhyang.

370
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,800
Once I step down,

371
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,300
we need someone who can keep
Chairman Gong Nan Sook in check.

372
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,040
As for Gong Nan Sook,
if Se Hoon and I join forces...

373
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,170
Se Hoon is no match
for Gong Nan Sook.

374
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
He accepted Joo Young Chae
eventually.

375
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,510
He could fall into her clutches
without you even knowing...

376
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,020
and deal a fatal blow
to Kunhyang Group.

377
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,390
And you think Joo Ha Neul
can beat Gong Nan Sook?

378
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,120
He may not be her biological son,
but he's still your son.

379
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,520
Joo Sang Cheol.

380
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,590
Joo Ha Neul's father.

381
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,800
Gong Nan Sook killed him.

382
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,600
So deep down in Ha Neul's heart,

383
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,840
there must be a deep-seated grudge
against Gong Nan Sook.

384
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,840
And that's not all.

385
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,080
If Se Hoon is interim Vice Chairman,
he'll never step down.

386
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,210
After that,
he'll go for the chairman's seat.

387
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,680
He'll want your seat.

388
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,320
Se Hoon's the heir anyway.

389
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,720
In time, it'll all work out...

390
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,960
And when will that be?

391
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,260
When do you actually plan on...

392
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,160
handing Kunhyang over to Se Hoon?

393
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,930
I haven't made any concrete plans...

394
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,100
That's proof that you're not ready.

395
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,740
In fact, until the day you die,

396
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,010
I bet you won't want
to hand over that seat to him.

397
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,180
It also gives us the perfect excuse
to change the culture...

398
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,550
from the outside.

399
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,680
We could also link
CEO Joo's business...

400
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,290
to Kunhyang's new ventures.
That's a real possibility.

401
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,250
That's not a bad idea.

402
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,120
But...

403
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,330
Do we really have to give
the vice chairman position...

404
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,130
- to Joo Ha Neul?
- It's temporary.

405
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,530
I...

406
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,900
am coming back.

407
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,670
Of course, you have to come back.

408
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,370
I'll have to think about it.

409
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,680
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

410
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,820
What is this nonsense
you're spouting?

411
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,150
Why would Han Hye Ra make my son,
Joo Ha Neul, the Vice Chairman?

412
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,960
I heard her out, and it makes sense.

413
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,420
If Se Hoon is appointed,

414
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,430
the public will claim it's nepotism,
and things will get even messier.

415
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,930
So, because my son is an outsider
and a major Kunhyang shareholder,

416
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,200
he's the right man for the job?

417
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,670
Why does Han Hye Ra suddenly want
to support Ha Neul?

418
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,510
I have a really bad feeling
about this.

419
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,480
Nothing's been decided yet.
I have the final say.

420
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,520
So, what's your take?

421
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,220
Obviously, I'm leaning more
toward Se Hoon.

422
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,260
But the idea of using Joo Ha Neul
isn't a bad idea.

423
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,460
Darn it, why's this so confusing?

424
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm getting a call.
Let's talk again later or meet up.

425
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,700
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

426
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,970
Darn it! I could've hung up first.

427
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,040
What on earth is going on?

428
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,380
Han Hye Ra.

429
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,910
What are you up to?

430
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,450
Are you saying Vice Chairman Han
backs CEO Joo Ha Neul...

431
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,690
as the interim Vice Chairman?

432
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,390
- It was unexpected for me, too.
- How is that even possible?

433
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,660
He's not even a board member
who's spent years at Kunhyang Group.

434
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,460
Why Joo Ha Neul so suddenly?

435
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,930
It's temporary. Not a big deal.

436
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,270
It's only until a new vice chairman
is elected.

437
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,200
Don't tell me...

438
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,200
you agree with Vice Chairman Han.

439
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,710
Of course, my first thought was you.

440
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,510
But Joo Ha Neul...

441
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,280
isn't a bad choice
for a temporary solution.

442
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,860
(Kunhyang Group)

443
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,630
You wanted to see me, Chairman?

444
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,130
What are you doing here?

445
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,730
I asked him to come see me.

446
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,380
I won't let Joo Ha Neul
get that vice chairman position!

447
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,020
What did you just say?

448
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,150
Joo Ha Neul for Vice Chairman?

449
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,730
- What are you doing here?
- I came to talk with you...

450
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,130
about the Design Team,

451
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,960
but it seems
you've got a much bigger problem.

452
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,230
You have to get that position.

453
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:10,970
No matter what it takes.

454
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,540
Don't worry. I'll get it.

455
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,440
- I'm the heir to Kunhyang Group.
- When?

456
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,280
- After the Chairman dies?
- What?

457
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,850
It seems the Chairman
will outlive you by a long shot.

458
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,380
Like King Yeongjo,

459
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,220
will he consider
giving up the throne...

460
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,950
once he's well past 80?

461
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,990
I do have a brilliant idea, though.

462
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,360
I'm just not sure
you could pull it off.

463
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,930
You want me to be the interim
Vice Chairman?

464
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,870
Vice Chairman Han is adamant.
I haven't made my decision yet,

465
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,740
and before I do,

466
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,940
I thought I should hear from you,
since you're the one involved.

467
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,650
I haven't given it
any serious thought.

468
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,050
Think about it seriously.
We don't have much time.

469
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,020
Since it's a temporary role
until a new one is elected,

470
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,430
I will do my best
and see it as a chance to learn.

471
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Please give me this chance.

472
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,000
Hye Ra really is a good judge
of character.

473
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,670
Now I see why she chose you.

474
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,970
Thank you for the compliment.

475
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,970
It's too early to say thank you.

476

(Kunhyang Group)

477
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,390
Start dating
my daughter, Se Mi, first.

478
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,650
Or better yet, get engaged to her.

479
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,090
Do that, and I'll approve you
as the interim Vice Chairman.

480
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,260
No, I might even appoint you
as the permanent Vice Chairman.

481
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,800
Chairman, what is
the meaning of this?

482
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,900
Are you asking me to take
the vice chairman position...

483
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,070
and marry into your family
in exchange?

484
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,410
What's the big deal?
As a win-win for both families,

485
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,170
there's no better arrangement
than marriage.

486
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,910
Wait, did you also...

487
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,210
threaten Jung Won to stop seeing me?

488
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,610
Threaten her?

489
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,350
That's a strong word.

490
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,690
That things might get dangerous
for you.

491
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,550
So stay away. That's all.

492
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,290
The vice chairman position,
dependent on my engagement to Se Mi.

493
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,400
I refuse.

494
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,810
So she foolishly...

495
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,710
shut me out because of

You're not taking my calls
and won't come see me.

is going to make me give up?

So, did you decide to accept
the vice chairman position?

Do you really want me
to become the Vice Chairman?

512

to anything that's mine, Ha Neul.
