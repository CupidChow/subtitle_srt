1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,210
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,240
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,310
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,350
(Episode 79)

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,980
If I wanted you dead,

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,420
you already would be,

7
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,220
Father.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,060
Don't call me Father!

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,030
It's disgusting!

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,560
How could someone like you,

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,700
a child raised with no roots,
be my own flesh and blood?

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,470
And what do you mean
by "having no roots?"

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,170
As my blood, you should at least...

14
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,170
I should what?

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,780
You'd never dare to aim your arrows
at Kunhyang...

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,550
or trick my son into marrying you.
You never should have done that!

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,090
So I'm a disgrace to you?

18
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,990
You're a humiliation.

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,360
How could my own blood...

20
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,090
be shared with someone like you?

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,330
I was born to you and Han Hye Ra,
the woman you love most.

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,970
- And you still find me humiliating?
- Hye Ra is different!

23
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,940
She is a flower that I cultivated.

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,470
My personal flowerbed,
grown beautiful only in my embrace.

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,940
How disgraceful.

26
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,910
I'm the one who's disgraced.

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,980
- What?
- That you gave me your blood,

28
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,990
and that you're the father
who gave me flesh and bone,

29
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:23,920
is what's truly horrific
and disgusting.

30
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,190
Then why did you save me?

31
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,690
You had the chance to kill me.

32
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,890
I wanted to.

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,840
But I had to be different.

34
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,840
Then what is it you plan to do?

35
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,740
I'll show you that living
is a fate worse than death.

36
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,010
You'll see everything you love
crumble before your eyes.

37
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,980
So keep your eyes wide open
and watch.

38
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,620
Cha Jung Won!

39
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,830
Hwang Jung Guk! You betrayed me?

40
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,260
I have merely found a new master.

41
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,530
How may I be of service?

42
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,400
Shut his noisy mouth.

43
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,770
Yes, ma'am.

44
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,310
Jin Tae Seok.

45
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,440
Though you're here in your palace,
the Kunhyang estate,

46
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,650
no one in the Kunhyang family
will ever know you're here.

47
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,850
You'll spend the rest of your days
alone in here,

48
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,250
playing your little game
of being chairman.

49
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
She woke up?

50
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,250
Mom, are you okay?

51
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,660
Jung Won.

52
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,760
You're awake.

53
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,930
I'll leave you two to talk.

54
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,250
Are you okay?

55
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,280
Are you hurt anywhere?

56
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,450
You didn't drink the poison,
did you?

57
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,790
You absolute fool.

58
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,090
You're the one who drank it.
You drank it for me.

59
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,630
You could have died because of me.

60
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,540
Why would you do something
like that?

61
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,470
Because I would rather die...

62
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,580
than have anything happen to you.

63
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,150
My baby...

64
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,220
How much pain you must have been in.
How hard it must have been.

65
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,560
How did you endure it
for all these years?

66
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,390
My poor child.

67
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm so sorry, Jung Won.

68
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,470
I've missed this so much.

69
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,340
A mother's scent.

70
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,270
Honey.

71
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,560
Who had the nerve
to pull something like that?

72
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,130
How dare they snatch prey from me
right under my nose?

73
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,570
Only Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul
knows that place is a watery grave.

74
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,770
And that would be me.

75
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,240
Ha Neul, it wasn't you, was it?

76
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,010
Only the three of us know
that place exists.

77
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,850
Young Chae knows too.

78
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,350
But she wouldn't dare do that
behind my back.

79
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,190
I have no reason
to do something like that.

80
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,020
I'd have finished him off there.
I don't need to intercept him.

81
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,530
That's true. Then who could it be?

82
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,900
You don't think
Young Chae told Se Hoon to do it?

83
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Absolutely not.

84
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,900
Jin Se Hoon would probably want
Jin Tae Seok to disappear for good.

85
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,140
At least, deep down.

86
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Cha Jung Won?

87
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,210
Yes, that girl...

88
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,920
tends to charge in recklessly
without a second thought.

89
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,390
I'll look into it myself.

90
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,160
Still no word on where my father is?

91
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,760
Yes, my mother has no clue either.

92
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,930
I hope he's gone for good.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What?

94
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,200
Don't you feel the same way?

95
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,770
What are you talking about?

96
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,410
How could you even think that?

97
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,850
If your father disappears,
Chairman Han will be powerless.

98
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,080
- Then who will be the new chairman?
- Joo Ha Neul?

99
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,790
Not Vice Chairman,
but Chairman Ha Neul?

100
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,590
- Is Kunhyang Group a joke?
- You think I'll become chairman?

101
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,130
Of course.

102
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,390
Mom's awake.

103
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,140
- Mother, we were so worried.
- We're so relieved you are better.

104
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,810
I heard you lost the baby.

105
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,250
Are you okay?

106
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,150
I'm physically fine now,

107
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,690
but I'm still heartbroken.

108
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,420
We can always have another baby,

109
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,790
but I was worried sick
that something would happen to you.

110
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,500
Se Hoon was too.

111
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,770
But what about your father?

112
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,410
Why the silence?

113
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,280
Han Hye Ra's awake?
All right, got it.

114
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,720
That's a relief.

115
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,920
She'd have died for her daughter.

116
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,090
Respect.

117
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,730
Are you taking Han Hye Ra's side
right in front of me?

118
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,100
You want me to send you over to her?

119
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,400
Really? I can live
with the Kunhyang family?

120
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,140
Why do you look so happy?
It's irritating. Are you serious?

121
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,470
Because Ms. Young Chae lives there.

122
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,780
- In your dreams. Let's go.
- Where to?

123
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,050
- Han Hye Ra's awake. We have to go.
- In the middle of the night?

124
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,020
Won't that hurt your image?

125
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,790
My image? For once,
you said something smart,

126
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,960
but we need to find out
where Jin Tae Seok is.

127
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,120
Where on earth could
Chairman Jin be?

128
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,660
That's why we're going, you idiot!
To find out!

129
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,900
- Seriously!
- Sorry...

130
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,010
Where is Jin Tae Seok?

131
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,410
I don't know.

132
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,310
Neither do Jung Won and Madam Gong.

133
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,650
You don't know either,
Manager Hwang?

134
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,650
That's right.

135
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,950
Who do you think you are,
sitting here?

136
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,520
I have nothing for you. Get out now.

137
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,990
- What's wrong?
- Vice Chairman Joo, stay out of it.

138
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,100
Ms. Jo Mi Hyang, I'm sorry.

139
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,700
Are you deaf?
I said get lost, so get lost!

140
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,040
It's not entirely your fault,
Manager Hwang.

141
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,880
So, Jin Tae Seok was the root
of all this evil after all.

142
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,990
Young Su A may have
survived back then,

143
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,160
but another precious life was lost.

144
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,030
My sister's life
was in Jin Tae Seok's hands,

145
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,390
but that's no excuse.

146
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,800
I made the wrong choice.

147
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,630
I should have found out
what happened to that child...

148
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,200
and I should have seen it
through to the end.

149
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,870
So that's why you...

150
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,410
kept visiting Ms. Jo.

151
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,250
I'm also guilty
of watching Cha Ki Beom die.

152
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,150
It's a heavy one.

153
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,650
For the rest of your life,

154
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,620
you'll just have to atone for it.

155
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,260
Is atonement even possible?

156
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,530
Let me ask you one more thing.

157
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,230
Jin Tae Seok.

158
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,140
Do you really not know where he is?

159
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,070
Please don't tell...

160
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,680
Chairman Han
and Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul...

161
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,510
that I have Jin Tae Seok locked up
at the Kunhyang house.

162
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,280
Are you trying to protect them
from any responsibility?

163
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,250
Please.

164
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,630
I don't know anything about that.

165
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,610
Be honest with me.

166
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,980
Jin Tae Seok.

167
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,980
Jung Won, you know where he is,
don't you?

168
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,920
- Why do you think that?
- Because if I were you,

169
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,260
I wouldn't have let Jin Tae Seok
get away with it.

170
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,130
If I were you...

171
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,770
I'm sorry.
Calling you "Mother" still...

172
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,100
I understand.

173
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,040
If it were you,

174
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,470
- what would you have done to him?
- I gave birth to you,

175
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,310
and he tried to kill you,
his own daughter.

176
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,080
- I would never forgive him.
- What if you were Jin Tae Seok?

177
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,890
You, Chairman Han.

178
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,150
If I were Jin Tae Seok?

179
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,860
Even if I couldn't fully atone...

180
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,930
for all the evil things I've done,

181
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,160
I'd get on my knees
before you, Jung Won,

182
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,830
and I'd like to think
I would beg for forgiveness.

183
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,440
- But...
- He would never do that, would he?

184
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,440
Don't try to find out anything more.

185
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,550
Whatever I might end up doing
to Jin Tae Seok,

186
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,580
please let me handle it my way.

187
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,890
You should come take a look at this.

188
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,000
Chairman Han.

189
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,230
I heard you're awake. Get out here.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, my.

191
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,240
Chairman Gong, you came rushing over
at this ungodly hour.

192
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,010
Were you that eager for me
to wake up?

193
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,550
So it's true. Chairman Gong is here.

194
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,850
Mom, what are you doing?

195
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,790
You could have at least waited
until morning.

196
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,790
My mother-in-law
is incredibly impatient.

197
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,760
Haven't you ever heard,
"Strike while the iron is hot?"

198
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,700
By the way, you're looking
a little too well, aren't you?

199
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,100
Are you disappointed?

200
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,300
Disappointed? What a thing to say.

201
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,170
I'm just parched from rushing over.

202
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,140
Get me a nice cup of iced tea.

203
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,050
Han Hye Ra, you're still kicking.
Full of energy, I see.

204
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,750
Maybe it's from all that sleep,
but your skin looks even better now.

205
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,220
You're infuriating.

206
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,460
I guess I really am alive and well.

207
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,660
I must be, if I'm here trading barbs
with the vulgar Gong Nan Sook.

208
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,030
You know how much I hate
being called vulgar.

209
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,370
- But fine. I'll let it slide today.
- How touching.

210
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,270
Spit it out. Why did you come here
in the middle of the night?

211
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,000
There are two things
I'm curious about.

212
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,470
And the first is?

213
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,440
Why did you drink the poisoned wine
meant for Cha Jung Won?

214
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,150
You said you weren't motherly,
but you're a mother after all?

215
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,710
My maternal instinct?

216
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,550
I don't know about all that.
It's just...

217
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,820
Just what?

218
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,790
I felt like I had to be
the one to end it.

219
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,960
But Jin Tae Seok has vanished.

220
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,990
Did he run away?

221
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,130
Or did you maybe spirit him away
and hide him somewhere?

222
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,100
I only woke up a few hours ago.

223
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,870
Someone from the Kunhyang family.

224
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,310
One of you must know where he is.

225
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,680
Oh, dear. Since I'm already here,

226
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,950
I might as well
have a look around for him.

227
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,350
Manager Gu, let's go.

228
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,690
Yes, ma'am.

229
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,420
Don't just go on ahead.
Stick with me!

230
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,220
- Yes, ma'am.
- I almost slipped.

231
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,180
Look at her wearing this.
It's not even pretty.

232
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,510
What are you doing?
You really think he's in there?

233
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,580
Get over here.

234
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,020
- It looks like a secret door...
- You've got to be kidding me.

235
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,020
Where could he be?

236
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,860
- What's this?
- Do you plan on day drinking?

237
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,030
Let go and just follow me.

238
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,070
What do you want me to do?

239
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,670
Quietly follow Gong Nan Sook
and see where she's snooping around.

240
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,740
Understood.

241
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,090
What are you doing here?

242
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,990
Was it a good mother-daughter
reunion with Han Hye Ra?

243
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,790
Looks like you've been crying.

244
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,530
Would you like some tea?

245
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,600
I'm not here to have tea with you.
I'm here to check something.

246
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,900
Open this door.

247
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,600
- What are you doing?
- Open it now.

248
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,140
The keepsakes
of Se Hoon's biological mother...

249
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,540
are kept in this room. It's private.

250
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,380
Only Chairman Jin Tae Seok
has the key.

251
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,760
It really is locked.

252
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,830
You don't have Jin Tae Seok in here,
do you?

253
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,670
- I don't think he's in this room.
- And how would you know?

254
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,240
So this is where you were.

255
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,440
Chairman Han has a late-night snack.
This way, please.

256
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,140
A late-night snack?

257
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,610
The Kunhyang family must have heard
that I love a late-night snack.

258
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,950
I wonder what's ready.

259
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,950
Let's go see.

260
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,880
I've prepared something simple.

261
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,350
Chef Hong.
You're living at Kunhyang house now?

262
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,950
I've decided to moonlight here
until Chairman Han fully recovers.

263
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,660
Your grandma should stay with me.
Or I'll be seriously upset.

264
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,590
I'm afraid that's not up to me.

265
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,030
Oh my goodness.

266
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,270
First thing you did when you woke up
was poach my chef?

267
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,640
- I had nothing to do with it.
- I'm the one who asked him to come.

268
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,000
Mother needs her healthy meals,

269
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,180
but Se Hoon hasn't been able
to eat well lately.

270
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,680
Thanks, Young Chae.

271
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,120
How sweet.

272
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,300
We have to move Jin Tae Seok
somewhere else.

273
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,770
Do you think someone's on to us?

274
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,910
Secretary Yoon.

275
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,680
Once everyone is asleep,

276
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,910
I'll move him quietly.

277
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,620
You must keep this from Ha Neul.

278
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,950
He's very worried about you.

279
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,090
Vice Chairman Joo, I mean.

280
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,890
It might be better
to ask for his help.

281
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,560
If someone has to do
something reckless,

282
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,590
it should just be me.

283
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,530
Understood.

284
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,170
Was it Jung Won?

285
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,640
There's no way
she could have done that by herself.

286
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,710
You think Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul
might be helping her?

287
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,270
Jung Won...

288
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,110
would never want to put
Vice Chairman Joo in danger.

289
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,250
We'll have to look into it.

290
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,270
- Se Hoon.
- Father, are you okay?

291
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,410
I knew I could count on you, my son.

292
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,780
- Who did this to you?
- Cha Jung Won.

293
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,510
Then again,

294
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,680
if I were Jung Won,
I wouldn't have let you off so easy.

295
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,780
What?

296
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,650
Are you siding with Cha Jung Won
right now?

297
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,490
Why did you kill my mother?

298
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,330
Who told you that nonsense?

299
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,690
It wasn't me,
and it was Gong Nan Sook!

300
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,060
Stop with the lies!

301
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,800
It turns out you...

302
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,070
really are the one
who killed my mother.

303
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,070
Se Hoon. This is not the time
to argue about that.

304
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,570
The important thing is...

305
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,480
for you to get me out of here now.

306
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,280
And why should I do that?

307
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
If you were to disappear forever,

308
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,250
- What did you say?
- I'd instantly become chairman.

309
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,890
I fail to see any reason
why I should help you.

310
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,160
I'm your father.

311
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,430
That reason alone...

312
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,930
is more than enough for you
to get me out of here.

313
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:57,100
Did you forget what you taught me
since I was a kid?

314
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,910
"The greatest danger in business
is personal feelings."

315
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,610
"And be most wary
of your own blood."

316
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,940
Fine. Then let me make you
a business proposition.

317
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,610
Vice President Jin Se Hoon.

318
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,950
I have a Swiss bank account.

319
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,920
A slush fund?

320
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,090
But the slush fund...

321
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,420
wasn't that exclusively managed
by Chairman Han?

322
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,260
- That's what everyone thinks.
- So behind Chairman Han's back,

323
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,660
do you have a secret slush fund
you've been managing?

324
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,600
That's what any businessman
would do.

325
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,700
Do you think I'd leave Kunhyang's
slush fund in her hands alone?

326
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,440
Only an idiot would do that.

327
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,840
Get me out,

328
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,680
and I'll give you the account number
for that slush fund.

329
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,720
And I'll put you in charge of it.

330
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,450
And after that?

331
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,190
Make me the chairman of Kunhyang.

332
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,960
Make me the next chairman.

333
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,260
I want to climb to the very top
of Kunhyang Group.

334
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,370
Unlike Gong Nan Sook,
who's always changing her mind,

335
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,430
Se Hoon is the better bet.

336
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,200
Tell me.

337
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,540
As soon as you get me out,
I'll hand over the Swiss account.

338
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,210
No, it has to be
the other way around.

339
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,580
You tell me first.
Then I'll get you out.

340
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,680
- Jin Se Hoon!
- This, too,

341
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,920
is just another business tactic
I learned from you.

342
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,660
Have a pleasant evening.

343
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,970
Why do I keep waking up like this?

344
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,970
Manager Gu, let's find
a guilt-free snack.

345
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,140
Gosh, it's cold.

346
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,280
Goodness, you startled me.
You must be clairvoyant.

347
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,850
You even know when my old stomach
is rumbling.

348
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,650
Grandma says...

349
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,120
that a villain worse than you
has been revived,

350
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,120
- and you should brace yourself.
- More evil than me?

351
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,230
Jin Tae Seok?

352
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,760
- That jerk is coming back?
- Believe it or not.

353
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,170
Good night.

354
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,030
Wait a minute.

355
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,810
Where in the world
did that come from?

356
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,540
Jin Tae Seok is coming back?

357
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,090
- What are you doing here?
- Vice President Jin.

358
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,090
Why are you here?

359
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,660
Are you helping Jung Won?

360
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,590
What are you talking about?

361
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,030
Se Hoon, don't try to dig too deep.

362
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,930
It's for your own good.

363
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,940
The one who's in too deep...

364
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,840
seems to be you.

365
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,640
Chairman Han must be
backing Cha Jung Won.

366
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,410
And Joo Ha Neul is with them, too.

367
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,150
I hoped you'd be on my side,

368
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,980
but if you're siding
with my enemies,

369
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,450
then you're my enemy too.

370
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,690
Remember that.

371
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,620
Manager Hwang Jung Guk.

372
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,770
We have a huge problem.

373
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,640
What is it?

374
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,120
There's no way
he escaped on his own.

375
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,790
Someone had to have helped him.

376
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,060
Just a moment ago,

377
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,160
I ran into
Vice President Jin Se Hoon.

378
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,000
What's the matter?
Don't you approve?

379
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,370
Don't you think using
the entire amount...

380
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,040
to buy up Kunhyang stocks
is too risky?

381
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,540
Now is the time
to go all-in on Kunhyang.

382
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,450
This is our golden opportunity
to shake up Kunhyang's management.

383
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,280
Trust my judgment.

384
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,920
This will raise suspicions
about David Kay's activities.

385
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,790
It could even be mistaken
for a dummy account.

386
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,690
If we do nothing for fear of risk,
nothing will ever happen.

387
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,760
But...

388
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,360
what if we succeed?

389
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,260
Your shares would rise
to 11 percent.

390
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,100
That puts you ahead of Jin Se Hoon
who holds ten percent.

391
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,700
It would pave the way for you
to take control of Kunhyang.

392
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,820
I can't believe Cha Jung Won
is now looking for me.

393
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,820
Jin Tae Seok.

394
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,120
- Did you sneak him out?
- What are you talking about?

395
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,420
I just saw him locked up
a minute ago.

396
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,230
So it's true
you met with Jin Tae Seok.

397
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,100
What do you think you're doing?

398
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,370
Young Chae, it's a misunderstanding.
We were just talking about work.

399
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,010
Stay out of this, Se Hoon!

400
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,340
You witch! You home-wrecker!

401
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,320
I don't have the slightest interest
in Se Hoon.

402
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,650
Stop making a fool of yourself!
It's pathetic to watch.

403
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,660
Young Chae, are you okay?

404
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
It's already swelling up.

405
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,670
- Young Chae!
- This is all your fault.

406
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,170
We're sleeping
in separate rooms tonight.

407
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,510
(Kunhyang Group)

408
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,850
What's the concept?

409
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,550
It's minimal chic
for the fall and winter collection.

410
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,990
Minimal chic?

411
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,890
It's about the silhouette's beauty
rather than flashy embellishments.

412
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,830
It's about the sharp,

413
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,900
yet elegant look
of a professional woman.

414
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,730
So it's a clear departure from
the spring and summer collection.

415
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,940
We've paired oversized shoulder coats
and wide-leg slacks...

416
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,640
with asymmetrically draped knits.

417
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,940
It's meant
to evoke a cold and urban image,

418
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,310
but we used wool and cashmere
to create a sense of softness.

419
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,980
So, a cold design
with warm materials?

420
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,520
I'm dying to ask
for a million revisions,

421
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,620
but it's edgy. I really love it.

422
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,280
Is there anywhere special
you'd like to go?

423
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,610
Lunch breaks are always so short.

424
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
I took a half-day off.

425
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,220
So I'm completely free from now on.

426
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,350
Perfect.

427
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,260
Oh my!

428
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,760
(Korean Honeycomb Toffee)

429
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
Oh my, just a little more.

430
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,970
There we go.

431
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,440
Success!

432
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,040
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

433
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,980
Here.

434
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,820
Oh, no...

435
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,820
I can't believe
I can't even do this simple thing.

436
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,840
Look right here at the camera...

437
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,270
Here we go. One, two, and three.

438
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,440
(Please look at the camera.)

439
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,020
Something unexpected
is coming your way.

440
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,090
Is it a good thing or a bad thing?

441
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,490
Whether it's good or bad
doesn't matter.

442
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,400
The point is
that it's going to happen.

443
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,970
Once it does, you'll never be able
to go back to how things were.

444
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,310
You'll see it through
to the very end...

445
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,680
no matter what.

446
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,920
So you're saying
I could get what I want?

447
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,220
It will come true.

448
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,760
It just might not be
in the way you imagine.

449
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,770
I see someone
holding their ground all alone.

450
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,640
Holding their ground?

451
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,180
It means they refuse to fall.

452
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,690
They hold a sword,
but they don't brandish it.

453
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,720
They only move
when they know where to strike.

454
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,660
So I'll have a clear target?

455

00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060

00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,260
How are you here?

(A Graceful Liar)

460
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,160
I don't want you to struggle...

461
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,600
and sacrifice yourself
to protect me.

462
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
I'll take care of it all.

463
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,400
I'll fire the arrow
and wield the blade myself.

464
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,440
I'm the one who'll protect you, Mom.
I'd risk my life for it.

465
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,440
What?
Jin Tae Seok was actually released?

466
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,180
Did you really mean to kill me?

467
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,980
Why do you keep showing your face?
Do you have a death wish?

468
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,450
Ha Neul!
Beat him as much as you like!

469

I'll take care of the consequences.

Turn yourself in! Confess everything
you've done wrong.
