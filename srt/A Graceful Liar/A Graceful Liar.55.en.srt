Chairman Jin went himself?

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,380
Yes, he went alone
without Manager Hwang.

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,990
Min Jung, I need you to go.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,060

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,540
This is Han Hye Ra.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,310
You know Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra,
don't you?

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,420
Did she steal your artwork?

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,260
She did.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,670
But...

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,600
I was well compensated for it.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,670
Compensation?

17
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,240
I had physical and mental issues.

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,150
If it weren't for Vice Chairman Han,
I wouldn't be alive today.

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,150
Has it ever occurred to you
that you were being used?

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,660
It was a mutual agreement.

21
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,660
I did it to survive.

22
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,600
Are you saying you sold your career
to Vice Chairman Han?

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,970
Yes.

(Ward A)

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,780
Hwang Mi Soo is actually
grateful to Vice Chairman Han.

26
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,720
Or she's been groomed.

27
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,070
Something's not right.

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,770

What brings you here?

31
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,330
I should be asking
you the same thing.

32
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,930
You're not going to answer me?

33
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,140
I heard...

34
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,110
you were there...

35
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,040
when my father passed away.

36
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,220
Unfortunately, I was.

37
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,720
You didn't call for an ambulance
on purpose,

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,190
did you?

(Naeil Nursing Home)

40
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,160
Yes, is something wrong with my mom?

41
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,190
Did you say my mom
regained consciousness?

43
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,850

What happened?

49
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,410
What?

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,510
You think Jin Tae Seok
bribed the doctor?

51
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,650
Stop him. I don't care how.

Come on, Mom. Open your eyes.

- Get the defibrillator.

What are you accusing me of?

70
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,790
That I intentionally
let your father die?

71
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,950
I believe you're capable of it.

72
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,360
Words like bold or cheeky
aren't enough to describe you.

73
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,170
Do you think I'll go easy on you
because you're Hye Ra's daughter?

74
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,870
I know you'll be the opposite
because I am her daughter.

75
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,140
I'm a thorn in your side, aren't I?

76
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,150
You really are just like Hye Ra.

Back when she was Young Sun.

78
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,420
You remind me of her
when I first fell in love.

79
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,390
Even now, I'm holding back...

80
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,260
because I don't want to hurt Hye Ra.

81
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,470
I wouldn't provoke me
if I were you, kid.

What?

Se Hoon.

96
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,260
She got here before I did,

97
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,800
and my mother passed away
in that time.

98
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,730
Doesn't that seem strange
to you, Father?

99
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,720
The funeral comes first.

100
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,370
Where is Hwang Mi Soo?

101
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,470
She has been moved
to a safe location.

102
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,440
Shouldn't we send her abroad
at this point?

103
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,340
That's not my decision to make.

104
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,710
How did you know to go there,
Secretary Yoon?

105
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,810
Did Vice Chairman Han send you?

106
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,280
You'll have to ask
Vice Chairman Han yourself.

107
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,420
Secretary Yoon!

108
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,920
- What about my sister?
- She's safe. Don't worry.

109
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,160
Why are they here?

110
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,790
They helped me get Hwang Mi Soo out.

111
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,330
Who was it?
Who tried to harm my sister?

112
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,240
It appears to have been
Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

113
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,950
Yes.

114
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Yes.

115
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,220
Yes, understood.

116
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,090
What's going on?

117
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,490
Vice President Jin Se Hoon's
birth mother...

118
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,930
has passed away.

119
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Mom...

120
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,950
I knew Se Hoon's mother
was in a coma,

121
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,260
but I never expected her
to go just like that.

122
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,300
We saved Hwang Mi Soo,
but Se Hoon's mother died.

123
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Two incidents happened
at the exact same time.

124
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,430
But who could it be?

125
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,070
I'm sure Chairman Jin Tae Seok
was after Hwang Mi Soo.

126
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,170
But I'm not sure about...

127
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,570
Se Hoon's mother...

128
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,580
Vice Chairman Han?

129
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,280
Vice Chairman Han? Why?

130
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,810
I overheard something
at the funeral home.

131
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,520
They said
the first person to arrive...

132
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,050
after hearing
his mother had improved...

133
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,050
was Vice Chairman Han.

134
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,760
Just because she was there
doesn't mean she did anything.

135
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,400
But Se Hoon's not going to
see it that way.

136
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,570
Are you actually crying?

137
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,210
Do you think...

138
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,020
I did something horrible
to your mother?

139
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,280
Didn't you?

140
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,650
Why do you think so poorly of me?

141
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,960
I may not be your birth mother,

142
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,130
but I thought
I was a good mother to you.

143
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,830
I thought so, too.

144
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,300
But...

145
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,870
in a childhood memory,

146
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,400
I remember seeing you the day
my mother had her accident.

147
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,740
You think...

148
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,240
I was behind her accident too?

149
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,980
I wanted to believe you weren't.

150
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,310
But...

151
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,650
now that my mother is actually gone,

152
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,320
I'm starting to think you've been
the cause of all her misery.

153
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,490
You?

154
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,070
I never knew my dear Se Hoon
thought so little of me.

155
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,840
I may not have given birth to you,
but I raised you as my own son...

156
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,340
Please, just stop!

157
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,410
Your beautiful face
hides such an ugly truth.

158
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,280
Just show your true colors
already, please!

159
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,850
Are you suspecting me...

160
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,290
just because I got
to the nursing home first?

161
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,190
Your mother's health had improved,

162
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,360
but they couldn't reach
any other family members.

163
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,260
That's why
the nursing home called me.

164
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,330
I got the same call.

165
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,530
- Was she really getting better?
- Yes, she was.

166
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,440
She couldn't hold a conversation,
but she did open her eyes.

167
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,370
I stepped out for one minute
to take a call.

168
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,010
And while I was gone...

169
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,910
So you were the last person...

170
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,910
to see my mother alive?

171
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,480
Se Hoon.

172
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,020
If I had really done that,

173
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,920
why would I stay at the nursing home
when I knew I'd get caught?

174
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,560
Am I supposed to know all that,

175
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,690
or even care?

176
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,100
The only thing that matters is...

177
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,100
that you were the one
who wanted my mom gone...

178
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,100
more than anyone else in the world.

179
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,120
Things look pretty bad.

180
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,720
Se Hoon thinks I killed Yeong Ran.

181
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,790
That phone call you received
was suspicious.

182
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,300
Someone's trying to frame me.

183
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,230
What about Hwang Mi Soo?

184
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,530
You don't have to worry.

185
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
I received confirmation that
she has arrived in the States...

186
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,540
at a nursing home in Manhattan.

187
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,810
This needs to be kept top secret.

188
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,580
I've already told this
to Manager Hwang.

189
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,110
Chairman Jin tried to kill
Hwang Mi Soo.

190
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Then...

191
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,120
who killed Yeong Ran?

192
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,550
Could it have been Chairman Jin?

193
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,360
He'd go as far as to frame me?

194
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,220
Why would he?

195
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,690
To keep your daughter...

196
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,900
and Vice President Jin Se Hoon
apart by force.

197
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,830
But would he really kill
Se Hoon's mother to do it?

198
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,710
About Se Hoon's mother.

199
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,380
Are you sure it wasn't natural?

200
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,420
Yes, sir.

201
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,650
The cause of death was a drug.

202
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,320
What about the security footage?

203
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,660
The footage from the hall and room
was deleted...

204
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,330
right before Vice Chairman Han
got there and left.

205
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,660
You don't think Hye Ra...

206
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,830
No, that's impossible.

207
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,270
She's too kind to even hurt a fly.

208
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,010
Who snuck Hwang Mi Soo out?

209
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,580
I have no idea, sir.

210
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,950
My sister just vanished.

211
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,850
You don't know either, sir?

212
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,720
First, find the punk
who did this to Se Hoon's mother.

213
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,490
And report to me the second
you hear from Hwang Mi Soo.

214
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,460
Understood.

215
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,700
Is it good or bad for me...

216
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,510
that Se Hoon's mother
passed away like that?

217
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,510
It's a great thing, of course.

218
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,410
- Why?
- Think a little.

219
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,280
Jin Se Hoon thinks Han Hye Ra
killed his birth mother.

220
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,220
So what about Han Hye Ra's daughter,
Cha Jung Won?

221
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,860
She's the daughter of the woman
who killed his mother, right?

222
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,090
Did you do it, Mom?

223
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,260
- What?
- Did you kill Se Hoon's mother?

224
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,270
My goodness.
You make it sound like I'm a killer.

225
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,000
That's not true, right, Manager Gu?

226
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
Excuse me?

227
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,270
I'm not sure
I understood the question.

228
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,280
She's asking if I killed
Jin Se Hoon's mother.

229
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,250
Yes, that's correct.

230
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,750
- What?
- You really did?

231
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,080
You!

232
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,350
No, that's not what I meant!

233
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,690
I'm not very bright.
I must've misunderstood you.

234
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,130
Chairman Gong didn't do anything.
I swear.

235
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,060
See?

236
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
Excuse me...

237
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,590
Can I get you to call and say that
Je Yeong Ran has recovered,

238
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,490
and they should hurry to get here?

239
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,690
Tell them the other family members
aren't picking up.

240
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,930
Okay.

241
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,150
I just did what you told me to,
Grandma.

242
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,290
There you go again, making excuses.

243
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,660
You're the one who asked me
how to make the impossible happen.

244
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,390
And I told you
that was the only way.

245
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,460
I never said to do something this vile,
you rotten witch.

246
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,930
I had no choice
if I wanted to make it happen.

247
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,870
So why don't you
just pray for me instead?

248
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,700
Atone for your own sins.

249
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,270
Why should I atone for anything?

250
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,970
Pray that
your favorite Gong Nan Sook...

251
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,540
lives a long and prosperous life.

252
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,280
- That's the prayer I want.
- Good grief.

253
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,650
If you live any more prosperously,

254
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,720
you'll burst from your own greed.

255
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,420
Just let me get my hands on
Kunhyang Group,

256
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,160
and I won't ask for anything more.

257
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,230
That's as far as I'll go. Okay?

258
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,360
Okay?

259
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,040
Are you expecting someone?

260
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,140
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

261
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,480
- Welcome.
- We don't need part-timers today.

262
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,080
He's here to see us, Mom.

263
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,790
What's this about?

264
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,260
All right. I'll leave you to it.

265
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,900
Thank you both for your help.

266
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,830
I won't forget what you've done.

267
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,740
I heard Secretary Yoon
took Hwang Mi Soo to safety.

268
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
I'm aware.

269
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,770
The only one giving Secretary Yoon
orders is Vice Chairman Han,

270
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,980
so why is she protecting
Hwang Mi Soo?

271
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,280
I can't read her mind,

272
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,920
but I believe she is
trying to repay a debt.

273
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,880
What about Se Hoon's birth mother?

274
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,190
Who would do such a thing?

275
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,390
Se Hoon seems to suspect
Vice Chairman Han.

276
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
Soon...

277
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,160
I believe the truth
will come to light.

278
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,100
Looks like they're having
a little war meeting.

279
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,170
And they didn't even include me.

280
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,120
The more I learn about you,
the less I understand.

281
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,320
What's really on your mind?

282
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,790
You think I hurt Se Hoon's mother?

283
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,560
Two incidents happened
around the same time.

284
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,060
In one, a life was saved.

285
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,300
In the other, a life was taken.

286
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,130
Were you the one who orchestrated...

287
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,740
both incidents?

288
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,940
Are you asking...

289
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,010
if I have the faces of an angel
and a devil?

290
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,450
So which one is your true face?

291
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,080
No one is purely good
or purely evil.

292
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,890
Some believe...

293
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,960
I saved them from torment.

294
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,760
While others think
I'm their sworn enemy...

295
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,990
who pushed them into the abyss.

296
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,530
All without bothering
to learn the truth.

297
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,470
Then what is the truth?

298
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,800
I've told you the truth,
time and again.

299
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,170
What I said went unbelieved.

300
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,380
No one can be both good and evil.
They're polar opposites.

301
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,610
As far as I'm concerned,

302
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,180
you're the latter.

303
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,320
You helped Hwang Mi Soo...

304
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,790
because she's still of use
to you, isn't she?

305
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,890
Do you want to release more work
as Grace Han?

306
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,630
Will you have Hwang Mi Soo
continue to paint for you?

307
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,700
If you really want
to know the truth,

308
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,070
find it out for yourself.

309
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,270
You said you wanted...

310
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,480
to tear off this mask of mine,
didn't you?

311
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,880
I do.

312
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,550
I will expose that you're a devil...

313
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,490
in an angel's mask...

314
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,920
with my own two hands.

315
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,750
What are you doing here?

316
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,690
You...

317
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,190
had a right to be here back then,
as a daughter-in-law.

318
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,590
But now,

319
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,190
what right do you have...

320
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,530
to be mourning my mother?

321
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,630
Our parents may be different,

322
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,600
but you're still like
a brother to me.

323
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,140
I'm here as your sister, Jung Won.

324
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,680
Your mother...

325
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,910
killed my mother.

326
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,380
We need to find out
what really happened before...

327
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,390
Are you defending Vice Chairman Han
right now?

328
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,760
Do you actually trust that woman?

329
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,660
The fact that you're
her biological daughter...

330
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,130
is already tearing me apart.

331
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,900
But you're also the daughter
of the woman who killed my mother?

332
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,070
Why does life have to be so cruel?

333
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,790
What's wrong?

334
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,320
Are you upset that you let
Hwang Mi Soo get away?

335
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,260
Or is it because
even though she was unconscious,

336
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,560
your ex-wife died,
and now your little heart aches?

337
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,030
I'm only human.

338
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,270
We just pulled the plug on someone
who was still alive.

339
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,670
What's this? You just stood
on the sidelines and watched.

340
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,170
I did all the dirty work.

341
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,210
Seeing her under that white sheet
is really getting to me.

342
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,080
Don't be ridiculous.

343
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,110
It's the idea of framing Han Hye Ra.

344
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,310
That's what's breaking your heart.

345
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,390
I feel so sorry for her.

346
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,160
I can only pretend to be cold
toward her for so long.

347
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,860
I want to run to her right now
and hold her,

348
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,030
and tell her,
"I believe you. I'll handle it all."

349
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,200
Give me a break.

350
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,600
- What?
- To get Young Chae...

351
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,140
accepted by the Kunhyang family,

352
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,640
who was it that said Jin Se Hoon
must see Han Hye Ra as his enemy?

353
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,540
You said it was the only way he'd
abandon her daughter, Cha Jung Won,

354
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,080
and you kept pushing me.

355
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,510
And now you're changing your tune?

356
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,950
You feel sorry for her?
You want to hold her?

357
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,580
Whatever, you're insane!

358
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,250
Anyone would think you're jealous.

359
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,690
What? Jealous?

360
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,760
Gong Nan Sook,
do you have feelings for me?

361
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Hold on.

362
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,600
Listen here, Chairman Jin.

363
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,640
My standards are sky-high.

364
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,310
You're obsessed with Han Hye Ra.
The nerve of you!

365
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,510
I'll admit you were a real beauty
back in your day.

366
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,650
If you hadn't been a loan shark,
you could have been by my side.

367
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,850
Shut it.

368
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,320
Keep flapping that trap of yours,

369
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,560
and tie it in a bow
on the back of your head.

370
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,860
Okay. I was just kidding.

371
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,330
My Young Chae...

372
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,170
has to sweet-talk
and manage Se Hoon well.

A good movie can be a real comfort
when you're feeling down.

378
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,810
Let's meet at the theater entrance
30 minutes before the show.

379
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,020
I heard this movie
is supposed to be good.

380
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,720
- Then you can have it.
- Really?

381
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,930
I should go see it with Ha Neul.

382
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,330
What are you doing here?

383
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,200
Today's the day we pick the design
for the new collection.

384
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,370
I'm here so you can cast your vote
as Vice President.

385
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,740
But I have a favor to ask.

386
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,740
Give me your vote.

387
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,880
And let me have Dad's vote too.

388
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,880

One side features a tailored look
using linen and silk.

391
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,390
While the other is more high-end
with its luxury, feminine look.

392
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,390
Why aren't the designers' names
listed?

393
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,660
That was my decision
as the director.

394
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,430
I believe judging by merit alone,
without the designers' names,

395
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,400
is the only way to be objective.

396
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,470
She has a point.
We should just look at the work.

397
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,970
They're both pretty good.

398
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,440
I don't know the first thing
about fashion.

399
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,210
Vice Chairman, you decide.

400
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,020
You're the expert, after all.

401
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,390
Chairman, why don't you support
Director Jin this time?

402
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,390
She's put her heart and soul
into preparing for this.

403
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,260
Really? You think so?

404
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,630
Then my vote goes to Director Jin.

405
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,100
I'll abstain as well.

406
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,000
For the same reason as the Chairman.

407
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,270
Director Jin, you can have my vote.

408
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,570
Thank you, Chairman, Vice President,
for putting your trust in me.

409
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,640
Vice Chairman,
which design do you prefer?

410
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,620
The grasp of current trends,
the use of color combinations,

411
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,780
and the originality of materials...

412
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,250
It's hard to say which is superior.

413
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,820
But if I had to choose one...

414
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,690
Using eco-friendly, healthy,
high-quality fabrics,

415
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,130
I'd like to present a tailored look.

416
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,360

the tailored look.

- Yes.
- You did a great job.

422
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,620
Using natural materials
was a very innovative idea.

423
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,750
The Chairman
and Vice Chairman liked it.

424
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,790
Thank you.

425
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,600
Jin Se Mi,
this isn't what we agreed on.

426
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,480
Don't tell me you're going to choose
Cha Jung Won's design?

427
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,250
If your skills are good,
your design will be chosen, right?

428
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,680
But it's not my decision alone.

429
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,590
Do you want Cha Jung Won to steal
Vice Chairman Han away from you?

430
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,760
What did you say?

431
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,560
Why do you think
she brought in the daughter...

432
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,600
she reunited with after 25 years
when she was talentless?

433
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,600
Does she want her
as the head of design?

434
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,930
Or maybe even the division director?

435
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,900

To prepare for the next season,
Designer Joo Young Chae...

441
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,430
has been appointed
as the interim team leader.

442
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,840

And why's that?

Because I don't want
Cha Jung Won to win.

451
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,530
- What?
- You need to get a grip too.

452
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,630
It's time you cut Cha Jung Won
out of your life.

453

I prefer the eco-friendly,
health-conscious, tailored look.

By all means.

Since the Chairman and Vice President
gave me their votes,

458
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,220

to make me feel more pathetic?

Cha Jung Won and Joo Ha Neul
are acting like a couple in public.

Are things not working out

that I killed Yeong Ran?

I'll ensure he believes
that I'm still Chairman Jin's man.

There's something I need you to do
for me, Manager Hwang.
