1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,140
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,740
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,080
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,250
Was I the only one who didn't know...

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,280
that my wife was
Mother's biological daughter?

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,980
I only recently found out myself.

7
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,290
How could something so absurd...

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,820
Is divorce the only answer?

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,320
Is there any other way?

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,790
If we're going to contain this
before rumors get out of hand,

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,330
you and that girl need
to make a clean break.

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,030
I can't do that.

13
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,200
I don't care whether
she's Joo Young Chae or not.

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,600
It has to be her.

15
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,070
- I don't want anyone else.
- Get a grip!

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,570
You're the heir to Kunhyang Group.

17
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,410
How could your mother’s own daughter
become the lady of Kunhyang?

18
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,480
What is there to clean up...

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,150
when she isn't even
the real Joo Young Chae?

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,120
There's no need
to change the official records.

21
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,990
Father,

22
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,720
do you also agree with
Chairwoman Gong Nan Sook?

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,590
That for the sake of the group,
whether she's real or fake,

24
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,090
I must maintain the marriage
to Joo Young Chae?

25
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,600
I can't say I disagree.

26
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,600
That's the kind of person
who deserves to lead Kunhyang.

27
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,970
And if I refuse?

28
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,070
Then you can leave
Kunhyang Group immediately!

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,710
You will no longer be the heir!

30
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,560
You're up early.

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,720
I think...

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,160
I need to go to the funeral home.

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,660
Come sit down for a minute.

34
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,000
What are you, his family?

35
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,300
That's what I'm saying.

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,840
Cha Ki Beom even served time
for murdering his father.

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,240
Hold on.

38
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,950
Cha Jung Won's dad...

39
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,750
killed Ha Neul's father?

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,420
Am I the last to know?

41
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,550
Why would I bring that up?
It's completely pointless.

42
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,750
Cha Ki Beom...

43
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,260
is not the man to do that.
Absolutely not.

44
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,630
You're defending the man
who murdered your father?

45
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,200
Do you like Jung Won that much?

46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,600
You care for her over your sister.

47
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,440
I'm not saying I don't care for her.

48
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,940
But she's not more important
than you.

49
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,710
Think about
how foolish you've been...

50
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,180
and all the chaos you've caused.

51
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,510
You wouldn't listen
when I tried to stop you...

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,480
That's not what's important
right now.

53
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,490
What's important is that Han Hye Ra
is the one who killed Cha Ki Beom.

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,220
- What makes you think that?
- Because she saw it all.

55
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,960
Did you send the video to Jung Won,
Chairman Gong?

56
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,800
So you're not even
calling me Mother anymore?

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
What video?

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Someone sent a video to Jung Won.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,070
It shows Cha Ki Beom
and Vice Chairman Han...

60
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,580
getting into a scuffle
before he falls down the stairs.

61
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,450
Was it you?

62
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,150
How could it have been me?
I didn't see or hear a thing.

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,520
How ridiculous.

64
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,260
Tell me what happened
between Han Hye Ra and Cha Ki Beom.

65
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,630
Manager Gu?

66
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,810
I don't know anything.
All I did was record the video.

67
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,160
Anyway, who will be
the chief mourner...

68
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,560
at Cha Ki Beom's funeral?

69
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,330
Should I even be going?

70
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,470
What right do I have?

71
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,740
You don't have to go.

72
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,680
I can go pay our respects
on behalf of Kunhyang Group.

73
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,180
But it happened because of me.

74
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,680
Don't blame yourself.

75
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,950
It was just his fate after all.

76
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,720
How did you know I was there?

77
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,990
Were you following me?

78
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,230
Something about you that morning
seemed off.

79
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,560
I had a bad feeling,
so I followed you.

80
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,130
And I saw you meet Cha Ki Beom.

81
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,000
I was angry at Ki Beom
for hiding who Su A was.

82
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,210
And I wanted to know if he knew
she was my daughter-in-law.

83
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,610
I was curious too,
about you and Cha Ki Beom,

84
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,610
if there were still feelings
between you and him.

85
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,910
Tae Seok!

86
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,220
I never thought such an accident
would happen.

87
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,120
Did you...

88
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,420
even call 911?

89
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,960
Do you really think
I didn't call 911...

90
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,530
and then lie about it?

91
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,330
I know that at least you...

92
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,900
wouldn't just ignore a dying man,
no matter how much you hated him.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,200
What kind of question is that?

94
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,970
I do value human life.

95
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,780
And you should stop blaming yourself
for this.

96
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,920
Okay. You're right.

97
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,850
By the way,

98
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,520
are you okay...

99
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,190
with Su A as the chief mourner
at Cha Ki Beom's funeral?

100
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,530
She's a sensible girl.

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,730
She'll know what to do.

102
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,100
- What about the press?
- I've blocked them completely.

103
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,070
They won't get near the funeral.

104
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,340
(Funeral Home)

105
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,810
Are you sure you should be here?

106
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,320
Didn't you say it was a big problem
if someone saw you here?

107
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,890
This is where I belong.

108
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,120
Of course it is.

109
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,260
If you weren't here,

110
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,630
Ki Beom wouldn't be able
to pass on peacefully.

111
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,670
- Let's go.
- All right.

112
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,800
Okay, let's go.

113
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,480
I'm not running away anymore.

114
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,350
I have to be...

115
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,880
the one to see him off.

116
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,690
Chairman Jin would like to see you
for a moment.

117
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,930
What do you mean,
I can't be the chief mourner?

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,140
To the world, you're Joo Young Chae,
Kunhyang's daughter-in-law.

119
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,970
How will we handle the fallout
if this gets out to the press?

120
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,110
It's already so unfair...

121
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,480
that my dad died so senselessly,

122
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,780
and now you're telling me
I can't even see him off properly?

123
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,680
That's ridiculous.

124
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,520
You must consider
Vice Chairman Han's position in all this.

125
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,190
The moment
you serve as chief mourner,

126
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,730
Vice Chairman Han's reputation
will be dragged through the mud.

127
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,500
It's bad enough he lived his life
branded as a murderer,

128
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,270
and just because my dad,
who died from a sudden fall,

129
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,340
was her ex-husband?

130
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,680
And because I'm their daughter?

131
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,550
If I serve as the chief mourner,
will everything be revealed?

132
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,120
And Vice Chairman Han's reputation
will be destroyed?

133
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,820
There's something more important
than that.

134
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,590
The fact that the daughter-in-law
is her own daughter.

135
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,730
Is that what you're hiding?

136
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,990
For now.

137
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,600
Let's just say that.

138
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,230
Did Vice Chairman Han...

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,330
say so herself?

140
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,570
It's my last chance to say goodbye
to my father.

141
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,640
It's my right to be there for him.

142
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,740
I'll have to escort you.

143
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,750
Let go of me! I said, let go!

144
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,760
(Utility Room)

145
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,590
Where's Jung Won?

146
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,730
Chairman Jin Tae Seok called for her
a while ago,

147
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,000
but she's not back yet.

148
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,100
The chief mourner isn't supposed
to leave her post.

149
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,800
Then I'll do it.
I'll be the chief mourner.

150
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,110
Are you out of your mind?
How could you be the chief mourner?

151
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,080
At least try to make some sense!

152
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,920
I'm still Su A.
At least, to everyone else.

153
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,350
- Get out! You're shaming Ki Beom.
- Let's go.

154
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,550
Jung Won is supposed to be
the chief mourner.

155
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,420
You should be thanking me.

156
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,920
What if the press learns
that Kunhyang's daughter-in-law...

157
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,830
is Vice Chairman Han's
ex-husband's daughter?

158
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,860
What are you going to do then?

159
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,230
And do you think Cha Jung Won
will be the only one in the news?

160
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,200
You said you'd be Joo Young Chae.
So why this chief mourner nonsense?

161
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,270
Can't you see the bigger picture?
If you don't get it, ask me first.

162
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,910
Like mother, like daughter.
Not one brain cell between them.

163
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,750
Look at all that jewelry
you're wearing at a funeral.

164
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,110
Are you nuts?

165
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,090
I wore all black to a funeral.
Isn't that enough?

166
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,390
Why do you care so much
about my personal style?

167
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,520
Just get out.
I can't stand the sight of you.

168
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,530
You too!

169
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,690
Before I rip every last strand
of your hair out.

170
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,560
Please go now.
It would be for the best.

171
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,700
Manager Gu.

172
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,840
I will escort you out respectfully.
You as well, miss.

173
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,840
Hey, isn't that your pickup line?

174
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,040
Then I'll escort you both out.

175
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,440
Let's go.

176
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
Come on.

177
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,290
(Jin Se Hoon)

178
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,230
Hey, Se Hoon. Where are you?

179
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,930
Se Hoon?

180
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,210
Was Cha Ki Beom really
Young Chae's...

181
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,610
I mean,

182
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,980
my wife's biological father?

183
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,940
And he's the one who passed away?

184
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,910
That's right.

185
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,910
Did Jung Won tell you?

186
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,950
I know...

187
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,550
my wife is Su A,

188
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,290
Vice Chairman Han's biological daughter.

189
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,060
You knew, didn't you?

190
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,260
Why am I always...

191
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,060
the last one to know?

192
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,900
The one Jung Won feels
worst about...

193
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,340
is probably you, Se Hoon.

194
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,040
Just how long have you known?

195
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
From the very beginning?

196
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,710
Did you conspire with Chairman Gong
to lie to me?

197
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,110
It wasn't like that.

198
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,080
I tried to stop it.

199
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,120
But then Young Chae started
impersonating Cha Jung Won...

200
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm sorry.

201
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,660
- But about Young Chae...
- Call her Jung Won.

202
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,690
Whoever she is.

203
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,800
Whoever she is, she is my wife.

204
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,130
How could she not even contact me?

205
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,170
- It must've been difficult for her.
- Young Chae.

206
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,340
I mean, Su A.

207
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,180
This is driving me crazy.

208
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,710
Where is she right now?

209
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,920
I heard Chairman Jin called her out.

210
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,860
Why isn't Jung Won here yet?

211
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,190
The mourners will be here
any minute.

212
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,670
You never cease to amaze me,
Vice Chairman Han.

213
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,880
Likewise. Seeing Chairman Gong
at a funeral...

214
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,980
is quite a surprise.

215
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,550
What are you doing?

216
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,990
But this isn't just any funeral,
is it?

217
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,190
It's for your ex-husband,
the father of your secret daughter,

218
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,820
and on top of all that,
I hear you were...

219
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,860
the cause of his death.

220
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,630
That's enough.

221
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,000
- You're going too far, Chairman.
- Too far?

222
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,600
You treat people's lives
like they're nothing,

223
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,470
Gong Nan Sook.

224
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,870
You must know
since you've heard my reputation.

225
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,270
So don't test me.
Let me go while I'm asking nicely.

226
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,610
You won't?

227
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,810
Then who's going to be
the one to kill you?

228
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,480
- What?
- Should I do the honors?

229
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,890
When I think about
what she put me through last time,

230
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,250
I still jolt awake in a fit of rage.

231
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,590
I can still feel you strangling me.

232
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,890
I thought you wanted me to be
Kunhyang's daughter-in-law.

233
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,690
This isn't helping.

234
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,000
There's a time and a place
to pick a fight.

235
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,030
I'll be seeing you.

236
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,370
Let's go.

237
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,170
"I'll be seeing you."

238
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,810
That venomous snake.
I can't even stand to look at her.

239
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,310
She completely ignored me.

240
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,580
It's all your fault, Mom.

241
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,820
Shut up! You just do as you're told.

242
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,390
If Jung Won becomes
the chief mourner,

243
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,250
things will get a lot
more interesting.

244
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,720
What if we secretly call Reporter Ma
to come take some pictures?

245
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,940
Protect...

246
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,950
our Su A...

247
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,220
from Jin Tae Seok.

248
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,220
Please...

249
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,900
The mourners will be here soon.

250
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,630
Compose yourself.

251
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,410
Why is no one here?
Where are Jo Mi Hyang and Su A?

252
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,740
Having Su A as the chief mourner
is out of the question.

253
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,610
I told her to get some rest
somewhere quiet.

254
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,980
Good call.

255
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,920
Kunhyang Group's daughter-in-law
as chief mourner?

256
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,520
That's preposterous.

257
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,730
It's a shame he passed this way,

258
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,200
but there's nothing we can do.

259
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,800
So a funeral is going to be held
without a chief mourner?

260
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,110
I hear you knew his daughter well...

261
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,270
and got along with Cha Ki Beom.

262
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,680
It wouldn't be a bad idea for you
to be the chief mourner.

263
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,080
That's enough.

264
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,450
The role of chief mourner...

265
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,050
isn't something
for someone else to decide.

266
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,290
Where is Jung Won?

267
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,460
Open the door!

268
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,530
I said open it!

269
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,180
(Utility Room)

270
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
You work for Jin Tae Seok,
don't you?

271
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,280
Please, open the door!

272
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,450
You've got my Jung Won in there.

273
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,020
Why did you lock my daughter up?

274
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,360
I see.

275
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,230
The great Chairman and Vice Chairman
of Kunhyang Group...

276
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,430
are doing this to stop my daughter
from being the chief mourner.

277
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,900
For your own good,
I suggest you don't make a scene.

278
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,180
Jung Won.

279
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,850
- Ha Neul.
- Let's go.

280
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,620
You should send
your father off properly.

281
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,460
Let my daughter out of there now!

282
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,160
Manager Hwang.

283
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,700
- Mom, let's go.
- How did you get out?

284
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,400
Your dad is waiting! Let's go!

285
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,940
I'll take full responsibility
for this.

286
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,930
Manager Hwang, what's going on?

287
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,000
I believe I just saw Ma Sang Ki
from Jeguk Daily.

288
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,200
Go and just keep an eye on him.

289
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,410
Su A is the chief mourner?

290
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,650
I'd like for the funeral, at least,

291
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,150
- to be held in peace.
- But if the press finds out...

292
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,620
Surely Kunhyang has enough influence
to keep them quiet.

293
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
Let's go.

294
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,480
How could this have happened?

295
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,910
What did you tell
the Kunhyang family?

296
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,950
I said I had to come pay my respects
to my father, Manager Kim.

297
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,050
But why did you tag along?

298
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,990
I heard that girl was
Vice Chairman Han's real daughter.

299
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,220
And the dead man's daughter.

300
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,420
Keep your voice down.

301
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,230
I told you it was a secret.

302
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,860
What a disgusting little brat.

303
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Hurry up.

304
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,020
- Ahn Ji Na?
- You haven't answered my calls.

305
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,150
Joo Young Chae... I mean,

306
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,150
it looks like you're sucking up
to Chairman Gong Nan Sook now.

307
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,020
Why would you say
something so hurtful?

308
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
Hand it over.

309
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,790
- The memory card with the photos.
- What are you doing?

310
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,130
I've got to make a living, you know.

311
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,170
You know who my father is, right?

312
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,440
Assemblyman Ahn Jung Soo.

313
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,670
How about I ask my dad...

314
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,340
to give your editor-in-chief
at Jeguk Daily a little phone call?

315
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,310
And get you fired?

316
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,530
What are you doing here?

317
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,070
You're the daughter-in-law
of the Kunhyang family.

318
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,540
Jung Won.

319
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,840
I'll handle this.

320
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,450
What makes you the chief mourner?

321
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,990
Put yourself in my shoes.

322
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,490
- What?
- It's horrible to think this,

323
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,730
but just imagine...

324
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,660
your mother at the nursing home
has passed away.

325
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,200
If Chairman Jin forbade you
from being the chief mourner,

326
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,300
would you obey?

327
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,400
He was the only father I had.

328
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,570
How could I not be here
to see him off?

329
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,010
But still, how can I sit back
and watch this without any plan?

330
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,450
I can't be the Kunhyang Family's
daughter-in-law anymore anyway.

331
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,150
You know that, Se Hoon.

332
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,050
After the funeral is over,

333
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,720
we'll figure out our problems.

334
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,890
I'm sorry.

335
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,730
It was just hard to accept that...

336
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,670
Cha Ki Beom was your real father
and you were Su A.

337
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,870
I guess I wasn't thinking straight.

338
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,140
I know it was a huge shock.

339
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,310
How did the accident happen?

340
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,950
It's Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra's fault...

341
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,720
that my dad is dead.

342
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,960
What are you talking about?

343
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,390
There was an accident.

344
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,690
We could've saved Dad,

345
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,300
but Vice Chairman Han abandoned him.

346
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,870
I can't believe it.

347
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,200
Someone sent a video
of the accident...

348
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,410
to me.

349
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,140
This must be so hard for you.

350
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,490
Please, let me give my dad
a proper farewell.

351
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:01,290
Please, just for a moment,
forget about what people will think.

352
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:03,930
I'm begging you.

353
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,390
Where's Jung Won?

354
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,190
Jin Se Hoon took her out.

355
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,440
- How did it go with Se Hoon?
- I explained everything.

356
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,170
He doesn't completely understand,

357
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,640
but he didn't try to stop me.

358
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,010
Thank you, Ha Neul.

359
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,420
Of course, Su A should be
the chief mourner.

360
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,490
It's her father's funeral.

361
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,590
Are you asking me to help her?

362
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,510
(Kunhyang Group)

363
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,540
Ahn Ji Na went after
Reporter Ma Sang Ki?

364
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:30,980
Yes. Reporter Ma photographed Su A
acting as chief mourner,

365
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,450
and I saw Ahn Ji Na
snatch the memory card from him.

366
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,590
Why would Ahn Ji Na do that?

367
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
Are you sure?

368
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,060
That Chairman Jin didn't call 911?

369
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
That's correct.

370
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:53,670
No emergency transport records exist
for that age, area, and time.

371
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,810
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

372
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,840
I never knew...

373
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,580
my lovely wife would go so far
as to check that.

374
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,150
How should I proceed?

375
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,450
She'll think I let Cha Ki Beom die.

376
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,360
Chairman Jin...

377
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,990
left Ki Beom to die.

378
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,900
What about the CCTV
on the gallery stairs?

379
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,800
Coincidentally, both CCTV cameras
near the stairs were malfunctioning.

380
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,170
Someone...

381
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,010
sent Su A the video, Min Jung.

382
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,180
Su A believes I deliberately pushed
Ki Beom down the stairs...

383
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,280
and that I caused his death.

384
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,090
I think the video was edited
to emphasize only that part.

385
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,460
Who do you think sent the video?

386
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,530
Could it have been
Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

387
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,100
I'm hurt...

388
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,370
to think you would even suspect me.

389
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,870
Since when has eavesdropping
been a hobby of yours?

390
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,470
I just stopped by to see
if you wanted to have lunch,

391
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,010
and I just happened to overhear.

392
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,310
Do you really think I'm the one
who sent the video...

393
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,720
to Su A?

394
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,050
I think it's a possibility.

395
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,820
- And why is that?
- Because you want Su A...

396
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,220
to believe that I killed Ki Beom.

397
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,760
But you killed Cha Ki Beom.

398
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,800
Honey.

399
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,370
He took his last breath
right after you left.

400
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:32,170
There was no time to call
911 or anything.

401
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,710
Then why did you lie to me?

402
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,380
You were already blaming yourself
as it was,

403
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,580
and I didn't want to make things
harder on you.

404
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,280
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

405
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,590
It wasn't your fault.
I'll make sure of it.

406
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,400
I told you to let go of your guilt.

407
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
Cha Ki Beom...

408
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,270
It was bound to happen.

409
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,100
What have I done?

410
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,170
I killed Cha Ki Beom.

411
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,540
Oh, no. How can I ever face Su A?

412
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,220
Why are you looking at me like that?

413
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,890
Did you show the entire video
to Young Chae?

414
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,530
Did you send it to her phone, too?

415
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,170
I'm only going to ask you
one more time.

416
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,440
- Did you show Young Chae...
- You might as well just kill me.

417
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
Would you look at this!

418
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,510
Are you my assistant
or Young Chae's?

419
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,950
Maybe I should just
have you drowned.

420
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,680
Yes, ma'am. I'm prepared for that.

421
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Oh, my.

422
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,950
Look here, Manager Gu.

423
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,320
Are you completely smitten
with Young Chae?

424
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,230
I believe so, no...

425
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,600
I am.

426
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,160
- But...
- But what?

427
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,870
I was afraid you'd be angry with me,

428
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,740
so I only sent the first part.

429
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
The first part?

430
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,310
And which part was that again?

431
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:21,110
Up to the part where Han Hye Ra
forcefully shoves Cha Ki Beom away?

432
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,380
That's right.

433
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,620
Ms. Young Chae was so persistent,
so I had no choice.

434
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,990
Hey, that was actually
very clever of you.

435
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,890
You managed to stay loyal to me...

436
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,720
while also pleasing Young Chae.
Killing two birds with one stone.

437
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,730
You're smarter than you look.

438
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,060
Thank you for the compliment.

439
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,800
You can't tell if I'm praising you
or scolding you, can you?

440
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,140
Stay out of my sight for a while.

441
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,900
I'm sick of looking at you.
Get out now!

442
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,710
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you for sparing my life.

443
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Seriously...

444
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,850
So Young Chae is plotting something
behind my back?

445
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,950
The nerve of her.

446
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,890
But then again...

447
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,360
Credit where credit is due.

448
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,260
Who cares about the truth, anyway?

449
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,600
What matters is
that Cha Jung Won believes...

450
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Han Hye Ra killed her father.

451
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,370
(Funeral Home)

452
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,550
Dad, I'm scared.

453
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,950
I feel like I'm going to fall.

454
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,930
I'm right here holding on tight.
What are you scared of?

455
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,300
My life?

456
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,230
If it's for you,

457
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,500
I'd give up a dozen times over.

458
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,740
But when it comes
to ruining my daughter's life,

459
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,110
I will risk my own life to stop it.

460
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,580
Dad, the unresolved sorrow
in your heart,

461
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,350
I will set it right for you.

462
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,820
I'll prove that you were
innocent of murder...

463
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,430
and clear your name.

464
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,630
And as for Han Hye Ra,
who caused your senseless death,

465
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,200
I’ll make her live in the pain
of a heart torn to shreds.

466
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,270
I'll stake my entire life on it.

(A Graceful Liar)

468
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,650
Han Hye Ra pushed Cha Ki Beom.

469
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,420
What in the world are you hiding?

470
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,690
Absolutely no one can find out.

471
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,660
I learned to take things first
and crush people before they can.

472
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,000
I used you for revenge
on Han Hye Ra,

473
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,130
the birth mother who abandoned me.

474
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,970
So what do you expect me to do now?

475
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,300
Do you want to see me lose my mind?

476
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,740
Su A, you need to be
tougher and stronger.

477
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,580
You have to live as if you never
had a mother to begin with.

478
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,510
The woman who caused
my father's death.

479
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,050
I'm going to make her pay
for what she did.
