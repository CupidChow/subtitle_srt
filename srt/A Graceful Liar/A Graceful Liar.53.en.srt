(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,610
(in this drama are fictional.)

00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,140
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,150
(Episode 53)

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,230
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,470
Is something wrong?

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,680
My father...

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,350
was killed by Madam Gong.

9
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,600
What do you two think you're doing?

10
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,810
Is this what you wanted me to see?

11
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,380
Is that why you asked me
to come home?

12
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,300
Oh, my!

13
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,370
My goodness, this is expensive!
Are you out of your mind?

14
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,440
Gong Nan Sook.

15
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,340
If you hadn't killed
Joo Sang Cheol...

16
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,340
Or...

17
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,780
if you hadn't framed Cha Ki Beom
for it,

18
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,450
things would've been different.

19
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,550
Different how? You mean your life?

20
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,760
At the very least,

21
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,330
I wouldn't have abandoned Su A
for fear of being a murderer's wife.

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,630
That wouldn't have happened.

23
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,600
Get a grip, Han Hye Ra.

24
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,910
Shouldn't you be
thanking me instead?

25
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,110
Thanks to me, you ran straight
to Jin Tae Seok, didn't you?

26
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,280
Thanks to me,
you're out of the mud...

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,480
and living like a queen, aren't you?

28
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,150
I should be eternally grateful
to you, then.

29
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,550
You should get down on your knees
and thank me.

30
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,860
Oh, my.

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,300
Darn, I'm startled.

32
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,900
What on earth is she laughing about?
This sociopathic wench.

33
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,240
How could I forget?

34
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,910
It's all thanks to you.

35
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,820
You see, there are two sides to me.

36
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,490
One who only thinks of my daughter,
Su A,

37
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,960
and feels guilty about what happened
to the late Ki Beom.

38
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,630
And...

39
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,460
the other side feels,

40
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,500
"Good riddance to my ex-husband
Cha Ki Beom, that thorn."

41
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,870
"Now I can breathe."

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,810
"Su A? That little brat?"

43
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,440
"Why should I care about her?"

44
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,210
"That whole maternal
instinct thing."

45
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,550
"I can throw it out!"

46
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,650
Why are you acting like this?

47
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,390
- Have you lost it?
- Which version of me...

48
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,520
do you think suits me better?

49
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,700
Right. You're finally showing
your true colors.

50
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,940
You've always been so nasty,
Han Hye Ra.

51
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,770
You wanted Cha Ki Beom dead,
didn't you?

52
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,170
I did.

53
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,880
I feel like
I've finally found the real me.

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,280
See?

55
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,620
I knew it.

56
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,390
You could've handled it on your own
without involving Jin Tae Seok.

57
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,160
My husband handles loose ends well.

58
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,900
He'd have handled Joo Sang Cheol...

59
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,640
just like he did with Cha Ki Beom.

60
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,900
That's what I'm saying.

61
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,040
You know,
I was pretty shocked myself.

62
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,480
Why do I have this bad feeling
that I'm being played?

63
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,150
Gosh, it's so hot in here.

64
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,290
Now that I've finally
let it all out for the first time,

65
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,730
I feel so much better.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank you.

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,440
What if I suggested
you drop Jin Tae Seok...

68
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,980
and offered to make a deal
directly with me?

69
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,180
What would you say?

70
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,790
I'm just kidding.

71
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,860
It's been fun, Chairman Gong.

72
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,950
I've never met a bigger psycho
than myself.

73
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,520
She's testing me to see
if I'll betray Jin Tae Seok or not,

74
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,880
isn't she?

75
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,450
This leaves such a bad taste
in my mouth.

76
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,790
I texted you to meet?

77
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,430
You texted me too,
saying it was urgent.

78
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,340
I didn't text either of you.

79
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,780
Someone was messing with my phone
while I was in the shower.

80
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,480
Joo Young Chae?

81
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,780
- She's the most likely suspect.
- That's not important right now.

82
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,090
Ha Neul and you...

83
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,320
clearly care for each other deeply.

84
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,860
I was going through something.

85
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,290
- Jung Won was just comforting me...
- No.

86
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,260
Se Hoon is right.

87
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,770
He and I care a lot
about each other.

88
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,440
Jung Won.

89
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,040
We share a similar pain.

90
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,340
We both lost our fathers unjustly.

91
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,440
Since when?

92
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,210
It hasn't even been that long
since your father died.

93
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,410
Let's drop it.

94
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,480
The person who was genuinely there
for me back then...

95
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,180
- was Ha Neul.
- Young Chae.

96
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,250
It's Cha Jung Won!

97
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,190
Can't you face reality yet?

98
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,960
The Young Chae you knew wasn't real.

99
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,360
- This is the real me.
- No.

100
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,730
I still can't accept it.

101
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,400
Who I see, who I care for,

102
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
whatever I feel...

103
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,640
I have to be a stranger
to you from now on.

104
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,040
That's how it has to be.

105
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,310
Don't do this. I don't care
if you're Joo Young Chae...

106
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,150
or Cha Jung Won.
It makes no difference to me.

107
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,280
You should go home for tonight.

108
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,390
- We can talk more later.
- For any reason,

109
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,520
the two of you
can never be together.

110
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,520
I won't stand for it.

111
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,580
Ms. Joo Young Chae.

112
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,150
What are you doing
at our house this late at night?

113
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,090
I just came by to pick up
something I left behind.

114
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,260
Did you forget I'm your boss?
Watch your tone.

115
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,300
Sorry. I'll speak formally to you
in the office.

116
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
I'm just in a rush.

117
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,100
She just does whatever she wants.

118
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,000
She's so blatantly obnoxious.

119
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,020
What are you doing here?

120
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,160
I'm here to comfort a wounded soul.

121
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,290
It was you, wasn't it?

122
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,060
You sent that fake text
from Ha Neul's phone, didn't you?

123
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,870
- That's right.
- Why would you pull such a stunt?

124
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,740
- What are you trying to pull?
- I wanted to show you...

125
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,210
what's going on
between Cha Jung Won and Ha Neul.

126
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,510
What?

127
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,180
Just how much
they cherish each other.

128
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,310
I wanted you to see it
with your own eyes.

129
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,110
What you see isn't everything.

130
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,320
No. I didn't see a thing.

131
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,420
That's not the only thing
you refuse to see.

132
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,760
Why...

133
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,230
don't you see me?

134
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,000
It started at the fashion show.

135
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,830
That's when I fell for you, Se Hoon.

136
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,400
Cut the nonsense.

137
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,600
Do you think I don't know
what game you're playing?

138
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,110
So what if it's a game?

139
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,340
You can just use me too.

140
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,810
- What?
- I'll help you forget Cha Jung Won.

141
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,850
I don't want you,
much less love you.

142
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,780
"Love?" How cheesy.

143
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,220
If you want to take something,
you take it.

144
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,550
If you want something,

145
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,060
you should just have it.

146
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,020
You'll be the one who gets hurt.

147
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,930
I have no intention of giving you
my heart or body...

148
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,270
You don't?

149
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,170
Really?

150
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,760
Drink up.
And forget everything else.

151
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,970
Let me ask you one more thing.

152
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,970
Is there not even
a one-percent chance for me?

153
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,240
Am I really that unappealing?

154
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,420
- You jerk.
- You're right.

155
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,320
I'm a terrible person.

156
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,330
Chairman Gong Nan Sook
did it herself?

157
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,300
She admitted she was the one
who killed your father?

158
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,700
You must have been so shocked
and hurt.

159
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,670
How cruel.

160
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,340
Why would she do something
like that?

161
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,980
I suspected Gong Nan Sook,

162
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,410
but deep down,
I wanted to believe it wasn't true.

163
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,380
At the very least,

164
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,720
I hoped my mother, of all people,
wasn't the real culprit.

165
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,960
I know that feeling all too well.

166
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,530
I hoped that Han Hye Ra,
of all people,

167
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,840
wasn't the one who harmed my dad.

168
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,710
The statute of limitations
has already run out.

169
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,080
There's no legal way to punish her.

170
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,310
She probably knows that,
which is why she's so brazen.

171
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,150
Don't think about anything
right now.

172
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,520
If it hurts, let yourself feel it.

173
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,990
You too.

174
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,560
If you're hurting, say so.

175
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,290
Don't just bottle it up.

176
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,810
It's way past quitting time.

177
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,210
Why haven't I heard from her?

178
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,650
You should be heading home.

179
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,360
About Hwang Mi Soo.

180
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,260
She hasn't been
discharged yet, right?

181
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,630
I heard she suddenly got worse,
so they moved her to a closed ward.

182
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,130
Chairman Jin did it?

183
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,970
Han Hye Ra.

184
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,540
Where are you?

185
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,710
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

186
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,110
Why?

187
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,950
Why won't you answer my calls?

188
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,690
Why did you call me at this hour,
Chairman Gong?

189
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,830
Did you send Hye Ra to test me?

190
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,130
Hye Ra went to see you,

191
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,930
Chairman Gong?

192
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,970
Why?

193
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,800
It really wasn't you?

194
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,610
It seemed like she was testing
the waters...

195
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,340
to see whether or not I betray you.

196
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,480
Tell me exactly what Hye Ra said.

197
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,150
No, never mind.

198
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,050
She just dropped by.
We had a lovely cup of tea...

199
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,050
and had a chat before she left.

200
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,460
When did she leave?

201
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,460
Oh, my. Your pretty little wife
isn't home yet?

202
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,530
Oh, dear. It looks like
she got sidetracked.

203
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,800
You must be busy
waiting for your pretty little wife,

204
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,240
so I'll let you go.

205
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,740
Hello? Gong Nan Sook?

206
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,280
Jin Tae Seok and Han Hye Ra.
There's trouble in paradise.

207
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,250
It could be real or just an act.

208
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,150
I don't need to be caught
in a couple's drama. What a pain.

209
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,390
Manager Gu.

210
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,300
At a time as crucial as this,
you have the nerve to be sleepy?

211
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,600
I'm not sleepy, ma'am.

212
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,810
It looks like CEO Joo
is going to take Cha Jung Won...

213
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,240
and cause a scene
at the Kunhyang house.

214
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,740
I have to act before they do.

215
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,910
I will never doze off.
Please forgive me.

216
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,850
I won't care if you doze off or not.

217
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,120
Just do your job right, understand?

218
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,790
Just give me the order.

219
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,520
You're practically dead
on your feet.

220
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,160
I'll have to make a fake audio file.

221
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,800
But don't we already
have a voice recording file...

222
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
between you and Chairman Jin?

223
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,930
Why are you in such a rush today?
You're usually slow as molasses.

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,470
Then who should be recorded?

225
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,640
Jin Tae Seok and Han Hye Ra.

226
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,910
(Haeoreum Psychiatric Hospital)

227
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,100
It's been a while, Mi Soo.

228
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,470
You're here again.

229
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,970
It wouldn't be good for you
if someone saw you here.

230
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,110
You don't look to be in bad shape
at all.

231
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,710
So why was your discharge delayed?

232
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,610
The doctor said my condition
is still highly unstable.

233
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,920
Your attending physician is
Dr. Yoon, whom I introduced, right?

234
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,790
He got switched the day before
I was supposed to be discharged.

235
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,500
But Dr. Yoon clearly said
you could resume daily life.

236
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,330
I agree. Something feels off.

237
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,930
But...

238
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,170
I'm afraid I might act impulsively
like I used to.

239
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,380
Hey, Jung Guk.

240
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,630
I didn't think Chairman Jin Tae Seok
would have her put in a closed ward.

241
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,860
It's because he wants my sister
to stay hidden...

242
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,860
- forever.
- I'm too ashamed...

243
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,330
to face Mi Soo.

244
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,240
I needed an educational background
and work experience...

245
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,000
worthy of
the Kunhyang family's matriarch.

246
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,840
I know you feel indebted
to my sister.

247
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,940
You've already paid that debt
in full.

248
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,950
I wanted to help her
make a comeback...

249
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,880
when she gets out of the hospital.

250
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,390
- So she could hold her exhibit...
- Why are you doing all this for us?

251
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,720
Are you asking why I'm trying
to help her now...

252
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,190
when I was the one
who stole her artist career before?

253
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,260
That's right.

254
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,630
Just use her,
and then throw her away...

255
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,630
when she's no longer useful.

256
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,000
- Just like Chairman Jin did.
- Are you already...

257
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,070
prepared to be thrown away?

258
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,710
The one who sent CEO Joo Ha Neul...

259
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,710
the audio file
related to Joo Sang Cheol's death.

260
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,750
Was it you, Manager Hwang?

261
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,480
I don't know anything about that.

262
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,920
Chairman Jin
probably already suspects you.

263
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,560
Leave Jin Tae Seok...

264
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,560
before he casts you away.

265
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,060
Come and work for me.

266
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,830
As for your sister,

267
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,540
I'll protect her.

268
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,370
Chairman Jin Tae Seok,
on the other hand,

269
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,210
will try to have her killed.

270
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,650
My goodness!

271
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,720
Gosh, you startled me.

272
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,020
Why aren't you in bed?
What are you doing here...

273
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,200
Did you do this?

274
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,530
I did.

275
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,040
Or more accurately,

276
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,770
you're the one who made me do it.

277
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,810
Why did you keep me waiting?

278
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,310
Why won't you answer my calls?

279
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,620
Why did you meet Gong Nan Sook?

280
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,550
Why...

281
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,990
Why are you going around
behind my back?

282
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,790
- Where were you? Who did you meet?
- That's enough.

283
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,560
How long are you going to
keep this up?

284
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,970
Cha Ki Beom is dead!

285
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,240
The man I couldn't forget,

286
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,240
the man I used Su A to see.
He's gone now.

287
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,210
I know,

288
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,680
but when I can't get ahold of you,
I feel like I'm going crazy.

289
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,410
I want to know what you do
behind my back...

290
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,980
and which jerk you're seeing.

291
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,680
I want to just wring his neck!

292
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,260
I...

293
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,500
I don't know what came over me.

294
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,760
You were just so late,

295
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,970
so I got worried.

296
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,940
I'm sleeping in here tonight.

297
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,510
I still have work to do.

298
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,990
I'll help you forget Cha Jung Won.

299
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,890
I don't want you,
much less love you.

300
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,760
There's no way that'd have happened
unless I lost my mind.

301
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,200
I must have been drunk
and had a nightmare.

302
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,540
Did you sleep well?

303
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,180
What are you doing here?

304
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,580
Gosh, I'm hurt.

305
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,150
Don't you remember?

306
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,250
So it was real?

307
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,950
Last night was incredible.

308
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,220
- Get out now!
- And that will make this go away?

309
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,390
I said, get out!

310
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,830
Se Hoon, breakfast is ready.

311
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,570
Jin Se Hoon.

312
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,770
You're my man now.

313
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,020
Good morning.

314
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,720
You look like you didn't sleep well.

315
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,020
You must still feel uncomfortable.

316
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,860
I'll get used to it.
You don't have to worry about me.

317
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,060
It's not just about
you adjusting to us, Su A.

318
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,970
The Kunhyang family
needs time to adjust too.

319
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,140
It's Cha Jung Won.

320
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,800
Please call me Jung Won.

321
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,470
- You're Su A. Why call you that?
- I was only Su A till I was seven.

322
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,410
I've been living
as Cha Jung Won ever since.

323
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,050
As my dad's daughter.

324
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,990
Mom, Dad! We have a huge problem.

325
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,290
You won't believe what I just saw.

326
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,500
Mother, Father.
Please enjoy your meal.

327
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,800
Is she out of her mind?

328
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,310
Joo Young Chae,
what are you doing here?

329
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,950
- I told you to get out.
- Come on, Honey.

330
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,450
Why are you making it so obvious
in front of your parents?

331
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,250
Let's at least wait for them
to finish their meal...

332
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,820
before we make our announcement.

333
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,860
What announcement?

334
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,930
Is there something we should know?

335
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,940
Last night, Se Hoon and I...

336
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,270
I'm heading to work.

337
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,610
I have an early meeting.

338
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,520
Mother, Father, and Se Mi.

339
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,120
Is there anything else
I can get for you?

340
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,190
Can I have a word with you?

341
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
What?

342
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,870
You and Se Hoon
slept together last night?

343
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,200
Yes, Mother.

344
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,240
Now, please formally accept me
as your daughter-in-law.

345
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,310
It looked like
Se Hoon didn't feel the same way.

346
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,040
Se Hoon feels the same way I do.

347
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,040
He just hasn't admitted it
to himself yet.

348
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:33,550
Young Chae, are you really so naive?
Or are you just pretending to be?

349
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,420
A one-night stand...

350
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,360
doesn't have to mean love.
Why pretend you don't know that?

351
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,090
I never said it was love.

352
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,760
But you said you two feel the same.

353
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,770
You're saying you see my Se Hoon
as a casual...

354
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,330
It's not casual at all.

355
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,540
It's so serious...

356
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,770
- that I'm doing this crazy thing.
- Joo Young Chae.

357
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,980
Do you really want our Se Hoon?

358
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,380
Yes.

359
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,080
Desperately.

360
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,520
Oh, Young Chae.

361
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,290
Hey, I've been dying to know
what happened last night.

362
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,390
- What happened?
- Where's Ha Neul?

363
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,560
In his room, I guess.

364
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,500
Hey!

365
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,800
Look at her,
not even answering her own mother.

366
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,170
I wonder if Ha Neul called for her.

367
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
That's right.

368
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,740
I used your phone to text
Cha Jung Won and Jin Se Hoon.

369
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,040
Why would you do something
like that?

370
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,610
You made things so awkward
for Jung Won and me.

371
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,680
Awkward? Please.

372
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,710
You held each other
and cried your eyes out.

373
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,210
It was so incredibly moving.

374
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,680
You were spying on us too?

375
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,820
I set the stage.
You expect me not to watch the show?

376
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,620
It was a spectacular finale.

377
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,430
- Se Hoon and I had one too.
- What are you talking about?

378
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,030
What happened with Se Hoon...

379
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,260
You got Se Hoon in the sack?

380
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,430
Mom!

381
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,830
You brat.
What's with all the yelling?

382
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,140
You slept with Jin Se Hoon?

383
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,540
Well, this morning,

384
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,040
I even got a little taste of being
the Kunhyang daughter-in-law.

385
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,280
- Oh, my gosh! Tell me everything!
- This is my room.

386
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,180
Would you both please get out?

387
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,020
What did Jin Se Hoon say?
And what about Han Hye Ra?

388
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,190
What did Jin Tae Seok say?

389
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,090
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

390
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,330
Hey.

391
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,400
For real? You really slept with him?

392
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,660
Yes.

393
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,070
Oh, my gosh, that's fantastic!

394
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,400
For the first time in forever,

395
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:35,110
my daughter has made me proud.
That's my girl!

396
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,270
So now I'm your daughter?

397
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,310
See what happens
when you listen to your mother?

398
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,580
- This is just the beginning.
- I know.

399
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,950
I'm going to make Jin Se Hoon
fall for me.

400
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,250
For real.

401
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:52,220
What a foolish idea.
What good are genuine feelings?

402
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,060
Just get pregnant.

403
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,530
Get pregnant? Mom, are you crazy?

404
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,530
I can't get pregnant
just because I want to.

405
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,530
Besides, it would ruin my figure.

406
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,530
Who cares about your figure?
I'm sure you can do it.

407
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,740
- Just get pregnant.
- Not again!

408
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,440
I'll handle it myself this time.
You stay out of it.

409
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,970
I have to get to work.

410
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,080
Fine, just handle it well. Got it?

411
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,110
We need to prepare...

412
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,480
the spring-summer women's collection
for next year.

413
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,720
Since we're a new team,
our schedule is tight.

414
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,390
Ms. Joo Young Chae.

415
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,190
Yes?

416
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,390
Since you're from
New York Royal Art School,

417
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,690
I can expect a lot from you, right?

418
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,390
Of course.

419
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,260
Ms. Cha Jung Won?

420
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,570
Yes, Director Jin.

421
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,830
I have high expectations
for you as well.

422
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,270
Your skills must be incredible
for a high school graduate...

423
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,170
to land a designer position
at Kunhyang.

424
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,010
Isn't everyone curious about
what these two can do?

425
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,450
It's pretty obvious, isn't it?

426
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,310
There's no way a high school grad...

427
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,850
can beat
a New York Royal Art School grad.

428
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,420
You might have to eat your words.

429
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,960
I know just how skilled Ms. Cha is.

430
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,190
Ms. Ahn Ji Na, you'll be supporting
Ms. Joo Young Chae.

431
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,330
And Ms. Kim Sung Hee,
you'll support Ms. Cha Jung Won.

432
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,100
You're telling me
I'm on support duty?

433
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,630
I'm counting on you.

434
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,570
Let's work well together,
Designer Cha Jung Won.

435
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,870
- Okay.
- Oh, right.

436
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,380
We'll have a team dinner.

437
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,740
Do you have any recommendations?

438
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,410
I know the perfect place.

439
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,020
So you checked the payment history
for the package,

440
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,090
but they said there's no record
because it was paid for in cash?

441
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,990
I went to the convenience store
it was sent from...

442
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,290
and checked the CCTV,

443
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,130
but they wore a hat, mask,
and shades,

444
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,130
so I couldn't identify them.

445
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,400
You couldn't even tell
if it was a man or a woman?

446
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,000
It looked like a man,

447
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,000
but I can't be sure.

448
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,200
Who could it be?

449
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,040
Who would send you...

450
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,180
the recording file of
Chairman Gong Nan Sook and Jin Tae Seok?

451
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,550
It has to be the person
who wants me the most...

452
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,280
to reveal the truth
about my father's death.

453
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,380
But everyone around us
wants to keep it buried.

454
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,750
Then who could it be?

455
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,760
I have to find them.

456
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,330
But first, there's someone
I need to meet.

457
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,400
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

458
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,570
- The side dishes are delicious!
- It melts in your mouth. My gosh.

459
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,630
You're here.

460
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,200
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

461
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,040
- I'll get it.
- It's fine.

462
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,070
Yes, on my way.

463
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,010
Let's eat up and get some more.

464
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,640
Let's order another one of these.

465
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,080
What did I do
to deserve such a great daughter?

466
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,260
My team will have
dinner here tonight at 7 p.m.

467
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,190
A team dinner?
Great, bring them on over.

468
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,990
I'll whip up a huge feast for you.

469
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,260
You're a natural at being
a barbecue restaurant owner, Mom.

470
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,700
It's all thanks to you.

471
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,540
It's as if the late Ki Beom...

472
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,340
is watching over me.

473
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,610
That's because
you're such an amazing cook.

474
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,780
Just don't overdo it.
Make sure you take breaks.

475
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,080
- Okay?
- Okay. Gosh, you.

476
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,420
Joo Sang Cheol.

477
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,460
So, Chairman Gong Nan Sook
killed your father,

478
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,830
and I cleaned up her mess?

479
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,060
Am I wrong?

480
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Should I play the recording for you?

481
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,830
That won't be necessary.

482
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,400
I want to know the truth.

483
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,970
That was 25 years ago.

484
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,540
Chairman Gong Nan Sook
suddenly caused a huge mess.

485
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,980
Let's say you were just helping
to clean up for argument's sake.

486
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,150
Even so, how could you...

487
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,520
- pin the crime on Cha Ki Beom?
- He's already dead.

488
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,390
Are you going to clear his name?

489
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,430
I will clear him of this dishonor
and shame...

490
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,900
by proving his innocence.

491
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,700
Do you have any idea
what that means?

492
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,440
It means that you'll tell the world
your mother, Gong Nan Sook,

493
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,740
is the real killer...

494
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,040
of the murder case
past its statute of limitations.

495
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,140
Gong Nan Sook!

496
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,610
She doesn't deserve
to be called my mother.

497
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,080
And I'll oust her from
the chairman's seat, no matter what.

498
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,320
Will Chairman Gong Nan Sook
just stand by and take it?

499
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,690
Neither will I.

500
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,790
Are you afraid Kunhyang Group...

501
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,060
will go down with Chairman Gong
if she goes down?

502
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,300
So you intend to break
a boulder with an egg?

503
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,730
How pathetic.

504
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,670
Let's see
just how much you can find out...

505
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,910
and how much you can really do.

506
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,110
(A Graceful Liar)

507
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,910
So, things are going well
with Young Chae, right?

508
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,340
Grandma is telling me
you should be careful of a woman.

509
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,380
Who is that woman?

510
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,610
- Joo Young Chae.
- Grandma!

511
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,150
You framed my dad as a murderer
and tore me away from him?

512
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,550
The more you find out,
the deeper you fall into this mess.

513
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,750
That's why I have to find out more.
And I have to fight.

514
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,420
Did you forge that file
to frame Cha Ki Beom for murder?

515
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,460
The Kunhyang family
has become the sworn enemy...

516
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,630
of Cha Jung Won and Joo Ha Neul.

517
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,760
Nip this in the bud before they get
the idea to come after Kunhyang.

518
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
