00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,710
(Episode 47)

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,120
(The Witch)

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,450
- I'm busy right now. I'll call...
- Don't you dare hang up on me.

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,060
It's your birthday today. Happy...

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,390
This birthday might be
the death of me.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,360
What? What is it this time?

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,760
What did that brat Cha Jung Won
do now?

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,930
I think she's about to tell everyone
she's the real Su A.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,700
Han Hye Ra is waiting for her
at the cafe right now.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,870
Hey, not yet. You have to stop her,
no matter what.

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,310
I'll give her what she's asking for.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,310
Hey, Young Chae!

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,290
- She's going to do something crazy.
- I'm home.

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,820
Ha Neul, I'm glad you're here.

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,120
Listen, Young Chae, that brat,

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,220
is on a rampage,
threatening to hurt Cha Jung Won.

17
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,960
Where is Young Chae right now?

18
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,850
- You'll tell everyone you're Su A?
- Because I am.

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,750
Then what does that make me?
I'm Su A right now.

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,720
What happens to me if you tell them?

21
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,360
You'll just vanish into thin air.

22
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,590
It'll be hard for you to
go back to being Joo Young Chae.

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,490
You won't be Cha Jung Won or Su A.

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,600
So, who are you supposed to be then?

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Hey!

26
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,400
Hey.

27
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,350
Are you okay?

28
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,170
Do you have any idea
what you've just done?

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,670
Lucky you.

30
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,770
Not a scratch on you.

31
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,380
Did you really want to hurt me?

32
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,840
You vicious witch.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,580
Because you are
about to ruin my life!

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,750
- Don't meet with Han Hye Ra.
- That's my decision to make.

35
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,690
Let's go.
You're not thinking straight.

36
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,930
- Come on.
- Let go!

37
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,430
Gosh, seriously!

38
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,700
What happened to you?
Your clothes are a mess,

39
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,210
and you look like a wreck.

40
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,610
You said you missed her so much.

41
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,780
So why don't you recognize her?

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,180
Your own daughter.

43
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,450
My daughter, Su A, is fine.
What are you saying?

44
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,820
You still don't get it, do you?

45
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,460
Who the real Su A is.

46
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,730
If I were Su A...

47
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,970
If you were Su A?

48
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,070
I would never forgive you. Ever.

49
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,040
You're lying.

50
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,040
How can you not recognize your child
standing right in front of you?

51
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,480
That's not true, is it?

52
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,120
How could you possibly be Su A?

53
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,120
If it hadn't been for that accident,

54
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,300
were you really coming to get me?

55
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,770
I...

56
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,170
am Su A.

57
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,740
- I told you I have a right to know.
- You are Joo Young Chae.

58
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,750
You're Se Hoon's wife
and my daughter-in-law.

59
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,780
There is absolutely no way
you're Su A.

60
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,990
And you can't be Su A.
No! It's not true.

61
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,590
Just because you run from it,
doesn't mean the truth will change.

62
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,270
What about the results?

63
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,100
You and Ms. Cha Su A...

64
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,740
have a 0.123 percent probability
of a blood relationship.

65
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,380
She is not your biological daughter.

66
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,460
That girl wasn't Su A.

67
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,760
Then that means...

68
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,340
(DNA Test Results)

69
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,240
I had a DNA test done too.

70
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,850
I did it myself.

71
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,420
(DNA Test Results)

72
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,360
This flimsy piece of paper...

73
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,730
is easy enough to fake.

74
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,700
Shall we get tested right now?

75
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,240
So you're Su A,

76
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,940
and you're Cha Jung Won?

77
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,510
Then why were you pretending
to be Joo Young Chae?

78
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,350
You knew this and married my son?

79
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,450
Because I wanted to show you...

80
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,250
exactly what you'd done wrong.

81
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,090
And how you could live...

82
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,160
so peacefully and without a care.

83
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,500
Did you really look for me
so desperately?

84
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,330
How could you not find me
after all those years?

85
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,440
- Or did you not want to find me?
- No.

86
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,910
Not for a single moment...

87
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,410
did I forget about my Su A.

88
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,720
As the years went by,

89
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,460
I thought the skies
had taken pity on me...

90
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,560
and helped me find her.

91
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,390
That girl isn't Su A,

92
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,460
but it's you?

93
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,130
That's right.

94
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,000
I can't believe it.

95
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,000
How could my daughter
be my daughter-in-law?

96
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,440
That's just wrong.

97
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,480
How could you do a thing like that?

98
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,010
Just how?

99
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,920
Let go of me!

100
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,260
Are you crazy?

101
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,060
- Jung Won could've been hurt.
- I hated her. I wanted her dead.

102
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,930
Jung Won is Su A. She's just trying
to take back what's rightfully hers.

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,030
Does the world revolve
around Cha Jung Won?

104
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,930
I'm still Su A.

105
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,540
I'll be thrown out of Kunhyang
before I can leave on my own terms.

106
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Listen.

107
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,770
If you're going to start something,
you'd better see it through.

108
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,810
Do you think I really wanted
to finish off Cha Jung Won?

109
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,010
If you can finish her,
it's better to be thorough.

110
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,380
Didn't you send me there
to stop Young Chae?

111
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,650
I wondered if she could be stopped.

112
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,460
And I wanted to know...

113
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,260
how much you cared
about Cha Jung Won, that brat.

114
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,390
So?

115
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,490
Do I look like I care
that much about Jung Won?

116
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,530
Enough to risk my life for her?

117
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,070
How would I know?
I didn't see it for myself.

118
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,300
It looked to me like you would.

119
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,370
Was I just supposed to stand there
and watch?

120
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,640
Quiet, that's enough.
Young Chae, from now on,

121
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,910
don't dream of hurting Cha Jung Won
or anyone else.

122
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,150
If someone has to do the dirty work,
I'll do it.

123
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,480
Are you pretending to care about me?

124
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,620
How touching.

125
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,190
As if you have maternal instinct.

126
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,820
Maternal instinct? What's that?

127
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,590
Does it put food on the table?

128
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
What?

129
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,870
You're not cut out for this yet.
I'm the one who cleans up the mess.

130
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,500
Lady, then go ahead
and get rid of Cha Jung Won.

131
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,540
Stop it.

132
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,370
"Lady?" Who do you think
you're talking to, Young Chae?

133
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,580
So now you call me Young Chae?

134
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,340
Is it because Cha Jung Won
is about to take her rightful place?

135
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,110
Then you can just go back
to being Joo Young Chae.

136
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,380
There's no such thing
as rightful place.

137
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,580
If you force your way in
and sit down,

138
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,290
then that becomes your place.

139
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,620
How can you say something
so twisted?

140
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,090
If Jung Won turns out to be Su A,

141
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,360
then of course, Young Chae should
return as your daughter.

142
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,290
It's not that simple.

143
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,960
The thing is,
they think the fake Su A...

144
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,070
is legally registered
as Jo Mi Hyang's adopted daughter.

145
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,120
If you and I had a past life,

146
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,330
- we must have been lovers...
- Or mother and daughter.

147
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,330
My daughter-in-law...

148
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,440
was my daughter, Su A.

149
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,140
How...

150
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,350
How could this have happened?

151
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,270
Did you tell Vice Chairman Han?

152
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,770
She must have been shocked.

153
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,970
Especially since she thought
Young Chae was Su A.

154
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,040
I know that's not easy
for her to accept the fact...

155
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,110
that her daughter-in-law
is her daughter.

156
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,310
But...

157
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,320
I feel like
she's denying the truth...

158
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,650
and rejecting me along with it.

159
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,490
I figured as much, but it hurts.

160
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,030
Just think of it
as part of the process.

161
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,160
You were brave
to tell her the truth.

162
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,670
There may be some fallout for a bit,
but you can get through this.

163
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,040
I can't imagine
how shocked Se Hoon will be.

164
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,010
He'll feel so betrayed.

165
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,710
Se Hoon will have to accept
the truth too.

166
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,150
He'll accept you as his sister.

167
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,650
He'll resent me...

168
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,620
and never forgive me.

169
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,490
But Se Hoon would still love you...

170
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,390
even if you're not blood-related
to him.

171
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,130
And you?

172
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,700
Would you be willing
to start over with him?

173
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,170
That must hurt.

174
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,280
Then what about me?

175
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,350
Will I be able to just...

176
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,920
watch you from afar?

177
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
Sorry.

178
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,930
It's okay.

179
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,200
Looks like you got hurt
trying to save me.

180
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,440
- Let's go to the ER.
- Let's go to the ER.

181
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,280
(The Crown Capital)

182
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,680
How will Han Hye Ra handle this?

183
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,050
Will she expose it right away,

184
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,420
like she did
when she found the fake Su A?

185
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,920
She can't. She'd have to admit...

186
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,260
the girl she announced as Su A
in an official gathering...

187
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,820
is actually an impostor.

188
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,860
And more importantly,
there's Se Hoon.

189
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,060
Exactly.

190
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,300
She doesn't have the guts
to reveal...

191
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,070
that her daughter-in-law was
pretending to be Joo Young Chae,

192
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,100
and that girl is her daughter
she abandoned long ago.

193
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,640
Guts? She's soft in appearance
but strong in character.

194
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,640
Maybe she's even tougher than you.

195
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,940
She might even be more than
a match for me.

196
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,650
Don't be ridiculous.
Hye Ra is just a delicate flower.

197
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,620
How dare you compare her to me?
Let a hundred of her come at me.

198
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,490
See if I even flinch.

199
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,060
Underestimate her,
and you'll be sorry.

200
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,860
Whatever.
What should we do about the kids?

201
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,760
If this gets out to the press,
Kunhyang's stock will tank.

202
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,000
Start by making Jin Se Hoon
divorce that brat.

203
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,970
You think he'll listen to me?

204
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,840
You have to make him!

205
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,210
Come on, don't be like this.
We both know the game.

206
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,440
Right. What about the fake Su A?

207
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,780
How are you going to handle her?

208
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,150
I'll take care of her.
You stay out of it.

209
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,820
But will Se Hoon...

210
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,920
even listen to me?

211
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,730
- You want me to get a divorce?
- It's the best option right now.

212
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,800
- Father!
- It's Chairman.

213
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,870
Yes, Chairman.

214
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,800
You have no right to interfere
in my divorce, Chairman.

215
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,470
I know Vice Chairman is furious
about Young Chae.

216
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,510
Why would you do this to me,
Chairman?

217
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,710
Do you want to see me
completely lose it?

218
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,110
I'm trying to prevent
a bigger bombshell from dropping.

219
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,820
What bombshell could be bigger
than my divorce?

220
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,690
You'll find out soon enough.

221
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,750
No matter what happens,

222
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,390
I am never divorcing Young Chae.

223
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,190
You want me to go after Jin Se Hoon
more aggressively?

224
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,660
That's your job.
It's the only way you'll survive.

225
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,400
Do you want me
to make him divorce her?

226
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,800
- That would come first. And then...
- And then what?

227
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,940
You should be the daughter-in-law
of the Kunhyang family...

228
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,270
since you're
the real Joo Young Chae.

229
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,610
Can I go back
to being Joo Young Chae?

230
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,210
Not right away.

231
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,780
Let's take care of
Han Hye Ra and Cha Jung Won first.

232
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,350
Are you going to take care of them
for me, Mom?

233
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,050
That was my original master plan
all along.

234
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,690
Then who am I supposed to be
in the meantime?

235
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,390
Well, about that...

236
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,590
Since your fake Su A cover is blown,

237
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,960
you'll live
as Jo Mi Hyang's adopted daughter...

238
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,600
just for a little while.

239
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,670
Mom!

240
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,300
Memorize the name.
I hear it's Cha Ji A.

241
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,970
Don't give me that nonsense!
I have to be a fake again?

242
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,480
Why does it matter who you are now?

243
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,380
You will live gracefully
as the daughter-in-law...

244
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,980
of the Kunhyang family,
and the two of us...

245
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,620
will take over
the entire Kunhyang Family.

246
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,950
That's what's important.

247
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,260
It will heal quickly.

248
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,460
They said I can
take the bandage off tomorrow.

249
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,200
But you sprained your elbow.

250
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,030
Don't do that again.

251
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,300
No.

252
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,840
If you were in danger,
I'd save you a hundred times.

253
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,440
Are you two having a moment again?

254
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,010
No, Young Chae and I got hurt,
so we're coming from the hospital.

255
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,680
Hurt? Both of you, together?

256
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:47,350
You went
to the hospital together too?

257
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,790
How did this happen?

258
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,890
If you were hurt,
you should've called me first.

259
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,460
Let's just go. I'm tired.

260
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,770
She must be exhausted,

261
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,970
and now she has to deal
with Se Hoon.

262
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,000
Whatever it takes,

263
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,930
you and I...

264
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,270
are going back
to the Kunhyang house.

265
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,870
Just hang in there.

266
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,370
We should...

267
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,610
get divorced.

268
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,510
What?

269
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,750
Young Chae.

270
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,920
I'm sorry...

271
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,490
for everything with you.

272
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,120
If you find out the truth,

273
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,890
I can only imagine
how shocked you'd be...

274
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,190
and how betrayed you'd feel.

275
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,160
Say it so I can understand
what you mean.

276
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,930
Did things get more serious
between you and Ha Neul?

277
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,140
So serious that you're thinking
of divorcing me?

278
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,270
Is that the "bombshell"
my father was talking about?

279
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,240
It's not about Ha Neul.

280
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,040
Then what is
so serious between us...

281
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,350
that you want a divorce?

282
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,250
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

283
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,330
You startled me!
Goodness, Vice Chairman Han.

284
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,400
I'm surprised you know
how to just show up unannounced.

285
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,570
That's unexpected.

286
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,440
Why are you getting so close?

287
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,550
Oh, my. Are you trying to
admire my pretty face up close?

288
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,710
Oh, my!

289
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,320
What, are you crazy?
Hey, Han Hye Ra!

290
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,820
Gong Nan Sook, you...

291
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,350
"You?"

292
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,930
Let go of me. My goodness,
so much for being delicate.

293
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,660
You're surprisingly strong!
My goodness!

294
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,930
You treat people's lives
like they're nothing,

295
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,830
Gong Nan Sook.

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,370
You must know
since you've heard my reputation.

297
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,940
So don't test me.
Let me go while I'm asking nicely.

298
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,170
You won't?

299
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,310
Then who's going to be
the one to kill you?

300
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,010
What?

301
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,480
Should I do the honors?

302
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,420
You made my own daughter...

303
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,020
my daughter-in-law?

304
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,860
Gong Nan Sook, you think
I'd let you get away with it?

305
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,630
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

306
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,770
And here I thought
it was something serious.

307
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,740
Hey. Your daughter came to me,
crying her eyes out...

308
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,240
and begged me.

309
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,610
She begged me to help get revenge
on the mother who abandoned her.

310
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,650
She said she would live
as Young Chae...

311
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,920
and push you, Han Hye Ra,
right off a cliff.

312
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,050
She really said that?

313
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,620
My worthless daughter ran off
to Paris with some man.

314
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,760
She had Cha Jung Won take her place.
What was I supposed to do?

315
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,100
I have big business with Kunhyang.

316
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,600
Should I have given it up
for my daughter?

317
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,230
So you decided to defraud
the Kunhyang family instead?

318
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,970
If Chairman Jin finds out...

319
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,970
Hey, you really think
Chairman Jin doesn't know?

320
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,740
What? He knows?

321
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
Him too?

322
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,750
It was your husband, Jin Tae Seok,
who suggested creating a fake Su A.

323
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,890
Wasn't it enough that my daughter
became my daughter-in-law?

324
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,720
Did you have to devise
this fake Su A scheme with my husband too?

325
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,360
That's how real business gets done.

326
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,070
For you, who spout elegant lines
like a delicate flower,

327
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,940
it's a world
you would never understand.

328
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,940
What you did today
was super original,

329
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,910
my dear Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra.

330
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,450
You're home late.

331
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,260
Care for a glass of wine?

332
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,860
Did you have a rough day?

333
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,170
This business with the fake Su A.

334
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,140
You knew about it, didn't you?

335
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,280
Of course, you knew.

336
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,710
- I didn't know.
- Liar!

337
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,280
Calm down.
Just listen to me, Hye Ra.

338
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,290
You conspired with Gong Nan Sook...

339
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,850
and pulled the wool over my eyes.

340
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,390
Did you think I wouldn't find out
about the fake Su A?

341
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,760
Who told you such nonsense?

342
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,960
Gong Nan Sook told me everything.

343
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,200
Gong Nan Sook?

344
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,100
- Has she lost her mind?
- You always know everything...

345
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,370
even before I do,

346
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,440
no, you make me believe your lies.

347
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,710
For that,

348
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,780
I despise you.

349
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,350
When you're angry with me,
my whole world falls apart.

350
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,190
You can despise me.

351
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,120
Just stay with me.

352
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,460
Mom, Dad,
can you come out here a second?

353
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,780
- What do you think you're doing?
- I've done something wrong.

354
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,940
I've been lying.

355
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,010
Did Gong Nan Sook
already tip her off?

356
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,780
Seriously...

357
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,720
She's one sly fox.

358
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,290
Gosh, Su A,
what could you have lied about?

359
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,890
I guess we're about to find out.

360
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,430
What did you do wrong?

361
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I am...

362
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,000
not Su A.

363
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm an impostor.

364
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,310
What is she saying?
I must've misheard her, right, Mom?

365
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,850
Then who are you?

366
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,650
I heard Jo Mi Hyang
has an adopted daughter.

367
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,320
That's you, isn't it?

368
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,090
I asked you who you are!

369
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,100
You asked me
that same question before.

370
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,270
Joo Young Chae.

371
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,340
I'm Gong Nan Sook's daughter.

372
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,580
So you're really...

373
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,110
Joo Young Chae?

374
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,910
If you don't believe me,
call Chairman Gong Nan Sook now.

375
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,550
Gong Nan Sook...

376
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,450
What on earth has she done now?

377
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,150
The surest way to know...

378
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,390
is a DNA test between me
and Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

379
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,960
Go ahead and run it yourself.

380
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,930
Wait, then who's our sister-in-law?

381
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,670
Cha Jung Won.

382
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,340
She's the real Su A.

383
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,410
Honey!

384
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Mom!

385
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,620
(DNA Test Results)

386
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,960
You already got
another DNA test done?

387
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,390
I had to be sure.

388
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,960
Using my hair and your toothbrush
from the annex.

389
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,630
Do you believe me now?

390
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,830
That I'm Su A.

391
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,290
Su A.

392
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,690
My baby.

393
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,700
I've finally found my daughter.

394
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,470
I can't bring myself
to call you "Mom" yet.

395
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,910
I understand.

396
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,780
Until you're ready,

397
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,080
I'll wait.

398
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,450
I've been waiting for this moment.

399
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,590
But I still hate you.

400
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,420
And I resent you.

401
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,930
Hate me if you want.

402
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,900
Resent me?
You can resent me all you want.

403
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,810
For whatever reason,
it took 25 years to find each other.

404
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,610
I, your own mother,
failed to recognize you.

405
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,620
Even though you were
right in front of my eyes.

406
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,480
I want to believe that
you didn't stop looking for me...

407
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,020
and that it was because
of the accident,

408
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,920
but the fact remains you left
your daughter at age seven...

409
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,160
when her father
was framed for murder.

410
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,200
That doesn't change.

411
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,530
You're right.

412
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,130
That's right.

413
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,770
I betrayed your father.

414
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,570
I won't deny it.

415
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,010
But you, Su A...

416
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,850
I was desperate to get you back.

417
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,210
I'll spend my life
making it up to you.

418
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,780
For what I did wrong
to your father...

419
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,690
and the pain and resentment
in your heart,

420
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,790
I want to ease them all.

421
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,430
Please let me, Su A.

422
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,930
Start by putting back
this tangled mess we're in...

423
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,100
in its rightful place.

424
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,400
I bet the mother and daughter reunion
was a tearjerker.

425
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,810
It's so predictable.

426
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,370
You lied to me too?

427
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,410
Fake Su A is your real daughter,
Joo Young Chae, isn't she?

428
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,780
Gosh, that darn Young Chae.

429
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,150
I told her over and over
that the time wasn't right.

430
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,020
What else?

431
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,720
Are you hiding anything else
from me?

432
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,890
What else is there to hide?
The cat's out of the bag now.

433
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,700
Just hurry up
and get Jin Se Hoon a divorce.

434
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,370
Then I'm going to make sure
he and my Young Chae get hitched.

435
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,440
So you can't let go of Kunhyang,
can you?

436
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,840
And you, Chairman Jin?

437
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,940
Can you afford to lose my vault?

438
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,380
If I have them divorce,

439
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,380
he'll be divorcing Joo Young Chae,
won't he?

440
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
What are you talking about?

441
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,380
We must leave their marriage as is
on paper.

442
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,090
So you want me to separate that girl
from Se Hoon?

443
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,660
Then what? Are you going to
let Han Hye Ra's daughter...

444
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,420
remain your daughter-in-law?

445
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,490
That's messed up on another level.
No way.

446
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,100
Se Hoon takes after me.
He only has eyes for one woman.

447
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,430
Please. How can you know
so little about men and women?

448
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,770
With enough persistence,
any man will give in.

449
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,610
If only it were that easy.

450
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,240
Now that you're Su A,

451
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,220
I suppose you'll have
to divorce Se Hoon.

452
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,580
I'm prepared for that.

453
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,990
I'll just have to convince Se Hoon
to accept it.

454
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,790
It won't be easy.

455
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,600
Once things are settled
with Se Hoon,

456
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,430
I will officially announce...

457
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,040
that you're my daughter, Su A.

458
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,000
It'll be messy
if the press finds out before then.

459
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,010
There are already...

460
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,810
a lot of people who think
Joo Young Chae is Su A,

461
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,650
and I need time for damage control.

462
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,750
You understand, right?

463
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,160
I know it might be
difficult for now,

464
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,490
but I want you
to move into the Kunhyang house.

465
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,430
What do you think, Su A?

466
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm going to stay
at my dad's for a while.

467
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,670
I'll think about it.

468
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,440
You don't think there will be
more trouble with Joo Young Chae?

469
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,210
Young Chae and I are both
just returning to where we belong.

470
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,280
From now on,
she can just live as Joo Young Chae,

471
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,580
so I just have to hope
there won't be any more problems.

472
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,680
If only that were the case.

473
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,560
I have to get back to the office.

474
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,620
Let's get lunch tomorrow.

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,860

- What's this about?
- Ki Beom.

479
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,270
How could you do this to me?

480
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,940

I'll text you the location.

Let's meet tomorrow at 4 p.m.
in front of Kunhyang Gallery.

483
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,420
It's about Su A.

484
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,160
Did she find out Jung Won is Su A?

485
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,790
You must be hungry.

486
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,130
What's that?
Why are you hiding your phone?

487
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,530
You have something to hide?

488
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,860
Don't be ridiculous.

489
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,300
You smell like barbecue again.
What on earth have you been up to?

490
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,810
Well, it's only the smell
that stuck to me.

491
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,140
Goodness.
Your stomach is growling up a storm.

492
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,750
Why do you reek so much of barbecue
for days?

493
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,080
Tell me now.

494
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,690

00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,530
You want to get barbecue?

500
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,070
Let's just go inside first.

501
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,610
Come on, just sit down here.

00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,840
Gosh, this place is packed.

503
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,010
- Honey.
- What is it?

504
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,450
You want something expensive?

505
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,650
Go ahead. Order whatever you want.

What is?

508
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,190
This barbecue place. It's mine.
Jung Won set it up for me.

509
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,630
I'm the owner.

510
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,830
What?

511
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,100
I'll give it a shot.

512
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,000
It's not too hard,
and I think I can manage.

513
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,970
Wait, she was kicked out
from the Kunhyang family.

514
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,370
How could she possibly afford this?

515
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,140
I guess she did it
because she could.

516
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,610
You had a whole grand opening,
and you're only telling me now?

517
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,040
This is a total betrayal.

518
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,180
What about you?

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,610

Not one single thing?

- What?
- Let's put it all on the table.

521
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,850
Have you never talked to Young Sun
behind my back?

522
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,820
It was good.

523
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,560
How do you order here?

524
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,130
So you are hiding something.

525
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,500
You're saying Hye Ra is meeting
Cha Ki Beom tomorrow?

526
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,800
The wiretap confirms it, sir.

527
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,200
Where? What time?

528
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,540
I'm trying to figure that out.

529
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,070
You brought
Vice Chairman's cloned phone, right?

530
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,410
(Kunhyang Gallery)

531
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,980
(Notice of Closure,
Closed for Exhibition Change)

532
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,720
(Let's meet tomorrow at 4 p.m.
in front of Kunhyang Gallery.)

533
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,790
(It's about Su A.)

534
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,030
Tomorrow's the perfect day...

535
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,430
to eliminate Cha Ki Beom.

536
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,700
Tomorrow?

537
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,210
Kunhyang Gallery at 4 p.m.? Got it.

538
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,080
So, tomorrow is D-Day.

539
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,090
(A Graceful Liar)

540
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,780
You're not Joo Young Chae
but Su A, my mother's daughter?

541
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,390
You married me while hiding that?

542
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:06,220
That's more than enough reason
for us to get a divorce, isn't it?

543
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,960
Why is Young Chae claiming
she's Cha Jung Won,

544
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,130
I mean, Su A,
Vice Chairman Han's child?

545
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,830
- Then where's the real Young Chae?
- I'm Joo Young Chae, Se Hoon.

546
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,100
I have a bad feeling Jin Tae Seok
is going to cause a huge mess today.

547
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,100
Why is Dad meeting
with Vice Chairman Han?

548
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,100
I have a bad feeling about this.

549
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,700
If Jin Tae Seok finds out,
he'll make a fuss.

550
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,810
Why didn't you tell me who Su A was?

551
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,140
You wanted her furious with me...

552
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,080
and to get revenge
on your behalf, didn't you?

553
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,910
Don't abandon our Su A again.

554
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,920
