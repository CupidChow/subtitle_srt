organizations, and incidents...)

00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictional.)

00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,280
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,780
Do you really think I'm the one
who sent the video...

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,650
to Su A?

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,220
I think it's a possibility.

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,960
- And why is that?
- Because you want Su A...

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,260
to believe that I killed Ki Beom.

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,900
But you killed Cha Ki Beom.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,930
Honey.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,430
He took his last breath
right after you left.

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,340
There was no time to call
911 or anything.

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,840
Then why did you lie to me?

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,580
You were already blaming yourself
as it was,

15
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,650
and I didn't want to make things
harder on you.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,590
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

17
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,990
It wasn't your fault.
I'll make sure of it.

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,800
I told you to let go of your guilt.

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,130
Cha Ki Beom...

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,700
It was bound to happen.

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,500
What have I done?

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,380
I killed Ki Beom.

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,950
Oh, no. How can I ever face Su A?

24
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,620
I...

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,080
will protect you...

26
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,790
no matter what it takes.

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,260
Jin Tae Seok...

28
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,430
knows my every move.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
But how?

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,800
So Young Chae is plotting something
behind my back?

31
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,840
The nerve of her.

32
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,640
But then again...

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,210
Credit where credit is due.

34
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,950
Who cares about the truth, anyway?

35
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,690
What matters is
that Cha Jung Won believes...

36
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,520
Han Hye Ra killed her father.

37
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,290
Anyway, where is
that brat Young Chae?

38
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,330
Young Chae!

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,230
Why are you looking for me?

40
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,530
What is it?

41
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,170
Don't you have something
to say to me?

42
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,840
If you want to know something,
just ask.

43
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,940
What's with you?

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,410
I'm just going to have a beer
and get some sleep.

45
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,050
Right.

46
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,320
To truly survive,
you must fool even your own mother.

47
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,090
You have to be willing to betray
even your own mother to get ahead.

48
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,100
That's my girl.

49
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,800
(Cha Ki Beom, Born: April 7, 1966,
Date of Death: November 28, 2025)

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,050
Ki Beom...

51
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,090
How could you leave me
all alone like this?

52
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,690
I lived only for you.

53
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,200
So what am I supposed to do now?

54
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,800
You were born with a restless heart,

55
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,200
like a girl
with spring fever year-round.

56
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,200
You should have lived
true to your nature.

57
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,570
Why'd you settle down
with a guy like me?

58
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,740
Because just looking at you...

59
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,450
makes me feel like that girl again.

60
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,510
What can I do when you still
make my heart flutter?

61
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,380
I make this vow...

62
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,550
before my father,
who loved his guitar and music...

63
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,860
and was full of laughter and love.

64
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,860
If there's anyone happier than me,
I dare them to step forward!

65
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,230
- I will cast off this life of lies.
- Stop smiling so wide.

66
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,030
- You're going to split your face.
- As his daughter, Cha Jung Won,

67
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,130
in my father's name,

68
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,770
I will make the Kunhyang family pay.

69
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,540
Ki Beom...

70
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,980
On the wings
with which I once yearned to fly,

71
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,250
I will affix
the blade of vengeance...

72
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,180
and plunge it
into Han Hye Ra's heart.

73
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,590
Into her bleeding, dying heart,

74
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,420
I will carve my father's name.

75
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,660
I swear it.

76
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,400

Ki Beom.

83
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
I know I don't have the right...

84
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,100
to say that I'm sorry.

85
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,740
In the next life,

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,610
and the one after that,

87
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,040
if by some chance
you happen to meet me,

88
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,110
act like you don't know me.

Or, rather,

91
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,720
don't even remember me.

92
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,440
What was that?

93
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,240
You let Ahn Ji Na
take the memory card from you?

94
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,810
What kind of reporter are you,
Reporter Ma?

95
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,440
You have zero professionalism!

96
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,210
I'm hanging up.

97
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,990
So, being Gong Nan Sook's daughter
gave you some nerve, did it?

98
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,230
Just like your mother?

99
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,630
I've been through a lot, you know.

100
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,370
I had to pretend
that I was Cha Jung Won, then Su A.

101
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,070
During that time,

102
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,670
I figured out how I needed to live.

103
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,410
And how will you live?

104
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,940
This world doesn't play fair.

105
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,710
There are no permanent allies.

106
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,510
I learned to take things first
and crush people...

107
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,780
before they ever had the chance.

108
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,920
Just like you, Chairman.

109
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,290
You've got a lot of nerve.

110
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,760
That girl, Cha Jung Won,
may have nothing,

111
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,130
but she's filled with the shame
of living as a murderer's daughter,

112
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,230
and she carries the scars of being
abandoned by her mother as a child.

113
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,200
What about you?

114
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,500
I have Gong Nan Sook's blood.

115
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,810
What do you want?

116
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,690
- Don't do this, Young Sun!
- Let go of me!

117
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,260
- Young Sun!
- I said to let go!

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,130
And?

119
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,940
I sent that video to Jung Won.

120
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,270
Cha Jung Won?

121
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,240
- You sent it to Su A?
- By now, Jung Won...

122
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,280
is convinced Vice Chairman Han
was the one who killed Cha Ki Beom.

123
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,720
So?

124
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,020
You wouldn't want this going public,
would you?

125
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,220
Were you there?

126
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,590
Does that matter?

127
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,760
If this video gets out,

128
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,870
Vice Chairman Han,
the person you love the most,

129
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,870
will be ruined.

130
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,900
And at the same time,

131
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,340
Kunhyang's name will be ruined.

132
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,610
This is blackmail, isn't it?

133
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,640
Let's call it a deal.

134
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,180
I assume I'm buying the video, then.

135
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,350
And what do you want?

136
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,820
Make Vice President Jin Se Hoon
change his mind.

137
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,190
Make him forget that pathetic girl
Cha Jung Won.

138
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,560
Make him accept me,
the real Joo Young Chae,

139
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,460
Kunhyang's rightful daughter-in-law.

140
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,030
Winning Se Hoon is your problem.

141
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,130
How dare you bring this video
and try to pull a stunt like this?

142
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,330
Should I send this to a reporter
for a daily newspaper?

143
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,640
You think you can do that?

144
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,340
Try me.

145
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,810
You'll regret underestimating me.

146
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,410
Mom?

147
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,580
Wasn't I the one
who shot this video?

148
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,910
Haven't you ever heard of copyright?

149
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,180
You can't just use my property
without my permission.

150
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,290
Gong Nan Sook.
You filmed this behind my back?

151
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,760
Behind your back?

152
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,360
I just filmed it and never told you.

153
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,560
Who would do business
that takes a loss?

154
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,930
I feared you wouldn't finish it,
so I prepared to handle it myself.

155
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,770
So, what's it going to be?

156
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,770
Should I send this to the reporter?

157
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,480
I also know
what happened after this.

158
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,880
I know everything
that happened next.

159
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,190
All right. I believe...

160
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,420
you're not only done
with my daughter,

161
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,920
but also with me.

162
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,890
So I guess
I'll leak everything then.

163
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,630
Starting with this first clip.

164
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,370
Chairman Gong, why are you acting
so out of character?

165
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,670
Why are you acting this way?

166
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,540
We're family, aren't we?

167
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,210
That's right.
That's exactly my point.

168
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,880
Family shouldn't use knives
to threaten to stab one another.

169
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,320
It can't get any more dysfunctional.

170
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,490
I couldn’t agree with you more.

171
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,030
Unlike Young Chae, I don't care
if Jin Se Hoon loves her or not.

172
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,560
You want her name to remain
as Se Hoon's wife on paper?

173
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,130
Meaning, Joo Young Chae will remain
as Jin Se Hoon's wife?

174
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,400
See? We're on the same wavelength.

175
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,000
We just click.

(Kunhyang Group)

178
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,200
Should I get rid of the bug?

179
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,340
No, leave the tea.

180
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,740
It tastes better now
that it's cooled off.

181
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,190
Slow down.

182
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,230
Here, have some water.

(Damga Charcoal Grill)

184
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,740
Why are you eating like
you haven't eaten in days?

185
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,670
You don't know what you have
until it's gone.

186
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,350
Thinking that Ki Beom is no longer
with us...

187
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,750
makes me feel so empty,
no matter how much I eat.

188
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,050
You have to be strong.

189
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,220
You've got me.

190
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,220
I'm here for you, too.

191
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,200
We keep the departed in our hearts,

192
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,300
but those of us here have to go on,
right?

193
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,770
I'll reopen this restaurant tonight.

194
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,640
You need to rest.

195
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,300
You'll make yourself sick
at this rate.

196
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,410
Goodness,
I can't tell who the mother is here.

197
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,540
I'm more worried about you.

198
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,950
What are you going to do now?
Live with me now.

199
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,410
Stay away from the Kunhyang house.

(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

201
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,700
It's Joo Ha Neul.

202
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,710
I should have visited you first.
Please, have a seat.

203
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,480
It's simple and neat.

204
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,410
Minimalism?

205
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,510
It's very you, CEO Joo.

206
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,520
Regarding the funeral,
I only did what was right.

207
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,520
A lot of people fail to do
what's right.

208
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,130
And that's not all.
Let's remember who Cha Ki Beom was.

209
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,400
You believe he wasn't the killer,
but your father...

210
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,600
I'd rather...

211
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,000
we not talk about that.

212
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,410
I was just complimenting you
on your ability to forgive.

213
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,880
My apologies
if that made you uncomfortable.

214
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,250
So, why did you ask to see me?

215
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,950
Thank you for honoring
my request that day.

216
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,890
You asked me to help Jung Won
serve as the chief mourner.

217
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,630
Why did you do that?

218
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,300
I wanted the funeral to be quiet,
at the very least.

219
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,400
And...

220
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,640
I felt Su A should at least
see her father off one last time.

221
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,870
That could have been...

222
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,610
a major blow to you, Vice Chairman.

223
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,510
If word had gotten out...

224
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,180
You don't think I considered that?

225
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,480
Su A, or rather,

226
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,250
are you saying you cared more
about Jung Won?

227
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,420
Or...

228
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,320
was it guilt over Ki Beom?

229
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,590
And what about you, CEO Joo?

230
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,860
Do you also believe
that I pushed Ki Beom?

231
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,540
Isn't this your phone,
Vice Chairman Han?

232
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,480
Does Su A...

233
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,350
know?

234
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,780
But she saw the video.

235
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,520
I don't know who sent it,
but that alone proves...

236
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,920
- that you pushed Cha Ki Beom...
- It was an accident.

237
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,930
He was clearly still alive.

238
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,430
I should've stayed to make sure
someone called 911.

239
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Fine.

240
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,570
It is my fault.

241
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,640
I won't deny it.

242
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,240
What do you intend to do now?

243
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,540
What are you asking, exactly?

244
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,650
You know that Jung Won is Su A.

245
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,310
My daughter-in-law
turned out to be my daughter.

246
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,120
Naturally, I'll have to welcome her
into the Kunhyang family.

247
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,190
It'll be difficult for now,

248
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,090
but I'll take it one step at a time.

249
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,360
For now,

250
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,730
are you planning to hide...

251
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,870
the fact that Jung Won
is your daughter?

252
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,510
You seem more concerned
about Su A than I am.

253
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,650
Just giving birth
doesn't make you a parent.

254
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,220
When it comes to my Su A,

255
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,820
I don't deserve to be her mother.

256
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,090
What am I to make of that?

257
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,260
What she needs right now...

258
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,200
is someone she can trust,
more than a mother.

259
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,930
You've been reunited after 25 years.

260
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,240
What Jung Won needs most
right now...

261
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,700
is a sincere apology
and acceptance from you.

262
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,340
What good would that do now?

263
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,610
As if that...

264
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,350
would heal the pain I caused her.

265
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,720
There's nothing I can do for Su A.

266
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,890
It's not like Ki Beom is coming back
from the dead.

267
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,920
Su A...

268
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,930
has to become tougher and stronger.

269
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,700
She has to live as if she never
had a mother to begin with.

270
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,100
CEO Joo.

271
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,170
I was hoping...

272
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,610
you could help.

Gong Nan Sook and her daughter...

276
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,950
dare to threaten me?

Secretary Yoon,
escort the Vice Chairman.

278
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,160
- We have to go, ma'am.
- No.

279
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
I'm waiting here
until the ambulance arrives.

280
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,230
Secretary Yoon!

281
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
We have to go.

282
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
This way, ma'am.

283
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,940
You have to save Ki Beom.

284
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,240
He's Su A's father.

285
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,070
Please, Tae Seok.

286
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,540
I promise. I'll ensure he's saved.

287
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,750
Manager Hwang, find out
if the ambulance is on its way.

288
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,150
Yes, sir.

289
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,450
Absolutely no one can find out.

290
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,050
Especially not...

291
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,460
Hye Ra.

292
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,930
Why did you have to go
and do something I didn't ask?

293
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
I thought you told me
to manage my own life.

294
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But there's more to that video
than what I’ve seen, isn't there?

295
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,670
- Am I right?
- More of what?

296
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,770
Look, here is seafood!

297
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,510
That hits the spot.

298
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:25,350
I'm going to do whatever it takes
to put you by Jin Se Hoon's side,

299
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,890
so don't waste your time
catching feelings.

300
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,890
You do what you have to, Mom.
I'll do what suits me.

301
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,090
What? Why, you little brat!

302
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,290
Because I'm going to win
Jin Se Hoon's heart.

303
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,170
Chef Hong, what's going to happen
between Jin Se Hoon and me?

304
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,430
Call him "Grandma."

305
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,000
That was delicious, Chef Hong.

306
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,470
Honestly.

307
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,010
Grandma,

308
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,080
can you tell me what you see
for Young Chae and Se Hoon?

309
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,920
She'll get one thing,

310
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,420
and won't get the other.
So says Grandma.

311
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,090
What will she get
and what won't she get?

312
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:10,060
Will Young Chae become
Kunhyang family's daughter-in-law?

313
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
Your soup is getting cold.
I'll go heat it up for you.

314
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,340
He always dodges
the important questions.

315
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,200
Darn it.

316
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,480
I heard that wasn't
the full video, right?

317
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,490
I thought you, Manager Gu,

318
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,620
were like a brother
or an uncle to me...

319
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,060
and someone I could count on.

320
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,290
I have to leave myself an out,
you know.

321
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,330
You know how Chairman Gong is.

322
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,300
You should have given me a heads-up.

323
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,510
I'll let the video
sent to Jung Won slide.

324
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,140
But do you know how humiliated I was
in front of Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

325
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,580
What are you talking about?

326
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,320
Young Chae, did you send that video
to Jung Won?

327
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,650
Whatever.

328
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,620
Do you realize what you've done?

329
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,960
You've scarred Jung Won for life.

330
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,690
She believes the mother she met
after 25 years harmed her father.

331
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,660
I was just telling her the truth.

332
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,160
I hear what she saw
wasn't the full video.

333
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,530
- There's more to the story, right?
- I don't know.

334
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,140
Gong Nan Sook knows everything.

335
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,270
So stop asking me.
You're getting on my nerves.

336
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,610
What do you mean, how do I know?

337
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,250
Because I saw it.

338
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,420
I saw what happened
on the gallery steps.

339
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,690
I heard the video Young Chae sent
to Jung Won wasn't the full video.

340
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,760
Is that true?

341
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,100
Are you asking if Han Hye Ra harmed
Cha Ki Beom, and what happened next?

342
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,560
Is that what you're curious about?

343
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,630
Yes.

344
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,670
You're CEO Joo, after all.

345
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,740
The only son of Gong Nan Sook,
and the one to succeed me...

346
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,280
and restore the glory
of the Gong family,

347
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,810
and the one who'll lead
Kunhyang Group.

348
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,550
Just tell me the truth.

349
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,350
Don't even think about lying.
Why were you there?

350
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,320
I got a tip
that Han Hye Ra and Cha Ki Beom met.

351
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,900
You know I can easily
get that kind of intel, don't you?

352
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,560
So you followed them?

353
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:31,130
To be honest,
I was following Jin Tae Seok.

354
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,710
- What do you mean?
- Jin Tae Seok was tailing them too.

355
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,140
I had a hunch he wouldn't just leave
Cha Ki Beom or Han Hye Ra alone.

356
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,250
So you weren't worried.
You just went to watch the show?

357
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,750
I suppose I did.

358
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,250
There's nothing more entertaining
than watching a good fight.

359
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,220
What did you see?

360
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,990
What you saw in the video.
That's all there was.

361
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,290
They were arguing back and forth
about something,

362
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,560
and then Han Hye Ra suddenly
shoved Cha Ki Beom.

363
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,730
- You saw it with your own eyes?
- I'm telling you I did.

364
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,400
Then you should have stopped her.

365
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,540
I was a little too far away
to intervene.

366
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,540
I was afraid Chairman Jin Tae Seok
would cause a scene, so I hung back,

367
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,140
hiding while I watched.

368
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,980
What happened next?

369
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,420
Then why was Cha Ki Beom alone
when Jung Won and I got there?

370
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,050
Han Hye Ra must've panicked and run.
It looked like no one called 911.

371
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,660
I came straight home
because I didn't want to get involved.

372
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,230
I'm sure Chairman Jin Tae Seok
handled the rest.

373
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,500
- That's everything I know. I swear.
- Madam Gong.

374
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,330
"Madam Gong" again?

375
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:37,070
What? Do you think I'm lying?

376
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,570
This just makes me more certain
that you're hiding something.

377
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,710
What on earth are you hiding?

378
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,850
I'm sorry.

379
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,620
Did you figure out that I met
with Vice Chairman Han?

380
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,420
I just had a feeling.

381
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,930
Why would she ask
to see you, Ha Neul?

382
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,060
Sorry, I mean, CEO Joo.

383
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,470
Just call me Ha Neul.

384
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,830
I'm back to being Cha Jung Won now.

385
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,370
- But still...
- You can still call me Ha Neul.

386
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,610
Just answer my question.

387
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,680
She has to accept
her daughter-in-law...

388
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,920
as her daughter now,
and I guess that's not easy.

389
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,980
And what about my father's death?

390
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,790
She blames herself for that.

391
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,220
She's overwhelmed with guilt.

392
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,530
- She's too ashamed to face you.
- She'd rather look the other way.

393
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,530
She doesn't want to admit
that she was wrong.

394
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,730
She probably doesn't even care...

395
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,670
why I had to pretend
to be Joo Young Chae...

396
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,900
and become her daughter-in-law
in the first place.

397
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,140
So what do you want to do now?

398
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,040
That woman is responsible
for my father's death.

399
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,480
I'm going to make her pay.

400
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,050
It might not be entirely
Vice Chairman Han's fault.

401
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,450
What are you talking about?

402
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,590
We both saw the video.

403
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,720
But what if there's more
after what we saw?

404
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,890
What if the truth has been
covered up?

405
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,200
Jin Tae Seok.

406
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:24,980
I guess you'll never be able
to defy me again.

407
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,380
How satisfying.

408
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,680
Young Chae sent me the video?

409
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,220
And Chairman Gong Nan Sook
was the one who filmed it?

410
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,990
There might be more to the story.

411
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,330
Chairman Gong Nan Sook and
Jin Tae Seok might be involved.

412
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,630
I need to find out
exactly what the truth is.

413
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,200
Then I'll decide what to do next.

414
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,540
But one thing won't change.

415
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,810
That woman, Han Hye Ra,
is the reason my father is dead.

416
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,780
And I will never forgive her
for that.

417
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,850
(Jin Se Hoon)

418
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,060
The number you have dialed
is not available.

419
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,160
Transferring to voicemail.

420
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,640
- Young Chae?
- How did you know it was me?

421
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,670
You sound thrilled.

422
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,210
What do you want?

423
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,310
I guess you were expecting Cha Jung Won,
the one impersonating me.

424
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,320
Just get to the point. I'm busy.

425
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,450
Where are you?

426
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,550
Maybe we could get a drink.

427
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,720
With you? Have you lost your mind?

428
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,360
We need to get to know each other,
don't we?

429
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,960
I'm annoyed waiting for my girl
in front of her house.

430
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,300
You think I have time for you?

431
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,130
I don't have time for that.

432
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,700
Wait, Se Hoon.

433
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,880
He's outside Cha Jung Won's house?

434
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,190
Fly!

435
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,560
Fly, Jung Won, fly!

436
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,800
- Fly!
- It really feels like I'm flying.

437
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,950
I still can't believe it.

438
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,620
That my dad is really gone.

439
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,230
Get your hand off her!

440
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,510
Se Hoon,
I know you're having a hard time.

441
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,880
But Jung Won is the one
who's hurting the most right now.

442
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,750
Let's not make things worse for her.

443
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,090
Look at you, trying every trick
to steal her from me.

444
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,490
Cut the considerate act.

445
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,560
Come here.

446
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,990
Don't do this, Se Hoon.

447
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,930
Don't you dare treat her like that!

448
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,170
Stop it, Ha Neul.

449
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,100
I'm still her husband.

450
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,740
Overnight,
the woman I love became my sister.

451
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,770
And you expect me
to just accept that?

452
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,780
What kind of psycho would do that?

453
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,940
I know it hurts,

454
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,410
but this is reality.

455
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,550
So now you think you're free
to move in on my woman...

456
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,920
and put your arm on her shoulder
whenever you want?

457
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,620
I'm just as confused as you are.

458
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,660
But...

459
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,360
from now on, it will be difficult
for her to be your wife,

460
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,700
or even your woman.

461
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,600
- You!
- Stop it!

462
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,570
Se Hoon, talk to me.

463
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,560
What am I supposed to do?

464
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,430
Do you really want
to see me lose my mind?

465
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,430
I'm so sorry, Se Hoon.

466
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,140
Then let's just run away together.

467
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,280
As long as I have you,

468
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,110
I'll give up the Kunhyang family,
Kunhyang Group, and everything.

469
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,520
Se Hoon.

470
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,060
Listen.

471
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,290
To get revenge on Han Hye Ra,
the birth mother who abandoned me,

472
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,830
I used you.

473
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,330
You can...

474
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,340
curse, despise,
and spit on a woman like me.

475
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,810
I can take it all.

476
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,570
No. I can't live without you...

477
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,740
Young Chae.

478
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,750
No, I don't care
if your name is Jung Won or Su A.

479
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,550
All I need is you.

480
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,020
Please...

481
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,490
Don't leave me.

482
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,250
Just the sight of cognac
puts me on edge.

483
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,830
- Honey.
- Stop right there. Don't go there.

484
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,660
I'm not jumping the gun.

485
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,330
What about you?

486
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,400
What do you think we should do
about Su A?

487
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,470
Me? Of course,
I'll go with whatever you want.

488
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,070
She's really Su A this time.

489
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,210
What if we brought her
into the Kunhyang family right now?

490
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,540
Someone as delicate...

491
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,750
and soft-hearted as you?

492
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,050
Even if she is your own daughter,

493
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,850
it's a tragic, ill-fated connection.

494
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,020
You're right.

495
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,390
After she found out
I was her birth mother,

496
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,500
she joined our family on purpose
to get her revenge on me.

497
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,430
She made a mockery of our family.
And that's not all, is it?

498
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,370
It will be hard for her
to forgive you, too.

499
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,110
I killed Su A's father,

500
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,010
Ki Beom.

501
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,150
Tae Seok.

502
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,280
Please send Su A abroad.

503
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,690
So we never have to meet again.

504
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,960
And so she won't get entangled
with Se Hoon again.

505
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,720
Are you serious?

506
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,860
It's the only way...

507
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,860
for both Su A and me to survive.

508
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,930
From now on, I'm Cha Jung Won.

509
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,100
I'm going to live
as Han Hye Ra's daughter.

510
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,670
(A Graceful Liar)

511
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
How about you go abroad
for a few years?

512
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,030
Are you afraid your world...

513
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,970
will come crashing down
if people learn who I am?

514
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,240
Jung Won went
to the Kunhyang house uninvited?

515
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,870
Who on earth
does Cha Jung Won take after...

516
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,380
to be so driven and decisive?

517
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,780
I will marry Cha Jung Won.

518
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,450
How can you marry
your own mother's daughter?

519
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,610
Mother, Father,
I need you two to get a divorce.

520
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,490
I know you saw everything happen
in front of the gallery.

521
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,120
I am merely a shadow.
I do not think, judge, or decide.

522
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,820
I came back to the Kunhyang family
