1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170
(All characters, locations, organizations,
and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,340
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,140
(This production followed all guidelines
for young actors.)

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,280
Dad!

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,920
Dad!

6
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:46,520
(A Graceful Liar)

7
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,860
Just stay at Mi Hyang's for three days.

8
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,660
Mommy will come get you, I promise.

9
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,630
In just three sleeps?

10
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,330
Promise?

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,600
I promise.

12
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,380
Mommy,

13
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,680
just three sleeps.

14
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,030
Three days turned into ten,

15
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,900
but even after that,

16
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,300
for twenty-five years, my mother...

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,070
never came back for me.

18
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,110
(Death to the killer's family)

19
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,520
Look at Jung Won.

20
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,160
(Death to the killer's family)

21
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,100
Cha Jung Won?

22
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,200
You have your high school equivalency,

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,270
and dropped out of fashion design
at Hangang University .

24
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,540
Your experience says...

25
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,980
you worked as a part-time personal shopper
at Veloa Department Store,

26
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,710
a part-time concierge
at the Kunhyang Hotel,

27
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,680
and even a convenience store clerk?

28
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,550
And you're thirty-two?

29
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,750
I was an honors student
and received a scholarship every semester.

30
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,460
Due to family issues,
I unfortunately had to...

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,320
Do I have to listen to
your whole sob story?

32
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,730
If you dropped out, that makes you
a high school graduate, correct?

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,600
- Yes, that's correct.
- We have graduates from top universities,

34
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,570
and even unemployed PhDs
are a dime a dozen these days.

35
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,540
Might as well have the best.

36
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,140
Do I need to explain our position
any further?

37
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,740
All right, next group!

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,990
Your father's name is Cha Ki Beom?

39
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,830
He has a murder conviction.
We value our family-like atmosphere,

40
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,930
so we don't hire people
from morally questionable families.

41
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,800
What was unavoidable for me...

42
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,540
was just a sob story to others.

43
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,050
I was a high school graduate,
living from one part-time job to the next.

44
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,620
That was me, Cha Jung Won.

45
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,880
At least, until six months ago.

46
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,660
And now?

47
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,030
I'm one of the super-rich
that everyone looks up to.

48
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,700
Jin Se Hoon?

49
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,940
Joo Young Chae?

50
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,670
I am Joo Young Chae.

51
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,360
Han Hye Ra.

52
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,230
If it means I can destroy you,

53
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,260
I don't care if I'm a fake.

54
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,930
I have to become Joo Young Chae.

55
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,170
No. I am Joo Young Chae.

56
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,640
(Six months earlier)

57
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,010
Here.

58
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,880
Are you sure you don't need
to go yourself, Ms. Kim?

59
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,210
Yes, no one will be home.

60
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,050
She's an ultra-VVIP,
and she's notoriously difficult and picky.

61
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,690
Set up her dressing room perfectly.
I'll text you the unit number and code.

62
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,190
Okay, got it.

63
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,000
You know the rule, right?
Never, ever try on a client's clothes.

64
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,870
You've told me a million times.

65
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,270
It's just that they're so gorgeous
and ridiculously expensive.

66
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,910
In my first year as a personal shopper,
my brain short-circuited at new arrivals.

67
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,880
In your head, you already own it.

68
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,010
- It's crazy.
- It's crazy.

69
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,850
Counting to three is not enough.

70
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,350
You have to count to five.

71
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,650
Vanity is probably scarier than murder.

72
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,020
Tattoo this on your brain,
"Treat luxury goods like they're rocks."

73
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,190
Treat luxury goods
like they're just rocks.

74
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Here.

75
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,680
Kunhyang Group.

76
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,290
It runs just fine even
when you're slacking off, Se Hoon?

77
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,190
Do I look like I'm working hard right now?

78
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,890
I'm Vice Chairman of the company...

79
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,260
and CEO of the department store
in name only.

80
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,730
And you know it.

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,130
Hey, Se Hoon.

82
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's stir up some real trouble together.

83
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,340
Why?

84
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,240
What is it?

85
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,710
Got something interesting in mind?

86
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,210
What, a partnership?

87
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,850
A startup?

88
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,720
This guy. Now you're talking.

89
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,310
Kyung Shin, wake up.

90
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,310
Come on, get up.

91
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,750
- Just go already!
- Ten more minutes. Or just five. Please?

92
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,220
Hey, you're dead if my mom finds you.

93
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,390
And if I die? What about you?

94
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,660
I'd get married, I guess.
To the man my mom picks out for me.

95
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,930
Wait, you mean Jin Se Hoon
from Kunhyang Group?

96
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,240
Listen carefully, Park Kyung Shin.

97
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,870
Whether you live or die...

98
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,810
I'm going through with the marriage.

99
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,480
That's your mom's plan. What about you?

100
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,110
I'm asking what you want.

101
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,960
I'm so sorry.

102
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,360
Please continue.

103
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,240
What bad timing.

104
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,940
Did I startle you? You probably thought
no one would be here.

105
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,650
I haven't seen you around before.

106
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,450
If you call ahead next time,
I'll ensure there are no interruptions.

107
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,820
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Ms. Kim of the luxury hall...

108
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,330
of Kunhyang Department Store sent me...

109
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,460
You're Cha Jung Won, right?

110
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,900
Wait, how do you know my name?

111
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,770
Joo Young Chae?

112
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,600
Jung Won!

113
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,750
This is from the Chardin Fall and Winter
Limited Edition collection.

114
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,780
There are only two of them
in the entire country.

115
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,190
Then I'll take this one.

116
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,060
Except I'm already wearing
one of those two.

117
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,700
Are you okay with that?

118
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,140
If we, as the future mothers-in-law,
wear the same outfit to dinner,

119
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,970
that would be a little awkward.

120
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
In that case,

121
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,680
I'll...

122
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,980
take this one.

123
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,420
Excellent choice. You have amazing taste.
It's also twice the price.

124
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,150
This one is totally my style anyway!

125
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,600
It suits you much better, Vice Chairman.

126
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,200
I know.

127
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,240
They say your fashion speaks volumes...

128
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,870
and you are clearly very passionate.

129
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,980
Too much passion becomes greed.

130
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,750
And you're surprisingly impatient, too.

131
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,950
She's angry I snatched the dress
out from under her.

132
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,320
You must've been in a real hurry...

133
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,930
that you'd use your son
to gobble up Kunhyang stock.

134
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,470
Oh, please. If we're talking
about being impatient,

135
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,730
wouldn't that be
Vice President Jin Se Hoon?

136
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,770
He's already broken off one engagement.

137
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,840
I don't know why he's dragging
his feet so much.

138
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,010
We weren't postponing. We were waiting.

139
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,750
Our grandparents' dying wish was
for our children to marry,

140
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,450
and we were waiting for the right moment
to honor it.

141
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,190
And that "right moment" is right now.

142
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,560
I was a major player on Wall Street.

143
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,230
Why else would I fly all the way here?
I have companies lining up for me.

144
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,770
and begging me to invest.
You think you're the only one?

145
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,240
We're well aware.

146
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,340
They call you the "female Warren Buffett,"
Chairman Gong.

147
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,940
I'm sure you hear that all the time.

148
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,710
My goodness, how do you always know
just the right thing to say?

149
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,480
All right, stop buttering me up.
You'll make my head spin.

150
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,090
Warren Buffett?

151
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,090
A vulgar loan shark. The audacity.

152
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,960
Well, since we're on the subject,

153
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,730
why don't we just set a date
for the kids' wedding?

154
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,230
What do you think?

155
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,340
Stunning. It looks great on you.

156
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,250
Jung Won, you really have
a knack for this.

157
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,320
Do you want to be my personal shopper?

158
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,120
- I'm just a part-time assistant.
- So what?

159
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,860
The client gets what she wants.

160
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,120
I'll talk to Manager Kim.

161
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,860
Thanks.

162
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,400
This is so you.

163
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,800
Try it on.

164
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,600
I can't try on a client's clothes.
It's against the rules.

165
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,600
Even if the client wants you to?

166
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,950
There she is.
That's the Cha Jung Won I know.

167
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,680
The only friend I ever envied.

168
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,790
You just had this natural glow about you.

169
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,450
Funny, I was the one who envied you.

170
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,220
Because you were rich.

171
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,660
I'm still rich.

172
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,730
And I'm...

173
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Look.

174
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,470
See? You still have that glow.

175
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,870
It's yours.

176
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,910
It's a gift. For our 12-year reunion.

177
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,610
No, I can't.

178
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,480
It's too expensive.

179
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,350
That's what friends do. They share.

180
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,420
You're not still holding a grudge about
what happened back then, are you?

181
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,820
I need money.

182
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,460
That's all water under the bridge.

183
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,000
We're going to be late. Let's go.

184
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,060
Where are we going?

185
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,830
(Kunhyang Group)

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hye Ra.

187
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,740
Don't you want to see
the kids get married?

188
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,880
- You know it's the exact opposite.
- Then you should be sweet-talking her.

189
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,950
What are we going to do if she gets angry
and starts buying up all our stock?

190
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,350
What will people say? That we sold our son
to loan sharks for the Chairman's seat?

191
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,850
You like the sound of that?

192
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,060
So what? You got a better plan?

193
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,060
It must look like they're getting married
because they're in love.

194
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,900
So, a romance, not an arrangement?

195
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,870
Romance? From a punk like Se Hoon?

196
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:56,240
His life is all about how to upset me.
He went abroad and got engaged on impulse,

197
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,010
only to break it off six months later.

198
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,310
She just wasn't the one for him.

199
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,250
And who's to say Joo Young Chae
is his real other half?

200
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,890
Chairman Gong must be fuming right now.
I can just picture it.

201
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,360
Why is this thing so big?

202
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,460
Darn it!

203
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,370
The way she acts,
you'd think she was the chairman.

204
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,670
She's got Jin Tae Seok wrapped
around her little finger.

205
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,710
So what did Vice Chairman Han say?

206
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,410
Darn...

207
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,040
The kids' feelings are more important.

208
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,320
They only met a couple of times as kids,
so they may not even remember each other.

209
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,250
They should go on some proper dates
and get to know each other.

210
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,360
Don't you think they need time
for that first?

211
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,990
That makes sense. We'll do it your way.

212
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,590
That's fine with you, right,
Chairman Gong?

213
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,330
Yes. Of course.

214
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,810
I mean, she's not wrong.

215
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,980
She's only acting so smug because she has
Jin Tae Seok backing her up.

216
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,750
That homewrecker pushed out
Se Hoon's real mom...

217
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,050
and took her place.

218
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,290
I heard it was the romance of the century.

219
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,060
Oh, please! That's all a load of crap.

220
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:23,160
Chairman Jin's late mother
called Han Hye Ra a "temptress" on sight.

221
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,060
Are you jealous?

222
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,370
What on earth? Have you lost your mind!

223
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,730
What has Han Hye Ra got that I don't?

224
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,640
Whether you're talking looks, body,
or overall vibe.

225
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,710
Well, you have way more money, for one.

226
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,610
Why do you think all those tycoons
grovel before you?

227
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,650
What did Jin Se Hoon say?

228
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,990
He didn't say much.
It was strictly business.

229
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,850
What business is more important
than this marriage?

230
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,060
Once Young Chae and Se Hoon are married,

231
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,900
then you will naturally
enter the Kunhyang fold.

232
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,900
And it's just a matter of time
before the Jus take over Kunhyang.

233
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,400
So you do get it.

234
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,840
So you want to make me
the chief of Kunhyang?

235
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,280
No, that's not it.
You're the one who wants to be the chief.

236
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,980
So, how long are you staying at the hotel?
I've already got your room ready.

237
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,850
Let me get over the jet lag first.

238
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,820
Always an excuse.

239
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,390
It's so hot. God, it's hot.

240
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,070
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

241
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,630
Victoria! Long time no see.

242
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,040
No way!

243
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,010
It's been forever!

244
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,340
What took you so long?
We've all been waiting.

245
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,750
- How've you been?
- Great! You?

246
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,780
Amazing. You got even prettier.

247
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,350
You too. You're absolutely gorgeous.

248
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Hey.

249
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,090
Who's that? Never seen her before.

250
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,190
Looks like she just tagged along
with Victoria.

251
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,030
This is a private party.
Why would she bring a random?

252
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,300
Her outfit's not bad.

253
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,030
Her face is not bad, too.

254
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,570
Is that Victoria Shin's assistant?

255
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,670
Her personal shopper?

256
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,480
She should know we don't mix
with her type.

257
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,780
Shouldn't she at least know some Japanese?

258
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,450
I understand Japanese just fine.

259
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,790
And French, for that matter.

260
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,690
Hey.
You'll regret underestimating my friend.

261
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,800
She mastered English, French, and Japanese
in high school to read original art books.

262
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,370
She's a walking translator.

263
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,440
How rude of me.

264
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,240
They can be a little guarded.
You know what I mean, right?

265
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,280
I do.

266
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,480
Victoria's friends are our friends, right?
And your name is?

267
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,750
Joo Young Chae.

268
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,520
We attended the New York Royal Art School
together.

269
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,660
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes.

270
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Who's that? A new face.

271
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,740
Stunning, right?

272
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,940
Her name's Joo Young Chae.

273
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,650
She went to the Royal Art.
Looks like her family is loaded.

274
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,020
What is it?
Do you like that brand she's wearing?

275
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,420
Want me to order you the same one?

276
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Never.

277
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,990
"Se Mi, please marry me."

278
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,260
Don't start with that again.

279
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,660
I'm serious. I'm single by choice.

280
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Have a seat.

281
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,040
Love your outfit.

282
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,780
Thank you.

283
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,160
Santé!

284
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,260
- The world...
- Cheers!

285
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,660
is being kind.

286
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,660
- For the first time ever.
- How long have you two known each other?

287
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,300
We've been friends since middle school.

288
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,310
What's just another day for Young Chae,

289
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,740
feels like a fairytale to me.

290
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,150
Yes, you're right.

291
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,480
Why did you tell them my name
was Joo Young Chae?

292
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,220
Did that surprise you?

293
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,020
And the school too.
I was completely thrown.

294
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,830
Come on, 90 percent of them
are fake anyway.

295
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,360
Why bother telling them the truth?

296
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,700
- Just to get yourself humiliated?
- But why did it have to be your name?

297
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,530
Well...

298
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,600
It was the only name I could think of.

299
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,800
It's fun, isn't it?

300
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,070
Victoria? Victoria Shin?

301
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,710
Is that fake too?

302
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,480
My real name is Shin Young Chae.

303
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,120
My biological father
whom I've never even met,

304
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,190
and his last name is Shin.

305
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,720
Anyway, my friends from my time abroad
all call me Victoria Shin.

306
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,860
Victoria.

307
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:27,160
- That name really suits you.
- Always victorious, right?

308
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,630
But I can never win against my mom.

309
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,900
I even have to marry the guy
my mom picked out for me.

310
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
The guy from earlier?

311
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,040
He's my lover.

312
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,310
What are you going to do?

313
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,280
Maybe we should just run away for love.

314
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
What?

315
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,290
What about you? Are you seeing anyone?

316
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,790
What's he like? What does he do?
How old is he? Is he handsome?

317
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,360
One question at a time.

318
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Okay.

319
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,130
Is he...

320
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,170
the real deal?

321
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,170
He's the real deal.

322
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,470
What makes you so sure?

323
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,270
He...

324
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,610
He knows I'm a college dropout
and that I just work part-time jobs.

325
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,480
So he doesn't care about money
or your background?

326
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,380
He couldn't care less about that stuff.

327
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,090
He's never once asked
whose family I come from...

328
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,160
or if we're rich or poor.

329
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,990
Does he know about the other thing?

330
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,490
About your dad?

331
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,060
Not yet. I have to tell him, though.

332
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,170
Sometime soon.

333
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,930
Do you think he'll be able to handle it?

334
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,640
Of course,
he'll understand and accept me as I am.

335
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,740
He's the real deal.
What about the marriage proposal?

336
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,580
I think he's going to ask soon.

337
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,090
Young Chae. Are you my Lady Luck?

338
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,160
I thought I was cut,

339
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,060
but they called me for the final interview
for Look and Style.

340
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,940
A woman over 30 having a sleepover?
What is the world coming to?

341
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,680
They'd better not be sleeping together
before the wedding.

342
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,980
You're one to talk, Jo Mi Hyang.

343
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,450
For the past 25 years,

344
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,920
which is long enough for mountains
and rivers to change,

345
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,160
I've been living with you
without a wedding.

346
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,930
What's so great about a guy
with a criminal record anyway?

347
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,830
For heaven's sake.
Stop talking about your damn record.

348
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,230
I'm so sick of hearing about it.

349
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,540
You really love me that much?

350
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,310
Of course I do.
Why else would I be living with you?

351
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,010
You think I'm crazy or something?

352
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,910
You're crazy, all right. Absolutely nuts.

353
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,680
Are you still not over that girl?

354
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Han Young Sun.

355
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,890
Jung Won's... I mean, Su A's mother.

356
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,820
Who says I haven't forgotten her?

357
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,130
She is not Jung Won's mother!

358
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,560
What kind of monster
abandons her own child?

359
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,060
Don't you ever say
that woman's name again!

360
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,600
Unbelievable.

361
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,340
You're impossible. How much did you drink?

362
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,510
- Mom.
- Oh my...

363
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,010
I'm so glad you're my mom.

364
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,520
Oh, you. That's enough now.

365
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,120
Oh, dear.

366
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,260
I'm so happy you're my daughter too,
Se Mi.

367
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,360
Stop acting like a baby and go to sleep.

368
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,200
Once my brother gets married, I can't act
like a baby in front of my sister-in-law.

369
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,900
I have to be a proper sister-in-law,
after all.

370
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,270
Don't get ahead of yourself.

371
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,400
What if Se Hoon doesn't like her?

372
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,440
She's totally his type.

373
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
You've seen her?

374
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Here.

375
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,380
How could Gong Nan Sook
have a daughter like her?

376
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,420
Send her picture to my phone.

377
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,740
I wonder if she's married by now.

378
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
That's right.

379
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,970
See? You're here holding my hand
right now.

380
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,580
She'd be 30 this year...

381
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,680
No, she'd be 32, actually.

382
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,590
My little girl.

383
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,870
You're here.

384
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,870
I couldn't sleep a wink.

385
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,810
Why? Were you worried I'd bomb
my interview again today?

386
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,880
When you said you met an old school friend
and decided to have a sleepover,

387
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,880
I had to wonder
if it was actually a girl...

388
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,780
or maybe some guy friend.

389
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,620
Go check for yourself.
Building 201, Apartment 2104.

390
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,520
See if my friend, Joo Young Chae,
lives there.

391
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,890
Joo Young Chae?

392
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,530
Oh, the one you went to church with
back in high school?

393
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,730
That's the one.

394
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,460
Wow, no way!

395
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,070
It's been, what, over ten years?

396
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:07,170
It was so good to see her again.
We never ran out of things to say.

397
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,210
Fair enough.

398
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,740
Come on, let's go.

399
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,110
Okay.

400
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,820
Was Joo Young Chae mother's preference?

401
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:28,630
I haven't met her myself,
but she's quite suitable.

402
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,130
I heard Joo Young Chae is such a recluse,
it's hard to even find a photo of her.

403
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,000
August 20th, 5:00 p.m.

404
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,640
Keep your schedule clear.

405
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:45,840
So, am I getting married
at that exact date and time?

406
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
To Joo Young Chae?

407
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,950
You have to at least see her first.
Let's just call it a blind date for now.

408
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,720
As I thought, it's too sweet.

409
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,490
Next time, please get me an Iced Americano
with an extra shot.

410
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,830
I ordered you some clothes
according to my taste.

411
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,300
You'll have to try them on.

412
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,370
I'm no match for the Vice Chairman, am I?

413
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,140
Let's go.

414
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,180
Doors are closing.

415
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,350
Cha Jung Won, attend the final interview
for a designer position at Look and Style.

416
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,920
Apollon Officetel, Room 401, 4:00 p.m.

417
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,700
Okay, Cha Jung Won.
You're going to nail it this time.

418
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,530
I believe in you.

419
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,380
- Who is it?
- You don't remember me?

420
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,210
It's Noh Min Gu.

421
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,110
Cha Jung Won's boyfriend.

422
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
Noh Min Gu?

423
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,690
How interesting that you two are dating.

424
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,630
Oh, Jung Won just left. What's up?

425
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,530
Are you going to let me in or not?

426
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,580
Ms. Cha Jung Won?

427
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,920
I'm here for the final designer interview,

428
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,850
but why is it here?

429
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,390
We tell a pretty high school grad
to come to a place like this...

430
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,690
for her final interview...

431
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,730
and if she shows up,
doesn't that mean she's game?

432
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,100
Don't play dumb.

433
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,430
I think I have the wrong place.
I'll just be going.

434
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Hey, not so fast.

435
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,570
- What are you doing?
- Stay here!

436
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,710
Now this is getting fun.

437
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,980
Stop!

438
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,960
You followed me in high school
because you liked me.

439
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,930
I never imagined you'd fall for Jung Won.

440
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,300
Was there any guy at church back then
who didn't have a crush on you?

441
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,600
What is it about Jung Won
that you like so much?

442
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,370
You know why.

443
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,370
She's kind, pure,
and just sort of sparkles?

444
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
I see.

445
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,480
It's amazing, isn't it?
How she can shine even when she's so poor.

446
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,210
Poor?

447
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,750
You mean like, "poor in spirit"?
From The Bible? That she's not greedy?

448
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,560
Don't you love her for who she is, do you?

449
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,230
I love her. I miss her when we're apart,
and even when we're together.

450
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,170
I wish she didn't have to work part-time.

451
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,540
I just wish she would be my wife
and let me take care of everything.

452
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,110
So it's the real deal.

453
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,240
You have no idea
how amazing our Jung Won is.

454
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,540
You stupid fool.

455
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,810
(Death to the killer's family)

456
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,250
You still don't get how the world works?

457
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,080
The world will never be...

458
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,750
kind to me.

459
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,710
Mommy will come get you, I promise.

460
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,250
Promise?

461
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,050
I promise.

462
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,530
(A Graceful Liar)

463
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,160
Enough.
Why does she get everything and I nothing?

464
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,160
Worthy of this ring? Son of a bitch.

465
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,990
Who asked you to pretend
to be some rich girl?

466
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:05,730
Do you need some help?

467
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,460
Joo Ha Neul. That's my name.

468
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,470
It's only fair I know yours too, Alice.

469
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,400
Joo Young Chae.

470
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,440
My name is Joo Young Chae.

471
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,910
Get out, you worthless piece of filth!

472
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,310
I love Park Kyung Shin.

473
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,750
Why do you think no one knows
what your birth father is up to?

474
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,620
If I see Park Kyung Shin, I'll drown him.
Just like my birth father.
