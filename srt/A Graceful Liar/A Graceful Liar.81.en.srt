1
00:00:02,688 --> 00:00:04,358
Why did Se Hoon ask to meet you here?

2
00:00:05,028 --> 00:00:06,658
He said he has something to tell me about Jin Tae Seok.

3
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:11,768
Should I go with you?

4
00:00:12,998 --> 00:00:16,138
If he sees you, Se Hoon will just act out even more.

5
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:20,038
And his feelings for me aren't what they used to be.

6
00:00:20,908 --> 00:00:23,478
But since it's about Jin Tae Seok, I'm curious, too.

7
00:00:24,218 --> 00:00:25,678
I'll call you right after I meet him.

8
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:25,408
Ha Neul...

9
00:01:27,148 --> 00:01:28,208
Ha Neul.

10
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:30,478
Ha Neul.

11
00:01:34,518 --> 00:01:35,518
Ha Neul?

12
00:01:38,388 --> 00:01:39,388
Ha Neul.

13
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:41,858
Ha Neul...

14
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:29,068
I've accidentally hit someone.

15
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:31,138
Please, hurry.

16
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:34,548
I will call for an ambulance too.

17
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:52,228
My gosh, what is wrong with me?

18
00:02:52,558 --> 00:02:55,368
How did my hands get so weak all of a sudden?

19
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:57,598
Gosh, honestly.

20
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:02,438
Stop. Please, don't do a thing, Your Highness.

21
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:09,148
Goodness...

22
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:12,578
For goodness' sake.

23
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:16,918
I couldn't focus at the company, so I came home early, and now this.

24
00:03:18,058 --> 00:03:20,558
This is strange. Something's off.

25
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:21,958
Please heal.

26
00:03:22,228 --> 00:03:23,428
Heal quickly.

27
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:28,728
Hey, on any other day,

28
00:03:28,798 --> 00:03:31,598
this would've made me smile,

29
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:33,338
but I'm really not feeling it today.

30
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:34,738
That's enough. Stop it.

31
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:37,238
Go get Grandma for me.

32
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:41,908
You're here.

33
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:43,878
Something must've happened, didn't it?

34
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:46,378
She says you must go to the hospital right away.

35
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:50,288
She said her favourite girl's heart is about to be torn to shreds.

36
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:52,218
What? Is someone going to get hurt?

37
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:54,028
Is someone going to die?

38
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,328
The number you have dialled is not...

39
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:03,228
Ha Neul isn't picking up.

40
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:06,668
Ms. Young Chae, where are you?

41
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,308
It's nothing.

42
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:10,408
Chairman Gong just wanted me to check in on you.

43
00:04:11,238 --> 00:04:14,148
Young Chae, listen, your brother isn't picking up.

44
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:16,808
Find out where Ha Neul is right now. Hurry!

45
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,048
Why is she asking me to find Ha Neul?

46
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:23,288
She's always so dramatic.

47
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:29,428
The number you have dialled is not available.

48
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:31,128
Transferring to voicemail.

49
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:33,128
I haven't seen Cha Jung Won around either.

50
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:35,428
I bet they're out on a date or something.

51
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,568
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

52
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,448
Joo Ha Neul...

53
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:55,388
threw his life away for Cha Jung Won?

54
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:02,288
Let's go and get some lunch.

55
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:08,128
Se Hoon, what's wrong?

56
00:05:08,198 --> 00:05:10,998
No. I didn't do anything.

57
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:14,068
This is all Cha Jung Won's fault.

58
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:16,308
Just tell me what's going on!

59
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:20,408
Ms. Jo, you insisted I bring you here,

60
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:21,908
but we can still turn back.

61
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:23,978
Jin Tae Seok! Get out here this instant!

62
00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:30,458
Mi Hyang...

63
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:33,858
Han Hye Ra, we'll talk later. You stay out of this.

64
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:36,058
Who does this woman think she is, barging in here?

65
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:38,658
Was the tofu slap last time not enough for you?

66
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:42,298
You did this to my daughter, Jung Won, didn't you?

67
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,668
I'll take you down with me!

68
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:44,838
Let go of me!

69
00:05:45,268 --> 00:05:46,798
I'm already furious enough as it is.

70
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:48,908
Hey, let me go!

71
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:52,638
You know I won't hit a woman, so you're pushing it, right?

72
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,478
- Ma'am, please... - Let go!

73
00:05:56,778 --> 00:06:00,318
Jin Tae Seok, you jerk, even the abyss is too good for you!

74
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:05,418
What?

75
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:07,858
You almost hit Cha Jung Won,

76
00:06:08,188 --> 00:06:10,058
but hit Ha Neul instead?

77
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:15,928
What happened to Ha Neul?

78
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:18,168
How badly is he hurt?

79
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:30,548
Yes, Father.

80
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,598
What? Joo Ha Neul got hurt instead of Cha Jung Won?

81
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:47,368
It was an unforeseen situation.

82
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,168
Did Cha Jung Won and Joo Ha Neul see your face?

83
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:50,838
Yes.

84
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:55,738
I had to call the police and say I hit someone by accident.

85
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:56,968
What happened to Joo Ha Neul?

86
00:06:58,078 --> 00:06:59,608
He was taken away in an ambulance.

87
00:07:00,238 --> 00:07:02,048
I'm not sure about his condition yet.

88
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:05,218
Cha Jung Won...

89
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:08,288
just won't die, will she?

90
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:11,818
- She's tough as nails. - I must go to the hospital first...

91
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,058
to make my act convincing.

92
00:07:28,368 --> 00:07:30,068
Are you saying Jin Tae Seok...

93
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:32,908
was behind what happened to your daughter Jo Jung Won?

94
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:37,678
How could he do that...

95
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:39,818
to that poor, sick little girl?

96
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:41,748
Goodness...

97
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:43,918
My poor, precious baby.

98
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:45,558
Mi Hyang.

99
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:47,188
I'm so sorry.

100
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:48,988
It's all my fault.

101
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:53,758
I'm going to handle Jin Tae Seok.

102
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:56,328
I'll make him pay,

103
00:07:57,098 --> 00:07:58,668
and I'll atone for my own sins.

104
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:02,608
How can you possibly take on a monster like him alone?

105
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:04,808
I'll find a way.

106
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:09,408
That's the only way I can protect my children.

107
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:16,488
Jung Won.

108
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:21,428
Jung Won, what's wrong with your voice?

109
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:24,928
What?

110
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:27,098
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul?

111
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:33,468
(Joo Ha Neul, in surgery, emergency)

112
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:46,918
(Operating Room)

113
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:55,688
Is this your fault?

114
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:58,298
I heard Ha Neul got hurt trying to save you.

115
00:08:58,358 --> 00:09:00,398
- I'm sorry. - Shut up.

116
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:02,928
Whose fault is this?

117
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:04,498
Was it...

118
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:06,168
Jin Tae Seok again?

119
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:07,708
It was...

120
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:10,468
Jin Se Hoon.

121
00:09:11,408 --> 00:09:12,608
Jin Se Hoon?

122
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:20,218
You witch!

123
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:22,588
What do you think you're doing, grabbing Jung Won by the collar?

124
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:23,988
Are you all right, ma'am?

125
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:27,288
Manager Gu. Did I hear correctly?

126
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:30,858
There's no reason why Se Hoon would do that to Ha Neul.

127
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:34,098
Jung Won, say that again.

128
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:37,438
Did Se Hoon really try to kill you?

129
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:42,408
Vice President Jin Se Hoon?

130
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:45,408
- That's impossible. - There must be some mistake...

131
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:47,448
Jin Se Hoon tried to kill me!

132
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:51,518
What are you talking about?

133
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:53,348
Se Hoon tried to kill you?

134
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:56,288
And that's why Ha Neul got hurt instead?

135
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:58,318
That's not true, is it, Mom?

136
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:00,858
Mom!

137
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:06,198
It's a misunderstanding.

138
00:10:08,628 --> 00:10:09,998
It was a mistake.

139
00:10:10,738 --> 00:10:11,898
It was just an accident.

140
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:18,108
Be honest with me.

141
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:20,138
Were you trying to kill Ha Neul?

142
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:22,578
Of course not.

143
00:10:23,808 --> 00:10:26,948
I was on a call and took my eyes off the road for a second.

144
00:10:28,818 --> 00:10:31,118
I didn't even realise Cha Jung Won was in danger.

145
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,728
Otherwise, why would I call the police first?

146
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,838
- I called the ambulance too. - That's right.

147
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:49,108
I can vouch for that.

148
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:51,638
Se Hoon...

149
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:54,108
would never do something like that.

150
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:08,228
(Operating Room)

151
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:32,078
Doctor, is Ha Neul out of surgery?

152
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:35,218
Yes, we operated on his broken shoulder.

153
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:36,718
The surgery was a success.

154
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:40,658
However, he does have a concussion, so we'll need to monitor him.

155
00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:43,658
Are you saying he's going to live or die?

156
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:45,628
He'll live. You don't need to worry.

157
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:48,668
Thank you so much.

158
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,168
Sit down.

159
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:53,998
That's such a relief.

160
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:57,608
I was so worried something terrible would happen to Ha Neul.

161
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:00,848
Doctor, thank you.

162
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:02,208
Thank you so much.

163
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:10,188
Was what Jin Se Hoon did really accidental?

164
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,388
Because his view was blocked?

165
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,458
That jerk Jin Se Hoon is lying.

166
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,558
Manager Gu,

167
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:18,428
- are you a fan of Ha Neul? - No.

168
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:23,268
It just makes me furious seeing you so worried.

169
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:25,738
Go outside and cool off for a bit.

170
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:28,768
Just looking at you is getting me all worked up.

171
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:32,708
I said go. What are you waiting for?

172
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:35,178
I'm waiting to hear what Grandma has to say.

173
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:38,548
Grandma, that punk Jin Se Hoon tried to hit...

174
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:41,288
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul on purpose, right?

175
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:42,448
Is that right, Grandma?

176
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:47,888
There's an evil inside him far more terrifying than his father.

177
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:50,328
Who does? Jin Se Hoon?

178
00:12:50,328 --> 00:12:51,928
Do you mean the student surpassed the master?

179
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:54,298
No, that's supposed to be a compliment.

180
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:57,668
Is Jin Se Hoon really that terrible, Grandma?

181
00:12:57,738 --> 00:13:01,668
If I knew that, I'd be a psychic, not a chef, right?

182
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:03,638
Goodness.

183
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:07,778
Then again, it's pointless to ask Grandma.

184
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:11,218
Jin Se Hoon, that little punk. I should just...

185
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:12,378
Have him drowned.

186
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:15,018
Is there anything worse than drowning?

187
00:13:15,748 --> 00:13:17,858
I'll have to give it some thought.

188
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:24,428
Why does it feel like...

189
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:26,698
half of me is relieved...

190
00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:28,868
and the other half is disappointed?

191
00:13:29,628 --> 00:13:30,628
What is this?

192
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:32,238
Jin Se Hoon...

193
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:37,608
Did you really want Joo Ha Neul to die for saving Cha Jung Won?

194
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:42,178
What are you thinking about?

195
00:13:45,348 --> 00:13:46,518
I'm so incredibly relieved...

196
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:48,348
that Ha Neul woke up.

197
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:51,788
Did you really...

198
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:55,088
- try to kill Cha Jung Won? - What are you talking about?

199
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,558
- I told you it was an accident. - Do you have to lie to me, too?

200
00:13:58,898 --> 00:14:03,828
Because I think you were trying to run Cha Jung Won over.

201
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:05,338
Don't get any crazy ideas.

202
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:07,368
I never intended to hurt...

203
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:09,838
either Cha Jung Won or Joo Ha Neul.

204
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:15,278
(Han Hye Ra)

205
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:19,348
Was it really an accident?

206
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:22,188
How many times do I have to explain it?

207
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:24,818
- This is exhausting. - Did you think...

208
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:26,758
I'd fall for your lie?

209
00:14:28,588 --> 00:14:31,758
Se Hoon, you tried to kill Jung Won, just like Jin Tae Seok did.

210
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:33,028
Why?

211
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,298
- Why did you have to go that far? - I'm losing my mind too!

212
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:38,368
Do you know how desperate I was?

213
00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:41,138
I had to give up the woman I loved, who was my wife,

214
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:43,508
just because she was your biological daughter.

215
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:46,838
But as if that wasn't enough, now she's my father's daughter?

216
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:49,008
Are you ashamed of my Jung Won, too?

217
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:51,378
Ashamed enough to want her dead?

218
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:52,948
If I can't have her, I'd rather...

219
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:55,988
just erase her from my sight forever.

220
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:58,058
I admit I've had that thought before.

221
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:02,388
Chairman Han!

222
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:06,628
You won't even call me Mother anymore?

223
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:08,268
Se Hoon, are you...

224
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,398
becoming just like Jin Tae Seok?

225
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:12,698
Isn't that to be expected?

226
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:15,638
- I'm his son, after all. - Did your father make you do it?

227
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:17,568
To get rid of Jung Won?

228
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:19,138
Just because he orders it...

229
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:21,808
doesn't mean I'm some idiot who blindly follows it.

230
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,278
Let me repeat myself.

231
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:28,188
- I didn't do anything. - Se Hoon.

232
00:15:28,988 --> 00:15:29,988
Do you...

233
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:33,888
want to be an even bigger monster than your father?

234
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:35,028
Perhaps I do.

235
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:40,458
And from now on, you'd better not underestimate me.

236
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:42,698
I will never forget the humiliation...

237
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:44,668
I suffered today.

238
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:51,038
Se Hoon...

239
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:54,108
tried to kill my Jung Won.

240
00:15:55,108 --> 00:15:57,008
My poor Jung Won. What am I going to do?

241
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:22,468
You put Se Hoon up to this, didn't you?

242
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:26,038
You told him to run over my daughter, Jung Won, with his car.

243
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:51,068
Jin Tae Seok, I can take you out whenever I want.

244
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:52,898
But before that,

245
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:56,638
I'm going to strip you of everything you have.

246
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:22,628
Jin Se Hoon was definitely...

247
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:25,038
trying to kill me.

248
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:45,058
I didn't dare hope you were still the man I once knew.

249
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:49,388
What I did to you was so cruel...

250
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:52,428
that I couldn't even bring myself to apologise.

251
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:54,868
If there was any way,

252
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:57,868
I would have gotten on my knees to beg for your forgiveness.

253
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:01,868
So now I finally get an apology.

254
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:04,708
Did you want to kill me?

255
00:18:06,678 --> 00:18:07,978
Do you really...

256
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:10,778
hate and despise me that much?

257
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:16,048
When you're deeply shocked...

258
00:18:16,818 --> 00:18:18,258
and get hurt so badly,

259
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,788
I guess people just erase their feelings...

260
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:22,888
to protect themselves.

261
00:18:24,828 --> 00:18:25,958
Even if I said...

262
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,868
it was an accident,

263
00:18:27,868 --> 00:18:29,698
- you wouldn't believe me, right? - You're right.

264
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:31,698
It wasn't an accident.

265
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:34,708
I saw the look in your eyes.

266
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:36,968
It was full of murderous rage.

267
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:38,608
You're right. I wanted you dead.

268
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:41,178
Then you should've done a better job of running me over.

269
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,708
Why hurt Ha Neul instead of me?

270
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,978
You should have finished the job!

271
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:49,348
Does it hurt you more...

272
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:52,018
that Joo Ha Neul got injured...

273
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:53,358
than the fact that I tried to kill you?

274
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:57,558
Maybe I should've just killed Joo Ha Neul instead.

275
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:12,308
This isn't enough to change my mind.

276
00:19:13,678 --> 00:19:15,308
I won't make the same mistake twice.

277
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:17,948
Next time, I won't fail.

278
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:21,588
Both you and Joo Ha Neul.

279
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:50,048
Whoever did this to my son, Ha Neul,

280
00:19:51,418 --> 00:19:53,148
will have to pay.

281
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:10,368
Is my house your new office or something?

282
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:13,798
You're heading out early. I still have about an hour to go.

283
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:17,068
I have an urgent errand to run.

284
00:20:18,638 --> 00:20:21,178
What's all this? Are you making my Ha Neul breakfast?

285
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:23,308
I was just going to make him some simple porridge.

286
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:25,078
There's already plenty of porridge in the fridge...

287
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:28,318
Hey! You need to learn when to speak and when to keep quiet.

288
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:30,388
You've gotten way too talkative these days.

289
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:32,858
I'm just still so upset...

290
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:34,928
about Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul getting hurt.

291
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:36,788
Is Ha Neul your son?

292
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:37,958
Get over it.

293
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:39,298
Yes, ma'am.

294
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:42,468
You're here to make breakfast, so I can't just turn you away.

295
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:44,228
Make it good.

296
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:46,168
- Let's go! - Yes, ma'am.

297
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:51,038
Please take good care...

298
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:53,678
of Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul.

299
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:30,978
You're such a fool.

300
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:33,718
Why would you do that for me?

301
00:21:45,228 --> 00:21:46,258
You're such a crybaby.

302
00:21:47,498 --> 00:21:48,498
Stop your tears.

303
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:51,328
You're awake?

304
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,108
Are you okay? Does anywhere hurt?

305
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:03,508
Should we go to the hospital?

306
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:05,118
I'm hungry.

307
00:22:09,518 --> 00:22:11,218
I guess you're finally back to your old self,

308
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,158
seeing how you're joking around.

309
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:17,128
Eat some porridge.

310
00:22:28,408 --> 00:22:29,408
This tastes terrible.

311
00:22:29,868 --> 00:22:32,108
Really? I'll go make another batch.

312
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:33,638
No...

313
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,348
I'm kidding. It's so good. It really is.

314
00:22:37,778 --> 00:22:38,978
You're impossible.

315
00:22:40,078 --> 00:22:42,148
You're always getting hurt trying to save me.

316
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:46,258
That's better than an "I love you."

317
00:22:55,628 --> 00:22:59,198
Jin Tae Seok hid billions in a Swiss account from Han Hye Ra?

318
00:22:59,298 --> 00:23:00,468
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

319
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:01,538
That's correct.

320
00:23:02,238 --> 00:23:03,308
Are you sure?

321
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:06,108
I'm smarter now. No, I always was.

322
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,878
That's just because my intelligence is rubbing off on you.

323
00:23:08,308 --> 00:23:11,078
Let's try a little something called "thinking."

324
00:23:11,648 --> 00:23:14,048
Why would Jin Se Hoon try to hit Cha Jung Won...

325
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:16,548
and say it was an accident?

326
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:18,588
But right at that exact moment,

327
00:23:18,858 --> 00:23:22,028
my devoted Ha Neul had to show up and get hurt instead.

328
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:26,528
Could Chairman Jin Tae Seok be the one behind it?

329
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:29,198
Of course he was.

330
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:32,338
I'm sure Jin Tae Seok baited Jin Se Hoon,

331
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:34,838
promising him the money in the Swiss account.

332
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:39,408
He told him to kill Cha Jung Won for the secret slush fund.

333
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:42,708
Bravo!

334
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:47,778
As expected. Gong Nan Sook sees right through me.

335
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:51,788
You and I are inseparable...

336
00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:58,028
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

337
00:24:02,468 --> 00:24:04,628
What, a pair of cockroaches?

338
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:06,798
I meant like peas in a pod.

339
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:08,908
You sure know your place.

340
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:11,068
You put Jin Se Hoon up to it, didn't you?

341
00:24:11,638 --> 00:24:15,348
You lied, promising the Swiss money if he harmed Cha Jung Won.

342
00:24:18,078 --> 00:24:19,518
There's no fooling you.

343
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:22,848
Your intelligence network really is world-class.

344
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:27,458
So, is there really money in that Swiss account?

345
00:24:28,788 --> 00:24:30,458
I guess you haven't gotten that far in your investigation?

346
00:24:37,168 --> 00:24:38,568
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

347
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:41,668
Why did you send this to me and conveniently omit the password?

348
00:24:41,868 --> 00:24:44,438
If you succeed where Se Hoon failed,

349
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:45,878
I'll give you the password.

350
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:49,878
If I take care of Cha Jung Won,

351
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:52,348
you'll give me the money in the Swiss account?

352
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:55,188
You don't really think I'd give you all of it, do you?

353
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:59,518
Just like old times, we'll be in the same boat again.

354
00:24:59,618 --> 00:25:00,988
As the crocodile and the plover bird.

355
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,588
If you'd like,

356
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:04,628
I'll even throw in the chairman position at Kunhyang.

357
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:09,298
So you're offering me money and the chairman's seat?

358
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:13,368
Gosh, what am I supposed to do?

359

00:25:16,938 --> 00:25:18,838
How's Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul?

361
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:20,508
I heard that the surgery was a success,

362
00:25:21,008 --> 00:25:22,708
and he was resting at home.

363
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:24,208
That's such a relief.

364
00:25:24,748 --> 00:25:28,418
I don't trust that punk Jin Se Hoon. An accident, he says?

365
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:30,148
What a joke.

366
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:32,718
He was such a good guy. I don't know what happened.

367
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:36,358
Don't you think he was just jealous of our Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul?

368
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:39,958
He lost his position, and Ha Neul won Jung Won's heart.

369
00:25:40,158 --> 00:25:41,898
But still, to hit him with a car...

370
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:46,168
Vice President Jin isn't the kind of person to do that.

371
00:25:47,238 --> 00:25:50,308
Come to think of it, why are you even talking to me?

372
00:25:50,738 --> 00:25:52,538
I don't want to see you yet, Manager Hwang.

373
00:25:54,408 --> 00:25:55,408
I'll wait...

374
00:25:56,248 --> 00:25:57,578
even if I miss you, Ms. Jo.

375
00:25:58,678 --> 00:25:59,678
Then.

376
00:26:00,218 --> 00:26:01,718
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

377
00:26:02,988 --> 00:26:03,988
What was that?

378
00:26:04,518 --> 00:26:07,718
Does he think he's forgiven just because he knelt once?

379
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:12,628
He's the one who made me lose my precious child...

380
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:16,868
and just stood by while my beloved Ki Beom died.

381
00:26:18,668 --> 00:26:20,368
I can never forgive him for that.

382
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:27,338
You're not thinking of working with Jin Tae Seok again, are you?

383
00:26:31,478 --> 00:26:32,918
Chairman Gong Nan Sook!

384
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:36,618
Gosh, you scared me, you jerk.

385
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:39,658
Did you just raise your voice at me? Are you insane?

386
00:26:39,718 --> 00:26:41,088
Of course I'm going crazy!

387
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:43,358
- If... - If what?

388
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:47,098
If you take Jin Tae Seok's deal, then we're through, Chairman Gong.

389
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:48,628
What?

390
00:26:50,168 --> 00:26:52,968
Hey, are you saying you're firing me?

391
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:56,368
Unbelievable. You've lost your mind.

392
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:57,608
The absolute nerve of you!

393
00:26:58,678 --> 00:27:00,108
Yes, I have!

394
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,208
You...

395
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:05,478
No, that's not it.

396
00:27:05,478 --> 00:27:07,978
Right. First, I'll put Jin Se Hoon in his place,

397
00:27:08,218 --> 00:27:11,148
and then I can decide whether or not to take Jin Tae Seok's deal.

398
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,658
Right? That's what I should do. Yeong Soo...

399
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,458
Where did he go? He sure is quick.

400
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:17,258
Yeong Soo, get in here!

401
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:21,698
The fall and winter season concept has been finalized.

402
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:24,428
I'd like to propose that we hire more designers.

403
00:27:24,698 --> 00:27:27,268
That's right, Director Jin. We were worked to death last time.

404
00:27:27,468 --> 00:27:29,108
It was basically just three of us doing all the work.

405
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:31,308
Because a certain someone was constantly away from their desk.

406
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:32,808
And that's my fault?

407
00:27:33,308 --> 00:27:34,478
I was the victim here.

408
00:27:34,938 --> 00:27:36,408
Whose fault do you think it was...

409
00:27:37,478 --> 00:27:38,818
when I was put on standby and the miscarriage?

410
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:42,988
I also agree that we need to hire more designers.

411
00:27:44,418 --> 00:27:47,888
Draft a plan for the number of hires and recruitment, then report to me.

412
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:49,288
Yes, Director Jin.

413
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:50,988
It won't be a blind recruitment, right?

414
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:53,728
Of course it will be a blind recruitment.

415
00:27:54,198 --> 00:27:55,798
That's the Design Team's hiring policy.

416
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:58,538
Kunhyang only tried blind recruitment...

417
00:27:58,538 --> 00:27:59,668
for its public image.

418
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:02,268
We should be honest about screening by education in the first round.

419
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:04,268
We should be upfront and honest about it.

420
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:09,978
Let's go back to our old method. The first round is education-based.

421
00:28:11,248 --> 00:28:15,018
If I'm in charge, I'll make a plan that fits your vision, Director Jin.

422
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:17,048
Why would you be in charge of that?

423
00:28:17,418 --> 00:28:18,858
Especially with Team Leader Cha Jung Won right here.

424
00:28:19,018 --> 00:28:22,288
A team leader should be someone who's qualified for the job.

425
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:25,128
Joo Young Chae! We are not changing team leaders.

426
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:26,628
Just stick to your own duties.

427
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:27,928
Are you sure about that?

428
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:31,698
So I can tell everyone, then?

429
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:37,168
What is she talking about?

430
00:28:51,088 --> 00:28:52,218
What Joo Young Chae said was true.

431
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:55,488
I'm the one who did it.

432
00:28:56,428 --> 00:28:57,688
Mom didn't know anything about it.

433
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:02,598
So that's what Joo Young Chae is using...

434
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:04,598
to blackmail you, Director Jin.

435
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:08,338
I won't let her get away with it.

436
00:29:29,858 --> 00:29:31,488
Don't you know how to drive?

437
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:42,668
I'm so sorry.

438
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:45,608
I was distracted by an urgent call and took my eyes off the road.

439
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:47,178
It appears I made a mistake.

440
00:29:47,438 --> 00:29:50,408
I was on a call and took my eyes off the road for a second.

441
00:29:53,248 --> 00:29:56,348
You're not even hurt, are you? You look perfectly fine.

442
00:30:05,858 --> 00:30:08,828
(A Graceful Liar)

443
00:30:30,918 --> 00:30:34,958
Jin Tae Seok gave you and Se Hoon a Swiss account number?

444
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:36,628
What can you offer me, Han Hye Ra?

445
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,258
It better be something bigger...

446
00:30:38,258 --> 00:30:39,458
than what Jin Tae Seok and Jin Se Hoon offered.

447
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:41,928
I'm thinking of joining forces with Chairman Gong Nan Sook again.

448
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:44,068
That's a better plan if you want to take down...

449
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:45,198
Jin Tae Seok and Jin Se Hoon.

450
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:47,898
The design I worked so hard on has disappeared.

451
00:30:47,968 --> 00:30:49,568
Have you seen Team Leader Cha's design?

452
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:50,808
Stop trying to pin it on me.

453
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,078
It's her fault for being careless.

454
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,278
You're the one who took Team Leader Cha's design.

455
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:57,548
That's mine. Joo Young Chae, did you steal my design again?
