(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,880
(in this drama are fictional.)

00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,380
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,760
How dare you go after Ha Neul?

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,810
Don't you know how to drive?

6
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,020
Chairman Gong?

7
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,500
I'm so sorry.

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,200
I was distracted by an urgent call
and took my eyes off the road.

9
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,900
It appears I made a mistake.

10
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,470
You're not even hurt, are you?
You look perfectly fine.

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,280
- I know you did that on purpose.
- You do?

12
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:11,940
You know that?

13
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,610
What could you possibly know?

14
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,780
People are watching.
Let's take this inside.

15
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,720
That's probably a good idea.

16
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,690
(Episode 82)

17
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,430
Listen, I can put up
with a lot of things,

18
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,930
but I will not tolerate anyone
who dares to mess with my Ha Neul.

19
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,430
It's hard for me to understand
since he's not even your own son.

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,110
Are you admitting to my face
that you almost ran over my Ha Neul?

21
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,710
It wasn't Joo Ha Neul.
It was Cha Jung Won...

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,550
The look in your eyes has changed.

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,580
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,550
I was wondering
where I'd seen that look before.

25
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,120
Now I remember.
Those are Jin Tae Seok's eyes.

26
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,630
Isn't it only natural
for a son to take after his father?

27
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,730
- You could kill someone like this.
- It was an accident.

28
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,830
Jin Tae Seok told me everything.
How dare you lie to my face?

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,710
I should've just run you over.

30
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,740
Did he also tell you
my reason for doing it?

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,480
Do you mean the Swiss account?
Yes, I got a text about it.

32
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,280
He said he'd give you the money
and the chairman position...

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,780
if you got rid of Cha Jung Won.

34
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,220
You know Jin Tae Seok spares no one,
not even his own son.

35
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,790
You've learned this lesson before,
and you're still falling for it?

36
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,030
My father...

37
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,860
No. I want to surpass Jin Tae Seok.

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,430
You want the money
in the Swiss account,

39
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,870
and you want to be chairman, right?

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,270
That's the same way I feel.

41
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,670
- As long as you're on my side...
- Listen here, Se Hoon.

42
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,440
How do I know you won't turn on me
and try to run over Ha Neul again?

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,810
How can I possibly trust you?

44
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,210
I will never go after
Joo Ha Neul again.

45
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,780
Just words? That's ridiculous.

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,720
Then what do I have to do
for you to believe me?

47
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,930
Get me the password
for the Swiss account.

48
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,760
If I knew the password,

49
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,260
do you think
I'd actually give it to you?

50
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,230
You want me
to let the fox guard the henhouse?

51
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,840
All right.

52
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,510
What?

53
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,380
Jin Tae Seok gave you and Se Hoon
the Swiss account number?

54
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
So it seems.

55
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,050
I'm not even sure
why I'm spilling all of this to you.

56
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,050
I don't really get it myself.

57
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,220
You don't know why?

58
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,190
You hate scumbags who are stronger
than you and just plain vile.

59
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,530
You're right.
I can't stand plain vile ones.

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,900
I hate them.

61
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,760
I like strong guys,
and I like bad guys.

62
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,370
But I hate petty people.

63
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,840
And I absolutely loathe the kind...

64
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,440
who tell lies
that fall apart in a second.

65
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,980
Considering all that,
Han Hye Ra, you may be a witch,

66
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,080
but at least you're not petty.

67
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,310
That's what I like about you.

68
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,910
Get to the point.

69
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,620
Are you still
going to work with me or not?

70
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,190
But his offer is just too tempting.

71
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,460
I love money more than anything.

72
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,860
He's offering the money
in the Swiss account,

73
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,290
plus the chairman's seat.

74
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,260
Your son Joo Ha Neul's life
is on the line.

75
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,170
If we're going there, your daughter
Cha Jung Won's life is at stake too.

76
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,500
So choose.

77
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,040
We'll have to make a new deal.

78
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,270
What can you offer me?

79
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,240
It better be something bigger...

80
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,280
than what Jin Tae Seok
and Jin Se Hoon offered.

81
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,550
I can't promise that.

82
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,950
Gong Nan Sook, it's up to you.

83
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,380
So it's take it or leave it?

84
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,620
The only thing I can promise is...

85
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,750
my resolve to protect our children
with you.

86
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,890
Darn it, so you're playing hardball.
Whatever!

87
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,130
One way or another,
I'm getting that Swiss account.

88
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,860
Then we'll have to split it.

89
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,100
Between you and me.

90
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,530
How can we split it
without the password?

91
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,740
Do you even know it?

92
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
We'll find it.

93
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,640
(Kunhyang Group)

94
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,910
Is that true?

95
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,920
Joo Young Chae is something else.

96
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,550
Blackmailing Director Jin
to get her team leader job back?

97
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,390
- Ji Na, I need your help.
- Me?

98
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,060
If Young Chae targets Director Jin,
it'll destroy the team's morale,

99
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,800
and it won't be easy to fix things.

100
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,770
I'll have to think about it.

101
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,080
This color combination is fantastic.

102
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,750
This draped knit
would flatter any body type.

103
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,760
Designer Ahn Ji Na
gave me a great idea.

104
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,290
That's all your skill,
Designer Kim Sung Hee.

105
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,330
Designer Joo Young Chae,
how's your design coming along?

106
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,600
Of course.

107
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,640
You'll be able to submit your design
by tomorrow, right?

108
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,340
Don't worry.

109
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,050
I'm heading out for a meeting
and will go home from there.

110
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,590
Please submit your designs
by tomorrow.

111
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,820
- Got it.
- All right.

112
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,380
Aren't you leaving, Young Chae?

113
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,850
- I still have some work left to do.
- We'll head out first, then.

114
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,950
It's not bad.
A little unoriginal, though.

115
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,670
My goodness.

116
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,500
To think the esteemed madam
would grace us with her presence.

117
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm just so overwhelmed.

118
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,140
I had to see Vice Chairman Joo.
He's one of my people, after all.

119
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,780
There you go again,
calling my son "one of her people."

120
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,850
I should've just slammed the door
in your face.

121
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,950
He's in there, right?

122
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,720
She wishes to see him alone.

123
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,820
What do you think you're doing?
How dare you stop Chairman Gong?

124
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,190
Oh my,
are you two fighting right now?

125
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,190
She didn't waste any time
getting in there.

126
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,730
Why is it that
whenever I see Han Hye Ra,

127
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,270
I get this horrible feeling
like she's stolen something from me?

128
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's go and cool our heads.

129
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Yes, ma'am.

130
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,610
I didn't expect you
to come here in person.

131
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,710
I'm so grateful.

132
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,120
I don't know
how I can possibly thank you.

133
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,790
Jung Won...

134
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,220
is alive thanks to you,
Vice Chairman Joo.

135
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,590
Please, don't say you're grateful
or even thank me.

136
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,200
In fact, I'm a little hurt
you'd even say that.

137
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,570
When Jung Won is in danger,
I don't even think,

138
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,340
and my body and my heart
just act on their own.

139
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,170
Just like you, Chairman Han.

140
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,850
Thankfully, both you
and Jung Won are safe,

141
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,150
but who knows
what might happen next,

142
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,050
or what terrible dangers lie ahead?

143
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,260
- Just the thought of it...
- Then we have to strike first...

144
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,630
to stop Jin Tae Seok and Jin Se Hoon
from doing any more harm.

145
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,460
So they can't put Jung Won or you...

146
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,030
in any more danger.

147
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,200
You're a target too.

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I know.

149
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,040
In fact, it has cleared my head.

150
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,650
It's now clear what I need to do.

151
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,380
Jin Tae Seok...

152
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,520
has a Swiss account.

153
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,320
He siphoned off a massive slush fund
behind my back.

154
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,390
Why are you telling me this?

155
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,930
Because Se Hoon found out...

156
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,230
and made a deal with Jin Tae Seok.

157
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,860
So that's why...

158
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,000
If Se Hoon killed Jung Won,

159
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,040
he said he'd give him the money
in the Swiss account and the chairmanship.

160
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,510
Jung Won can never know about this.

161
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,140
I agree.

162
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,380
You and I have to be the ones
to handle this.

163
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,750
I'll recover and be back soon.
Please, just give me a little time.

164
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,790
What is it?

165
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,930
I'm thinking of joining forces
with Chairman Gong Nan Sook again.

166
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,630
It's just business.

167
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,360
A necessary move.

168
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,100
That's a better plan
if you want to take down...

169
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,170
Jin Tae Seok and Jin Se Hoon.

00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,590
What?

175
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,160
Is your design ready?

176
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,100
We’re going to have a meeting
to review each...

177
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,230
of your submitted designs.

178
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
So be ready.

179
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,030
I should just take this.

180
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Where did it go?

181
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,510
- What's wrong?
- Is something missing?

182
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,880
The design I worked so hard on
for the past few nights has disappeared.

183
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,950
What?

184
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,850
It's not like it grew legs
and walked away.

185
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,790
- What?
- You were the last to leave last night.

186
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,320
Did you see
Team Leader Cha's design?

187
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,890
Why are you asking me?

188
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,700
You really didn't see it?

189
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,600
Stop trying to pin it on me.

190
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,370
You should've kept
a better eye on it.

191
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,210
Make me one too, please.

192
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,580
Make it yourself.

193
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,910
It was you, wasn't it?

194
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,950
- What was?
- You took Team Leader Cha's design.

195
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,390
Do you have proof?

196
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,890
You sound so confident.

197
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,100
Goodness, you poor thing.
I can't bear to see you like this.

198
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,100
You got hurt this badly
trying to save my Jung Won.

199
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,070
It's not that serious.

200
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,640
I'll be back on my feet in no time.
Please don't worry.

201
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,380
Jin Se Hoon has gone mad.
I'll teach him a lesson.

202
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,380
I'll make sure he can't lay a finger
on Jung Won or you ever again.

203
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,620
No, please don't do that.

204
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,450
If you get hurt, it'll make it
harder for Jung Won and me.

205
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,050
So you're telling me to stand by
and do nothing?

206
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,690
I can't do that.

207
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,460
You think you have a spare life
or something?

208
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,560
Hurry up and get back on your feet.
Goodness...

209
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,930
I'm so sorry.

210
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,870
- Goodness.
- I'll get better quickly,

211
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,170
and I'll protect you and Jung Won.

212
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,270
- What was I thinking?
- Easy...

213
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,780
When it comes to minimal chic,
I know my stuff.

214
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,980
It was all the rage
in New York for a while.

215
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,760
That's my design.

216
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,360
Joo Young Chae,

217
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,500
did you steal my design again?

218
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,200
What? This is my design.

219
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,870
Did anyone here see her design this?

220
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,710
- I didn't see it.
- I didn't see it either,

221
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,840
but you have a history of this.

222
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,880
And you were the last one
to leave yesterday.

223
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,050
It's unfair to automatically
blame me just because of my past.

224
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,160
What's that?

225
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,130
That must be Cha Jung Won's design.

226
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,770
That's my design.

227
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,510
- It wasn't me.
- Director Jin.

228
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,440
I know you hate your sister,
but this is going too far.

229
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,250
I was being unfairly blamed
for no reason.

230
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,090
Designer Cha Jung Won.

231
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,590
I need to find out what happened,

232
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,400
but this is my mistake.
I sincerely apologize.

233
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,840
I don't believe
you'd do something like this.

234
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,540
We still need to confirm the facts.

235
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,240
You don't have to apologize
preemptively.

236
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,100
Are you here to visit me?

237
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,130
I almost feel bad
for being in such good shape.

238
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,770
I'm not going to say I'm sorry.

239
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,410
It was a mistake,

240
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,780
- and it was an accident.
- A mistake?

241
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,210
An accident?

242
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
Jin Se Hoon.

243
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,350
You were really trying
to kill Jung Won.

244
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,880
And you were trying to save her?

245
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,450
No.

246
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,190
You were even willing
to die for her.

247
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,390
Isn't that hilarious?

248
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,560
That I, with my own two hands,

249
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
almost harmed Jung Won...

250
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,170
If...

251
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,600
your car had hit Jung Won...

252
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Or...

253
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,570
if the worst scenario had happened,

254
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,910
would you have been satisfied then,
Se Hoon?

255
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,710
I didn't think that far ahead.

256
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,610
I just...

257
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,420
I just wanted to end it all.

258
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
What?

259
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,050
My love,

260
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,920
my jealousy, my obsession,
and my resentment,

261
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,990
and all my anger toward you
and Cha Jung Won...

262
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,830
- I just wanted to end it all.
- Se Hoon.

263
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,430
You're supposed to be different
from your father.

264
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,570
At the very least, you should see
what's wrong with you...

265
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,570
Or...

266
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,740
you have to get a grip on yourself
before you become completely warped.

267
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,380
- You need to stop here, Se Hoon
- I don't want to stop!

268
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,980
I'm going full steam ahead.

269
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,850
You and Cha Jung Won,

270
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,350
if you get in my way,

271
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,160
I'll get rid of you anytime
without mercy.

272
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,330
Se Hoon, is this
who you've always been?

273
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,460
No.

274
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,130
I was much worse.

275
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,530
Even worse than my father,
Jin Tae Seok.

276
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,100
Just being prepared won't be enough.

277
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,740
You have to put your life
on the line, Joo Ha Neul.

278
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,790
Is something troubling you?

279
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,520
Min Jung.

280
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,520
I need you to do something for me.

281
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,880
What is it?
Do you have something to report?

282
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,550
I don't think I can do this anymore.

283
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,680
Do what anymore?

284
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,190
Chairman Han is suspicious of me.
It puts me in an awkward position.

285
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,990
I'll think it over.

286
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,490
Dad, are you free for some tea?

287
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,430
- Of course.
- I'll go prepare the tea.

288
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,900
Since when has Secretary Yoon
been assisting you?

289
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,770
Your mother and I are home,

290
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,270
and Manager Hwang is busy
at the office.

291
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,450
My dear Se Mi.

292
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,480
Why do you look so troubled?

293
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,890
Dad, what kind of person are you?

294
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,730
What kind of question is that?

295
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,160
I'm your dad, who loves you more
than anyone in the world.

296
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,130
Are you only a good person to me?

297
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,770
Don't you love Mom anymore?

298
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,700
That's not true.

299
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,910
To me, there are only two women,
you and your mother.

300
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,140
You’re the only two people I love.

301
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,850
Cha Jung Won, I mean,

302
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,380
I heard Jung Won is
your daughter too.

303
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,890
Did your mother tell you that?

304
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,360
Yes.

305
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,890
Then why are you trying to hurt...

306
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,260
Jung Won?

307
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,930
Who told you this nonsense?

308
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,500
The poison in the wine.

309
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,670
Mom drank it, but you were trying
to kill Jung Won, weren't you?

310
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,470
And you smothered her with a pillow.
That was real, wasn't it?

311
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,740
I told you no.

312
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,440
- You don't believe me?
- I want to believe you.

313
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,780
When you're born with everything...

314
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,920
and are admired by everyone,

315
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,450
you're surrounded by envy, jealousy,
and betrayal. That's your world.

316
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,160
So everyone's just jealous
and envious of you,

317
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,520
and that's why they're trying
to frame and betray you?

318
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,360
Se Mi.

319
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,430
Don't listen
to what anyone else says,

320
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,700
and just trust me. All right?

321
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
If...

322
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,070
Go on.

323
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,170
If everything you said was a lie,

324
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,610
I'll never forgive you.

325
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,150
Never.

326
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,880
Se Mi.

327
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,820
I'll never let you find out
what kind of man I am.

328
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,150
Ever.

329
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,840
My sweet, good-hearted boy.

330
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,180
Let this be a chance to rest.
Get all the sleep you've missed.

331
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,990
Then when you wake up,
you'll be more upright, stronger...

332
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,860
like a tree with deeper
and more solid roots,

333
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,990
and you'll stand tall again.
All right?

334
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:13,910
Gong Nan Sook.

335
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,910
I just can't figure you out.

336
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,050
Why can't you just let me...

337
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,920
hate you completely?

338
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,030
How do I know you won't turn on me
and try to run over Ha Neul again?

339
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,200
How can I possibly trust you?

340
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,500
I will never go after
Joo Ha Neul again.

341
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,100
Just words? That's ridiculous.

342
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,510
Then what do I have to do
for you to believe me?

343
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,440
What can you offer me?

344
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,380
It better be something bigger...

345
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,650
than what Jin Tae Seok
and Jin Se Hoon offered.

346
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,880
The only thing I can promise is...

347
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,880
my resolve to protect our children
with you.

348
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,820
Jin Se Hoon or Han Hye Ra?

349
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,960
Who should I side with?

350
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,230
That is the question.

351
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,410
What is it? Tell me.

352
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,750
Manager Hwang
is in a very tough spot.

353
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,650
He was the only person
Jin Tae Seok trusted,

354
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,720
so of course, Jin Tae Seok is going
to think he was betrayed.

355
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,090
He can't quit the Kunhyang family.

356
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,260
I know.

357
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,030
Is there a solution?

358
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,000
Let me go work
for Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

359
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,440
- What?
- I already spoke to him.

360
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,240
And you think he'll trust you?

361
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,250
But do you trust me, Hye Ra?

362
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
Of course I do.

363
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,890
If I couldn't trust you,

364
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,890
it would mean my entire life
was a lie.

365
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,090
You were my right-hand man
for 25 years.

366
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,030
Hwang Jung Guk,
I trusted you completely.

367
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,200
How could you betray me like this?

368
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,170
There's a limit to ingratitude,
you know.

369
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,010
I can no longer serve you,
Chairman Jin.

370
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,210
What?

371
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
You can no longer serve me?

372
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,790
And who do you think
is keeping your sister safe?

373
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,520
You think I don't know
she's in Manhattan?

374
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,460
Please, spare her.

375
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,930
Don't make me laugh,

376
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,290
you ungrateful wretch.

377
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,170
Hit me until you're satisfied.

378
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,170
Fine.
Then consider today your funeral.

379
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,770
That's enough!

380
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,210
Manager Hwang was only following
my orders.

381
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,820
Why would my personal secretary
be taking orders from you?

382
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,120
Secretary Yoon Min Jung here...

383
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,790
could never defy an order from you.

384
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,890
You can no longer
trust Manager Hwang.

385
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,800
And I can no longer trust
Secretary Yoon.

386
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,070
I'm taking Manager Hwang
to work for me.

387
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,800
You can have Secretary Yoon.

388
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,140
That's not a bad idea.

389
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,060
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

390
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,740
What's this?

391
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,770
Did the cleaning fairy stop by
or something?

392
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,520
Did you think I was kidding
when I told you to stay away?

393
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
I'm sorry.

394
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,100
Did you get beaten up?

395
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,340
- It was an accident...
- Stop it.

396
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,400
Jin Tae Seok beat you, right?

397
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,010
Did you get fired?

398
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
Yes.

399
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,980
Fine. You can work part-time here
until you find a new job.

400
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,920
Yes, thank you.

401
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,020
But...

402
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,090
I actually already found
another job.

403
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,190
What? Where?

404
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,960
I'm assisting Chairman Han Hye Ra.

405
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,330
- What?
- I'll work both jobs.

406
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,230
Good grief.

407
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,840
It's time you made me the chairman.

408
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,270
You didn't even do
the one thing I asked,

409
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,440
and you're already demanding
your cut?

410
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,840
How was I supposed to know
Joo Ha Neul would interfere?

411
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,780
You must at least acknowledge
my attempt.

412
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,580
Your method was wrong all along.

413
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,620
Until Cha Jung Won
is out of the picture for good,

414
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,450
forget about any account.

415
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,920
I hear you made the same deal
with Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

416
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,190
I'm a businessman.

417
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,230
To get what I want,

418
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,560
I won't just play both sides.
I'll play all of them.

419
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,970
Why can't you bring yourself
to trust me?

420
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,570
Don't you know
what Chairman Gong wants?

421
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,770
- She's trying to take Kunhyang...
- And you're not, Se Hoon?

422
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,310
The minute you get that password,
you'll drain the money...

423
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,280
and treat me like I'm nothing.

424
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,720
You think I'm a fool?

425
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,950
Even if I had gotten rid
of Cha Jung Won,

426
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,420
you never intended to give me
the password to the Swiss account,

427
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,460
- did you?
- Prove you're my son...

428
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,590
and on my side,
and that you would die for me.

429
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,200
That's impossible.

430
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,230
- I'd rather...
- Rather what?

431
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,930
just take it from you.
Every last bit of it.

432
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,840
After all,
that's the way you taught me.

433
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,410
After all I did for you...

434
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,950
Se Hoon, you can't bite the hand
that feeds you.

435
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,120
I will never let that happen.

436
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,990
Because you are going
to be my shield.

437
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,660
I didn't get to see the whole thing.

438
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,100
There will be other opportunities.

439
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,570
We've secured another five percent
of Kunhyang's shares.

440
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,370
Combined with my own stake,
that's a total of 15 percent.

441
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,340
Don't you think Jin Tae Seok knows
that you're behind David Kay?

442
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,580
He probably suspects by now.
However...

443
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,150
Out of Chairman Han's 18 percent,

444
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,920
she gave 5 percent to Cha Jung Won,
leaving her with 13 percent.

445
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,360
Excluding Chairman Jin Tae Seok,
you're now the largest shareholder.

446
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,430
You own more than
Vice President Jin Se Hoon does...

447
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,460
with his ten percent.

448
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,560
Thank you for all your hard work.

449
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,940
- Yes, Chairman Han.
- Why don't you return to work...

450
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,700
starting next week?

451
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,810
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul,
you have a lot of work ahead of you.

452
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,810
Did you find out the password
for Jin Tae Seok's Swiss account?

453
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,450
Only half.

454
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,980
I don't consider it a failure.

455
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,520
The video of Cha Ki Beom's death
that Se Hoon has.

456
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,760
I will find it.

457
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,120
No matter what it takes.

458
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,660
You have to.

459
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,940
(A Graceful Liar)

460
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,190
How can I hope to beat you
and your father if I don't change?

461
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,260
I'm not just going
for Vice Chairman,

462
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,460
I’m going for Chairman too.

463
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,270
Joo Ha Neul declared that he's going
to become the chairman.

464
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,370
So that was his real intention
all along.

465
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,670
You must find the video
that Vice President Jin Se Hoon has.

466
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,910
Are you referring to the video
of Cha Ki Beom's death?

467
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,940
We can't let them take this video.

468
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:09,550
I must either take down Joo Ha Neul
or become the new chairman.

469
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,780
Se Hoon, now you know
what you have to do, right?

470
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,550
First, I'll secure
Young Chae's three percent.

471
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,650
Gong Nan Sook could seize Kunhyang.

472
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,460
