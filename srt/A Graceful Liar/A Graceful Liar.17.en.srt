(in this drama are fictional.)

(This production followed all guidelines

00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,650
(Episode 17)

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,700
(We welcome your visit.)

6
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,390
Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,960
I'm your daughter.

8
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,760
You think
that's going to work on me?

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,390
Seriously...

10
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,820
He acted all high and mighty...

11
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,540
Darn...

12
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,170
Aren't you tired of hamburgers?

13
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,500
For dinner tonight,

14
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,570
I brought sandwiches.
Is that cool with you?

15
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,710
What took you so long?

16
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,410
I was worried sick.

17
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,350
But not too worried to play games, I see.

18
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,990
I'm scared to death.
I'm going stir-crazy in here.

19
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,390
You know what? I'm out.

20
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,130
If you walk out now,
you're not coming back.

21
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,470
Are they so determined to catch me?

22
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,570
Do you even have to ask?

23
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,770
This is driving me nuts.

24
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,210
I shouldn't have been involved
in this.

25
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,270
What did you just say?

26
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,880
That’s not what you said
when you were pocketing my cash.

27
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,580
"Pocketing your cash"?

28
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,050
Hey! Just do what you're told.

29
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,080
Before I make you puke up
everything you took.

30
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,860
What?

31
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,320
Why should I help you?

32
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,600
It's the other way around.

33
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,230
I'm the one helping you, Min Gu.

34
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,830
Whether Jung Won is posing as you
or not.

35
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,100
Or if Park Kyung Shin betrayed you,
what's that got to do with me?

36
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,510
Doesn't it make you feel furious?

37
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,540
Your ex-girlfriend, Cha Jung Won,
is marrying Kunhyang's heir.

38
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,680
Are you asking me if I feel furious?
Hardly.

39
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,650
We were over a long time ago.

40
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,550
So do you feel upset?

41
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,490
Just a little?

42
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,320
Hey, I dumped her.
What makes you think I'm upset?

43
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,690
Then why the long face?
Did you get your heart broken?

44
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,960
Are you lovesick or something?

45
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,530
You're so pathetic
I can barely look at you.

46
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,800
While you've been left high and dry,

47
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,970
Cha Jung Won went from rags
to riches by marrying into wealth.

48
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,610
That must really burn you up, right?

49
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,540
Look who's talking.

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,650
Sure, you were "best friends,"

51
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,720
but you thought Jung Won
was just your little maid to boss around.

52
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,350
So how does it feel to be
completely upstaged by her?

53
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,220
- Stings, doesn't it?
- Shut your mouth.

54
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,300
I'm so furious I could die.

55
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,770
Suddenly, I feel like my whole life
has been thrown in the gutter.

56
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,810
I have no one on my side.

57
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,580
Even my own mother
is looking out for her.

58
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,450
I'm so angry I'm going to lose it.

59
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,550
The only one who can help me is you.

60
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
What should I do?

61
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,660
Park Kyung Shin, who tossed me aside
like an old shoe.

62
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,400
Let's make that jerk pay first.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And then?

64
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,940
Of course, the one
who crushed your self-esteem,

65
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,670
it's Cha Jung Won's turn.

66
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,580
I'll set the stage for you.

67
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,110
Go kick up a storm,
as much as you want.

68
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,850
Come on.

69
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,420
I can't do that without money.

70
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,140
(Deposit from Joo Young Chae:
500,000 dollars)

71
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,170
Min Gu.

72
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,810
You only threw fits
because you were broke.

73
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,380
Now go throw some money around.

74
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,960
Noh Min Gu, it was your choice,

75
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,130
and your decision.

76
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,100
I didn't know it would go this far.
What is all this?

77
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,900
I'm a kidnapper all of a sudden.
I can't even go to my office.

78
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,240
And I'm about to get dumped
by my girlfriend.

79
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,140
Do you take me for a fool?

80
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,540
You...

81
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,780
You were fired...

82
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,010
and broke up with the girl you left
Cha Jung Won for.

83
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,880
You think I wouldn't have
looked into that?

84
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,280
If only Jung Won's face
wasn't plastered all over the news...

85
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,990
And as if that wasn't enough,
she's marrying the Kunhyang's heir.

86
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,420
You must've been furious.

87
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,160
What kind of world is this?

88
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,230
I work my butts off just to earn
a few hundred bucks a month,

89
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,700
and after paying off my loans,
I'm broke.

90
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,000
But what about
that pathetic, poor Cha Jung Won?

91
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,300
She marries into a tycoon's family?

92
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,510
That's exactly why you're here.

93
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,410
Because you couldn't bear to watch.

94
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,710
I didn't know I'd be stuck inside.

95
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,550
He's the one who should be locked up,
so why am I...

96
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,610
What?

97
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,580
Hey...

98
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,160
Hey, stop!

99
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,060
- Stay back!
- Hey, calm down.

100
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,300
- Hey, that's dangerous, you punk.
- I'll really light it on fire.

101
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,240
This is insane...

102
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,950
Joo Young Chae, stop!
Hey, I said, stop right there!

103
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,530
Not the face.

104
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,230
How did it feel
when you were almost drowned?

105
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,240
That was just a little tease.

106
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,440
How about I have you cremated alive?

107
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,380
I was wrong.

108
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Please...

109
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,510
Please, just let me go.

110
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,550
Alright. If that's your wish,
I'll let you go.

111
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,920
For good.

112
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,190
Hey!

113
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,530
Are you insane?
Are you trying to get us all killed?

114
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,800
I don't want to die here!

115
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,300
Young Chae.

116
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,730
I really did love you.

117
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,770
Why, you little...

118
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,240
You punk!

119
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,880
Don't you dare play games with me!

120
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,350
Hey. Tie him up.

121
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,450
Tighter.

122
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,560
Seriously, why did you
have to make things worse?

123
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,590
Look, I had no idea
Young Chae was this unhinged.

124
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,630
Stop trying to get yourself killed.

125
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,460
Get over here!

126
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,420
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

127
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,230
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra?

128
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,140
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

129
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,870
Oh my...

130
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,310
What do you think you're doing here?

131
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,610
I thought we agreed to never see
each other again.

132
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,880
How dare you show your face here?

133
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,950
Cha Jung Won.

134
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,590
Is she your daughter, Mi Hyang?

135
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,460
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
is at my house?

136
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,570
Yes. I'm not sure what it's about.

137
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
She thinks Young Chae is me,

138
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,340
I mean, she thinks Young Chae
is Cha Jung Won.

139
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,040
Apparently, Young Chae told her
she's Cha Jung Won.

140
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,510
So since Young Chae called herself
Cha Jung Won,

141
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,880
Vice Chairman Han would think...

142
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,710
she was
Park Kyung Shin's girlfriend or ex.

143
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,350
Exactly.

144
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,590
She might even think
Cha Jung Won has him.

145
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,350
Which is why she came
to my father's house.

146
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,320
That's a logical conclusion.

147
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
What do we do?

148
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,860
What if Vice Chairman Han...

149
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,030
finds out I'm the real Cha Jung Won?

150
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,570
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We don't know why she's here.

151
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,270
We still don't know
her real motives.

152
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,940
- We should pull back for today...
- No.

153
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,240
Let's wait for her to leave,
then go talk to my dad.

154
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,150
You'll probably find out
what's going on.

155
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,660
I hadn't seen her
since she was seven,

156
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,430
but we met briefly at the hospital.

157
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,630
- You met Jung Won?
- I did.

158
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,570
She's grown
into a beautiful young woman.

159
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,170
Don't tell me she recognized her.

160
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,210
That Jung Won is Su A.

161
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,580
Fine, so you met her.
Why are you here?

162
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,710
There's something
I need to ask Jung Won.

163
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,120
I was hoping you could give me
her number.

164
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,280
Why do you want
my daughter's number?

165
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,790
To make her a replacement for Su A?

166
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,720
What kind of nonsense is that?

167
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,490
Who said anything about
replacing anyone?

168
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,260
This is a very serious matter.

169
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,770
Jung Won could be involved
in a big incident...

170
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,270
and end up in serious trouble.

171
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,200
I need to meet with her
and get the full story,

172
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,510
- so I can help...
- Since when does a cat help a mouse?

173
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,710
I don't know what this is about,

174
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
but my Jung Won can handle it,

175
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
no, I mean,

176
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,110
Mi Hyang and I will handle it.

177
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,720
This isn't something
to take lightly.

178
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,780
Enough!

179
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,050
How can you be so shameless?

180
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,520
Get out now! I said, get out!

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:20,680
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

183
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,780
What are we going to do?

184
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,220
To keep them from meeting,

185
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,850
I told her Jung Won, who is alive,
was dead,

186
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,960
but how could she possibly...

187
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,660
mistake Jung Won for my daughter
who's gone?

188
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,500
I guess blood really
is thicker than water.

189
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,830
How can we stop what's meant to be?

190
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,000
Shut up!

191
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,640
We just have to keep them apart.

192
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,980
Jung Won is my daughter,
not Han Young Sun's.

193
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,620
(Mr. Hiccups)

194
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,820
What am I going to do?

195
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,590
I invited Mr. Hiccups over,

196
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,260
and I completely forgot.

197

(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

198
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,530
I was too hasty.

199
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,470
It must be hard for them
to see my face again.

200
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,420
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

201
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,430
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

202
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,240
Where are you?

203
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,700
I'm right out front.

204
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,340
Hello.

205
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,350
Has Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
left already?

206
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,380
- You saw her?
- Yes, I came right up to the front.

207
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,320
How do you know Hye Ra?

208
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,690
Hye Ra?

209
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,960
Do you two know each other?

210
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
Hardly.

211
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,760
Though she just looks a bit older
than me.

212
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,800
What about you, Mr. Hiccups?

213
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,100
How do you know
such an important woman?

214
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,340
She's famous in the business world.
I've only seen her from a distance.

215
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,440
I see. You must be hungry.
Let's go inside.

216
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,710
Actually, wait...

217
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,180
Why did Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
come to visit?

218
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,850
Why are you so curious about that?

219
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,150
It's just that it seems unlikely...

220
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,950
for her to come in person
without her secretary,

221
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,820
unless there is a personal connection.

222
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,560
I can't get into the details,

223
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,460
That vixen said...

224
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,530
she wanted to see Jung Won.

225
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,700
Jung Won?

226
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,440
What for?

227
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,940
You know how Jung Won worked
at Kunhyang Department Store...

228
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,110
as a personal shopper, right?

229
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,150
Yes.

230
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,950
She has such an exceptional eye
for fashion,

231
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,450
so she wants
to hire her exclusively.

232
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,120
That's why she was here.

233
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,160
What's all this?

234
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,330
We really enjoyed what you brought
last time.

235
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,330
This is that stuff for knees,
isn't it?

236
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,660
Yes.

237
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,600
It's best to take care of your health
while you're feeling well.

238
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,100
You really didn't have
to bring anything.

239
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,270
- You're just so thoughtful.
- It was nothing.

240
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,810
Vice Chairman Han met
with Cha Ki Beom?

241
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,920
She's not one to act rashly.

242
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,490
So why would she go all the way
out there?

243
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,590
This information came
from the Owner Risk Team.

244
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,430
According to official records,

245
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,330
Cha Ki Beom
is Cha Jung Won's father.

246
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,100
Jo Mi Hyang raised her on her own.
After Cha Ki Beom was released,

247
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,540
he formally adopted her
and changed her surname to Cha.

248
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,310
- How old is she?
- She's 32.

249
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,710
25 years ago,

250
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,880
when Jo Mi Hyang took in Cha Su A,

251
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,450
her own daughter
would've been seven, right?

252
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
That's correct.

253
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,490
But why did she go
to Cha Ki Beom's house...

254
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,420
just to see Cha Jung Won?

255
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,290
She must have concluded...

256
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,160
that Cha Jung Won
has Park Kyung Shin.

257
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,300
Are you sure she doesn't know
what happened 25 years ago?

258
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,170
I saw no indication
of that whatsoever.

259
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,700
So?

260
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,940
Do you know where Cha Jung Won is?

261
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,840
Is she really the one
hiding Park Kyung Shin?

262
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,340
Cha Jung Won!

263
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,980
Have the Owner Risk Team
find her contact information.

264
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,150
The Chairman is bound to find out.
Are you sure about this?

265
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,550
Right now, finding her
as soon as possible...

266
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,160
is more important.

267
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,800
What's the rush?
Why are you drinking so fast?

268
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,770
When my head's a mess,
drinking is the only thing that helps.

269
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,140
Is something bothering you?

270
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,080
Is it because
of Vice Chairman Han's visit?

271
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,780
You should just worry
about Jung Won.

272
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,120
Why is there an article saying
she's marrying some other guy?

273
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,890
Reporters do anything for a scoop.

274
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,590
Don't pay any mind
to that fake news.

275
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,760
Are you sure?

276
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,030
That you're the one Jung Won wants?

277
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm positive.

278
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,630
I'll give you that.

279
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,100
The way you have absolute faith...

280
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,870
that your woman would
never see another man.

281
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,150
Darn it.

282
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,950
You can know the depths of the sea,

283
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,150
but you can never know
what lies in a person's heart.

284
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,720
Anyone who trusts blindly
is a complete fool.

285
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,390
But he's saying
he trusts Jung Won anyway.

286
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,500
Take it easy.

287
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,670
Did you two have a fight
or something?

288
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,170
What?

289
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,040
How can I fight with sweet Mi Hyang?

290
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,080
It breaks my heart to look at her.

291
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,210
Come on.

292
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,880
I just...

293
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,320
feel worse for you, Ki Beom.

294
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,990
- Go on, eat.
- Okay.

295
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,330
- Here.
- Thank you.

296
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,600
Her exclusive personal shopper?

297
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,300
She was just making that up.

298
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,910
You said Jo Mi Hyang
isn't your biological mom, right?

299
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,510
I'm sorry.

300
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,310
That must be a painful memory
to bring up.

301
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,720
For me,

302
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,620
she's the only mother I have.

303
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,590
It looked like Vice Chairman Han
and Jo Mi Hyang knew each other.

304
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,820
Not at all.

305
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,490
You're probably mistaken.

306
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,530
Maybe I am.

307
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,330
Then...

308
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,970
why do you think Vice Chairman Han
is pursuing Young Chae?

309
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,100
She thinks
Young Chae has Park Kyung Shin.

310
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,370
No, that Cha Jung Won does.

311
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,810
We have to find him first.

312
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,140
If Young Chae meets with her again,
she'll reveal who you really are.

313
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,550
You don't have to worry about that.

314
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,780
Young Chae is leaving
for Milan tomorrow.

315
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,950
You met with Young Chae?

316
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,220
I did. She came to see me
in the chairman's office.

317
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,720
Young Chae herself?

318
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,360
That's what I said.

319
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,290
From now on, you don't need to worry
about Young Chae.

320
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,460
You came all this way
just to tell us that?

321
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
What else was I supposed to do?

322
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,540
Our future depends on this girl
who's pretending to be Young Chae.

323
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,570
What about Park Kyung Shin?

324
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,440
Did she say she has him?

325
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,710
Young Chae would never admit it,
even if she did.

326
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,120
What does it matter?
I don't care if she kills him.

327
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,920
What matters is keeping Young Chae
from meeting Han Hye Ra again.

328
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,260
Do you think Young Chae
will just leave quietly?

329
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,430
And if she doesn't?

330
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,160
How dare she defy me?

331
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,600
No, she wouldn't dare.
Absolutely not.

332
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,250
Young Chae is leaving alone?

333
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,220
Then what about Park Kyung Shin?

334
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,850
And how does Noh Min Gu fit
into all of this?

335
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,800
The person you called
is unavailable.

336
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,500
You'll be transferred to voicemail.

337
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,340
Min Gu, I need to confirm something.

338
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,440
Meet me at Joo Young Chae's house
tomorrow at 1 p.m.

339
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,480
Meeting Noh Min Gu
should clear some things up.

340
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,760
(Tranquilizer, Alpdem)

341
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,050
Why isn't she showing up?

342
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,460
So you changed the passcode.

343
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,630
It's strange
that I have to ring the doorbell...

344
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,700
to come into my house.

345
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,440
What are you doing here?

346
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,810
I thought you'd be on a flight
to Milan by now.

347
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,340
All that flying
was making me airsick.

348
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,810
But more importantly,

349
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,180
you seemed more eager to see me
than Noh Min Gu?

350
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,390
(To Mom,
Young Chae is home right now.)

351
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Darn it.

352
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,830
Young Chae is home right now.

353
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,640
What is she doing at home?

354
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,540
Unbelievable.

355
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,840
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

356
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,910
Good work.

357
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,350
The Chairman
must know by now, right?

358
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,720
Since the Owner Risk Team was mobilized,
he must be aware.

359
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,360
(Cha Jung Won)

360
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Vice Chairman Han
has Cha Jung Won's number?

361
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,070
It looks like she's planning
to find Park Kyung Shin herself.

362
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,770
What about Noh Min Gu?

363
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,400
We confirmed he's with Cha Jung Won.

364
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,380
So they conspired
to sneak Park Kyung Shin away?

365
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,510
Does Se Hoon know about this?

366
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,350
Cha Jung Won and Noh Min Gu
snuck Park Kyung Shin away?

367
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,030
(Joo Young Chae)

368
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:46,930
Did you...

369
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,500
get Noh Min Gu
to hide Park Kyung Shin?

370
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,840
Why do you care
whether I did or not?

371
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,110
That's a crime.

372
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,180
A crime?

373
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,950
Stop laughing.

374
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,620
I wonder
what you're so worried about.

375
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,920
Park Kyung Shin's safety?

376
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,830
Or that I'm using your ex,
Noh Min Gu?

377
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,700
- Both.
- You're lying.

378
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,630
What you're most worried
about right now...

379
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,670
is that I'm going
to take your place.

380
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,210
I bet you couldn't care less
about Park Kyung Shin or Noh Min Gu.

381
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,850
You probably wish I would take care
of the two men who know your secret,

382
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,190
and make them disappear
without a trace.

383
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,660
Stop it.
You're giving me the creeps.

384
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,390
The creeps?

385
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,960
The creeps?

386
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,600
You're the one who's really creepy,
Cha Jung Won.

387
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,500
Vice Chairman Han couldn't possibly think
I'm in the dark.

388
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,640
Why is she keeping secrets?

389
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,540
I'm not keeping any secrets
from you.

390
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,640
You walk without making a sound.
So light on your feet.

391
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,080
- You're clearly not human.
- What am I, a ghost?

392
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,920
Either an angel or a fairy.

393
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,090
I have a favor to ask you.

394
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,390
Name it. I'd give you anything
but the stars in the sky.

395
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,760
It's about Cha Jung Won.

396
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,900
It looks like she and her
ex-boyfriend, Noh Min Gu,

397
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,500
are holding a model named
Park Kyung Shin captive.

398
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,010
A model from our fashion show
has gone missing.

399
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,080
If this gets out to the press,
it'll be a huge blow to our image.

400
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,650
I need you to find him.

401
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,880
- Young Chae.
- That's right.

402
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,950
That's my name, Joo Young Chae.

403
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,820
Don't be like this.
You're the one who asked for this.

404
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,590
- Have you forgotten?
- How could I ever forget?

405
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,260
You staged Park Kyung Shin's
suicide attempt...

406
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,300
so that I'd be so touched,
I'd run away to Paris.

407
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,270
Because you gave it all up for love.

408
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,370
That love...

409
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,440
got thrown out like trash.

410
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,070
And I was shattered
into a million pieces.

411
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,610
So, what should I do now?

412
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,310
Should I shatter you to pieces
for what you've done to me?

413
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,220
- Stop it. I can't breathe.
- Of course. I should stop.

414
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,420
I'll end this for you.

415
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,590
Young Chae!

416
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,260
- Se Hoon.
- Who are you?

417
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,770
Who do you think you are,
trying to hurt my Young Chae?

418
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,700
My Young Chae?

419
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,370
You're asking who I am?

420
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,510
My one and only friend,

421
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,080
what should I tell him?

422
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,350
I'll tell you, Jin Se Hoon.

423
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,250
I'm...

424
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,250
Stop it.

425
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,590
Please.

426
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,860
Seeing my friend in so much pain
breaks my heart.

427
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
But what can I do?

428
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,970
I've taken quite a liking
to Jin Se Hoon.

429
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,600
I am...

430
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,810
Cha Jung Won.

431
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,410
Right?

432
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,240
You're Cha Jung Won, aren't you?

433
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,350
The one who plotted with Noh Min Gu
to abduct Park Kyung Shin.

434
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,650
Cha Jung Won?

435
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Cha Jung Won?

436
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Cha Jung Won?

437
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,530
Me?

438
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,070
Don't be ridiculous.

439
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,870
I'm Joo Young Chae.

440
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,920
(A Graceful Liar)

441
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,310
I thought you had guts.

442
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,080
Did Young Chae's arrival scare you?

443
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,710
Do you know where Young Chae is?

444
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,010
I'm talking about Cha Jung Won.

445
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,350
She's so hostile
to our future daughter-in-law.

446
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,120
So they think Young Chae
is Cha Ki Beom's adopted daughter.

447
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,820
Cha Jung Won says...

448
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,720
her father served time in prison
for a crime he didn't commit.

449
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,850
Could she be out for revenge?

450
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,820
They must have known we were coming
and moved in a hurry.

451
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,490
Chairman Jin Tae Seok
is getting involved himself?

452
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,730
If you missed them by a hair,
someone must have tipped them off.

453
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,130
How did you know to sneak
Park Kyung Shin here?

454
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,500
I can't stand the sight of him.
Get him out of my face now...

455
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,570
before I bury him alive.

456
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,540
