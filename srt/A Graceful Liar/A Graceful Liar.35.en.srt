1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,570
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:03,880
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,140
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,760
What's this?

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,670
Why are you clutching that
like it's some priceless treasure?

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,140
This is none of your concern,
Madam Young Chae.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,470
What concerns Mother concerns me.
I'll be running this household soon.

8
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,150
That's enough.

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,850
My dear daughter-in-law,
you're more brazen than you appear.

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,720
Are you trying to walk all over me?

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,270
- Am I not supposed to know this?
- Bring some tea.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,240
A DNA test with Cha Jung Won?

13
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,110
Han Hye Ra thinks Cha Jung Won
might be Su A.

14
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,880
I heard Jo Mi Hyang's daughter
was registered as Cha Ki Beom's.

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,550
Does the truth matter?

16
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,390
The truth is
whatever you and I make it.

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,760
I suppose you're right.

18
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,660
It doesn't matter
if Cha Jung Won is the real one.

19
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,300
We just have to make her
the real one.

20
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,770
See?
That's why we're a perfect match.

21
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,070
I know exactly what to do.

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,800
Should I tail Secretary Yoon?

23
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,270
She's going to run a DNA test.

24
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,640
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,110
Are you sure
Vice Chairman Han's daughter...

26
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,640
is still alive?

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,510
How did you mess things up
25 years ago?

28
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,750
She was Jo Mi Hyang's daughter
back then.

29
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,090
I wasn't aware.

30
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,560
You weren't aware?
And you call that an excuse?

31
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,070
Apologies, sir.
There must've been a mistake.

32
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,370
A mistake?

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,340
You get one mistake.
But there won't be a second.

34
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,880
Turn Cha Jung Won into Su A.

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,380
- Understood.
- Bring me the results secretly.

36
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,520
(Episode 35)

37
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,360
Why do you keep crossing the line?

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,730
Why do you have to keep secrets,
Mother?

39
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,030
I am the daughter-in-law
of the Kunhyang Family.

40
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,940
Even we must have boundaries.
Secretary Yoon is my aide.

41
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,770
She only follows my orders.

42
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,280
So do not mistreat her.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,810
I'll give you a proper portrait.

44
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,980
"Proper?"

45
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,520
- I wonder how you'll capture me.
- So am I.

46
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,930
I wonder how deep my brush will dig
to capture what's stirring beneath.

47
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,230
"What's stirring beneath?"

48
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,870
You saw it in me? Desire?

49
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,330
A mother's love is a form of desire,
isn't it?

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,240
A mother's love isn't always blue
like the sky or the sea.

51
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,080
Sometimes, it's a fiery red,
like burning to death from longing.

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,010
I suppose it can also be black,
like a pitch-dark tunnel.

53
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,650
I mean, your maternal love.

54
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,350
Why did you hide the fact?

55
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,320
The fact that
you have another daughter.

56
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,290
So, word really does travel fast.

57
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,830
I suppose you should know
since you're family, after all.

58
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,170
Why didn't you tell
your own son and daughter?

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,370
I was afraid
they'd be disappointed in me.

60
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,410
But more than that,

61
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,180
I was afraid of hurting them.

62
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,780
Of course you wanted to hide her.

63
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,120
Su A didn't fit in
with the Kunhyang Family.

64
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,280
She was just
a dry cleaner's daughter.

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,460
She would have threatened
everything you've built.

66
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,290
I looked for her for a long time.

67
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,990
But I could never find her.

68
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,660
And I'd recently been told
she was dead.

69
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,900
With Kunhyang's resources,
you could've found her anywhere.

70
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,500
I'm just as baffled
and furious about it.

71
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,140
How do you think
your daughter would feel?

72
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,040
When she finds out you're the mother
who abandoned her all those years,

73
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,580
aren't you afraid of the fallout?

74
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,550
Her sense of betrayal.

75
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,290
I'll heal any scars she has
from feeling abandoned.

76
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,290
No.

77
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,030
I will give her the world.

78
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,560
You're lying.

79
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,030
You're nothing
but a hypocrite wrapped in lies.

80
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,530
You even wear a mask of motherhood.

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,070
You must have suffered so much,
Mother.

82
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,240
Thinking about how you've lived...

83
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,980
with such a heavy weight
on your heart for so long,

84
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,550
it just breaks my heart.

85
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,990
I'm sure I'll find her soon.

86
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,860
You'll find out soon enough.

87
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,060
That I'm your daughter, Su A.

88
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,200
I'll have you thrown out of Kunhyang
with nothing to your name.

89
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,250
Great minds think alike.
I was thinking of getting some tea.

90
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,760
Are you tired?
You don't look so well.

91
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,630
I apologized to Mother
about the portrait.

92
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,370
I have bigger things to worry about
than that.

93
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,540
Is it because of Mother's daughter,
Su A?

94
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,610
So you knew about her?

95
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,910
Mother's daughter is family to me.

96
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,380
But I worry more about you.

97
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,150
I assumed you didn't know about her.

98
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,320
I've known from the very beginning.

99
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,990
Su A.

100
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,430
She's going to show up,
sooner or later.

101
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,860
She might even be someone you know.

102
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,430
They found Su A?

103
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,540
Someone I know?

104
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,070
It will get chaotic
for the Kunhyang family,

105
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,170
though it won't be for long.

106
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,940
So, I need you...

107
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,110
to hold your ground
and conduct yourself with dignity.

108
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,550
I can trust you, can't I?

109
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,950
Thanks for forgiving me
and buying me dinner.

110
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,490
You didn't have to get me flowers.

111
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,860
But I have to admit
that I'm touched.

112
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,090
I didn't expect you
to get me flowers. Thanks.

113
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,200
Don't you make that face
in front of any other girls.

114
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,600
What's with that look on your face?

115
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,870
Other guys would think
you're interested in me.

116
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,570
I am.

117
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
What?

118
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,870
Hey, come here.

119
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,480
You're being cheeky again.

120
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,580
I'm not kidding.

121
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,780
- I like you, Ha Neul.
- I like you too.

122
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,720
As a little sister.

123
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,120
Too late. Be my real boyfriend.

124
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,420
Se Mi.

125
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,430
That's my sister for you.
You're always blunt.

126
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,230
I told you that she's going
through puberty again.

127
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,330
She really does have it bad.

128
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,030
Why are you butting in?

129
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,240
You're the one butting in, Se Mi.
I'm here on business.

130
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,540
Some help you are.

131
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,280
Just think about it, Ha Neul.

132
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,910
Se Mi, listen carefully.

133
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,380
I think you're adorable.

134
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,120
But you're Se Hoon's sister,
and practically family.

135
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,650
I'll be back tomorrow.
Save your answer for then.

136
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,590
For crying out loud.

137
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,500
She just withdrew her stance
on remaining single.

138
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,900
You're a heartbreaker, Joo Ha Neul.

139
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Good grief.

140
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,140
Is Su A still being an issue
for others?

141
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,380
I can't hide it anymore.

142
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,250
She's really gotten to me, too.

143
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,590
You've been the Vice Chairman's doctor
for ten years now, correct?

144
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,860
She trusts you more than anyone.

145
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,890
When I hit rock bottom
because of that malpractice suit,

146
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,400
if it weren't for the Vice Chairman,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

147
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,470
This is top secret.
Understood?

148
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,270
She can apologize a million times,
but I won't forgive her.

149
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,300
I'm going to be the one
who leaves her.

150
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,940
I'll push her right off a cliff.

151
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,840
My sweet, kind Jung Won.

152
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,140
How did she become so full of venom?

153
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,380
Revenge isn't a game for amateurs.

154
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,880
Revenge?

155
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,080
Who's getting revenge on whom?

156
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,560
I was just thinking about a show
I watched yesterday.

157
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,260
Nothing's wrong with my hearing.
I heard you perfectly clear.

158
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,360
You said, "My sweet, kind Jung Won."

159
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,770
What's going on? Why?

160
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,070
Is something wrong with Jung Won?

161
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,670
No, not at all.

162
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,170
Did you tell Jung Won the truth?
That Han Young Sun is seeking her?

163
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,870
I told you, no!

164
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,110
Look me in the eye.

165
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
Have you...

166
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,690
forgotten everything we went through
to raise her?

167
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,060
Being framed for murder,

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,530
bone-crushing poverty,

169
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,800
and even though
I'm a pathetic father,

170
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,700
she's my entire world.

171
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,810
Fine. I told her everything.

172
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,340
That Young Sun is desperately
looking for her.

173
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,250
The person you called
is unavailable.

174
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,980
She's completely ignoring my calls.

175
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,420
Don't say a word to Jung Won.

176
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,120
Mi Hyang,
I thought she was taking your calls.

177
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,660
What are you doing?

178
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,790
Did Jung Won change her number?

179
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,470
The person you called
is unavailable.

180
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,300
- Where is she? Where does she live?
- I told you I don't know!

181
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,910
- Mi Hyang!
- I'm serious.

182
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,410
Hey, Manager Hwang.

183
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,820
We can drop the formalities, right?

184
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,560
- Sir, are you drunk?
- Just call me Se Hoon.

185
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,290
But there's a hierarchy, titles.
I couldn't possibly.

186
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,660
Let's forget about all that
starting today.

187
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,400
See? It's nice when you smile.

188
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,270
Yes. Vice President, I mean,

189
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,540
Se Hoon.

190
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,580
Where's Su A?

191
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,380
You know where she is, right?

192
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,550
I'm the heir to Kunhyang Group.

193
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,490
I need to know everything happening
in the Kunhyang Family.

194
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,660
My loyalty is to the Chairman.

195
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,560
Then be my right-hand man.

196
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,470
Starting now,
and long after I become chairman.

197
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,270
So, who is she?

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,170
Did you find out?

199
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,050
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

200
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,620
I just had a quick drink
with Ha Neul.

201
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,420
My beautiful wife.
I missed you like crazy.

202
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
Me too.

203
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,090
We've...

204
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,630
found Su A.

205
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,130
A DNA test is being conducted.

206
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,570
That girl, Su A.

207
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,110
- I think she has been found.
- You know that too?

208
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,950
- You too?
- How did you find out?

209
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,050
Your father warned me.

210
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,050
He said if a new sister-in-law came,

211
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,320
I should handle it with grace
as Kunhyang's daughter-in-law.

212
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,460
- My father told you?
- He said he knew all along.

213
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,630

indeed.

214
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,400
I know how you feel.

215
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,410
To protect their so-called love,

216
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,840
they just threw away
your innocent mother...

217
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,440
so heartlessly.

218
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,690
Did Dr. Kim get the message?

219
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,320
Persuading him wasn't easy,

220
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,390
but he was more afraid of you, sir.

221
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,690
Everyone's scared for their lives.

222
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,430
When do the test results come in?

223
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,970
He said the results will be ready
tomorrow at 6 p.m.

224
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,780
I know late-night snacks
are a diet's worst enemy,

225
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,740
but why is this so delicious?

226
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,450
Then why did you call me so late?

227
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,050
I said I called you
to ask your grandmother something.

228
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,620
She's not at your beck and call,
you know.

229
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,350
Come on, please!
It's about Young Chae.

230
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,120
Do you think she can pull off
acting as the fake Su A?

231
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,060
I'm so furious I could burst.

232
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,260
What? What's gotten into you?
Are you not feeling well?

233
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,160
You're an evil witch
who broke two daughters' hearts.

234
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,130
May you be struck by lightning.

235
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,130
What's with her all of a sudden?

236
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,440
It's me. Gong Nan Sook.

237
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,840
The one you always called
a tough girl...

238
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,110
and the apple of your eye.

239
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,180
Do you think it's been easy for me,
having to be so tough all the time?

240
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,150
My poor child.

241
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,880
You poor thing.

242
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,380
You're so lonely it could kill you.

243
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,920
I'm not lonely at all.

244
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,320
And there's nothing pitiful
about me.

245
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,090
I might seem crazy, but I'm a mom.

246
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,960
I do it all for my child's sake.

247
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,710
Hey, can we talk for a second?

248
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,020
- Do you see Jung Won often?
- Sometimes, I guess?

249
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,730
Isn't Jung Won taking your calls?

250
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,700
I heard she got a designer job,

251
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,260
so I guess she's swamped.

252
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,140
You don't know a thing
about her life, do you?

253
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,340
You should address me
more respectfully.

254
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,640
Is that really the issue here?

255
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,870
Sir.

256
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,880
Jung Won is Su A, isn't she?

257
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,840
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra's daughter.

258
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,910
What are you talking about?
That's ridiculous.

259
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,250
If you're going to lie,
at least make it believable.

260
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,460
Honestly, how did you manage to hide
that she was Su A for 25 years?

261
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,660
Stop talking nonsense.

262
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,660
If you're Jung Won's friend,
then act like one.

263
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,800

meeting her real daughter?

348
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,320
The Chairman told me himself.

349
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,790
He said he knew
from the very beginning.

350
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,760
Hey, Jin Tae Seok is
far more dangerous than I am.

351
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,900
I'm just a bit strange
and eccentric.

352
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,970
- I'm not a bad person.
- Just get to the point.

353
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,040
The moment Jin Tae Seok finds out
you're the real Su A,

354
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,440
it'll be over for both you
and Han Hye Ra.

355
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,310
What about the fact...

356
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,750
that the fake Su A is
your real daughter, Joo Young Chae?

357
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,920
Does Chairman Jin Tae Seok
know that too?

358
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,690
If he knew that,

359
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,890
don't you think your cover
would've been blown long ago?

360
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,390
Jin Tae Seok thinks my Young Chae
is Cha Jung Won.

361
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,900
And it was his idea
to turn her into Su A.

362
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,770
- Is that true?
- Why would I lie to you now?

363
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,540
I've been really honest today.
Maybe too honest.

364
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,640
My goodness, call me Ms. Honest.

365
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,820
What is it?

366
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,460
Did Su A come back from overseas?

367
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,900
She got married...

368
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,900
and went to study in the States?

369
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,040
You think I'd fall
for a pathetic lie like that?

370
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,240
Do you really have to find her?

371
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,510
You think finding her is the end?

372
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,010
I have to see her.

373
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,180
Then what?

374
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,520
I'll beg for her forgiveness.

375
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,220
I'll say I was wrong a million times
for breaking my promise to return.

376
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,020
I'll get on my knees and beg.

377
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,060
And what good will that do?

378
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,900
All the hurt, resentment, and anger
she feels because of you.

379
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,170
I'll embrace her
even if she's full of resentment.

380
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,740
- Even if it destroys me.
- It won't end there.

381
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,070
Su A.

382
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,580
Do you think Jin Tae Seok
will just let her be?

383
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,080
To him, there's only you.
Su A doesn't exist.

384
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,280
He sees her as an obstacle.

385
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,990
Tae Seok will accept Su A.

386
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,020
He will because I want him to.

387
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,390
Remember Mi Hyang's daughter?

388
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,360
Why do you think
things ended badly for her?

389
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,900
He's the one who framed me
for murder,

390
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,500
all so he could have you
for himself.

391
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,570
Do you have any proof?

392
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,410
I can't prove it.

393
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,880
But I know.

394
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,980
That punk did it.

395
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,080
Jung Won was only seven.

396
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,750
Why was such a sickly child hit
by a car, all alone?

397
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,750
- He mistook Jung Won for Su A...
- Stop it!

398
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,200
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

399
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,930
(Kunhyang Group)

400
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,470
Vice Chairman Han arranged a meeting
with Cha Ki Beom.

401
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,870
I'll update you
once I've tracked her movements.

402
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,550
Where is she right now?

403
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,080
He would never hurt Su A.

404
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,080
You think he mistook
Mi Hyang's daughter for Su A?

405
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,290
What happened
to Mi Hyang's daughter, Jung Won.

406
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,460
It was just bad luck.

407
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,290
You know it too.

408
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,790
You know exactly what kind of man
Jin Tae Seok is.

409
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,230
He won't lay a hand on Su A.

410
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,970
I'll protect her with my life.

411
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,500
If Jin Tae Seok was behind that,

412
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,870
and if he tries anything again,

413
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,080
I won't let him get away with it.

414
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,480
Just leave Su A alone.

415
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,150
That's the only way to protect her.

416
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,790
Even if I had the whole world,

417
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,490
even if everyone bowed down to me,

418
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,960
my life without my daughter Su A...

419
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,470
felt like sand slipping
through my fingers.

420
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,080
Su A doesn't want that.

421
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,720
She never wants to see you again.

422
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,390
Does she know...

423
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,790
- that I'm her mother?
- Not yet.

424
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,190
She'll find out someday.

425
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,860
No, she'll find out soon.

426
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,670
- What?
- Once I'm sure that girl is Su A,

427
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,740
I'll tell her myself.

428
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,370
That I'm her mother.

429
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,470
"That girl?"
Who are you talking about?

430
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,250
You've met Su A in person? How?

431
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,780
How dare you call her out here?

432
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,900
Slow down.

433
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,560
What's the big rush?

434
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,970
I don't know what to do.

435
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,040
Is this about Cha Ki Beom?
I mean, your father?

436
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,410
Don't you think
it's time to tell him the truth?

437
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,910
That you're married to Jin Se Hoon,
the heir to Kunhyang Group.

438
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,680
I can't. Absolutely not.

439
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,220
Because I'm Cha Su A.

440
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,930
Just let him do what he wants.

441
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,900
Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

442
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,670
It's because I'm not ready
to tell Han Hye Ra...

443
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,570
who I am just yet.

444
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,380
Well, look at you, you sly thing.
You're really playing with fire.

445
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,340
You're really dancing
on a razor's edge.

446
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,910
Help me get my revenge.

447
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:30,020
Now you're finally learning
how to make a real deal.

448
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,760
All right.
After my Young Chae becomes Su A,

449
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,660
what should I do for you?

450
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,690
You have to give me my wings.

451
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,800
I'll give you those wings
so you can fly as high as you want.

452
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,700
Take down Han Hye Ra.

453
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,040
Drag her down
to the fiery depths of the abyss!

454
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:18,370
(A Graceful Liar)

455
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,130
Are you still dreaming
about that jerk?

456
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,800
Did you frame Ki Beom for murder?

457
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,240
If Cha Ki Beom was framed,
it was Gong Nan Sook's doing.

458
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,480
Making Young Chae
a fake Cha Jung Won wasn't enough?

459
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Now what's this about a fake Su A?

460
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,050
Once I've taken down Jin Se Hoon
and his sister,

461
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,710
who's to say Young Chae can't be
the Kunhyang family's next heir?

462
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,620
I guess the line
of succession could change.

463
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,220
You need to be prepared.

464
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,190
Are you worried about my position?

465
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,250
How does it feel?

466
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,020
You're a step away from
having your life stolen.

467
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,720
To deal with these lunatics,

468
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,390
I have to become even crazier.

469
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,230
Those test results are fake.

470
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,460
If Vice Chairman Han gets them as is,
chaos will erupt.

471
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,440
