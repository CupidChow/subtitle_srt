00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,940
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,970
(in this drama are fictional.)

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,040
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,880
(Episode 48)

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,620
Let's have breakfast.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,990
How is the battery dead already?

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,860
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,270
Young Chae? Where are you?

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,900
(Naeil Nursing Home)

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,780
Se Hoon is...

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,980
like a mischievous little boy.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,780
He gets sulky easily,
but he gets over it just as fast.

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,190
And he's an amazing cook.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,660
Sometimes he's like a boy,
and other times, he's a man.

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,530
He's full of charm.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,500
Now that I think about it,
he really takes after you.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,870
I'm so sorry, Mother.

18
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,540
I don't think I can keep
the promise I made...

19
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,950
to never let Se Hoon feel lonely.

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,250
Why can't you keep it?

21
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,850
You're still thinking about divorce?

22
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,200
Not in front of your mother.
Let's talk outside.

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
You came all the way here
to apologize to my mom?

24
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,000
Are we divorced already?

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,440
Just tell me why.

26
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,980
Don't tell me
you have some terminal illness.

27
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,520
Did you rack up a huge debt
behind my back?

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,380
How much do you need?

29
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,420
Three million?

30
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,590
Or ten million?

31
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,690
- I'll take care of it.
- That's not it.

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,420
Is it...

33
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,690
because of Ha Neul?

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
I'm Su A.

35
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,880
I've been living as Cha Jung Won
since I was seven.

36
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,980
What?

37
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,580
I'm Vice Chairman Han's
biological daughter.

38
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,420
That's more than enough reason
for us to get a divorce,

39
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,460
isn't it?

40
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,060
That...

41
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,430
makes no sense.
I can't even pretend to believe that.

42
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,760
It's the truth.

43
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,230
Chairman Jin and Vice Chairman Han
both know.

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,370
So, you're not Joo Young Chae,
but Cha Jung Won...

45
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,070
No...

46
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,170
You're my mother's daughter, Su A.

47
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,140
You married me while hiding that?

48
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,950
That's right.

49
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,810
I deceived you.

50
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,280
Why?

51
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,050
Why would you tell a lie like that?

52
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,120
At first,
it was a favor for Young Chae.

53
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,930
I was just filling in
the blind date for her.

54
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,530
Did you plan this...

55
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,030
from that moment?

56
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,530
To deceive me?

57
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,070
You saw past me being
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter,

58
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,270
and you saw me for me,

59
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,840
and you believed in my potential
as a future designer...

60
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,080
for Kunhyang Fashion.

61
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,410
I was so grateful for that.

62
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,180
What about the new designer contest
at Kunhyang?

63
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,550
That was
Joo Young Chae's application.

64
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,120
Young Chae stole my design book
and submitted it as her own.

65
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,020
The day she was meant to meet you
for the blind date,

66
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,590
her boyfriend, Park Kyung Shin,

67
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,630
was hospitalized for
an overdose on sleeping pills.

68
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,690
That's how it all started.

69
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,300
So I became Joo Young Chae.

70
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,730
Then, Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

71
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,100
and Ha Neul knew about
this all along?

72
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,670
They believed your marriage
to Young Chae...

73
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,370
was crucial for the future
of both families.

74
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,280
Did that give you the right
to keep lying...

75
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,080
to the guy
who was head over heels for you?

76
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,420
Did you even care
that you were hurting me?

77
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,390
The more you cherished and loved me,

78
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,630
the more guilty I felt.

79
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,900
- That's why I was going to end it.
- Then why...

80
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,030
Why did you let it get this far?

81
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,040
What am I supposed to do now?

82
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,010
As much as I felt guilty
about hurting you,

83
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,810
my need for revenge
against Vice Chairman Han...

84
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,340
for abandoning my dad and me
was stronger.

85
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,850
Then you should've kept it a secret!

86
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,110
You should've stayed as my wife,

87
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,750
the daughter-in-law to Kunhyang,

88
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,620
and taken revenge
on Vice Chairman Han!

89
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,190
I didn't hear anything.

90
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,890
I don't know anything.

91
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,230
- I can't give up on you.
- Denying it won't change the facts.

92
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,970
We're siblings.

93
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,640
How can we stay married?

94
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,070
For what I've done wrong,

95
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,980
I'll spend the rest of my life
atoning for it as your sister.

96
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,950
How can we be brother and sister?
We're not even blood-related.

97
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,980
I know you need time.

98
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,420
There's no other way...

99
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,450
to make things right again.

100
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,660
I don't care
whether you're Young Chae or Su A.

101
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,690
You are my woman. My wife.

102
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,530
That will never change.

103
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,310
What were you thinking,
revealing you're Joo Young Chae?

104
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,340
Have you decided to defy me?

105
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,510
It's my life.

106
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,410
Stop telling me what to do.

107
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,710
I'm sick and tired of this charade.
And...

108
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,950
And?

109
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,820
I'll need to be Joo Young Chae again
to seduce Jin Se Hoon.

110
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,590
You're talking nonsense again.

111
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,860
Se Hoon and Jung Won are married.

112
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,520
Hey. I'll make them get divorced.

113
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,760
Do you think Kunhyang will allow it,
now that they're siblings?

114
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,200
Se Hoon isn't the type
to just do whatever he's told.

115
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,900
Ha Neul, be honest with yourself.

116
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,840
If Jin Se Hoon falls for me,
that's good for you too, right?

117
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,700
- You should be cheering.
- Don't play with people's hearts.

118
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,910
You're meant to fall for each other
and then share your feelings.

119
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,710
Love isn't something
you can just take by force.

120
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,680
Whatever. You're so annoying
that I can't even look at you.

121
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,620
That's enough.
There's no need to overthink this.

122
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,120
Ha Neul,
you like Cha Jung Won, don't you?

123
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,520
Then just go for it.

124
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,430
A win for you, Young Chae, and me.
A win-win-win for all of us.

125
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,360
After Se Hoon gets a divorce,

126
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,400
you'll make him marry Young Chae?
And I have to marry Jung Won?

127
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,500
- Exactly.
- You want to have it all again?

128
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,910
That sounds just like you,
Madam Gong.

129
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,940
That brat...

130
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,510
Hello, Ms. Jo. What's going on?

131
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,610
Mr. Cha is meeting
with Vice Chairman Han?

132
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,420
What are you talking about?

133
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,090
Why is Dad meeting
with Vice Chairman Han?

134
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,730
I snuck a peek at Ki Beom's phone
this morning.

135
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,660
He just couldn't put his phone down
and was so restless and fidgety...

136
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,470
that I knew something was up.

137
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,830
Why did she want to meet him?

138
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,230
She said it was about Su A.

139
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,910
Is it because Dad didn't tell her
I was Su A?

140
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,870
I have a bad feeling about this.

141
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,980
If Jin Tae Seok finds out,
he'll make a fuss.

142
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,850
Maybe I should have followed him.

143
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,080
You can't leave
this place unattended, though.

144
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,320
That's why I asked CEO Joo Ha Neul
to go check on them...

145
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,080
in case I couldn't
get a hold of you.

146
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,490
He just left a moment ago.

147
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,620
Where are Dad
and Vice Chairman Han meeting?

148
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,660
Where did Ha Neul go?

149
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,570
Han Hye Ra and Cha Ki Beom
are meeting today.

150
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,630
Why would Ha Neul go there?

151
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,500
If you're that curious, go find out.

152
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,810
Why should I? No way.

153
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,340
If anyone's going, you should go.

154
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,710
That girl...

155
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,580
She can't do anything on her own.

156
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,350
It's useless to even
give her a chance.

157
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,920
I have a bad feeling Jin Tae Seok
is going to cause a huge mess today.

158
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,060
Manager Gu!

159
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,660
Yes, ma'am. The car is ready.

160
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,160
Where shall I take you, Chairman?

161
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,860
Have I ever told you where to go?
Just drive.

162
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,970
Why did you ask to meet?

163
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,810
Why didn't you tell me who Su A was?

164
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,410
- You found out who she is?
- How could you hide that from me?

165
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,350
Especially when Young Chae was
pretending to be Su A.

166
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,280
You should've told me first.

167
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,420
A real mother...

168
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,450
would've recognized her own child.

169
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,960
How could I guess my daughter-in-law
was my own daughter?

170
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,990
She chose to be my daughter-in-law,
knowing who I was.

171
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,000
And you knew but didn't stop her?

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,100
I found out later.

173
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,370
And by then it was
too late to stop her.

174
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,470
No,

175
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,910
you didn't stop her on purpose.

176
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,510
- What?
- You wanted her furious with me...

177
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,810
and to get revenge
on your behalf, didn't you?

178
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,850
That's not true!

179
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,350
I was afraid Jin Tae Seok...

180
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,190
would hurt Jung Won
if he found out she was Su A.

181
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,760
So I couldn't bring myself
to tell you.

182
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,580
Was Su A the one who told you?

183
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,080
She did.

184
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,080
My daughter was right before me,

185
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,120
and I didn't even recognize her.

186
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,190
Even after she became
my daughter-in-law.

187
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,920
Don't abandon...

188
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,390
our Su A again.

189
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,930
Why would I abandon her?

190
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,030
I didn't abandon Su A
25 years ago either.

191
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,370
Stop making excuses.

192
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,240
That story about your accident...

193
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,270
and not being able to get Su A
25 years ago...

194
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,840
was all a lie, wasn't it?

195
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,480
- It's not.
- The accident was a lie,

196
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,050
and your long hospital stay
was probably a lie, too.

197
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,950
No, it wasn't.

198
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,620
And that accident...

199
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,120
was caused on purpose
by Jin Tae Seok...

200
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,790
to keep you with him.

201
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,660
Right?

202
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,730
Am I wrong?

203
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,260
No.

204
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,900
Just because you run from it,
doesn't mean the truth will change.

205
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,180
Mommy!

206
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,000
Ki Beom.

207
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
I'm so sorry.

208
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,980
I don't deserve to live.

209
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,790
Don't do this, Hye Ra!

210
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,560
- Don't! It's dangerous.
- Let me go!

211
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,120
Please, don't do this!

212
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,030
Don't do this, Young Sun!
Please, just don't

213
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,200
Let go of me! I said to let go!

214
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
Ki Beom.

215
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,830
Ki Beom... No, Ki Beom.

216
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,330
Ki Beom, open your eyes...

217
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,200
Please, Ki Beom...

218
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,940
What do I do? Ki Beom!

219
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,570
Protect...

220
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,510
our Su A...

221
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,010
from Jin Tae Seok.

222
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,720
Please...

223
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,290
No!

224
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,390
Ki Beom?

225
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,430
What do I do? Somebody!

226
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,670
Secretary Yoon!

227
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,810
Ki Beom...

228
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,310
This got easier than expected.

229
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,280
Everyone will think
Hye Ra killed Cha Ki Beom.

230
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,520
Ki Beom...

231
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,480
Are you all right, ma'am?

232
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,420
Save him, please.
I must've lost my mind.

233
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,820
He's still alive.

234
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,790
Call 911!

235
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,360
- Ki Beom.
- I already called 911.

236
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,940
- Why are you here?
- We'll talk about that later.

237
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,440
- Did you really call 911?
- I told you I did.

238
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,010
Call them again! Tell them to hurry!

239
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,380
Hye Ra, calm down.

240
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,580
Secretary Yoon,
escort the Vice Chairman.

241
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,250
- We have to go, ma'am.
- No.

242
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,180
I'm waiting here
until the ambulance arrives.

243
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,250
Secretary Yoon!

244
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,580
We have to go.

245
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,590
This way, ma'am.

246
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,990
You have to save Ki Beom.

247
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,360
He's Su A's father.

248
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,960
Please, Tae Seok.

249
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,830
I promise. I'll ensure he's saved.

250
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,700
Manager Hwang, find out
if the ambulance is on its way.

251
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes, sir.

252
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,300
Hey, make sure
you're getting all of this.

253
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,840
Wait a minute.
It wasn't Jin Tae Seok,

254
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,740
but Han Hye Ra
who did that to Cha Ki Beom?

255
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,370
Things didn't have to
get this interesting.

256
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,440
Should we pack it up now?

257
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,610
Not yet. I want to see
how Jin Tae Seok cleans this up.

258
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,120
The game's not over until it's over.

259
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,460
- Such a waste that he's gone.
- You scared me.

260
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,670
Grandma, is that you?

261
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,040
You should have stopped it.

262
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,800
Stop what? I didn't do anything.

263
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,610
The heavens are angry.

264
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,340
My gosh, you really are gifted.

265
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,110
I didn't say a word,

266
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,510
so how did you know
something happened?

267
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,720
You didn't bring any food with you,
did you?

268
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,790
Why do you think I'm here?

269
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,420
How should I know?
You're starting to freak me out.

270
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,730
Since you're here,
you might as well make some dinner.

271
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,270
I believe
you have something to tell me.

272
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,170
Look, Se Hoon.
You seem really upset right now.

273
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,070
Why don't we talk tomorrow
after you've calmed down a little?

274
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,880
I can't even think straight
right now.

275
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,740
Is the woman I married...

276
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,450
really your daughter,
Joo Young Chae?

277
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,850
Why is Young Chae claiming
she's Cha Jung Won,

278
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,890
I mean, Su A,
Vice Chairman Han's child?

279
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,030
Listen.
I don't feel the least bit sorry...

280
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,960
for Han Hye Ra and Jin Tae Seok.

281
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,500
But when it comes to you, Se Hoon,

282
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,100
I do feel a little bad.

283
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,530
I had my reasons.

284
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,200
Whatever your reasons were,

285
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,710
marriage is built on trust
between the two families, isn't it?

286
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,080
How could you, of all people,

287
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,180
do this to me,
the heir to the Kunhyang Group?

288
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,320
Did you take me for a fool?

289
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,750
Of course not. Not to the man
who will soon be...

290
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,690
the owner of Kunhyang Group.

291
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,760
To me, you will always
and forever be my son-in-law.

292
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,660
But you're saying
Young Chae is fake.

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,370
How is that even possible?

294
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,100
Then where's the real Young Chae?

295
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,140
Right here.

296
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,780
I'm Joo Young Chae, brother.

297
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,950
Not anymore. From now on,

298
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,480
Se Hoon.

299
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,510
You...

300
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,220
pretended to be Cha Jung Won
and said you were Su A...

301
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,190
Is she really Joo Young Chae?

302
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,330
That's right. She's the real one
this time. And that's final.

303
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,630
She's my daughter, Joo Young Chae,
and your legal wife.

304
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,970
What do you mean, "my wife?"

305
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,570
I just have to take back
my rightful place.

306
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,700
I am your wife, Se Hoon.

307
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,270
We can start getting
to know each other now.

308
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,310
Because I...

309
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,310
really like you, Se Hoon.

310
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,580
Let me make myself clear.

311
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:27,790
I don't care
if she is the fake Joo Young Chae.

312
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,820
I only have one wife.

313
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,120
So don't get your hopes up.

314
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,330
Hey. It's not going to be easy
to win over Jin Se Hoon.

315
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,600
No.

316
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,570
That just fires me up even more.

317
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,210
I will make Jin Se Hoon mine
no matter what.

318
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,370
Dad.

319
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,880
Dad!

320
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,830
Don't do this, Young Sun!

321
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,900
- Please, just don't!
- Let me go!

322
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,780
Did you see Vice Chairman Han
and Cha Ki Beom meet?

323
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,210
What happened?

324
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,550
I saw everything.

325
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,120
Something huge is about to happen.

326
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,550
Did someone die?

327
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,220
Goodness.

328
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,360
No way. Are you serious?

329
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,830
Was it Han Hye Ra? Or Cha Ki Beom?

330
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,630
- Come on, what happened?
- You'll find out soon enough.

331
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,570
Chairman, we have a serious problem.

332
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,970
I didn't mean to impose,
but now I'm in your debt.

333
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,380
I'll be sure to repay this kindness.

334
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,480
He's furious.

335
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,920
They say a woman makes the man.
You just need to make him like you.

336
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,160
Then his "I'll repay this kindness"
will actually mean something.

337
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,290
Don't worry. I've got this.

338
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,660
Now that's my girl.

339
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,340
Here, drink this.

340
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,380
Where's Ki Beom?

341
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,480
Did you check
if the ambulance arrived?

342
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,880
I'm sorry.
I was busy getting you out of there.

343
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,750
I think I lost my phone.

344
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,590
Call emergency services and find out
which hospital they took Ki Beom to.

345
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,860
Yes, right away.

346
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,960
That won't be necessary.

347
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Ki Beom...

348
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,500
Is Ki Beom okay?

349
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,470
He's alive, isn't he?

350
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,270
Ki Beom...

351
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,240
Did something bad happen?

352
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,750
By the time the paramedics arrived,

353
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,820
he was already gone.

354
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,050
No, that can't be.

355
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,990
I'm sure I saw him breathing.
He was alive.

356
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,630
The paramedics
confirmed it themselves.

357
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,760
They said there was nothing
they could do.

358
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,970
Oh, no...

359
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,500
What do I do? What have I done?

360
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,770
I think I killed Ki Beom.

361
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,040
What do I do, Tae Seok?

362
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,680
- I have to go see for myself.
- Are you out of your mind?

363
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,580
You'll be the prime suspect.
You can't just show up there.

364
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,650
No, I have to go find out myself.

365
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,350
Hye Ra!

366
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
(Kunhyang Hospital)

367
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,980
What happened to Ki Beom?

368
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,150
Where is Ki Beom?

369
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,460
(Mortuary)

370
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,330
Honey, why are you here?

371
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,330
Open your eyes.

372
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,800
Let's go home.

373
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,900
I'm here.

374
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,040
The one who's loved you
her entire life,

375
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,940
your Mi Hyang, is here.

376
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,820
Why are you so cold...

377
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,520
Ki Beom. This can't be happening.

378
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,160
This can't be happening, honey...

379
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,060
Honey, no!

380
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,830
No, honey...

381
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:53,340
(Viewing Room)

382
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,550
Young Sun.

383
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,150
You met with Ki Beom, didn't you?

384
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,790
- Mi Hyang.
- You killed him, didn't you?

385
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,020
Please, calm down.

386
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,130
Young Sun, if he hadn't met you,

387
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,500
this never would have happened
to my Ki Beom.

388
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,230
You're the one who killed him!

389
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,630
What do you think you're doing?

390
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,000
She is suffering right now, too.
Please stop with these accusations.

391
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,770
You're Chairman Jin Tae Seok,
aren't you?

392
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,410
If it wasn't Young Sun,
then maybe it was you.

393
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,410
This won't bring Dad back, Mom.

394
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Ma'am.

395
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,190
You met with my dad...

396
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,960
in front of the gallery, didn't you?

397
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,170
Why would my dad
have an accident there?

398
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,700
Tell me what happened.

399
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
She...

400
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,540
spoke with him briefly
and then left.

401
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,610
We just found out ourselves
that Cha Ki Beom fell to his death.

402
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,270
Come on, let's go.

403
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,870
It must be hard for Mom
to be with Dad all alone.

404
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,710
I found this on the stairs
at the gallery.

405
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,210
I feel like I've seen this before.

406
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,850
Someone must have dropped it,

407
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,820
and it looks broken.

408
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,950
If we get it fixed,
we might find out whose it is.

409
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,830
- Don't do this, Young Sun!
- Let go of me!

410
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,940
- Young Sun!
- I said to let go!

411
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,620
It was Han Hye Ra.

412
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
I knew it.

413
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,380
Manager Gu is so kind.

414
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,630
Why did you want to meet here?

415
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,840
I was going to the funeral.

416
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,070
You killed him, didn't you?

417
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,410
My dad.

418
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,650
Don't even try to deny it.

419
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,850
I saw it with my own two eyes.

420
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,720
When Ki Beom tried to save me,

421
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,220
he lost his footing.

422
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,850
Did you do it on purpose?

423
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,590
Because I revealed that I'm Su A?

424
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,430
Were you afraid the world would find out
your daughter-in-law was your daughter?

425
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,800
Did you want to hide it?

426
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,640
Is that why you went after my dad,

427
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,600
the one person
who could prove I'm Su A?

428
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,410
He was definitely still alive.

429
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,150
I should have stayed with him
until the paramedics arrived.

430
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,080
He was still alive?

431
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,450
And you just left him there?

432
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,860
Did you really do that?

433
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,890
It's all my fault.

434
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,430
I should have...

435
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,700
stayed with Ki Beom until the end.

436
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,500
How could you do such a thing?

437
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,110
You killed my father.

438
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,180
That's not all.

439
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,180
I abandoned you, too,

440
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,420
Su A.

441
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,450
But you said you didn't abandon me.

442
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,890
You said there was an accident,

443
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,420
and that was why
you couldn't come get me.

444
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,190
You see, I knew.

445
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,030
That Tae Seok...

446
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,230
never wanted you.

447
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,740
That's not true, is it?

448
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,240
- That can't be true, right?
- Su A.

449
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,650
Don't forgive me.

450
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,450
Never.

451
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,650
You should have just died back then!

452
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,090
Then you wouldn't be the mother
who abandoned her seven-year-old,

453
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,160
or driven the father of the daughter
you just found after 25 years...

454
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,460
to his death.

455
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,720
You told me not to forgive you.

456
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,290
Why are you kneeling shamelessly?

457
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,720
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

458
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,090
I've only just realized...

459
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,800
that I chose
my ambition and my desires...

460
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,900
over being a mother.

461
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,740
Even though
you are my daughter, Su A,

462
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,710
this is the only time...

463
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,240
you will ever see me on my knees.

464
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,050
You're not even worth forgiving.

465
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,820
Then hate me to death.

466
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,720
Other than giving birth to you,

467
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,760
there's nothing I've done for you
or can do for you now.

468
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,030
Money?

469
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,500
I can give you as much of that
as you want.

470
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,100
If you want to be my daughter,
I'll give you that too.

471
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,800
But that's it.

472
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,110
Don't you dare try to take
what's mine, what I protect,

473
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,180
any of it.

474
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,880
This is the only way
that Su A and I...

475
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,620
can both survive.

476
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,000
(A Graceful Liar)

477
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,130
Why is no one here?
Where's Jo Mi Hyang and Su A?

478
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,760
Open the door!

479
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,300
You're still Joo Young Chae,
the daughter-in-law of Kunhyang.

480
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,070
How will we handle the fallout
if this gets out to the press?

481
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,440
I can't even pay my last respects?

482
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,470
That's ridiculous.

483
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,410
Someone sent Jung Won a video.

484
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,640
It shows them getting into a scuffle
and him falling down the stairs.

485
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,510
Su A believes I pushed Cha Ki Beom
down the stairs on purpose,

486
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,750
and that my actions
led to his death.

487
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,620
You did kill Cha Ki Beom.

488
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,150
We could've saved Dad.
But Vice Chairman Han abandoned him.

489
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,060
Chairman Jin left Cha Ki Beom
to die.

490
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,490
