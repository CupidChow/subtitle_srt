(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,680
CEO Joo,
you should cut her loose now too.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,950
Don't stick around
and get caught in the crossfire.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,420
Is that a threat?

7
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,160
Threat or warning,
you'd be wise to listen.

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,990
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,360
I'll never leave her.
No, I can't leave her.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,270
Once I decide someone is mine,
I will never abandon them.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,910
Would you even die for her?

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,110
If you're that devoted,
I suppose I could approve.

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,420
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,350
A classic threat from Madam Gong.

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,720
You just wanted to expose
my true colors.

16
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,300
Neither Jin Tae Seok nor I
will be shaken by a story like this.

17
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,600
Let alone Kunhyang Group.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,800
This is just the first step.

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,740
Starting by exposing your fake life
to the world,

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,510
I'll rip the masks off
Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,610
and Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

22
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,080
If you do,
you'll be the one to get hurt.

23
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,010
It will be far worse than the pain
from being abandoned by me.

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,550
As if abandoning me wasn't enough,

25
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,490
you killed my father,
who never cleared the false charges.

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,620
Is that what you did?

27
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,260
What could possibly hurt
more than that?

28
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,200
Just thinking about it...

29
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,130
drives me crazy.

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,370
To call it my penance
for abandoning you...

31
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,440
is just too cruel.

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,340
How am I supposed to live
for the rest of my life?

33
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,010
What am I supposed to do...

34
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,650
- to escape this guilt...
- You can never escape it.

35
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,620
Guilt? No.

36
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,420
Even that guilt of yours is a lie.

37
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,160
The more you hate and despise me,

38
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,060
the more that blade turns on you.

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,700
It will be plunged right
into your own heart.

40
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,000
- And you don't care?
- I can't stop.

41
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,970
I don't want to stop.

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,410
Not until your life is in ruins,

43
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,480
and Chairman Gong Nan Sook
and Jin Tae Seok...

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
are pushed to the brink.

45
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,220
My father died with so much
unresolved anger...

46
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,320
that his spirit can't rest.

47
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,050
Not until I've cleared his name.

48
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm going to keep fighting,

49
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,260
even if it costs me my life.

50
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,000
You foolish girl.

51
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,570
The pain of being abandoned
at seven?

52
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,070
That's nothing but a splinter,

53
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,370
compared to the immense hardship
that's coming.

54
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,580
It will be far more horrific
than you can ever imagine.

55
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,280
You're the one
who should be prepared.

56
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,620
I will make everything you've gained
by breaking the hearts...

57
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,150
of your loved ones
and even taking their lives...

58
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,090
all crumble to dust.

59
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,260
It will be more horrific
than you could ever imagine.

60
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,460
I'll be looking forward to it, then.

61
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,270
I trust you have a plan?

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,100
I think you're the one who's going
to need a plan, Vice Chairman Han.

63
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,710
The fallout is going to be massive.

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,980

to your retaliation.

don't you think?

if she were the daughter
of the mother who had killed mine,

77
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360
I would have left her,

78
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,490

even if it's something you love,

you have to know how to crush it.

83

That's how you'll become...

84
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,870

aren't you?

What's it to you?

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,180
I was about to go public
with my relationship with Se Hoon.

94
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,050
Is this your way of trying
to ruin it for me?

If it involves the Kunhyang family,
then it's my business now too.

Isn't it enough
that you're now Joo Young Chae?

100
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,160
How dare you try to seduce Se Hoon
when he's not ready,

101
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
even with a baby?

102
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,930
Are you even pregnant?

103
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,770
You think I'm lying?

104
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,210
I wouldn't put it past you.

105
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,140
You're wrong.

106

107
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,050
I'll make sure you see it first.

108
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,420
I sincerely hope
you're not toying with a life.

109
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,290
So what do you want to do about her?

110
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,290
I want to erase that Cha Jung Won
from my sight right this instant.

111
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,130
Do you think Han Hye Ra
will just stand by and let you?

112
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,700
Hye Ra finds her to be
a liability, too.

113
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,100
But that doesn't mean
she wants her dead.

114
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,370
You're always scheming.

115
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,440
So what is it this time?
Spit it out.

116
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,110
An "idea" or "a great plan"
would sound so much better.

117
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,310
Why do you have to be so crude?

118
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,250
Kill a story with another story.

119
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,150
Another story, you say?

120
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,350
Be that as it may.

121
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,990
Han Hye Ra is going to face
some humiliation for a while,

122
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,720
and that will drag the family's name
through the mud.

123
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,230
I can practically hear
the stock prices plummeting.

124
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,130
So, what are you going to do
about that?

125
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,770
I have to get
to an emergency executive meeting.

126
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,440
You figure out a story to bury this,
Chairman Gong.

127
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,280
You have no idea what I really want,
do you?

128
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,790
It's to throw the Kunhyang family
into chaos.

129
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,800
It's past your lunch break.
What are you doing here?

130
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,040
I saw the article
and got worried about you.

131
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,240
I was prepared for this.

132
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,440
I told Vice Chairman Han as much.

133
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,280
That this is just the beginning.

134
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,310
If Chairman Jin Tae Seok...

135
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,080
- comes after you...
- I told you.

136
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,750
If I had been afraid
of getting hurt,

137
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,990
I never would've started this.

138
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,290
CEO Joo,
you should cut her loose now too.

139
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,830
Don't stick around
and get caught in the crossfire.

140
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,170
No matter what,
I will never leave your side.

141
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,770
What's wrong?

142
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
I know I can't stop you.

143
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,140
And I won't even try. But...

144
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,870
You're worried?

145
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,050
I'm worried too.

146
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,080
I'm worried you'll get hurt...

147
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,290
trying to protect me.

148
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,920
I pray all the time.

149
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,460
That we'll both be given strength.

150
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,000
If there's really a deity,
he'll answer your prayer.

151
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,370
No matter what adversity we face,

152
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,140
he'll give us the strength
to overcome it.

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,660

Over here, please!

159

Is it true Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
has another daughter?

160
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,400
We'll hold a formal
press conference...

161
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,340
once we schedule one.

162
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,470

from her previous marriage.

166
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,550
And who is that daughter?

167
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,820
I am.

168
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,630
Are you the biological daughter
of Kunhyang's Vice Chairman Han?

169
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
That's right.

170
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,170
Is that true she is your daughter,
Vice Chairman Han?

171
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,640
Let's go.

172
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,850
Why didn't you look for her
for 25 years?

173

Where is your ex-husband now?

174
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,520

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,990
Just a moment, Chairman!

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,160
- Just a moment!
- Please give us a statement!

177
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,960
Why are you coming forward
to the press now?

178
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,400
Do I need a reason to say
who my mother is?

179
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,700
Who is your father?

180
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,430
He passed away.

181
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,200
You claim to be
her biological daughter.

182
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,440
How will you prove it?

183
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,010
- Look over here!
- Just give us one comment!

184
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,740
- Look over here and say something!
- Is it true?

185
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,480
Over here! Please say something!

186
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,110
- Why reveal this now?
- Give us a comment! Just one word!

187
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,780
Please make a statement!

188
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,190
Let's go.

189
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,690
- They're leaving! Say something!
- Don't go!

190
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,360
Please tell us more!

191
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,690
Say something!

192
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,700
Why did you blurt that out
in front of the reporters?

193
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,270
Did I say something wrong?

194
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,070
The story was already out,
and it's better than lying about it.

195
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,410
Didn't you consider Mom's position?

196
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,310
We could've made
an official statement later.

197
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,150
I was going to reveal it anyway.

198
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,880
Everyone in the Kunhyang Association
knows about it too.

199
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,320
And we can't hide it any longer.

200
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,720
That article goes beyond criticism.
It's basically an accusation.

201
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,020
I know exactly
how that girl must feel.

202
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,820
It'll damage your standing
as Vice Chairman...

203
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,860
and Kunhyang's reputation.

204
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,060
Didn't you hear
the executives in an uproar?

205
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,360
They might even try to oust me.

206
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,530
As long as I, Jin Tae Seok, am here,

207
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,800
no one will lay a hand on my wife.

208
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,050
Why did you come instead of
coming straight to the office?

209
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,290
I was worried.

210
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,490
I knew the reporters
would swarm immediately.

211
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,460
Do you always show up
whenever I'm in trouble?

212
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,260
That's just like how you were
back in high school.

213
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,130
Remember?

214
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,330
Are we doing this?

215
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,670
- Spray-painting?
- Let's go to the murderer's house.

216
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,040
- Let's go!
- Hey, let's go tag the house!

217
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,870
Hey, let's go. Come on.

218
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,740
Let's go tag the house!

219
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,310
You're going to spray paint my house,
aren't you?

220
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,650
My dad's not a murderer!

221
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,120
Get lost.

222
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,090
We're off to create a masterpiece.

223
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,960
You shouldn't get in our way.

224
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,900
I said, knock it off!

225
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,600
What's it like?

226
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,040
- Living with a murderer for a dad?
- He's not a murderer.

227
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,110
How'd he do it? With a knife?

228
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,510
Or did he strangle him?

229
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,340
Or what if he...

230
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,280
Maybe your dad's a serial killer
like in the movies...

231
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,680
Watch your mouth!

232
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,090
That's enough!

233
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,040
And who are you?
Are you her brother?

234
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,040
Are you her boyfriend or something?

235
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,510
Yes.

236
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,180
I'm her boyfriend.

237
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,920
- Hey!
- What was that?

238
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,250
- Hey, get him!
- Quick, go after him!

239
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,470
Joo Ha Neul was my first love.

240
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,210
What are you smiling about?

241
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,120
That was
a pretty dangerous situation.

242
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,750
You know, Ha Neul,
whenever I start to feel lost,

243
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,520
you're the one
who always keeps me grounded.

244
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,330
Whenever I make a mistake,

245
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,090
instead of scolding me, you say,

246
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,460
"It's okay. Let's try again."

247
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,300
That's the kind of person you are.

248
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,100
We share each other's burdens,

249
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,770
- a friend and an ally.
- I'm not your friend.

250
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,640
- How I feel about you...
- I know.

251
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,680
But for now,

252
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,650
I hope
we can encourage each other...

253
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,020
and lean on each other
for our common goal.

254
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,360
I'll wait.

255
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,560
Until you're ready to come to me.

256
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,130
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

257
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,370
Yes, Chairman.

258
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,280
I'll be there shortly.

259
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,950
(Kunhyang Group)

260
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,420
This place isn't bugged, is it?

261
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,590
Jin Tae Seok is more
than capable of doing that.

262
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,060
Don't worry about it.

263
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,530
Really? Goodness.

264
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,200
So what are you going to do?
It's getting worse by the minute.

265
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,570
Do you think you can make a deal
with me in this state?

266
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,180
You're just dying to see me fall,
aren't you?

267
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,540
It's written all over your face.

268
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,750
You're trying so hard not to laugh.

269
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,050
You can? You saw right through me.

270
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,090
What can I say? I'm too honest.
I wear everything on my sleeve.

271
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,620
When are you going to
hand over that video?

272
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,030
Make sure everyone knows...

273
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,990
that Young Chae and Jin Se Hoon
as a real married couple...

274
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,000
and that they're having a baby.

275
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,400
Everyone who matters already knows.

276
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,330
Acknowledge it officially.

277
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,310
Otherwise, you'll never lay eyes
on the video as long as you live.

278
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,310
That's not guts, Cha Jung Won.
That's just plain crazy.

279
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,310
I was simply stating the facts.

280
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,950
This isn't about you being
Han Hye Ra's daughter!

281
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,680
Your revenge article has ruined
Kunhyang's reputation,

282
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,450
leaving it in tatters.

283
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,890
Do you know how much the stock fell?

284
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,320
To raise Kunhyang Group's stock price,

285
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,030
how many people
did you have to hurt...

286
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,730
and sacrifice along the way,
Chairman?

287
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,000
Why should I have to
keep track of that?

288
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,900
Many livelihoods depend on me.

289
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,040
If Kunhyang falters,
it'll drag down the economy.

290
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,400
How stressful for you.

291
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,610
To think that the mighty
Kunhyang Group...

292
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,480
is being shaken
by Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra's past.

293
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,350
I'm curious to know...

294
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,380
if you had to choose
between Vice Chairman Han...

295
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,580
and Kunhyang Group,

296
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,720
which would it be?

297
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,460
Cha Jung Won.

298
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,690
Should I let you live
for Hye Ra's sake,

299
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,590
or kill you
for the sake of Kunhyang?

300
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,600
And you think that's it?

301
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,840
I'll team up
with Chairman Jin again...

302
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,310
and figure out how to oust you,

303
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,940
and how I can wrap this company
around my little finger.

304
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,340
I'll be working hard
on that little project.

305
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,850
Gong Nan Sook, do you really think
you're the one playing Jin Tae Seok?

306
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,320
Don't kid yourself.
It's the other way around.

307
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,990
The other way around?
You mean Chairman Jin is playing me?

308
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,560
It's not just you.

309
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,790
He's playing the whole world.

310
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,190
The law, morality,
even truth itself.

311
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,800
He believes he can bend it all
to his will.

312
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,400
To him, someone like you is just...

313
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,200
"Someone like me?"

314
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,540
You're a piece on his chessboard,

315
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,040
and just a pawn at that.

316
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,840
That's infuriating.

317
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,110
Why a pawn?

318
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,410
I wouldn't even be satisfied
being the queen!

319
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,280
That's my point.
Don't let Jin Tae Seok play you.

320
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,450
Unless you want him
to eat you alive.

321
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,560
If we were to team up,

322
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,760
could we take...

323
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,700
- Jin Tae Seok down?
- Absolutely.

324
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,430
Jin Tae Seok...

325
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,770
is in love with me.

326
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,170
- So?
- And that...

327
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,180
will be his greatest Achilles' heel.

328
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,980
Sounds good.
We'll start with a press release.

329
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,150
I'll handle that, Han Hye Ra.

330
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,050
Right, and I'll do an interview...

331
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,220
that the Kunhyang Association
approves of.

332
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,130
And after that,

333
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,130
hand over the video.

334
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,530
Alright.

335
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,000
We're becoming quite the team.
I love it.

336
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,650
Oh, my! Well, if it isn't CEO Joo.

337
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,250
What brings you to Kunhyang?

338
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,220
I was about to ask
you the same thing.

339
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,020
Especially coming
from the Vice Chairman's Office.

340
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,760
With my sort-of-in-law,
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra,

341
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,530
I just had a little something
to discuss.

342
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,530
"Sort-of-in-law?"

343
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,870
Wait!

344
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,640
Are you on your way
to the Chairman's Office?

345
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,840
That's right. You have to talk
to the one at the very top.

346
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,910
That's how you get things
done quickly.

347
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,650
- I have a meeting.
- Right. See you.

348
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,560
I hope he doesn't mess up this deal
because of Cha Jung Won.

349
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,730
Why did you want to see me alone?

350
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,000
Do you remember...

351
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,200
what I told you before?

352
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,900
Promise...

353
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,500
you'll keep Jung Won safe.

354
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,700
And if I do?

355
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,610
What's in it for me, CEO Joo?

356
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,180
I'll be your most steadfast ally.

357
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,380
And if I refuse?

358
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,180
Then I'll become your most powerful
and terrifying enemy.

359
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,850
I'll keep getting back up,
even if you knock me down,

360
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,850
until I plunge a dagger
through your heart.

361
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,630
But back then,
she was just your fake sister.

362
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,600
So what is Cha Jung Won
to you now, CEO Joo?

363
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,830
She's the woman I love.

364
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,730
I knew you cared for her,

365
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,740
but I didn't realize
your feelings ran deep enough...

366
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,770
for you to say it boldly to my face.

367
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,070
It took me a while
to realize my true feelings.

368
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,540
But...

369
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,180
now I can tell anyone
that I love Jung Won.

370
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,610
Even to Se Hoon?

371
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,150
Yes.

372
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,220
I know better than anyone
what a man feels when he's in love.

373
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,790
So what are you getting at?

374
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,190
Tell me...

375
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,400
if you still want me
to be your ally.

376
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,430
You want me to guarantee
Cha Jung Won's safety.

377
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,170
Yes.

378
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,410
Joo Ha Neul,
you're a very desirable asset.

379
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,980
If you were to become
my steadfast ally,

380
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,910
it would be like gaining
an entire army.

381
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,580
But, you see,

382
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,780
I have a dilemma.

383
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,490
The woman you love is attacking
the woman I love.

384
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,090
And quite viciously at that.

385
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,090
And they're mother and daughter,
no less.

386
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,960
So what choice do you think
I'll make?

387
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,530
Naturally, for my woman, I'd...

388
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,400
What do you think
Vice Chairman Han wants?

389
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,140
- What was that?
- Though her daughter hurts her,

390
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,280
I doubt she'd want her hurt
at your hands, Chairman.

391
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,710
She's suffered for 25 years.

392
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,820
Jung Won even lost her father.

393
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,550
So for a little while,

394
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,750
I'm asking you
to turn a blind eye...

395
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,160
and just take it.

396
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,960
The stock price has dropped.

397
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,430
Vice Chairman Han's position...

398
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,300
has become precarious.

399
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,130
And my reputation is...

400
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,300
As for Vice Chairman Han,

401
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,470
I can help you protect her position.

402
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,740
I'll exercise my five percent stake
in Kunhyang,

403
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,140
I'll vote them however you see fit,
Chairman.

404
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,960
What's troubling you, sweetie?

405
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,390
Tell your Grandma all about it.

406
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,300
Goodness, Grandma.
What's gotten into you?

407
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,260
You never start
a conversation with me.

408
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,270
I know, right?
This Grandma is being nosy.

409
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,370
Chef Hong.

410
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,510
What are you plotting?
Spill it, sweetheart.

411
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,110
Do you recall saying
that witch Han Hye Ra...

412
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,480
was even scarier than me?

413
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,410
That terrifying witch...

414
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,650
wants to team up with me
to take down an even bigger jerk.

415
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,020
She reached out to me.

416
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,660
But I want to take down that witch
at the same time.

417
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,330
Killing two birds with one stone.

418
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,560
Exactly.

419
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,100
Gosh. As if you've ever been
loyal to anyone.

420
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,040
How many people have you backstabbed
after pretending to be an ally?

421
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,870
Right?

422
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,880
That's right. I'm a witch
with no loyal bone in my body.

423
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,810
Except when it comes to you,
of course.

424
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,020
I whipped up something for you.
Enjoy.

425
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,250
All right, let's see here.

426
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,360
This is way too good.

427
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,830
Darn it. I'm only supposed to eat
one meal a day.

428
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,500
So much for that.
Whatever, I'm eating the whole thing.

429
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,240
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

430
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,850
You're here again?

431
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,680
Should I get you a punch card?

432
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,990
You look like you're
in a better mood today.

433
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,420
Perfect timing.
Come on, have a seat.

434
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,600
I have a favor to ask you.

435
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,100
Here, try this.

436
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
What do you think?

437
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
You don't like it?

438
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,320
I'm blown away.

439
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,250
The texture is incredible.

440
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,220
It just melts in your mouth.

441
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,730
My mom was a master
at marinating meat.

442
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,830
I find myself thinking
about it sometimes.

443
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,230
Especially when I think I'll never
taste my mom's cooking again,

444
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,200
It just makes me crave it more.

445
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,600
Then I vaguely remembered
my mom's secret recipe,

446
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,310
so after a lot of trial and error,
I tried to recreate it.

447
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,310
Headquarters is developing
a new menu item,

448
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,980
and I'm thinking of entering this.

449
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,180
- I see.
- And that's how I perfected it.

450
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,990
The key is to age it twice
for two days each time.

451
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,060
That's the secret.

452
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,360
What? Was I rambling?

453
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,500
Mi Hyang.

454
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,270
Of all the times I've seen you,
this is the most...

455
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,130
- The most?
- beautiful you've looked.

456
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,370
My heart just skipped a beat.
This is insane.

457
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,270
Seeing you so full of passion...

458
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,210
puts my mind at ease.

459
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,980
Where is my head?
The dinner rush is about to start.

460
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Please, finish your food.
It's on the house today.

461
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,650
Thank you for the meal.

462
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,770
Young Chae?

463
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,200
What? I was just about to leave.

464
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,800
You still have that thing, right?

465
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,310
The one I gave you before.
Show it to Jin Se Hoon.

466
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,170
You think he'll be happy to see it?

467
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,010
Kunhyang Group is in an uproar
because of Cha Jung Won's article.

468
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,380
That's exactly why it's your time
to make a move.

469
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,120
Your and Jin Se Hoon's story
is perfect...

470
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,250
to bury Cha Jung Won's article.

471
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,360

No, that's not it.
It's just a little strange,

481

and amazing at the same time.

482
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,900
I have a favor to ask you.

483
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,570
You'll do it for me, won't you?

What is it?

485
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,040

is real or not.

If we want to bury the article
Cha Jung Won released,

488
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,150
- we have to be prepared.
- How?

00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,240
So this is how
you're going to flip things around?

524
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,080
Did you see the article?

525
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,650
It's a ploy to change
everyone's attention.

526
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:47,260
I expected something was coming,
but I didn't expect an actual photo.

527
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:50,090
They counterattacked.
We need to strike back.

528
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,560
I've prepared a deadlier arrow,

529
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,400
one they can't escape.

530
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,480
It's almost time to bury
one story with another.

531
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,480
And Han Hye Ra
will come crashing down too.

532
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,890
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

533
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,930
(A Graceful Liar)

534
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,920
You want me to wear a ring
that Cha Jung Won used to wear?

535
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,560
I used to live with Cha Jung Won.

536
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,630
Why let that tramp Cha Jung Won
get to you?

537
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,890
He's disrespecting
Chairman Gong Nan Sook!

538
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,630
How could you
give my Young Chae the ring...

539
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,830
that tramp Cha Jung Won
used to wear?

540
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,970
Did he confess his feelings?

541
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:06,000
Ha Neul is confessing his feelings
to Cha Jung Won today.

542
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,440
You have to get your hands dirty
to win the one you love.

543
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,170
You still like CEO Joo Ha Neul,
don't you?

544
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,180
Break apart...

545
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,850
Cha Jung Won and Ha Neul for me.

546
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,320
