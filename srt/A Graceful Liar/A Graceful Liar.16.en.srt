00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,540
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,910
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,340
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,550
You must be out of your mind.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,510
If you're drunk, go home.

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,520
I'm not the crazy one. You are.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,320
Do you know what kind of woman
she is?

8
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,660
She's dirt poor,

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,690
a part-timer with
a high school diploma,

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,690
and a murderer's daughter,
Cha Jung Won...

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,400
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,700
- You know Young Chae?
- Who are you?

13
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,470
You know Young Chae,
but you don't know who I am?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,540
I'm Young Chae's older brother,
Joo Ha Neul.

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,810
Let go!
This is none of your business!

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,780
This is about my sister.
How is it not my business?

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,420
Ha Neul, I think
there's a misunderstanding.

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,750
- That's enough.
- What do you mean, "enough?"

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,460
We need to teach this punk a lesson
so he won't run his mouth again.

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,160
Outside, now!

21
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,560
Did you get your hooks
into Young Chae's brother, too?

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,400
I'll see who walks down...

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,130
- that aisle with you.
- Get out!

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,470
From a dirt-poor family,

25
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,140
a high-school-educated part-timer,

26
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,810
the daughter of a murderer
has really made it big.

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,140
I wonder who should be
the one walking down the aisle.

28
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,810
It was Noh Min Gu.

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,920
Not Young Chae.

30
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,990
(Episode 16)

31
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,330
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

32
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,600
Why did you bring me here?

33
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
Have a seat.

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,210
- I'm fine standing.
- Suit yourself.

35
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,510
Then you can just stand there
and listen closely.

36
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,680
You're Noh Min Gu, right?

37
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,520
Cha Jung Won's ex-boyfriend.

38
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,920
I don't recall telling you my name.

39
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,560
We have files on everyone
connected to Cha Jung Won.

40
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,530
You have a file on me?

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,890
I have some questions for you.

42
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,540
Have some warm chamomile tea.

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,140
They say it helps with stress.

44
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,940
Thanks.

45
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,110
I'm ready.

46
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,950
Go ahead, ask.

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,720
Who was that jerk earlier?

48
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,990
- Noh Min Gu.
- So you know him?

49
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,300
Besides Park Kyung Shin,

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,470
was there someone else you dated?

51
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Noh Min Gu?

52
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,310
He's not my ex.

53
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,970
He's Cha Jung Won's ex-boyfriend.

54
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,710
Cha Jung Won?
Do you mean Park Kyung Shin's ex?

55
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,150
That's right.

56
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,950
Then why did he come after you?

57
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,390
We just ran into each other
by chance at the restaurant.

58
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,590
It's a place Jung Won and I
frequented when we were dating.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,170
Noh Min Gu was one of the guys
who used to be obsessed with me.

60
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,870
But then he started
dating Cha Jung Won,

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,570
so I remember his face.

62
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,780
I have no idea
why he'd cause a scene like that.

63
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,110
You even know
who her ex-boyfriend is?

64
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,150
Are you interrogating me?

65
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,620
If you don't want to talk about it,
you don't have to.

66
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,390
I don't want to grill you
about your past either.

67
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,590
We were in the same class
in our all-girls high school.

68
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,460
Cha Jung Won and I.

69
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,500
We also went to the same church,

70
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,430
and so did Noh Min Gu.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But Noh Min Gu...

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,340
acted as if you were Cha Jung Won.

73
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,170
No matter how wasted he was,

74
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,840
how could he confuse you with her
when they didn't break up long ago?

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,950
Cha Jung Won...

76
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,580
used to copy everything I did.

77
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,450
Even though she was wearing
fake items,

78
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,120
she would copy my outfits
and hairstyle.

79
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,060
As if that could ever make her me.

80
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,700
People like her are just pathetic.

81
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,430
Some people should just learn
to stay in their own lane.

82
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,270
You're lying.

83
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,740
Did Cha Jung Won dump you?

84
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,240
No. I dumped her.

85
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,510
Then why are you so hung up on her?

86
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,150
Why so much anger?

87
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,420
Because she's posing
as Joo Young Chae...

88
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,490
to marry some conglomerate heir.

89
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,950
So now you think she's the one
that got away?

90
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,460
What are you talking about?
I dumped her.

91
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,390
Then why are you so jealous?

92
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,300
This isn't just about being jealous
because my cousin struck it rich.

93
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,030
This is on a completely
different level.

94
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,070
A dirt-poor nobody like her will
become the wife of a conglomerate,

95
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,510
and she's doing it with a huge lie.

96
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,740
Am I supposed to just let it happen?

97
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,910
It's not a scam.

98
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,780
Excuse me?

99
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,880
Both Chairman Gong and I,
Young Chae's brother, know about it.

100
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,150
How is that a scam?

101
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,020
So the real Joo Young Chae
was just cast aside.

102
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,460
The whole family's in on it.

103
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,760
Have you seen Young Chae?

104
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,700
Where is she right now?

105
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,000
Well...

106
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,430
As for why Noh Min Gu
was so triggered by seeing me,

107
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,000
I really have no idea.

108
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,770
Unless...

109
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,780
Nevermind.

110
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,520
You must be wondering whether
you can really trust this woman...

111
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,680
since she seems to have
quite a history with men.

112
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,020
Look at that. Another mind reader.

113
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,890
Another one?

114
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,430
You mean, Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra?

115
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,910
Se Hoon, look at me.
Right in the eyes.

116
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,640
Who do you see reflected
in my eyes right now?

117
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,780
I can't see anything.

118
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,420
What about my heartbeat?

119
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,160
It's beating really fast.

120
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,260
Whenever I'm with you,

121
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,530
my heart always races like this.

122
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,500
I get so giddy and excited.

123
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,030
You're the only one I see right now.

124
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,640
Why are you so insecure?

125
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,740
Why do you keep doubting me?

126
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,080
Because the more my love
for you grows,

127
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,620
the more I'm afraid you'll run away,

128
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,820
or that I'll lose you
to some other guy.

129
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,660
And it scares me.

130
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,490
You think I'd leave Jin Se Hoon
for another man?

131
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,460
I'd have to be insane.

132
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,540
I asked you where Young Chae was
right now.

133
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,200
How am I supposed to know?

134
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,570
Joo Young Chae and I have nothing
to do with each other.

135
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,080
You'd better be telling the truth.

136
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,680
Because if you're not,

137
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,080
I'll be the one to finish you off...

138
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,520
before Chairman Gong,
who treats human life as worthless,

139
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,290
decides to step in.

140
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,860
Why are you going to such lengths?

141
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,900
What's so special
about Cha Jung Won?

142
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,200
The real Young Chae is out there,

143
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,230
so why are you protecting Cha Jung Won,
who is an imposter?

144
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,700
I ask myself the same question.

145
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,410
What is it about Cha Jung Won?

146
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,650
For Chairman Gong,

147
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,080
business is more important
than her own daughter.

148
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,220
But what about me?

149
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,990
Cha Jung Won is like a clown
on a tightrope,

150
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,090
and I can't just stand by
and watch her teeter on the edge.

151
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,090
If I, the one who knows her secret,
don't stand by her,

152
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,130
then who will?

153
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,130
I must be out of my mind.

154
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,980
What is this?
These are leftovers from last night.

155
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,920
I wasn't expecting a feast,
but where's the crab and short ribs?

156
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,420
- You can have them tomorrow night.
- Are you kidding me?

157
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,990
I want them now.

158
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,120
Just hurry up and eat what's served.

159
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,290
Darn it.

160
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,100
Wait. Are the kids coming over?

161
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Just eat.

162
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,870
I see.

163
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,170
Mi Hyang.

164
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,440
Is that ginseng wine
from last spring still around?

165
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,680
I drank it all.

166
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,150
- What's gotten into you?
- I'm just kidding.

167
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,280
Come on...

168
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,450
(Kunhyang Group)

169
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,260
Cha Jung Won is
Jo Mi Hyang's daughter?

170
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,360
Yes. After Cha Ki Beom was released
and married Jo Mi Hyang,

171
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,870
that's when she was registered
as Cha Jung Won.

172
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,470
If my Su A were still alive,

173
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,040
she'd be the same age as Jung Won.

174
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,310
From the way Cha Jung Won dresses
and carries herself,

175
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,020
I thought she came from
a well-to-do family.

176
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,290
Also, she's a sophomore dropout...

177
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,020
from Hangang University's
fashion program.

178
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,590
She graduated from
the fashion department.

179
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,960
Her family seemed to be
quite well-off.

180
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,930
My daughter-in-law
wouldn't have lied to me.

181
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,970
Did you look into the link between
Joo Young Chae and Cha Jung Won?

182
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Yes.
We found they were best friends.

183
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,680
And they were both in love
with Park Kyung Shin?

184
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,480
Cha Jung Won wasn't linked to him.

185
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,680
In fact...

186
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,880
In fact?

187
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,050
It seems she was dating Noh Min Gu,
who caused the restaurant scene.

188
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,560
Why would Noh Min Gu,
who is Cha Jung Won's ex-boyfriend,

189
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,090
show up and harass my son
and daughter-in-law on their date?

190
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,030
To be honest, that's what
I don't understand either.

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,700
It's understandable
why Park Kyung Shin liked her.

192
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
If they're together,

193
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,610
it would not be kidnapping.
They would've run away for love.

194
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,580
My daughter-in-law, Joo Young Chae,

195
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,950
and Jo Mi Hyang's daughter,
Cha Jung Won.

196
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,850
And mixed up between them
are Park Kyung Shin and Noh Min Gu?

197
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,350
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

198
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,630
I'm...

199
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,570
the man who once promised
to marry this woman.

200
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,410
Is he blind? How could he not
recognize his own ex-girlfriend?

201
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,520
What do you mean, why?
I just want to see you.

202
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,060
He still hasn't outgrown
his childish hobbies?

203
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Bravo.

204
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,150
- Do you want to give it a try?
- And if I win?

205
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,220
Will you do me a favor?

206
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,860
What if you fail?
Then I don't have to do it?

207
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,600
The word "failure"
isn't in my vocabulary.

208
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,840
I should get going.
My lunch break is over.

209
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,350
Wait a second.

210
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,410
I'm not done yet.

211
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,090
Can I borrow one dollar?

212
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,960
Come on, hurry up!

213
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,250
- Yes! I got it!
- Bravo.

214
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,350
For stress relief,

215
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,420
it's the best.

216
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,120
Congratulations.

217
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,160
Here you go. A gift.

218
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,370
Give this to your fiancée.

219
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,140
Women find a man
who can win at a claw machine...

220
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,470
very charming.

221
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Really?

222
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,980
What's the favor you need?

223
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,890
There's a guy
I need to know more about.

224
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,690
I need you to look into him
for me, mister.

225
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,430
"Mister?" I'm not even married.

226
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,900
I'm officially offended.

227
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,400
Mister.

228
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,770
I meant "brother." Please.

229
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,410
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

230
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,010
Se Hoon asked you for a favor?

231
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,210
Noh Min Gu?

232
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,740
He's Cha Jung Won's ex-boyfriend,

233
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,950
and Cha Jung Won is friends
with your future daughter-in-law.

234
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,950
- The guy from the restaurant scene?
- Yes, that's him.

235
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,750
I've been curious about him myself.

236
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,820
Something about Noh Min Gu mistaking
Joo Young Chae for his ex feels off.

237
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,230
- Find out what his game is.
- I'm on it.

238
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,800
Report directly to me first.

239
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,230
And the fact that
I know about this...

240
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,000
must be kept from Vice Chairman Han.

241
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,030
Understood.

242
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,340
(Suspected Voice Synthesis:
98 Percent)

243
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,380
(Traces of Synthesis Detected)

244
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,320
Jin Se Hoon is totally my type.

245
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,860
I'll put an end to your game
of pretend soon.

246
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,430
Wait.

247
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,700
So, it was Noh Min Gu.

248
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,270
Noh Min Gu?

249
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Your ex-boyfriend?

250
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,370
Yes.

251
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:06,410
Why would Noh Min Gu impersonate
Young Chae with a voice changer?

252
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,580
He must've seen my face in articles
about my marriage to Jin Se Hoon...

253
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,250
and realized I was impersonating
Young Chae.

254
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,720
He might have approached me
with an ulterior motive.

255
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,290
Like blackmailing you for money.

256
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,760
No, that can't be it.

257
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,130
If he were after money
from the start,

258
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,830
he would've come to me for a deal.

259
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,360
Why put on such a show?

260
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,230
That's what I don't get either.

261
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,230
He used Young Chae's voice,

262
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,140
especially
when Park Kyung Shin disappeared.

263
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,540
Don't you think...

264
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,270
Noh Min Gu has Park Kyung Shin now?

265
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,410
As of now,
we can't rule out that possibility.

266
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,640
Why?

267
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,250
But I have nothing to do
with Park Kyung Shin.

268
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,320
Then why did you let Noh Min Gu go?

269
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,620
If he can use a voice modulator,
he's capable of much worse.

270
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,490
Young Chae and Noh Min Gu
know each other, too.

271
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,930
I only spoke to him for a moment,

272
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,360
but it seemed that he had
something to do with Young Chae.

273
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,060
This is giving me a headache.

274
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,570
So, the one
holding Park Kyung Shin...

275
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,600
is it Young Chae or Noh Min Gu?

276
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,570
Who are you?

277
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,410
Who are you to kidnap me like this?

278
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,270
Did Chairman Gong Nan Sook
put you up to this?

279
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,010
Did she really tell you to dump me
into the Han River?

280
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,310
Hey, eat up
while you have the chance.

281
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,810
Are you trying to starve me
to death?

282
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,920
It's not my call.

283
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,820
I'm being forced to do this.

284
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,620
What are you talking about?

285
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,360
Because you and I
are in the same boat.

286
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,860
This is so annoying. Darn it.

287
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,170
Just tell me what your game is!
Who are you?

288
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,670
You're so loud.

289
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,670
Hey.

290
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,750
Just be quiet, will you?

291
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,280
You're really starting
to piss me off.

292
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,050
Hey! Will you just be quiet!
Come on.

293
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,260
Here. Drink.

294
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,970
You shouldn't have
let Noh Min Gu go.

295
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,840
And if I hadn't?

296
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,480
Was I supposed to waterboard him
like my mother?

297
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,550
Park Kyung Shin was waterboarded?
By Chairman Gong?

298
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,680
Let my mother find Noh Min Gu.
She'll handle it.

299
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,790
What about Young Chae?

300
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,390
She'll either get found,
or she'll come back on her own.

301
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,600
There's something else
we need to deal with.

302
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,600
Your father.

303
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,200
My dad? What about him?

304
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,240
Jo Mi Hyang wants me to tell him
that I'm the one...

305
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,680
who you're marrying, not Se Hoon.

306
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,250
They invited us to dinner tonight.

307
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,050
What do you want to do?

308
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,690
Please, meet with my dad.

309
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,310
If you'd prefer
the vice chairman's office,

310
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,980
should we switch offices?

311
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:03,210
If we did that, I'd just grow
to like the new office.

312
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,480
It's not about the room.
It's about who's in it.

313
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,790
Seriously...

314
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,320
I admit it. I'm whipped.

315
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,160
So, what's on your mind?

316
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,630
It's about Se Hoon.

317
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,400
It seems like he doesn't
completely trust his fiancée.

318
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,770
First Park Kyung Shin,
and now this Noh Min Gu.

319
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,470
You know about this too?
How did you find out so quickly?

320
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,340
We're talking about our son here.

321
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,710
If I don't look out for him,
who will?

322
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,920
You dote on Se Hoon so much.

323
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,380
Some of the executives
were saying...

324
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,820
they thought he was your son
from a previous relationship.

325
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,390
Se Hoon must be worried sick
these days...

326
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,500
because of all the drama
surrounding his fiancée.

327
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,500
Then I guess we should find out
what's causing all the drama.

328
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,440
This feels good.

329
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,780
You always seem so calm and serene,

330
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,950
but do you get stressed out often?

331
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,480
Do you know the saying,
"Life is suffering?"

332
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,650
Do you think I'm exempt?

333
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,990
If your life is suffering,

334
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,660
then life must be torment
for the rest of us.

335
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,370
Do I...

336
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,270
seem happy to you?

337
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,670
Yes.

338
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,610
You have it all.

339
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,020
You are the one who has it all,

340
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,060
so why do you look so unfulfilled?

341
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,800
I feel alive again.

342
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,000
I was absolutely parched.

343
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,010
Shaved ice in late autumn.

344
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,410
You have unique taste.

345
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,440
So do you, Mother.

346
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,310
And why is that?

347
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,220
Because you like me.

348
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,350
And what's not to like?

349
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,350
I'm fickle,

350
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,820
secretly mean,

351
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,690
and selfish.

352
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,930
You're the complete opposite.

353
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,200
You're steadfast, openly kind,

354
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,030
and exceptionally considerate.

355
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,240
When I'm with you,
you make me feel so special.

356
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,950
I heard you two were best friends
in high school,

357
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,020
you and Cha Jung Won.

358
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,430
Did you run a background check?

359
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,370
Because Cha Jung Won is most likely
the one hiding Park Kyung Shin.

360
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,270
You heard we were best friends?

361
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,410
Jung Won and I?

362
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,610
You weren't?

363
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,280
That might be how it looked
to others.

364
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,090
But...

365
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,820
it was a toxic relationship.

366
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,290
Toxic?

367
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,070
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

368
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,170
Who dares sit in my chair?

369
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,270
Is anyone sane enough to do this?

370
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
Young Chae!

371
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,210
Is it so strange for your daughter
to be sitting in your chair?

372
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,720
I think it suits me.

373
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,750
How dare you? Get up, now.

374
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,220
It's so comfortable, I'm not moving.
Whatever will I do?

375
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,430
Besides, it's not the first time
I've been a brat.

376
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,960
Stop fooling around...

377
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,560
and tell me what on earth
you've been doing.

378
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,130
Did you kidnap Park Kyung Shin?

379
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Kidnap?

380
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,040
Is this funny?

381
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,300
Isn't it funny?

382
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,240
- Why would I kidnap a man I loved?
- "Loved?"

383
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,010
You're sure that's in the past?

384
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,450
You brat. You're still in love
with that jerk, aren't you?

385
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,120
That's why you're so resentful
and can't forgive him.

386
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,450
Was Dad like that too?

387
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,490
Your love was still present tense,
but his for you was past tense?

388
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,290
Is that why you were so resentful
and couldn't forgive him?

389
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,400
So you drowned him?

390
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,170
Don't you cross the line.

391
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,740
I have to claim my place.

392
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,450
Cha Jung Won...

393
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,860
would imitate everything you had...

394
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,690
and wanted it all for herself?

395
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,330
Even your men?

396
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,930
That's right.

397
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,300
Park Kyung Shin too?

398
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,700
What about Noh Min Gu?

399
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,240
Are you suggesting something
between me and Noh Min Gu?

400
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,980
Not suggesting.

401
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,180
I'm just curious.

402
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,450
Why do you look at me like that?

403
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,020
It's just that the time I spent
with you...

404
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,030
always felt like a blessing
I was grateful for.

405
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,000
You taught me...

406
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,630
what warmth, kindness, and comfort
are like,

407
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,940
which I never got
from my own mother.

408
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,780
I understand why you're curious.

409
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,110
I really do.

410
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,210
But...

411
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,350
it's upsetting,

412
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,690
and it hurts.

413
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,530
I can't stand watching Cha Jung Won
impersonating me anymore.

414
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,970
She has the nerve to marry
Jin Se Hoon of Kunhyang Group.

415
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,000
Once you get your place back,
then what?

416
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,740
Then what? Jung Won,
who's clawing her way to the top,

417
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,180
will just go back to being
a laundromat owner's daughter.

418
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,510
And...

419
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,550
I'll go back
to being Joo Young Chae.

420
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,550
No, it's...

421
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,120
It's not that simple, Young Chae.

422
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,620
I want to live as myself.
What more is there to it?

423
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,390
If I want to,

424
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,400
I can be your daughter again. Right?

425
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,130
My poor girl. You look so stressed.

426
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,240
You look completely worn out.

427
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,640
Cut the act.

428
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:12,140
I'm your mother. I'm just worried.
How can you say I'm acting?

429
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,240
Why would you say such a thing?

430
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,580
Why?

431
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,650
You're asking me why?

432
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,280
Take him away!

433
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,380
Come with me quietly.

434
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,090
Help me! Jung Won!

435
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,420
What do you mean, Jung Won?
Who's Jung Won?

436
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,690
That's Young Chae.
My daughter, Joo Young Chae.

437
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,560
Am I really your daughter, Mom?

438
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,300
Or does Jung Won,
the one who's pretending,

439
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,130
seem more like a real daughter
to you?

440
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,970
Come on.

441
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,400
Even if the earth split apart
and the sun rose in the west,

442
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,010
you're still my only daughter.

443
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,210
- It's just that...
- Just what?

444
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,940
The timing just isn't right.

445
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,880
When will the timing be right?

446
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:53,250
Just one year! Okay? No, wait.

447
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,920
Fine, just wait six more months.

448
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,750
What could possibly take that long?

449
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,190
The wedding gift is
a three percent stake in Kunhyang.

450
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,400
Do you know what that means?

451
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,360
With the shares Ha Neul has...

452
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,030
plus the shares Jung Won
will bring in under your name,

453
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,370
I'll become
Kunhyang's largest shareholder.

454
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,510
Darn it...

455
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,010
So stock is more important to you
than your own daughter?

456
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,750
Do you even know how pathetically
I'm living right now?

457
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,520
Of course I know! I'm your mother!

458
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,590
I'll give you plenty of money.

459
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,960
Why don't you go back to Milan?

460
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,830
You can start your fashion studies.

461
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,860
You can even have that fashion show!

462
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,100
I'll back you up
with everything I have.

463
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Really?

464
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,300
I mean it!

(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

466
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,610
I'm hungry.

467
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
I'm craving a filet mignon
from Kunhyang Hotel.

468
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,750
Anywhere but Kunhyang!

469
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,790
That's right.
I'm still Cha Jung Won, aren't I?

470
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,730
Cha Jung Won?
What are you talking about?

471
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,130
It's just a thing.

472
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,700
A very amusing little game of lies.

473
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,770
What are you plotting now?

474
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,540
You're the one holding
Park Kyung Shin, right?

475
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,510
Park Kyung Shin?

476
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,380
Who's that?

477
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,910
Mom, you know me.

478
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,680
I have the memory of a goldfish.

479
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,250
I forget everything
in three seconds.

480
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,420
Don't go to the hotel.
Go stay at the villa in Yangpyeong.

481
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,920
I'm booking you a flight
for the first thing tomorrow morning,

482
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,130
so be at the airport on time.
Got it?

483
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,000
Okay.

484
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,630
What a headache.

485

Oh my...

490

What do you think you're doing here?

491
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,830
I thought we agreed to never see
each other again.

492
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,130
How dare you show your face here?

493
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,130
Cha Jung Won.

494
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,830
Is she your daughter, Mi Hyang?

(A Graceful Liar)

496
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,970
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
is at my house?

497
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,500
Why would Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
show up here?

498
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,840
That vixen said she wanted
to see Jung Won.

499
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,540
It looks like she's going to find
Park Kyung Shin herself.

500
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,910
I was wrong.

501
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,380
Please, just let me go.

502
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,680
Fine. If you insist,
I'll let you go.

503
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,810
For good.

504
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,480
It's strange that I have to ring
to come into my house.

505
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,090
Did you get Noh Min Gu to sneak
Park Kyung Shin out?

506
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,960
Two men who know who you really are.

507
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,720
I made them vanish without a trace.

508
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,090
Stop it.
You're giving me the creeps.

509
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,800
The creeps?

510
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,600
You're the one who's really creepy,
Cha Jung Won.
