1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,540
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,340
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,250
I see someone
holding their ground all alone.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,150
Holding their ground?

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,860
It means they refuse to fall.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,870
They hold a sword,
but they don't brandish it.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,840
They only move
when they know where to strike.

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,970
So I'll have a clear target?

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,150
(Kunhyang Group)

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,610
(Episode 80)

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,150
He should be here by now.

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Jin Tae Seok.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,390
How are you here?

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,060
Get up. Now!

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,070
Do you know who locked me up?

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,740
No, wait.

18
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,440
Joo Ha Neul, you were in on it
with Cha Jung Won, weren't you?

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,980
Jung Won locked you up?

20
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,850
I thought you two were in love.

21
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,250
So without you even knowing,

22
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,650
Cha Jung Won
pulled that cute little stunt?

23
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,520
If she hadn't, I would have.

24
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,490
Jin Tae Seok.

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,760
You're finished.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Finished?

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,570
You still have no idea
who you're dealing with.

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,040
Then how did you get out?
You said you were imprisoned.

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Why would you take the poison?

30
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,090
Do you have any idea
how worried I was?

31
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,120
I thought I was going to have
a heart attack.

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,660
I'm glad you're safe.

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,500
I just can't understand you.

34
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,730
Even knowing she's your daughter,

35
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,600
how could you bring yourself
to want to kill her?

36
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,410
She's our child.

37
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,310
What's so shameful about it?

38
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,450
Even if she is our daughter,

39
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,250
- I can't stand her.
- I thought it'd be our last memory.

40
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,520
So the fruit of our affair
is a disgrace?

41
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,560
- So you're saying I'm the disgrace?
- No.

42
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,560
If that were the case,

43
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,730
I wouldn't have left Se Hoon's mom
to be with you.

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,130
Then why?

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,930
Why can't you stand Jung Won?

46
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,670
So much that you want to kill her!

47
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,170
Because she's an illegitimate child!

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,440
On top of that,

49
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,710
she posed as my daughter-in-law
for her so-called revenge.

50
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,810
It's despicable.

51
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,510
It's an insult to Kunhyang,

52
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,880
and she's an unimaginable piece
of filth.

53
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,760
What are you doing to me?

54
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,660
Hye Ra.

55
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,600
How could you drive me
to such despair!

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,540
No, you're my shame
and the pile of filth!

57
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,370
I regret abandoning...

58
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,210
Ki Beom and Su A
because of my ambition.

59
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,410
It's driving me insane!

60
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,380
Se Mi is the only child we need.

61
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,050
We're better off...

62
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,890
without a piece of worthless trash
like Cha Jung Won.

63
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,120
Then I have no other choice.

64
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,060
Either I kill you
with my own two hands,

65
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,460
or...

66
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,500
I'll die a miserable death
right in front of you.

67
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,930
Don't, Hye Ra.

68
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,800
I'm as good as dead without you.

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,940
No.

70
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,040
Then let's just die together.
That should solve it!

71
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,780
Don't do this, Hye Ra.

72
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,850
You wanted me too.
You still love me, don't you?

73
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,350
A devil like you.

74
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,020
I may have wanted you,

75
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,720
but I have never loved you,
not for a single moment.

76
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,500
Han Hye Ra. How dare you!

77
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,830
Go on.

78
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Go ahead.

79
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,270
Kill me. Get it over with.

80
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,170
Kill me!

81
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,280
What have I done?

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,670
Did you sleep well?

83
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,070
Hye Ra.

84
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,540
What happened?

85
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,740
They say just one pill...

86
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,110
can kill you instantly.

87
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,490
In my purse, the dressing room,

88
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,700
and even inside your pillow,

89
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,300
I've hidden this poison...

90
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,370
in every nook and cranny.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why...

92
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,210
would you do something like that?

93
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,180
If you ever try
to kill my Jung Won again,

94
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,480
I won't hesitate to put it
in your food, tea, or water.

95
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,680
- I'll slip this poison in.
- What?

96
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,050
You're joking.

97
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,390
- Don't mess with me.
- Want to find out?

98
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,900
Go on. Drink it.

99
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,530
See what happens.

100
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,640
Or should I?

101
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,810
I told you to stop playing games!

102
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,830
It seems to be quite effective,
doesn't it?

103
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,780
That conniving witch, Cha Jung Won,
locked me up, but Hye Ra freed me.

104
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,210
Hye Ra loves me.

105
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,750
Chairman Han let you out?

106
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,920
That's right.
I'm back from the dead.

107
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,890
I'm back on top
of the Kunhyang Group.

108
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,420
- Turn yourself in!
- Don't make me laugh.

109
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,060
I'm just getting started.

110
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,590
Jin Tae Seok doesn't die.

111
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm immortal.

112
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,800
What do you think you're doing?

113
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,070
We're at the office!

114
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,670
- He's the honorary chairman.
- He's nothing but a criminal.

115
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,240
We need to expose exactly
what he's done wrong.

116
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,610
You're not a judge,
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul.

117
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,950
What's important right now...

118
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,220
is keeping
the company running smoothly.

119
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,890
The board meeting is in 30 minutes,
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul.

120
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,960
- You'd better hurry.
- I'm not letting this go.

121
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,900
I will make you pay
for your crimes, Jin Tae Seok.

122
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,800
He was given way too much power.

123
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,010
How did you get out?

124
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,020
Did you have a good time today?

125
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,260
Stop staring.
You'll burn a hole through my face.

126
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Because I just can't get enough
of looking at you.

127
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,770
In front of Jin Tae Seok,

128
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,270
you were being harsh on me
on purpose, weren't you?

129
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,300
To protect me.

130
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,410
I wanted to touch you and hold you.

131
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,250
I wanted to make up
for all your years of pain.

132
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,050
I'll make it up to you for life
and help you forget the pain.

133
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,290
But there's still something
we have to do.

134
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,060
We need to make
Chairman Jin Tae Seok pay.

135
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,760
And Chairman Gong Nan Sook, too.

136
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,430
Jung Won, don't worry about that.
I'll take care of it all.

137
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,670
I'll fire the arrow
and wield the blade myself.

138
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,710
Let me do it.

139
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,240
I don't want you to suffer
and get hurt more...

140
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,050
by sacrificing yourself
to be my shield.

141
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,120
Someone broke Jin Tae Seok out.
We have to find him.

142
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,450
I'm the one who let him out.

143
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,890
What was it you said, Se Hoon?

144
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,330
If you were to disappear forever,

145
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,200
- What did you say?
- I'd instantly become chairman.

146
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,700
I fail to see any reason
why I should help you.

147
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,110
I'm your father.

148
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,170
That reason alone...

149
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,140
is more than enough for you
to get me out of here.

150
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,750
Did you forget what you taught me
since I was a kid?

151
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,590
"The greatest danger in business
is personal feelings."

152
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,520
"And be most wary
of your own blood."

153
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,190
Then, I'll make you an offer,
just as I taught you.

154
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,830
Are you talking
about the Swiss bank account again?

155
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,640
So that account was real?

156
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,840
Why don't you check and see
for yourself?

157
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
What's the password?

158
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,710
Come on.

159
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,650
- Let's do this how I taught you.
- What is it you want?

160
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,820
Prove to me that you have
what it takes.

161
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,420
Cha Jung Won.

162
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,790
Get rid of her
with your own two hands.

163
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,990
How could you just let
Jin Tae Seok go?

164
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,500
Reporting him or locking him up
isn't enough to stop Jin Tae Seok.

165
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,470
He's too much for me
to handle alone.

166
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,040
So that's why you need
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's help?

167
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,480
Only until we take
Jin Tae Seok down for good.

168
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,180
But what if those two team up again?

169
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,380
Are you so sure
you won't get backstabbed, Mom?

170
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,190
I've wanted to hear you...

171
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,790
call me "Mom" for so long.

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,730
I've wanted to call you that, too.

173
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,440
Why does it have to be now,
of all times,

174
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,040
when we're forced
to walk on thin ice?

175
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,610
Why can't we just be at peace
and simply be happy?

176
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,550
It breaks my heart.

177
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,190
I'm the one who'll protect you, Mom.

178
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,450
I'd risk my life for it.

179
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,590
I can't tell who's the mother
and who's the daughter.

180
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,870
He should be here by now.

181
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,100
Were you expecting someone?

182
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,170
Here you go.

183
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,810
I made it myself.

184
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,910
You made this yourself,
Chairman Han?

185
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,780
- Go on, try it. It's to die for.
- Han Hye Ra's bean sprout soup...

186
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,220
- with small octopus.
- With small octopus.

187
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,700
Oh my, this broth is...

188
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
It's exactly the same.

189
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,870
It tastes just like I remember.

190
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,340
I can't believe
this day has finally come.

191
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,480
Looks like Chairman Han...

192
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,550
is such a softie.

193
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,650
I guess I am.

194
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,570
I can only imagine
how harsh and cold the path...

195
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,970
this mother and daughter must walk
will be.

196
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,510
It pains me just to think about it.

197
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,850
But spring always follows winter.

198
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,360
Spring is bound to come.

199
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,190
I wish I could tell them that.

200
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,870
(Kunhyang Group)

201
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,170
Prove to me that you have
what it takes.

202
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Cha Jung Won.

203
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,910
Get rid of her
with your own two hands.

204
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,080
He wants me to get rid of Jung Won?

205
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,950
Cha Jung Won and I are now over.

206
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,390
"Now?"

207
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,820
It's been over for ages!

208
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,030
- What are you doing here?
- I thought we'd go home together.

209
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Do you want to eat out?

210
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,670
Sure, whatever.

211
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,840
What is it?
Is something on your mind?

212
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,940
Are you shutting me out again?

213
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,610
Give it a rest.
I just have a lot on my mind.

214
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,620
So, what's my Young Chae craving?

215
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,320
"My Young Chae?"

216
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,890
Sushi from the Kunhyang Hotel.

217
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,730
All right, let's go.

218
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,170
What?
Jin Tae Seok was actually released?

219
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,340
Cha Jung Won had him locked up,

220
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,410
and Han Hye Ra let him out?

221
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,510
All right. Keep me posted.

222
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,320
What in the world is going on?
Has Han Hye Ra lost her mind?

223
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,880
What is this? She's picking
her husband over her daughter?

224
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,450
No, that can't be it.

225
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,660
Love him or hate him,
a husband always comes first.

226
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,790
But what would you know about that?

227
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,560
It's been over 25 years...

228
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,570
since you've been living all alone,
hasn't it?

229
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,670
You son of a...

230
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,940
Grandma was spot-on. She said
the vilest man would be back,

231
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,440
and the first thing you do
is come here to rub it in my face?

232
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,210
I should've drowned you back then.
Darn it.

233
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,380
Gong Nan Sook.

234
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,720
How dare you?

235
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,690
Did you really mean to kill me?

236
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,290
If I had wanted you dead,
I would have crushed you that day.

237
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,530
Why would I have let you go?

238
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,830
I was sizing you up
just to see how tough you were.

239
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Why size me up?

240
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,940
- You should've just killed me.
- Stay out of this!

241
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,210
Chairman Gong, it's an unfair fight.
You're guaranteed to lose...

242
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,280
Hey! I said stay out of it.

243
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,780
Jin Tae Seok!

244
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,590
Why do you keep showing your face?

245
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,060
- Do you have a death wish?
- Joo Ha Neul.

246
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,760
You've got a lot of nerve,
don't you?

247
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,030
First thing you do when you see me
is grab my collar and throw a punch?

248
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,530
Gong Nan Sook,
get this punk off of me now.

249
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,830
"Get him off you?" Are you kidding?
This is highly entertaining.

250
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,870
Where else in the world would I
ever see a spectacle like this?

251
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,740
Ha Neul!
Beat him as much as you like!

252
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,610
I'll take care of the consequences.

253
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,740
What? This mother-son duo...

254
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,350
Father!
Ha Neul, have you lost your mind?

255
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,820
Hey! Whose side are you on?
You ungrateful brat!

256
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,460
Here.

257
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,830
Seriously, what a mess.

258
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,800
Here. Drink up.

259
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,340
That will make you feel better.

260
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,750
Was it that hard for you
to watch me...

261
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,320
almost get strangled to death
by Jin Tae Seok?

262
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,090
Why on earth would you
let him do that to you?

263
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,260
You two were thick as thieves,
doing terrible things together,

264
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,490
and now you're suddenly
at each other's throats?

265
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,730
Because Jin Tae Seok
dared to lay a hand on my son...

266
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,500
- right in front of my eyes...
- I just can't understand you.

267
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,540
Why are you even trying
to understand me?

268
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,240
To me, you're...

269
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,970
How should I put this?

270
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,950
You're the last tiny speck
of my heart's remains...

271
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,550
- A scrap of my heart. That's you.
- Why?

272
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,550
But you're not even my real mother.

273
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,660
I know, right?
I've always wondered that myself.

274
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,990
Why I care about you so much.

275
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,200
Maybe we were mother and son
in a past life?

276
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,970
So don't you go thinking
your body is all yours.

277
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,440
Don't get sick, and don't get hurt.
And when it comes to beer,

278
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,970
you have to chug it
for it to taste good.

279
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,980
Here.

280
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,980
You drink this one, too.

281
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
Oh my.

282
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,400
You love Ha Neul more than me,
don't you, Mom?

283
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,130
- You want me to change your diaper?
- What?

284
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,940
Or should I nurse you?

285
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,670
How old are you?
Stop acting like such a baby.

286
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,810
Honestly, you're past 30 asking,
"Do you like him more, or me more?"

287
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,740
- You're my stepmom, aren't you?
- What? You little brat!

288
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:30,750
I knew it! Ha Neul is your real son,
and you just found me, right?

289
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,820
There's no other explanation.

290
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,790
Come on, where would I find someone
as cute as you just lying around?

291
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,690
If I had,
I would've hit the jackpot.

292
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,230
That's right.
The jackpot of all jackpots.

293
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,330
Around the time you were born,
I was just starting to lend money,

294
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,000
I was so busy
I could barely breathe.

295
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,200
Until you were about three or four,
I had someone else look after you.

296
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,970
- Someone else's care?
- They must be long dead by now.

297
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,010
There's an old saying.

298
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,210
They say parents spend their lives
doting on their children...

299
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,380
because kids are so adorable
before they turn five...

300
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,980
that parents spend their lives
paying off that debt.

301
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,850
So you're saying I wasn't with you
during my most adorable years?

302
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,420
But Ha Neul was?

303
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:17,190
I lived with Ha Neul's father then.
I couldn't have you live with us.

304
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,400
Mom, that's awful.

305
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,630
It's the raising, not the birthing,
that creates the bond.

306
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,330
So you're saying
you have no real affection for me.

307
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,740
Who did you take after
to be so dramatic?

308
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,210
Hey, if I didn't care about you,

309
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,880
I would've kicked you out
a long time ago, you brat.

310
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,740
Forget it.
I'm not talking to you anymore.

311
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,110
I'm done being your daughter.
Just you watch.

312
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,050
What? Hey! Done being my daughter?

313
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,290
When have you ever acted
like my daughter?

314
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,720
It's her loss, seriously.

315
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,860
Hey, Manager Gu. Are you crying?

316
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,030
Is Young Chae your daughter?
Why are you crying? Stop it!

317
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,530
Yes, ma'am.

318
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,250
Why are you all staring
at me like that?

319
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,880
Are you moved to see your dad's face
for the first time in a while?

320
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,390
I was worried, Dad.
I thought something happened to you.

321
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,460
Well, look at that.

322
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,490
Looks like my Se Mi is the only one
who's genuinely worried about me.

323
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,530
Will you both be returning
to the group right away?

324
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,900
Of course, we are.

325
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,900
No.

326
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,740
There are still some things
to be taken care of.

327
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,240
The Honorary Chairman
will be staying home.

328
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,370
And what about you, Mother?

329
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:39,740
I had no idea you were so concerned
about the chairman position.

330
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,910
You worry about
the strangest things.

331
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,390
I'm sorry.
You should be enjoying your meal.

332
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,080
Can I sleep with you tonight?

333
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,320
Why?

334
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,280
You and Dad haven't shared a room
in ages...

335
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,690
Is it so you can sleep
with Cha Jung Won?

336
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,820
It's the first time in 25 years,
Se Mi.

337
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,760
Can you please try to understand
how I feel?

338
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
Okay.

339
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,900
Mom, for some reason,
I'm feeling pouty.

340
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,780
You big baby.
She's your older sister,

341
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:52,320
born of the same parents as you.

342
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,220
Is it true?
Is Cha Jung Won Dad's daughter too?

343
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,130
I know it feels awkward
and distant for you now,

344
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,600
but try to close that gap gradually.
Okay?

345
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,560
I'm asking you as your mother.

346
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,450
I'll let you borrow my mom for a bit
Jung Won.

347
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,190
So, are you going to keep treating
me like your sister at home?

348
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,550
We'll see.

349
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,870
(Kunhyang Group)

350
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,710
So, you're getting on with Jung Won,
Se Mi.

351
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,410
Is there any reason I shouldn't?

352
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,280
Do you want Cha Jung Won
to take everything from you?

353
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,620
Your mom and even Ha Neul.

354
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,890
People aren't objects.
You can't take them from someone.

355
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,890
Trust me,
I've had everything taken from me.

356
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,760
My mother, my brother,
and even my sense of self.

357
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,030
You need to wake up, Se Mi.

358
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,200
If you underestimate Cha Jung Won,
you'll get seriously burned.

359
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,140
I'm not a kid anymore.

360
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,470
Is it because of that incident?

361
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,740
Did Cha Jung Won find out
and blackmail you?

362
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,850
- "That incident?"
- The blind hiring process.

363
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,080
Screening applicants by education
in the first round.

364
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,720
I heard that was a decision you made
on your own, right?

365
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,860
And you forged it to look like
the Vice Chairman's directive.

366
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,520
Forged it?

367
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,490
The Vice Chairman took the fall
so you wouldn't get hurt.

368
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,960
- Am I wrong?
- It's not that...

369
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,830
Don't worry.

370
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,400
Se Hoon and I will protect you.

371
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,010
I'll take this secret to my grave.

372
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,740
So you need to be on my side.

373
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,510
Your side?

374
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,080
I need to be the team leader
of Design Team again.

375
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,960
Let's be honest,
you don't have the skills, do you?

376
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,260
Once I'm team leader again,

377
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,830
I'll fill the team with designers
from top universities.

378
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,730
Then they'll be able to churn out
as many designs as are required.

379
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,640
All you and I have to do
is manage and supervise them.

380
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,010
Let's just do things
the way we always have.

381
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,240
Keep graduates
from non-top universities...

382
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,480
out of Kunhyang Group.

383
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,050
That's how it should be.

384
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,820
Having a secret meeting?
Just the two of you?

385
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,490
Let's break for lunch.

386
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,900
Why Han Hye Ra, I mean,

387
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,660
why my mom treated me
the way she did,

388
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,870
I think I'm starting to understand
a little.

389
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,470
She drank poison for you.

390
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:37,340
That's what only a parent would do
for their child.

391
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,880
I'm glad you and Chairman Han
have cleared things up,

392
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,140
after everything
you two have been through.

393
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,850
But it's not over yet.

394
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,250
Right.

395
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,790
Jin Tae Seok is still out there.

396
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,560
- He's not one to go down easy.
- What we do now matters most.

397
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,660
This won't do.
I'll take matters into my own hands.

398
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,630
What's he doing here again?

399
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,940
Mom, why are you being so rude
to Manager Hwang?

400
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,570
I asked him to come.
I thought he could help us.

401
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,510
- I'll do anything I can to help.
- Forget it! Tell him to get out.

402
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,210
I have a right to know
what's going on.

403
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,350
I'll tell you. Let's go on ahead.

404
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,660
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

405
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,100
I'll do anything to help.

406
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,970
Just say the word.

407
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,510
You'll really do anything I ask?

408
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,440
- Yes.
- Then kidnap Jin Tae Seok for me.

409
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,680
I've already done that.

410
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,380
- He was released a short while ago.
- So?

411
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,050
Then bring him here right now.

412
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,560
I don't think he'll be
coming back here.

413
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,130
- Why?
- After how you treated him...

414
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,690
Was he scared of a little tofu?

415
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,130
Fine, then I'll go to him.

416
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,370
Ms. Jo.

417
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,740
Her birth mother risked her life
to protect her,

418
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,070
so the mother who raised her needs
to see this through to the end.

419
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,110
So that's what happened
to Mi Hyang Mom.

420
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,180
I remember living with her daughter.

421
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,550
It's all my fault.

422
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,690
Her losing her daughter, I mean.

423
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,330
Why would you think that?

424
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,200
Don't you ever blame yourself
for anything again.

425
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,510
It's all on Jin Tae Seok,
to be more precise.

426
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,410
Jin Tae Seok.

427
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,910
Is there any limit
to what he will do?

428
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,880
There's no end to his evil.

429
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,320
He feels no guilt or remorse.

430
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,160
Does he even have a heart?

431
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,830
He's a man devoid of all emotion.

432
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,530
Han Hye Ra.

433
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,070
But his love for my mother
is almost excessive.

434
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,430
That's not love.

435
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,300
It's an obsession...

436
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,700
and a twisted sense
of possessiveness.

437
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,180
Vice President Jin Se Hoon?
What's the occasion?

438
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,260
That punk.
He used an alias to sneak in here.

439
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,900
Are you going to tell me
Kunhyang's stock dropped again?

440
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,530
No.

441
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,600
A new name just appeared
on the list of major shareholders.

442
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
David Kay.

443
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,270
A foreign investor?

444
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,610
On the surface.

445
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,040
He's a guy who operates quietly
out of The Crown Capital.

446
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,780
You stare at these things all day,
so you're bound to imagine things.

447
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,680
He pulls out without a trace
and is never greedy when he buys in.

448
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,650
He always leaves himself some room
to maneuver.

449
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,490
But here's what's
really interesting.

450
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,760
Around the same time,
Joo Ha Neul also...

451
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,100
pulled a pretty sizable stake
from The Crown Capital.

452
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,300
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul?

453
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,730
Joo Ha Neul and David Kay.

454
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,840
Their timing and methods
follow the exact same pattern.

455
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,970
It might just be a coincidence.

456
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,880
That's a calculated move disguised
as a coincidence.

457
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,680
This isn't the time...

458
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,880
to buy Kunhyang stock
just for profit, is it?

459
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,350
Joo Ha Neul is behind David Kay.

460
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,720
He's trying to take over Kunhyang.

461
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,800
He and I care a lot
about each other.

462
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,540
We share a similar pain.

463
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,710
We both lost our fathers unjustly.

464
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,880
Then let's just run away together.

465
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,950
As long as I have you,

466
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,890
I'll give up the Kunhyang family,
Kunhyang Group, and everything.

467
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,620
I came to give this back.

468
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,670
Cha Jung Won.

469
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,930
Fine. With my own two hands,

470
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,570
I'll sever this ill-fated bond.

471
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,880
Why did Se Hoon ask
to meet you here?

472
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,010
He said he has something to tell me
about Jin Tae Seok.

473
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,220
Should I go with you?

474
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,620
If he sees you,
Se Hoon will just act out even more.

475
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,530
And his feelings for me
aren't what they used to be.

476
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,830
But since it's about Jin Tae Seok,
I'm curious, too.

477
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,100
I'll call you right after
I meet him.

478
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,710
(A Graceful Liar)

479
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,500
Jin Tae Seok!
Get out here right now!

480
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,740
Was throwing tofu at me last time
not enough for you?

481
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
You did this to my Jung Won, right?

482
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,140
I'll end this today,
starting with you.

483
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,840
No! I didn't do anything!

484
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,480
You're going to lie to me,
of all people?

485
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,380
It was a mistake.
It was truly an accident.

486
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,850
Did your father order you
to eliminate Jung Won?

487
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,320
If I can't have her,

488
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,650
I'd rather she disappeared
from my life forever.

489
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,890
I admit the thought
has crossed my mind.

490
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,420
I'll deal with Jin Tae Seok.

491
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,890
I'll pass judgment on him
and then I'll pay for my sins.

492
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,490
