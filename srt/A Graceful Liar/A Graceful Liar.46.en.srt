1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,610
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,970
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,040
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,390
Young Chae was always so kind,
affectionate, and thoughtful.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,620
Why would she portray me like this?

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,530
How could she come
to hate me so much?

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,560
(My Daughter-in-law)

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,300
What's this about?

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,270
If that accident hadn't happened,
were you...

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,410
really going to come and get Su A?

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,280
Why are you asking the obvious?

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,150
Then why didn't you recognize her?

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,450
Su A.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,090
Why are you calling me this late
to ask something like that?

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,560
Only Su A has the right
to ask me that.

16
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,860
I'm tired. I'm hanging up.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
I am...

18
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,470
Su A.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,310
I'm your daughter,

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,780
not Young Chae.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,080
(Episode 46)

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,390
I gave it to her as a gift.

23
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,200
Young Chae said it was cute.

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,330
Wasn't this doll precious to you?

25
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,300
Because Young Chae is
a more precious friend.

26
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,040
So this doll really did belong
to you, then?

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
Yes.

28
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,340
Do you like your teddy bear?

29
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,280
Do you remember
that I bought this for you?

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,790
Of course I do.

31
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,890
It reminds me of you, Mom.

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,460
Young Chae is something else.
Why would she still have this?

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,670
You used to love it,
saying it sounded like my lullaby.

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,770
Did you give this music box away
to Young Chae too?

35
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,980
I didn't want to hold on
to my childhood memories.

36
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,520
But you said you missed me.

37
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,350
I missed you so much.

38
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,260
When your dad was framed for murder
and sent to prison,

39
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,960
how hard must that have been
for you?

40
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,130
I don't remember.

41
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,770
No, actually,
I think I wanted to forget.

42
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,540
Anyway, there's something
I want to show you.

43
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,620
Se Hoon, what are you doing here?

44
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,620
A son-in-law is visiting
his mother-in-law. What's wrong with it?

45
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,230
He just showed up
with all his bags packed,

46
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,530
so, of course,
I have a splitting headache.

47
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,030
Gosh, at this rate,

48
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,230
Jin Se Hoon might leave
Kunhyang Group for that brat.

49
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,370
What about your parents' permission?

50
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,100
Am I a kid?
Why would I need permission?

51
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,640
Go back home now.

52
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,480
- Don't do this on a whim.
- It's not a whim.

53
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,380
I can't stand being away
from you for a second.

54
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,480
And with your so-called "brother"
always preying on you,

55
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,820
I can't stand the thought of you two
living in the same house.

56
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,790
I'll be turning in now.

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,200
Se Hoon, did you really come here
because of Ha Neul?

58
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,840
What in the world
are you talking about?

59
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,270
Why do you care about CEO Joo?

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,340
He's Young Chae's older brother,

61
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,980
and they're siblings on paper.

62
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,880
That's not how Ha Neul sees it.

63
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,010
If you don't keep him in check,
I swear...

64
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,120
I'll throw away my friendship
and business with Ha Neul.

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,450
No, just trust me. End of story.

66
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,120
Isn't how you feel about each other
the most important thing?

67
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,060
My mom's right.

68
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,400
As long as our love for each other
is unchanged, nothing else matters.

69
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,970
I'll never change.

70
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
You feel the same, right?

71
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,040
This is driving me crazy.
Love, my foot.

72
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,810
This is just unbearable.

73
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,420
- Wait here. I'll get us some tea.
- I can get it.

74
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,830
No. I want to do it for you.

75
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,970
So childish.

76
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,180
Su A was a terrible artist
when she was young.

77
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,050
You're not Su A.

78
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,220
Who are you, then?

79
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,970
How could a seven-year-old...

80
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,040
have such powerful,
yet delicate strokes?

81
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,910
I can't believe I'm the one
who drew that.

82
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,580
They say artistic talent is innate,

83
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,250
so I guess
I must take after you, right?

84
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,160
Can't you sleep?

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,260
It'd be strange if I could.

86
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,690
You'll build a tolerance.

87
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,300
And I hear the side effects
are pretty severe.

88
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,960
Can they be any worse
than not sleeping at all?

89
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,170
(Alpdem)

90
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,710
What do you think you're doing
in front of me?

91
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,680
Ha Neul was just trying to stop me
from taking my sleeping pills.

92
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,310
Get inside.

93
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,880
You're hurting her.

94
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,920
Don't you dare treat Young Chae
like that.

95
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,790
What I do with my woman
is my business. Stay out of it.

96
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,750
Se Hoon.

97
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,690
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

98
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,900
I saw you with Ha Neul,
and I just snapped.

99
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,000
We live in the same house.
We just ran into each other.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,470
- It's not what you think.
- I know, okay?

101
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,500
But it's still driving me crazy.

102
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,180
What? You're staying at a hotel
while Jin Se Hoon is here?

103
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,520
Yes, I think that would be
for the best.

104
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,390
No. Just stay here.

105
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,390
That will just make
Se Hoon overreact even more.

106
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,420
That will make it more interesting.

107
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,030
Is our suffering just a game
to you, Mother?

108
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,430
You're the one
who needs to stop overreacting.

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,070
I should use this chance to separate
Jin Se Hoon and that brat.

110
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,600
You're not going to...

111
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,070
make Se Hoon and Young Chae...

112
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,370
If not right now, it's best
to pave the way for later, right?

113
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,510
It'd be good for you too
if they were over for good.

114
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,950
I want Jung Won
to have a fresh start.

115
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,880
I want her to stop pretending
to be Joo Young Chae...

116
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,720
and rebuild her relationship
with Se Hoon.

117
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,720
Now is the perfect chance
to take down Kunhyang.

118
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,630
We have to reveal her true identity
while Se Hoon is smitten with her.

119
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,630
That's what will make him waver
and crumble.

120
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,240
Is that why you told
Chairman Jin Tae Seok...

121
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,270
that Jung Won is Su A?

122
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,670
Of course I did.

123
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,110
That was reckless of you.

124
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,040
In business,
you go big, or you go home.

125
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,910
You have to know when to go all in
and when to fold.

126
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,180
Always being anxious
and looking over your shoulder...

127
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,220
That is so not my style.

128
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,290
You wanted to use the fake Young Chae
as your puppet...

129
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,560
and pull her strings
however you wanted.

130
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,130
But you're just mad
that you can't control her, right?

131
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,200
How dare that pipsqueak defy me?

132
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,770
What? She thinks she can
set the stage...

133
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,970
and be the one calling the shots?

134
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,910
I won't let her do that.

135
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,710
I'd rather flip over the stage
I set up...

136
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,210
with my own two hands.

137
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,580
Are you only happy
when everyone dances to your tune?

138
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,680
Of course. That's who I am.
The Gong Nan Sook way.

139
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,720
Don't you care about your kids
that you hurt?

140
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,990
Young Chae is so messed up...

141
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,720
and can't tell right from wrong.
Have you ever thought about why?

142
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,260
That's her fault, not mine.
She's lucky to have a mom like me.

143
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,000
It's not a curse.
Hey, I'd call it a great blessing.

144
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,270
About the DNA test results...

145
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,140
- They're conclusive, right?
- You confirmed them yourself.

146
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,980
- Dr. Kim wouldn't lie to me.
- Then what is it, ma'am?

147
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,550
It's just that Su A...

148
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,550
doesn't remember the teddy bear
she got from her dad.

149
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,550
She slept with it every night.

150
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,360
She was only seven, ma'am.
It's possible she doesn't remember.

151
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,360
I suppose you're right.

152
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,430
She might want to erase the memory
of her mother leaving her...

153
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,100
when she was young.

154
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,240
She probably wants to forget
about the things from then too.

155
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,140
Is that what you did too, Hye Ra?

156
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,610
- What?
- You risked it all, even your life.

157
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,780
Min Jung.

158
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,850
I...

159
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,560
- want to be with Tae Seok.
- Then just go.

160
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,090
But what about Su A?

161
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,190
President Jin Tae Seok loves you.
He'll accept Su A too.

162
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,930
Tae Seok...

163
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,430
only wants me.

164
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,100
I want to be the matriarch
of the Kunhyang family.

165
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,970
I want to be with Tae Seok.
Please, you have to stop me.

166
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,570
But still, how could you
do something like that?

167
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,210
If I survive, I'll believe that
the skies have taken pity on me...

168
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,480
and have given me permission...

169
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,350
to be with Tae Seok in this life.

170
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,680
And if not?

171
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,020
If I die just like that,

172
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,120
it'll be the price
I pay for my sins.

173
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,560
I'll just have to accept it.

174
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,430
I don't want to live
as a murderer's wife.

175
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,500
I did that?

176
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,040
Min Jung, you've got it wrong.

177
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,340
- I don't remember any of it.
- At 18, when I left the orphanage,

178
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,880
I was thrown out into the world
with next to nothing.

179
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,080
I would have died
if it wasn't for you.

180
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,610
Thanks to you,

181
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,120
I got hired
as President Jin Tae Seok's new secretary.

182
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,250
I decided I'd do anything for you.

183
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,520
So, on your orders,
I got a truck driver...

184
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Stop!

185
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,460
I never did that.

186
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,800
Why do you keep lying?

187
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:00,930
I...

188
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,270
- was talking nonsense.
- I have never once...

189
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,640
abandoned my Su A or forgot her.

190
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,440
Jin Tae Seok is the one who lied.

191
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,110
He was trying to kill me
if he couldn't have me.

192
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,090
Your tea is cold.
Let me get you a fresh cup.

193
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,660
Even Su A doesn't seem
like the real Su A.

194
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,630
What kind of trick
is Jin Tae Seok pulling?

195
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,410
(Alpdem)

196
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,250
It's even more suffocating here
than the Kunhyang house.

197
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,990
He must know.

198
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,560
He must've received
Su A's test results in advance.

199
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,360
Birthday...

200
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,110
The day we were reunited?

201
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,740
Hye Ra.

202
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,250
Su A doesn't feel like my daughter.

203
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,320
You orchestrated something,
didn't you?

204
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,580
She's not my daughter, is she?

205
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,120
What are you talking about?

206
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,790
You saw the DNA test results.

207
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,060
What?

208
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,730
I never told you I got a DNA test.
How did you know?

209
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,960
It was about having a new member
in the Kunhyang family.

210
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,030
How could I pretend not to know?
I had to make sure.

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,840
But Dr. Kim and Secretary Yoon
are my people! Just how?

212
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,470
I know everything that goes on
in the Kunhyang family. As I should.

213
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,440
- You're acting the strangest.
- What do you mean?

214
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,980
When Su A showed up again,
you weren't surprised or even angry.

215
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,680
You accepted it so naturally.
The man I know...

216
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,850
wanted to keep me away from Su A.

217
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,020
Don't you remember?

218
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,190
Please let me bring Su A too.

219
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,700
You told me to bring her,

220
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,870
but your face and the look
in your eyes said the opposite!

221
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,700
I was supposed to accept...

222
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,670
your ex-husband's child,
no matter what?

223
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,470
I hid how I felt not to hurt you,
but I wasn't happy about it.

224
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,310
That's honestly how I felt.

225
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,010
So that's why you tried to harm her?

226
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,680
But...

227
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,550
you mistook Mi Hyang's daughter,
Jung Won, for Su A,

228
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
so she was sacrificed, right?

229
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,120
Hye Ra, that's enough.

230
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,890
- How far are you going to push me?
- My accident!

231
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,090
You caused it, so I couldn't
keep my promise of getting Su A.

232
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,130
Or, rather...

233
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,860
You were afraid
I'd choose Su A over you,

234
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,470
so you caused the accident,
didn't you?

235
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,070
Say it! Say it's true!
Admit you did it!

236
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,370
- You did it!
- Stop it, Hye Ra!

237
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,710
I can't trust you anymore.

238
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,750
I don't even think
that girl is my daughter,

239
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,750
and at this rate,
I feel like I'm losing my mind!

240
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,190
It's okay.
Everything's going to be all right.

241
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,990
Trust me. Please.

242
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,930
Let it all out.

243
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,830
You'll feel better
once you let it all out.

244
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,800
Young Chae!

245
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,540
- What is it, Se Hoon? What's wrong?
- I can't find Young Chae.

246
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,750
She probably couldn't sleep
and went for a little walk.

247
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,550
- Ha Neul is gone too.
- What? What's going on?

248
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,450
So she just ditched her husband
to run off with her brother...

249
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,320
to dance in the moonlight or what?

250
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,160
- I have to find her right now.
- Hold on.

251
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
The number you dialed
is unavailable.

252
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,200
Gosh, that girl.
She never answers on the first ring.

253
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,570
Ha Neul isn't picking up either.

254
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,980
Hey, Manager Gu!

255
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,310
Did you... Did you call for me?

256
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,580
Go out and find where Young Chae is.
And Ha Neul too.

257
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,750
By Ms. Young Chae,

258
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,180
do you mean Ms. Su A who is
currently with the Kunhyang family?

259
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,520
Why, you little...

260
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,520
Cha Jung Won! Find that girl.

261
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,490
- Go on, hurry.
- Yes, ma'am.

262
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,360
My goodness.

263
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,460
Don't they ever sleep?

264
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,900
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

265
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,130
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

266
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,900
(Sky Question)

267
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,940
Se Hoon.
What are you doing here so late?

268
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,810
Where's Young Chae? Where is she?

269
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,010
What are you talking about?
I thought she was...

270
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,050
- Young Chae isn't home?
- You didn't call her out?

271
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,650
Don't be ridiculous!

272
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,550
I'm sure nothing's happened
to Young Chae.

273
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,820
She probably just needs some time
to herself to think.

274
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,490
You look like you know where she is.

275
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,260
She's not with me, is she?
Isn't that all that matters to you?

276
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,580
Who were you with
and how much barbecue did you eat?

277
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,180
You still reek of it.

278
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,920
Yes. That's right, I'm the owner.

279
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,930
Gosh, this woman.
Even her sleeping habits are awful.

280
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,130
Gosh.

281
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,030
That smell...

282
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,740
Why did I come all the way here?

283
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,040
What was I thinking, coming home?

284
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,750
Gosh, it's cold.

285
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,690
Jung Won.

286
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,260
Dad.

287
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,670
If you're home,
you should come inside.

288
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,340
Let's go in.

289
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,310
I cranked up the heat for you.

290
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,480
If I'd known you were coming,

291
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,950
I would've tidied up your room.

292
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,230
It's been so long.

293
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,660
It's so warm and cozy.

294
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,600
- This really is my room.
- It is.

295
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,970
You can come back anytime.
This will always be your room.

296
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,710
Whether you are
Kunhyang family's daughter-in-law...

297
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,440
or the fake daughter
of that crazy Gong Nan Sook,

298
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,680
you're always my daughter
and Ki Beom's.

299
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,790
I just don't think a lie
should become a swamp.

300
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,300
You must get out
of this swamp of lies,

301
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Joo Young Chae.

302
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,290
Chef Hong,
why seaweed soup all of a sudden?

303
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,830
- Is it someone's...
- How could you forget?

304
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,100
Right. It is today.

305
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,400
Young Chae's birthday.

306
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,970
No, that's not it.
We have to check the lunar calendar.

307
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,470
So it must be for me, then.

308
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,240
Happy birthday, dear.

309
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,350
Oh, my. Thank you so much, Grandma.

310
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,620
You shouldn't have done all this
for my lunar birthday.

311
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,650
Grandma, you can go back inside now.

312
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,890
If you keep popping in and out,

313
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,390
you'll startle Se Hoon.

314
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,890
Please enjoy your meal.

315
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,560
All right.

316
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,760
Gosh, my back.

317
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,770
Oh, right. Dig in. Let's eat.

318
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,140
Young Chae stayed at a hotel
last night...

319
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,240
At her friend's house.

320
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,480
That's incorrect, sir.
She was at a hotel.

321
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,710
Right.

322
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,880
I actually spoke to her yesterday.
She'll be home tonight.

323
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,020
All right.

324
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,520
Anyway, I bet the Kunhyang family...

325
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,290
won't even get Young Chae
a birthday meal.

326
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,260
Whatever. It's just a birthday.
Everyone has one.

327
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,500
Gosh, whatever.

328
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,870
That's hot!

329
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,440
But it's my birthday today.

330
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,310
Su A, why aren't you eating?

331
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,350
I'm just not much of
a breakfast person.

332
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,820
In the Kunhyang family,
you must follow the Kunhyang family rules.

333
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,160
- The Kunhyang family rules?
- Everyone's busy,

334
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,130
but we make it a rule to eat
breakfast together as a family.

335
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,300
Se Hoon and Young Chae
aren't even here.

336
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,760
Rules, my foot.

337
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,100
Have you always just said
whatever popped into your head?

338
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,770
Even if you're dying to speak,
learn to hold it at least three times.

339
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,340
That's how one maintains
their dignity.

340
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,510
She'll get the hang of it.

341
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,250
Old habits die hard.

342
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,650
What's with you, Mom and Dad?
Did you two fight or something?

343
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,760
- Excuse me. I've lost my appetite.
- Sit down.

344
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,570
How can you leave the table
when your parents are still eating?

345
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,700
The first thing you need to learn
is some manners.

(Organic Haskap Berry)

347
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,350
Mom, you drink this too?

348
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,710
All the ladies
in this neighborhood drink this.

349
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,050
Now, what do they say about it?

350
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,820
They say it flushes out toxins
and improves your circulation.

351
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,520
Didn't you say you often wake up
because your limbs fall asleep?

352
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,230
It's gotten a lot better
since I started drinking this.

353
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,830
Make sure
you drink it regularly too.

354
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,430
I drink it too.

355
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,470
They call it a superfood,
and it has a really clean taste.

356
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,530
Plus, I feel like my body is
a bit lighter.

357
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,200
Your father must be waiting.
Let's drink.

358
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,580
What are you two having without me?

359
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,210
It's mostly for women,

360
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,080
but it's also good
for men's circulation.

361
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,280
- Have some.
- What?

362
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,620
Gosh, it's clean and delicious.

363
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,560
So, what are you going to do?
You could stay here for a while.

364
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,900
That's right. When things get tough,
it's a blessing to have a home.

365
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,740
This is your real home.
This is where you're from.

366
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,140
My phone's ringing.

367
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,610
Hello?

368
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
What?

369
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,340
Wang from the deli ran off with
all the money from our savings club?

370
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,850
I'll be right there.

371
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,280
You're looking for a way out again.

372
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,050
Your mom has a case of spring fever,
and it's not even spring.

373
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,050
Hey, it's not that.
She ran off with the club money...

374
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,090
Mr. Hiccups? Why is he calling?

375
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,760
Hey, what is going on?

376
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,030
Jung Won?

377
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,830
She's here with us.

378
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,870
You look like you finally got
a good night's sleep.

379
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,140
Maybe it's because I slept
in my own bed at home.

380
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,240
It's your mind and body
sending you an alarm,

381
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,250
telling you to go back
to where you belong.

382
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,080
As for Se Hoon,

383
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,650
Madam Gong covered for you.
She said you stayed at a hotel.

384
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,830
All I seem to do is lie to Se Hoon.

385
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,560
From the start to the end.

386
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,370
If Se Hoon...

387
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,240
finds out
I'm the Fake Joo Young Chae,

388
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,410
- will he still love me the same?
- If you want to know,

389
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,150
then you'll have to tell
Se Hoon the truth.

390
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,880
Is that what you want me to do,
Ha Neul?

391
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,550
That's your call, Jung Won.

393

(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

394
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,400
You didn't call me
to the Kunhyang house this month.

395
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,540
Let me check
your blood pressure first.

396
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,250
I won't ask you anything
about what happened last time.

397
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,920
But this time,

398
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,950
bring me the real results.

399
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,830
Keep in mind that you are here
for my check-up today.

400
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,300
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

401

(Kunhyang Group)

402
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,630
What is it?

403
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,970
I listened in on the conversation
in the Vice Chairman's office.

404
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,110
Her personal physician, Dr. Kim,
just paid her a visit.

405
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,940
He visits the Kunhyang house
once a month.

406
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,780
- Why was he at her office?
- Vice Chairman asked him...

407
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,450
for another DNA test
on her and Ms. Su A.

408
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,360
What? Han Hye Ra suspects
that Su A is an impostor?

409
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,090
She's having another DNA test done.

410
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,260
So? What's the big deal?

411
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,260
We'll just swap the results again.

412
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,560
It's not like
this is our first time.

413
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,430
It's not that simple.
Hye Ra's instincts...

414
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,670
are telling her
the fake Su A isn't real.

415
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,040
She can sense she's not
her own flesh and blood.

416
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,810
You're saying it's a matter of time
before the truth is exposed?

417
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,680
Too many people know the real Su A
is our daughter-in-law.

418
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,480
We just have to keep Han Hye Ra
and Jin Se Hoon from finding out.

419
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,850
And you think that's easy?

420
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,550
Not when Cha Ki Beom is still alive.

421
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,720
What's gotten into you?
Is this amateur hour?

422
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,230
You're right.
That's probably for the best.

423
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,630
You'd better come up with a plan.

424
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,430
Get rid of him quietly
so that not a soul knows.

425
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,070
Leave it to me.

426
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,970
I want to deal with that
jerk Cha Ki Beom myself.

427
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,770
Whether I send my men,
dump him in the Han River,

428
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,880
or make it look like an accident.

429
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,980
It's always about timing.
You know it, right?

430
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,760
Fine. I'll just celebrate
my birthday.

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,940
Do you have any idea
how worried I was?

434
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,280
How could you run off in the night
without a word?

435
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,380
I'm sorry. I just felt trapped.

436
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,060
What a relief.

437
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,690
Those few hours you were gone
were a pure nightmare.

438
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,700
Why are you looking at me like that?

439
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,540
Just tell me what it is
before you give me a heart attack.

What if what?

443
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,850
How would you feel
if we started over...

444
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,650
from the beginning?

445
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,550
What is she trying to expose now?

446
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,250
She's out of her mind.

447
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,960
But we're already married.
What's there to start over?

448

I'm already head over heels for you.

not to lie to you anymore.

who I really am,

- Can you just...

461

promise me you'll do as I ask?

462
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,540

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,620
Why meet outside, all of a sudden?

467
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,130

What happens to me if you tell them?

It'll be hard for you to
go back to being Joo Young Chae.

You'll just vanish into thin air.

479

Jung Won is Su A. She's just trying
to take back what's rightfully hers.

So then, who gets to kill you?

It was your husband, Jin Tae Seok,
who suggested creating a fake Su A.

484
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,570
You conspired with Gong Nan Sook
and pulled the wool over my eyes.

485
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,570
Did you think I wouldn't find out
you were using a fake Su A?

Start by making Jin Se Hoon
divorce that brat.

No matter what happens,
I will never divorce Young Chae.

489
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,020
You should be the daughter-in-law
of the Kunhyang family...

490
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,050
since you're
the real Joo Young Chae.
