Did you just call me
Cha Jung Won, Mom?

will die by my hand.

That's enough.

15

Stop it, Mom.

Leave the lights off.

30

You're either fearless
or you're crazy.

31

One of the two.

32
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,150
To come all this way
to find me yourself.

33
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,130
And here I thought you were supposed
to be so gentle and kind.

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,060
Appearances can be deceiving.

35
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,410
Didn't that ever occur to you
that I could be even scarier...

36
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,110
than Chairman Gong Nan Sook?

37

You think this is going to scare me?

If you were to know
who I really was,

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,790
you'd probably pass out.

Cha Jung Won.

42
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,330
You're a daughter of Cha Ki Beom
and Jo Mi Hyang,

43
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,360
and you're the one
who kidnapped Park Kyung Shin.

44
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,370
You're wrong.

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm not Cha Jung Won.

46
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,170
Then who are you?

47

49

I'm the real daughter
of Gong Nan Sook.

50

I am Joo Young Chae.

51
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,100
Say that again.

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,830
Who did you say you were?

53
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,970
Your future daughter-in-law,
Joo Young Chae,

54
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,070
is me.

55
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,510
Cha Jung Won...

56
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,710
would imitate everything you had...

57
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,810
and wanted it all for herself?

58
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,510
Even your men?

59
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,550
That's right.

60
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,580
Park Kyung Shin too?

61
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,330
So it wasn't enough to just be
jealous of my daughter-in-law?

62
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,400
You can copy her looks and style.
Fine, I'll grant you that.

63
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,870
I can even believe you'd want
to steal her man, but...

64
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,040
Pretending to be Joo Young Chae
when I'm actually Cha Jung Won...

65
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,070
is a crazy thing to do?

66
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,010
Wasn't my daughter-in-law...

67
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,880
more than generous to you?

68
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,710
Was her warm
and considerate heart...

69
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,320
insulting to you?

70
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,850
I was the generous one to Jung Won!

71
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,920
I gave her so much,
she ended up stealing my life.

72
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,530
Your parents would be so heartbroken
if they knew.

73
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,330
Cha Ki Beom and Jo Mi Hyang...

74
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,930
They're not my parents.

75
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,040
My late father is Shin Jae Ho,
and my mother is Gong Nan Sook.

76
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,210
Do you need to know
my grandfather's name too?

77
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,610
Should I go on?

78
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
By all means.

79
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,650
My brother Joo Ha Neul and I
share no blood.

80
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,690
His father passed.

81
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,320
That's just
a basic background check.

82
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,160
Anyone could find that out
if they wanted to.

83
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,730
How did you end up like this?

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,170
It's truly a shame,

85
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,730
but I can't let it slide
when you come to me...

86
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,740
spouting nonsense.

87
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,100
Have you never once considered...

88
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,810
that your future daughter-in-law,
Ju Young Chae,

89
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,680
might be an impostor?

90
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,580
There's no need to drag this out.

91
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,620
If we have a three-way meeting
with Chairman Gong,

92
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,450
wouldn't that clear things up?

93
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,560
No, not Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

94
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,780
What a complex flavor for an apple.

95
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,880
It smells like a peach.

96
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,350
It's a peach apple.

97
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,620
Seriously, if it weren't for you,
Chef Hong,

98
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,790
I might've lost my appetite forever
and starved to death.

99
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,620
Don't jinx it, dear.

100
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,860
Yes, Grandma.

101
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,760
Grandma, can I ask you something?

102
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,370
Please stop bothering her.
She's tired.

103
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,200
Grandma.

104
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,010
My dear, what's on your mind?

105
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,810
It's about Noh Min Gu.

106
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,580
Do you know where he is?

107
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,390
He's right under your nose.

108
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,160
Manager Gu, get the car ready.

109
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,570
You can't meet Chairman Gong?

110
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,700
I thought you said
she was your mother.

111
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,610
The one person who can truly confirm
that I'm Joo Young Chae...

112
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,010
is someone else.

114
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,750
Call your brother, not your mother?
I wonder why.

115
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,620
Do you completely trust
Chairman Gong Nan Sook?

116
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,360
She'd look me straight in the eye
and lie if it suited her.

117
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,560
- But...
- And CEO Joo...

118
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,470
is not the type to lie?

119
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,540
You want me to sleep at my place?

120
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,680
But what about moving
Noh Min Gu somewhere else?

121
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,550
The Kunhyang Family and Mom
are desperately searching for him.

122
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,950
Exposing him unnecessarily
is too risky.

123
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,820
I can't leave him here alone.

124
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,090
I'll stay with him.

125
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,560
Are you sure?

126
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,660
It's probably better
for me to stay than you.

127
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,630
I'll take you home.

128
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,670
I can go by myself.

129
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,270
What if I go with you
and tell your father the truth?

130

a few days ago,

149

right here in this very room.

150
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,860
You said you and Cha Jung Won
were seeing each other.

Is she the Cha Jung Won...

You too? Why are you doing this?

157
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,660

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,470
Then why the tears?

181
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,340
Dad.

182
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,540
Why did you have to have
a daughter like me?

183
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,280
What's wrong with having
a daughter like you?

184
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,850
A daughter like you
is more than I deserve.

185
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,850
You're the one I don't deserve, Dad.

186
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,790
Look at you.
You're being so sentimental tonight.

187
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,990
I know I'm not supposed to ride it,
but I want to.

188
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,000
Why not? It's just a swing.

189
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,040
You get to go so high.
It's like you have wings.

190
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,510
You want to fly?

191
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,650
Then fly.

192
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,780
I'll give you a push.

193
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,120
No, it's okay. I was just saying.

194
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,650
It's just a swing. It's no big deal.

195
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,190
My point exactly.
What's stopping you from riding it?

196
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,590
All right, let me check.

197
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,200
Here we go.

198
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,500
Fly.

199
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,870
Fly.

200
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,070
Fly, Jung Won, fly!

201
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,570
- Fly!
- It really feels like I'm flying.

202
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,850
Do you know someone
named Cha Jung Won?

203
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,350
Do you know what kind of woman
she is?

204
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,090
A murderer's daughter,
Cha Jung Won...

205
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,930
Dad, I'm scared.

206
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,430
I feel like I'm going to fall.

207
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,380
I'm right here holding on tight.
What are you scared of?

208
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,490
What are you, a baby?

209
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,460
I worry that you always try so hard.

210
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,930
I can see how hard
you push yourself,

211
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,540
and as your dad, that upsets me.

212
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,680
Did you get in a fight
with Mr. Hiccups?

213
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,550
Mi Hyang must be waiting for us
to get back. Let's go.

214
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,260
Silly girl...

215
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,460
Hey, that's heavy.
Let me take that. Give it here.

216
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,930
Let's go.

217
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,610
She asks why it's only you
with a potbelly.

218
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,810
A wavering heart just means
that there's love involved.

219
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,850
So, hug her and say "I love you."
Not me, of course.

220
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,220
- I love you, Hye Jeong.
- Wait, am I hearing things?

221
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,990
This one's red too.

222
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,060
It's all red!
Such a hopeless romantic!

223
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,290
Darn it.

224
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,070
How did they...

225
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,210
The phone is turned off.

226
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,280
Please leave a message
after the tone.

227
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,380
She's got some nerve.
No, it's way beyond that.

228
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,680
Do you think you could sleep right now
if you were in her shoes?

229
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,450
Maybe she took some sleeping pills?

230
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,820
Let's come back in the morning.

231
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,390
Have you forgotten how gifted
Chef Hong's psychic is?

232
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,560
She said Noh Min Gu was
right under my nose.

233
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,830
Then it must be the company,
the house, or here.

234
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,940
For crying out loud.

235
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,070
If you hadn't lost him
in the first place...

236
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,970
I'm sorry.

237
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,280
Whether you break down the door
or drill the lock,

238
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,480
just open it now. Do it now.
Right now.

239
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
Yes, ma'am.

240
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,880
Wait. The master key.

241
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,650
The master key!

242
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,050
- Go get it, now!
- Right away.

243
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Hurry!

244
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,760
Unbelievable.

245
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,100
Chairman Gong is here outside
Young Chae's house.

246
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,730
Please help me.

247
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
(The Crown Capital)

248
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,600
Of all the places,
you brought me here?

249
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,940
Where would you rather go?

250
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,040
Mom's place?

251
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,480
The villa in Yangpyeong?

252
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,940
Your place?

253
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,510
Right. It's Young Chae's house.

254
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,520
You mean the house
Cha Jung Won stole from me.

255
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,020
There are hotels, you know.

256
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,420
It's the middle of the night.
Who's going to recognize me?

257
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,290
You still don't get the situation,
do you?

258
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,460
If it weren't for Vice Chairman Han,

259
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,890
the Kunhyang Family would've
reported you to the police.

260
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,260
Am I supposed to be grateful
for that?

261
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,570
Why are you making things
so difficult?

262
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,430
Wasn't being a kidnapper
enough for you?

263
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,440
Now you'll be a shameless liar
on top of it?

264
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,010
Have you forgotten
who the real shameless liar is?

265
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,740
How could you say
I'm not Joo Young Chae?

266
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,880
How could you? You're my brother.

267
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,180
How could you lie
without even batting an eye?

268
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,150
Oh, right.

269
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,650
Se Hoon wasn't enough for her?
Did she have to ensnare you, too?

270
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,760
Don't be ridiculous.

271
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,930
I've been so busy with your messes
that I'm turning into a liar myself.

272
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,800
Me? Not Cha Jung Won?

273
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,030
You started this fire.

274
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,670
You told her she could play around
with your name, place, and life.

275
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,940
You're the one who
gave her permission.

276
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,270
And now you're demanding
it all back?

277
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,410
That would piss off a saint.
Anyone would turn vicious.

278
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,680
You must have thought Cha Jung Won
was a total pushover.

279
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,680
You thought you could have your fun,

280
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,080
and then come back
to snap your fingers...

281
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,390
to get rid of her.

282
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,760
I never thought things would get
this messed up.

283
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,960
I never thought Mom...

284
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,630
and you...

285
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,200
would turn your backs on me.

286
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,700
I hate you even more than Mom.

287
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,700
How can you defend Jung Won...

288
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,910
who stole your sister's life?

289
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,540
I told you, she didn't steal it.

290
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,950
You gave it away yourself,
like an idiot.

291
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,380
You've made a mess so tangled
it can't be undone.

292
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,580
I'll fix it.

293
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,820
It's going to take time.

294
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,790
This isn't for Jung Won's sake.
It's for our family and for you.

295
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,190
Then what about me?

296
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,660
What am I supposed to do?

297
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,270
If I can't be Joo Young Chae,
then who am I?

298
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,000
Where am I supposed to live?

299
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,300
Whose daughter am I?
Whose sister am I?

300
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,510
It's Mom...

301
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,090
Cha Jung Won came to see you,
Mother?

302
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,160
And she claimed to be
Joo Young Chae?

303
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,130
Yes.

304
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,100
If they had a three-way meeting
with Joo Ha Neul,

305
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,230
then I doubt things will escalate
any further.

306
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,930
That Cha Jung Won,
Cha Ki Beom's daughter,

307
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,640
has the nerve to impersonate
my future daughter-in-law?

308
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,210
Is that Cha Jung Won girl crazy?

309
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,610
She claimed to be Joo Young Chae?

310
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,380
Hey, is that any way to talk about
your future sister-in-law?

311
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,180
Is that really what's important
right now?

312
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,880
How could she do something
like that?

313
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,250
She must've broken up with Ha Neul
and acted out to get revenge.

314
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,820
Ha Neul and Cha Jung Won dated?

315
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,690
- It wasn't that serious.
- No, it wasn't like that at all.

316
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,030
I already confirmed it myself.

317
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,260
What's going on?
Am I the only one who didn't know?

318
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,330
You only had eyes for Young Chae.
You wouldn't have listened anyway.

319
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,000
That woman, Cha Jung Won,
is a real piece of work.

320
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,470
She's sick.

321
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,080
Poor Young Chae must have gone
through so much.

322
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,050
Please, enjoy.
I've suddenly lost my appetite.

323
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,150
Pour me another one.

324
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,960
That's new.
You never have more than one.

325
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,000
About Cha Jung Won...

326
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,870
Are you sure she's the one
who kidnapped Park Kyung Shin?

327
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,910
CEO Joo said he'd handle it,

328
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,980
but I don't think
we can just sit back and watch.

329
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,210
It's not really over
until we find Park Kyung Shin.

330
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,920
Do you think
Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

331
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,650
might have gotten rid
of Park Kyung Shin already?

332
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,690
I wouldn't put it past her.

333
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,560
I doubt she actually hurt him.

334
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,260
Why do we need to know?

335
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,370
If our kids get married
with no issue,

336
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,770
it's a win-win for both companies.
That's all that matters.

337
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,210
The person you are calling
is unavailable...

338
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,080
Joo Young Chae,
why aren't you picking up?

339
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,520
So, besides Chairman Gong's home
and company,

340
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,760
you want me to check her vacation villas
in the Gyeonggi Province?

341
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,560
Whether Park Kyung Shin is
alive or dead,

342
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,270
the world can't find out.

343
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,200
I believe we should find
Park Kyung Shin first.

344
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,940
And should I report this
to the chairman?

345
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,110
He won't care. Not right now.

346
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,210
I'll be discreet.

347
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,080
You must not leave a single trace.

348
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,880
There can be no loose ends.

349
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,890
Min Jung.

350
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Not a soul can know about this.

351
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,420
Is that clear?

352
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,530
I'll keep that in mind,
Vice Chairman Han.

353
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,570
Is Manager Gu making a master key?
What's taking him so long?

354
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,340
How did you know?

355
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,770
Sorry for the delay.
I had to have a master key made.

356
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,980
- Hurry up and open it.
- Right.

357
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,390
For goodness' sake. Give it here.

358
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,260
Ha Neul.
How did you know I was here?

359
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,200
Don't tell me you came to see her
at this hour?

360
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,030
Young Chae went to her place.

361
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,540
Her place?

362
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,510
She's at our Yangpyeong villa.
What are you talking about?

363
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,810
No, I mean...

364
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,410
she is at her own place.

365
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,710
Her own...

366
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,980
Right. That's my boy.

367
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,180
We must call
that girl Young Chae now.

368
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,380
We just have to drill that
into our heads.

369
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,890
Goodness, I'm running on fumes.
Let's go inside and talk.

370
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,190
Actually...

371
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,390
There's something more pressing.

372
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,030
What?

373
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,430
You must handle this yourself.

374
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,630
Why? Is there another fire
to put out?

375
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,900
I'll explain on the way.
Let's go now.

376
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,100
Go where?

377
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,910
Darn it, who is it now?

378
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,620
Whatever, I just won't answer.

379
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,280
Go ahead and sue me!

380
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,960
Nobody knows the passcode anyway.

381
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,100
Cha Jung Won said
she went to her place.

382
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,200
Noh Min Gu, you punk.

383
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,910
What are you doing here?

384
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,220
What did you say?

385
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,150
You're saying
you're not marrying Joo Ha Neul?

386
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,520
Goodness.
Is something wrong with my ears?

387
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,690
I must be hearing things.

388
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,200
You came after so long,
slept like a baby,

389
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,000
ate a delicious meal,
and now you're spouting nonsense?

390
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,500
Did you have a fight
with Mr. Hiccups?

391
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,270
That's enough.

392
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,810
Why are you dropping
a bombshell on us now?

393
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,850
I was wrong.

394
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,510
It was all a lie.

395
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,020
What?

396
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,950
What's gotten into her?

397
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,490
This seems fine, though.

398
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,760
What lie?

399
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,990
Cat got your tongue?

400
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,400
CEO Joo and I never dated,

401
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,500
let alone got engaged.

402
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,800
Then why did CEO Joo
buy me those shoes?

403
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,470
Why did he treat me
like his father-in-law?

404
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,310
I asked him to lie for me.

405
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,550
Why would you do a thing like that?

406
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,550
You really approved of CEO Joo.

407
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,820
You just assumed he was going to be
your son-in-law,

408
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,860
so I couldn't bring myself
to correct you.

409
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,660
And that made you lie?

410
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,460
And what does that make CEO Joo?

411
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,830
What does that make us
for falling for your lie?

412
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,640
Are we a joke to you?

413
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,840
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. I'm fine.

414
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,610
While you're at it, why don't you
come clean about everything?

415
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,320
That you're marrying some rich heir
who's better than Mr. Hiccups.

416
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,850
Stop it.

417
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,390
I can't even think straight now.

418
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,890
Who could it be this early?

419
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:36,000
(A Graceful Liar)

420
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,700
She revealed she's Joo Young Chae
right in front of Han Hye Ra?

421
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,430
It's not entirely
Young Chae's fault.

422
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,870
She lost to Cha Jung Won.

423
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,270
My very own daughter.

424
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,710
Only when you're worthy
of being my daughter...

425
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,410
can you enjoy all the privileges
that come with it.

426
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,180
Cha Jung Won, this is your fault.

427
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,650
I'll take back everything you stole.

428
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,250
Cha Jung Won, you're going to end up
in the gutter.

429
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,520
She tells one lie
to cover up another,

430
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,690
and now Cha Jung Won is trapped
in a web of her own lies.

431
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,660
How did things get this far?

432
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,730
It's Ripley syndrome.

433
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,870
She perfectly concealed the fact
that she was your daughter...

434
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,830
and posed as Joo Young Chae,

435
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,900
my future daughter-in-law.

436
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,510
I can't even pretend to listen
to such nonsense.

437
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,210
Like father, like daughter.

438
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,140
Don't you dare insult my daughter.

439
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,780
I'm going to make it my reality,
not a lie.

440
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,910
Because I am Joo Young Chae.

441
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,480
