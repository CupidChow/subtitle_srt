00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,440
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,510
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,440
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,890
Mom.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,960
This is all your fault.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,960
Don't tell me they're fighting.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,190
Gosh.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,600
Hey, come on now.

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,670
You're invading their privacy.

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,270
Come on.

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,170
But I'm telling you,
I heard them fighting.

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,110
Sure, and pigs
might start flying next.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,110
You want to make a bet on it?

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,250
You're on.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,620
If I win, you have to grant my wish.

16
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,620
- And if I win?
- I'll grant you one wish.

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,330
Deal.

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,000
- Ouch!
- That hurts.

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,130
You already knew that Su A
was gone, didn't you?

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,870
Didn't you?

21
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,270
Honey,

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,040
how could I have known and not told?

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,110
You expect me to believe
you didn't know?

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,940
Is there anything
beyond Kunhyang's reach?

25
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,250
I told you, I missed my chance.

26
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,480
By the time I went to find her,
Jo Mi Hyang had left with Su A,

27
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,590
and by the time I tracked down
their new address and got there...

28
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,420
You should have gone immediately.

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,860
If you had acted a little sooner,
our Su A would still be alive.

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,230
She'd be safe in my arms.

31
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,470
- Hye Ra.
- I resent you.

32
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,800
- Hye Ra.
- I resent you.

33
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,340
Hye Ra! Hye Ra.

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,810
I can't even begin to imagine...

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,710
the pain you must be feeling.

36
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,580
It's all my fault.

37
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,830
I don't know what came over me.

38
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,960
If not me,
who else would you open up to?

39
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,700
You can blame me all you want.

40
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,530
Let it out.

41
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,570
I'm so used to getting my way...

42
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,370
that I took it out on you.

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,350
No, I'm the one who should be sorry.

45
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,090
But if you're lying to me,

46
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,830
if it's your fault
we never found our Su A,

47
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,900
I will never forgive you!

48
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,550
Was I just seeing things?

49
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,250
No, I'm the one who misheard.

50
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,990
You win. I give up.

51
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,630
Okay. I'll take it.

52
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,900
Name your prize.

53
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,330
When Young Chae and I get married...

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,340
You're telling me not to boss
my future sister-in-law around, right?

55
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,500
Bingo!

56
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,910
Gosh, you're so whipped.

57
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,410
Se Mi, what was your wish anyway?

58
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,650
- It's a secret.
- Come on. Spill it.

59
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,420
You were going to ask for my help
with Joo Ha Neul, right?

60
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,690
Whatever.

61
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,730
You wanted me to investigate
the incident from 25 years ago?

62
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,210
Do you think what happened to Su A
is related to the Chairman?

63
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,940
I'd like to think not.

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
But...

65
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,150
this tiny sliver of doubt
just won't go away.

66
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,780
Digging into an accident
from 25 years ago won't be easy,

67
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,890
and if the Chairman were to find out
that you don't fully trust him...

68
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,890
Min Jeong.

69
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,260
I just want to know the truth.
No, actually...

70
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,300
I want to be able
to trust him again.

71
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,800
You'll do this for me, won't you?

72
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,670
Understood.

73
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,310
You want me to start monitoring
Cha Ki Beom and Jo Mi Hyang again?

74
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,080
May I ask why, sir?

75
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Manager Hwang.

76
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,420
How long have you been working
for me?

77
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,060
Twenty-five years, sir.

78
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,300
After so many years, people start
to forget their place.

79
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,870
Don't make the mistake
of getting too comfortable.

80
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,340
No, sir. Of course not.

81
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,970
I told you not to ask questions
and not to think.

82
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,810
I'm the one
who calls the shots here.

83
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,910
I'll keep that in mind, Chairman.

84
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,380
Find out who Cha Ki Beom is meeting.

85
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,520
No, let's be more precise.

86
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,550
Find out when and where...

87
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,760
the Vice Chairman Han
is meeting that bastard.

88
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,890
Keep an eye on them.

89
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,700
It'd be even better if you find out
what they say about 25 years ago.

90
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,830
Understood.

91
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,210
If he doesn't pick up again,
I'll just eat this myself.

92
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,480
What? When did I drop this?

93
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,290
It's that handkerchief again.

94
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,260
It's not like I asked for your help.

95
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,030
Is that any way
to treat your sister?

96
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,410
It wasn't there when Se Hoon
put ointment on my leg.

97
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,880
This thing follows me around
like a lost puppy.

98
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,720
It's like it walks around
on its own.

99
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,650
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

100
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,830
Joo Ha Neul, at this point,
he's definitely blocked me.

101
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,290
I'm sure of it.

102
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,530
(K Group's Crown Prince Jin
and Fiancée Joo, Wedding Imminent)

103
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,640
They clearly went to great lengths
for these shots.

104
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,910
Who is it? Reporter Ma Sang Ki?
Have you tried contacting him?

105
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,950
Yes. Looks like
there was a whistleblower.

106
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,280
Who?

107
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,020
- He's being tight-lipped.
- Then you have to loosen his lips.

108
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,250
The timing isn't good.

109
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,250
Especially with
the Park Kyung Shin situation.

110
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,760
Darn it.
That girl is a ticking time bomb.

111
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,680
I guess even a fake daughter
is still a daughter.

112
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,910
Look at her,
crawling back on her own.

113
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,880
- Did you miss me?
- Enough of that. What do you want?

114
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,450
I made honey cookies in my class.
I brought them for you.

115
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,320
You're a natural, aren't you?

116
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,290
- Lies just spill out of your mouth.
- You don't have to believe me.

117
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,790
Besides, I have a question for you.

118
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,530
- About Park Kyung Shin?
- Where is he right now?

119
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,400
Aren't you curious
if he's even alive?

120
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,970
You were really going to kill him?

121
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,770
You didn't know?
I can snuff out a life like that.

122
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,010
I made sure to shut him up for good,

123
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,080
if he causes any more trouble,
next time...

124
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,780
You will just crush him like a bug?

125
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,450
You think it's just him?

126
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,190
Your life and your father's life
depend on me.

127
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,420
That's enough.

128
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,630
- What?
- Even a catchy tune gets old.

129
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,700
Do you always toy with
people's lives like this?

130
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,970
I can't take it anymore.
I'm so sick of...

131
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,270
Toying? Toying with them?

132
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,500
You're sick of it?

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,440
Hey! I'm the one who's sick of you!

134
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,880
There's never a day of peace
with you.

135
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,940
Not one single day.

136
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,780
What are you, a celebrity?
Are you famous or something?

137
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,180
You're always in the news. Always!

138
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,250
Do you shove your face
in front of cameras,

139
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,150
begging them to take your picture?

140
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,730
My goodness!

141
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,560
My pretty little daughter's face
has a scratch on it.

142
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,030
Whatever shall we do?

143
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,900
Manager Gu!
Get the first-aid kit. Now!

144
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,970
Hurry up!

145
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,150
(1 Missed Call: Joo Young Chae 1)

146
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,020
This latest article is a real doozy.

147
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,360
Joo Young Chae, you can't
always cry to your brother.

148
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,030
You need to handle
your own problems.

149
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,000
My goodness. How can this happen
to a bride-to-be?

150
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,500
It's so upsetting.

151
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,540
You should have known better
than to defy me.

152
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,940
I'll do it.

153
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,650
I have to be more cunning.

154
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,790
Gong Nan Sook is my mother.

155
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,390
I am her daughter, Joo Young Chae.

156
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,220
I must never forget
and burn it into my brain.

157
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,630
It should be better by tomorrow.

158
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,560
Cover it with makeup
when you go out.

159
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,330
Thank you for your concern. I will.

160
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,370
Exactly. It's basic manners to say
thank you when you're grateful.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,380
You know what kind of people
I despise the most?

162
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,810
They come to me begging for money,

163
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,850
saying, "Please, just help me out,
this one time."

164
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,350
"I'll be forever in your debt."

165
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,050
Crying and pleading,

166
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,390
and against my better judgment,
I lend them the money.

167
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,750
And then
it's like it never happened.

168
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,790
Their whole attitude changes.

169
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,930
But I could even live with that.

170
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,430
I mean, they act like
the money's theirs.

171
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,160
The ones who vanish at payback time,

172
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,270
the ones who always pay late,
and the ones who start...

173
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,000
cussing you out
when you call to collect.

174
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,140
There's a limit to being ungrateful,
you know.

175
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,540
- So it's non-payers you hate most?
- No.

176
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,350
The real problem starts
after they've paid it all back.

177
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,020
If they want to act high and mighty,
and won't need my money again, fine.

178
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,520
I was ready to find it amusing.
But then that son of a gun...

179
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,160
called me a "filthy loan shark"
and spat right in my pretty face.

180
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,460
Ptooey!

181
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,900
What do you think I did
to that bastard?

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,970
Another one of your heroic tales?
Stop sugarcoating it.

183
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,910
- Off to work?
- Yes.

184
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,880
Hey, can I get a ride?
My car is in the shop.

185
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,180
Sure, let's go.

186
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,220
Make sure you handle
that news article...

187
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,450
and don't make me get involved.

188
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,290
Are you sure it's Park Kyung Shin?

189
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,430
Yes, I heard directly from a junior
in Planning and Coordination...

190
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,200
who's stationed
at Kunhyang Hospital.

191
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,300
And why was he admitted?

192
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,370
He has full-body contusions
and pulmonary edema.

193
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,010
Apparently, his lungs
were filled with water.

194
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,280
That means he was assaulted.
But why the fluid in his lungs?

195
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,950
- Did they find the attacker?
- We don't have the specifics yet.

196
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,190
I guess I'll have to
go ask him myself.

It's the cooking class parking lot.

199
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,130
Any idea who the tipster is?

200
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,930
Ahn Ji Na.

201
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,640
- You're in the same cooking class?
- That was her first time there.

202
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,010
Why would Ahn Ji Na go this far?

203
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,110
The obvious reason is
she's still hung up on Se Hoon.

204
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,050
But will that change Se Hoon's mind?
If he finds out Ahn Ji Na did this,

205
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,650
he'll be even more repulsed by her.

206
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,350
She must have a bigger endgame.

207
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,890
I'm off.

208
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,590
- I thought you needed a ride.
- I'll just take my own car.

209
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,760
- You said it was in the shop.
- I lied.

You don't need to know.

212
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,030
He's right.

213
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,540
Chairman Gong will
probably take care of him.

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,050
- From fashion magazines.
- Are you a fashion model?

- How about "crazy witch?"
- Joo Young Chae!

like a completely different person?

349
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,690
Let Chairman Gong
handle him herself.

350
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,960
Gosh, that insolent witch!

351
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:34,060
Gosh. For a ticking time bomb,
she has the nerve to talk big.

352
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,430
She's earned the right
to be insolent.

353
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,710
Are you sure you're seeing it right?
Take a good look.

354
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,980
I mean, Chef Hong. No, Master Hong.

355
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,250
What's with the book
all of a sudden?

356
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,080
Lost your touch?

357
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,790
Fortune-telling is a study,
Chairman. Please be patient.

358
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,320
And don't be so impatient.

359
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,130
The real Joo Young Chae is the cause
of all the trouble in this house.

360
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,460
What? What about my Young Chae?

361
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,530
Your Young Chae feels wronged.

362
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,730
She says an impostor
took her mother.

363
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,540
Oh my goodness,
then what should I do?

364
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,070
Oh, dear. No, no. I'm sorry.
It was my fault.

365
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,910
Master Hong,
hurry and ask your guide...

366
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,050
what I should do for my Young Chae.

367
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,150
Hurry!

368
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,060
Oh my goodness!

369
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,590
It's too beautiful.
How could I possibly wear it?

370
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,930
It's your attire for greeting guests
after the ceremony.

371
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,570
Jung Won picked it all out herself.

372
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,940
Are you touched?

373
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,210
That girl.

374
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,270
Why is she preparing everything
for her parents' wedding?

375
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,440
We're her parents,

376
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,950
but we couldn't even do a thing
for our own daughter's wedding.

377
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,650
His family doesn't expect that.
Jung Won will take care of...

378
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,950
Do you know what kind of family
he comes from?

379
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,430
- More or less.
- Then you know who the groom is?

380
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,530
- Of course I do.
- Well, I don't.

381
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,770
Even Ki Beom doesn't know
who Jung Won is planning to marry.

382
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,440
It's complicated.

383
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,310
Soon enough, Jung Won will bring...

384
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,580
Vice President Jin Se Hoon
to introduce him.

385
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,710
You mean it's not Joo Ha Neul?

386
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,780
It's really that Jin Se Hoon guy?

387
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,750
Joo Ha Neul?

388
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,890
No, it's not him.

389
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,220
Then why did she bring him home
to introduce him to us?

390
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,860
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

391
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,200
You should ask Jung Won about that.

392
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,360
And what about the news article?

393
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,870
Right. That.

394
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,470
It says that the Crown Prince
of K Group...

395
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,970
Is that Jin Se Hoon?

396
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,670
- Yes.
- That's the face from the boutique.

397
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,650
But why does it call our Jung Won
"Joo" something?

398
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,610
The daughter of Chairman Gong,
a big shot in finance?

399
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,880
I'm not so sure about that part.

400
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,050
But the girl in the picture
is definitely Jung Won.

401
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,760
Why are her last name, mother,
and family...

402
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,520
all lies?

403
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,830
It figures a prominent family like
Vice Chairman Jin's would attract...

404
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,730
a lot of tabloid attention,
even about Jung Won.

405
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,170
- It's probably fake news.
- Fake news?

406
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,470
Just how powerful is his family?
Are they billionaires or something?

407
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,840
Something like that.

408
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,080
Here you are.

409
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,620
If your wife's ring is 0.5 carats,

410
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,860
you should've gone for 0.3, sir.

411
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,160
I'm good with 0.1.

412
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,090
You sure you're okay with that?

413
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,070
- What is?
- Your in-laws are quite the family.

414
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,370
But your only daughter...

415
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,640
can't even call her parents
her own and has to hide it.

416
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,710
It's just a little weird,
don't you think?

417
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,780
What are you talking about?
That's ridiculous.

418
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,980
I guess you haven't seen it yet.

419
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,310
Hold on a second.

420
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,720
This is your daughter, right?

421
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,120
(K Group's Crown Prince Jin
and Fiancée Joo, Wedding Imminent)

422
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,600
The very picture of a noblewoman.

423
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,470
Just the kind of mother-in-law
a wealthy family would want.

424
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,170
- Jo Mi Hyang!
- Jo Mi Hyang!

425
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,810
- Jo Mi Hyang!
- Jo Mi Hyang!

426
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,410
- Jo Mi Hyang!
- Jo Mi Hyang!

427
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,120
- Jo Mi Hyang!
- Jo Mi Hyang!

428
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,450
- Jo Mi Hyang!
- What is this nonsense?

429
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,860
Oh, my.

430
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,530
I didn't buy any of this.

431
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
Jung Won sent it all to me.

432
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,870
Tell Jung Won to get here right now.
Tell her to get here this instant!

433
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,140
(Kunhyang Group)

434
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,940
Park Kyung Shin is seeing someone?

435
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,810
It seemed to be a thing of the past.

436
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,450
But the woman is still
hung up on him.

437
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,290
It's unlike you to give me a hint
like this, Vice Chairman.

438
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,560
When someone says, "I'm fine,"
it really means they're not fine,

439
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,160
and that they actually do care.

440
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,900
Park Kyung Shin and Joo Young Chae,
done and dusted.

441
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,670
Okay, understood.

442
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,870
She seemed incredibly bold
and self-assured.

443
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
Cha Jung Won.

444
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,380
She said she's a designer.
Have you heard of her?

445
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,180
Cha Jung Won?

446
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,820
No, this is the first
I'm hearing about her.

447
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,530
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

448
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,870
A hint from the Vice Chairman
isn't enough to go on.

449
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,900
I'll have to see for myself.

450
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,780
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

451
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,850
It's me, Young Chae.

452
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,920
(Ward A)

453
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,250
Is someone sick?
Is it Vice Chairman Han?

454
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,450
No.

455
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,690
- The Chairman?
- Not him either.

456
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,330
Then who? Se Mi?

457
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,900
You'll see when we get there.

458
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,470
There's no reason for him to be
sulking. What's his problem?

459
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,270
(Ward A)

460
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,310
(Patient: Park K Shin,
Attending Physician: Noh Ji Hwan)

461
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,620
He was badly injured and admitted
after the Kunhyang fashion show.

462
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,520
I thought it would be nice if you
came along to visit him, Young Chae.

463
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,830
So he knew about
Young Chae and Park Kyung Shin.

464
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,970
And he still brought me here?

465
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,370
How much does he know?

466
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,780
Looks like he's sleeping.
Let's come back later.

467
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:37,720
What's going on here?

468
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
And where's the bed?

469
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,360
(Blocked Number)

470
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,640
- Park Kyung Shin?
- Why are you desperate to find him?

471
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,580
It looks like you really miss
Park Kyung Shin.

472
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,820
(A Graceful Liar)

473
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,280
Is the news true, or is it a lie?

474
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,980
Your face is plastered all over it.

475
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,980
It says your name is what? Joo?
And your mother's Chairman Gong?

476
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,850
Who is the man Jung Won is marrying?

477
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,050
His name is Jin Se Hoon.

478
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,290
Dad can't find out
I'm marrying Jin Se Hoon.

479
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,390
Please keep it a secret for me, Mom.

480
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,460
Park Kyung Shin might have run away.

481
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,160
Could Young Chae have taken him?

482
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,930
A private jet from Milan
arrived in Incheon three days ago.

483
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,300
Young Chae is back.

484
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,830
I guess it's time
I returned to being Cha Jung Won.

485
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,840
Park Kyung Shin is missing?

486
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,770
