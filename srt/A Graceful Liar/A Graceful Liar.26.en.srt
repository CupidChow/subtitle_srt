1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,210
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,840
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,310
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,090
I apologize for insisting on meeting
at your home.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,250
Please, come and have a seat.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,920
I was hoping we could speak
somewhere quiet.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,760
You can wait in my study.
I'll go make some tea.

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,250
It's okay.

9
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,350
I can do anything for my dad.

10
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,040
I drew this when I was a kid.

11
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,610
What's this doing here?

12
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,900
It looks like a child's drawing.

13
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,930
Is it special to you?

14
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,530
It's nothing special.

15
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,070
Why would Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
have this painting?

16
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,050
Does this have something to do
with the mother who abandoned me?

17
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,220
Or are you my mother?

18
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,590
You are not, are you?

19
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,820
Was it chosen...

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,630
for the Kunhyang-sponsored
Nurturing Budding Talent Program?

21
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,930
That's right.

22
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,130
Where is that young artist?
What are they doing now?

23
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,880
Enough about the drawing.

24
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,780
My dear daughter-in-law.
What did you want to talk about?

25
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,880
I came here to tell you
I can't marry Se Hoon.

26
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,290
But...

27
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,920
something came up that I need
to confirm first.

28
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,230
Is there a problem
with the wedding preparations?

29
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,730
No.

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,700
I'm almost finished with the sketch
for your portrait,

31
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,140
and I wondered if you'd prefer it
in watercolor or oil.

32
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,810
Could you do an oil painting
with the feel of a watercolor?

33
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,050
I'll try my best.

34
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,930
Just stay at Mi Hyang's
for three days.

35
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,970
Mommy will come get you, I promise.

36
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,670
In just three sleeps?

37
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,870
Promise?

38
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,280
I promise.

39
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,090
There's no way Vice Chairman Han
could be my mother.

40
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,710
(Dad)

41
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,080
(Episode 26)

42
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,180
You're home.

43
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,660
Where's Dad?

44
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,890
He just called. He's on his way
from the laundromat.

45
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,530
You decided to do
as your dad said, right?

46
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,300
Do you remember her?

47
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,830
The woman who abandoned me
and ran away.

48
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,470
Han Young Sun.

49
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,070
Why bring up Young Sun
all of a sudden?

50
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,910
I just wonder how well she's living
after abandoning her daughter.

51
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,250
- I'm just curious.
- Why on earth would you be curious?

52
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,750
Young Sun...

53
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,420
That girl is not even human.

54
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,350
Is she even alive?

55
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,190
Have you seen her?

56
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,760
You still can't forget
your birth mother,

57
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,690
and your heart still aches for her?

58
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,030
That girl...

59
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,200
has forgotten all about you.

60
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,140
She's probably living her life
as if you were dead.

61
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,400
How could a mother...

62
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,340
forget her own child?

63
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,980
How can she pretend I'm dead
when I'm still alive?

64
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,850
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

65
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,850
No, I'm the one who should be sorry.

66
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,150
To me, you're the only mom I have.

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,230
What's going on here?

68
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,910
You haven't asked about her once
since you grew up.

69
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,140
That's no way to talk
to Mi Hyang, your mother.

70
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,150
Do you know, Dad?

71
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,250
- Where she is and what she does.
- Don't you ever...

72
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,380
mention that woman's name again.

73
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,890
Did you tell them you won't marry
Jin Se Hoon?

74
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,860
Really?

75
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,860
I told you I did.

76
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,830
Well done.

77
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,900
That's my girl.

78
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,970
You did the right thing.

79
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,580
Dad, I have to find out.

80
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,950
How Vice Chairman Han
and my mom are related.

81
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,150
(The Crown Capital)

82
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,720
Cha Ki Beom must have been
pretty shaken up.

83
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,060
He made it seem like I was dead set
on ruining his daughter's life.

84
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,660
Let's be real. If it weren't for me,

85
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,830
could she dream
of marrying into a rich family?

86
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,370
Cha Ki Beom is going to...

87
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,870
- stop this marriage.
- How so?

88
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,040
Listen, even if the sky falls,
Cha Jung Won will marry Jin Se Hoon.

89
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,140
I'd bet my life on it.

90
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,580
He knows whose son I am now.
So I can't keep...

91
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,880
spying on his family anymore.

92
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,590
Why? Are you sad to see it end?
Have you grown fond of them?

93
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,790
What are you going to do now?

94
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,330
Why don't you meet with her?

95
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,630
- Me?
- She opens up to you...

96
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,870
after playing siblings for so long.

97
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,910
What about Young Chae?

98
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,210
She's been texting,
asking to see you.

99
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,190
(Naeil Care Hospital)

100
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
Mom.

101
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,560
My poor girl, you look so thin.

102
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,530
Let's sit down.

103
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,330
Manager Gu, give it here.

104
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,870
I brought your favorite sushi
from Kunhyang Hotel, Ms. Young Chae.

105
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,540
Here you go.
You love tuna belly, don't you?

106
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,350
Make sure you chew it well.

107
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:04,890
It just melts in my mouth.

108
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,760
Mom.

109
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,830
When can I get out of here?

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,300
All right, let's talk about that.

111
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,500
Are you ready to live
as Cha Jung Won?

112
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,710
Why should I live as Cha Jung Won?

113
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,380
I won't.

114
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,350
I said, I won't do it!

115
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,320
Screaming and throwing a fit
won't solve a thing.

116
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,990
- You foolish girl.
- How am I supposed to live as her?

117
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,360
Why can't you?

118
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,560
That's the only way for you
to be Joo Young Chae again.

119
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,330
You'll come back with even more,
as a Joo Young Chae at the very top.

120
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,770
- I'll make it happen.
- When?

121
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,340
As soon as that brat, Cha Jung Won,
marries Jin Se Hoon.

122
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,540
Is that even possible?

123
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,770
Your mother is Gong Nan Sook.
Is there anything I can't do?

124
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,510
Are you going to make them divorce
or something?

125
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,480
I am willing to, if necessary.

126
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,180
I could frame that girl,
Cha Jung Won,

127
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,650
for Park Kyung Shin's murder.

128
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,520
Trust me. You're my daughter.

129
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:15,360
How can I bear to see you
cooped up in here like this?

130
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,060
If I live as Cha Jung Won,

131
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,830
where will I live
and what will I do?

132
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,200
Don't you remember where she lived
and what she did for a living?

133
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,110
Are you telling me to live
in Cha Jung Won's house?

134
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,210
Working part-time jobs?
With those dirt-poor parents?

135
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,380
I would never!

136
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,320
Gosh, what a temper.

137
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,430
You seem determined
to call off the wedding.

138
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,900
I was going to.

139
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,670
For real?

140
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,900
- But why the past tense?
- I need to confirm something first.

141
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,810
Is it important enough to decide
whether you'll get married or not?

142
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,720
- Can I ask what it is?
- I can't tell you until I decide.

143
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,620
What does your father think?

144
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,690
That the wedding's off.

145
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,620
Take your time, sir.

146
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,490
Mr. Hiccups.

147
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,460
You're a scary man, you know that?

148
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,130
What's the matter?

149
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,570
Are you too disgusted to drink
with a lowlife like me?

150
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,410
No, sir.

151
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,510
I had a few drinks earlier.

152
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,880
I figured one of us
should stay sober.

153
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,910
Even though you know who I am,

154
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,550
you're still this respectful,
and you give me shoes as a gift?

155
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,880
I apologize.

156
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,460
What, are you just going
to turn the other cheek?

157
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,490
You should want me dead.

158
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,470
It's been well over 20 years.

159
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,640
A tiny child came to see me...

160
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,340
- and swore he'd make me pay...
- I said I'd kill you.

161
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,680
What's your game?

162
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,950
- Trying to kill me by inches?
- The answer.

163
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,950
You're the one who told me
back when I was just a boy.

164
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,620
What?

165
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,860
Then you'd better grow up fast.

166
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,930
Catch your father's killer
with your own two hands.

167
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Make sure of it.

168
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,110
Tell me.

169
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,280
Do you...

170
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,550
believe I'm not the real killer?

171
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,910
My gut feeling doesn't matter.

172
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,780
Only facts and evidence...

173
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,720
can prove what's true.

174
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,620
You still haven't given up.

175
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,920
I knew you wouldn't.

176
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,460
Please, find the real killer.

177
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,000
My whole life,

178
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,540
I've been branded a murderer.
I can accept that as my fate.

179
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,070
But my daughter, Jung Won,

180
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,580
lived under the misconception
that she's a murderer's child...

181
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,880
when she has such a kind heart.

182
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,380
Jung Won...

183
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,150
has never once resented you.

184
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,690
She trusts you more than anyone else
in the world.

185
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,290
Hate me all you want. I don't care.

186
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,760
But...

187
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,030
not my Jung Won.

188
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,530
Just like you are now,
stay by her side...

189
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,130
and protect her.

190
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,110
Did Jung Won really break off
her engagement?

191
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,310
Yes.

192
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,710
Your brushwork
is truly one of a kind.

193
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,510
You've managed to capture the feel
of a watercolor with oils.

194
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,680
What were you trying to convey?

195
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,580
Gentle in appearance,
strong at heart.

196
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,190
Is that what you see?

197
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,960
You're gentle, but I feel
an unbreakable resilience.

198
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,660
This is far too generous a gift.

199
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,300
I'll have to find a way
to repay you.

200
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,770
You've already given me
more than enough.

201
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,840
You're so modest.

202
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,610
Actually, I just thought
of something I'd like.

203
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,780
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

204
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,780
What?

205
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,710
Of course.
I'll get it for you myself.

206
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,820
My dear daughter-in-law,
my favorite artist.

207
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Su A.

208
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,310
Who...

209
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,350
Who put this music box here?

210
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,250
Mother.

211
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,080
Hold on.

212
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,100
It's just a little cut.

213
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,500
Even a small cut
shouldn't be ignored.

214
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,680
This music box.

215
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,750
Is it yours?

216
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,380
Yes.

217
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,550
Have you had it
since you were a little girl?

218
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,990
No.

219
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,660
A few years ago, I went to Insa-dong
to do some sketching,

220
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,760
and I bought it at a vintage shop.

221
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,900
I fell in love with the melody.

222
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,930
Could Mi Hyang have sold
the music box...

223
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,230
after Su A left?

224
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,770
I was surprised to see
a similar music box...

225
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,170
in Se Mi's room not so long ago.

226
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,910
She said
you bought it for her, Mother.

227
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,410
They say people who are
destined to meet...

228
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,420
always find a way to each other.

229
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,260
The music box.

230
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,560
Why are you carrying it around?

231
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,130
The music was getting faint,

232
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,100
so I took it with me
to get it fixed.

233
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,100
I guess I wanted to show you
that we are meant to be.

234
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,520
Are you hurt?

235
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,190
It's nothing.

236
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,020
Our daughter-in-law's hands
have a healing touch.

237
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,800
What's wrong?
Is your leg bothering you?

238
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm fine.

239
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,970
Hold still.

240
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,270
- I'm fine. Goodness.
- Gosh.

241
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,740
Kids might see us.

242
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,340
Let them look.

243
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,640
I'm carrying my own wife.

244
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Here you go.

245
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,950
You have to take care of your health
while you're still healthy.

246
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,630
And it tastes good too.

247
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,970
Look at me.
Because you always make me take it,

248
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,940
I'm solid as a rock!

249
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,440
You have some too.

250
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,410
I can't live as Cha Jung Won.

251
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,120
Not for a single day.
Not even for a minute or a second.

252
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,090
Hey.

253
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,360
Get someone for me!
Just let me make one phone call!

254
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,800
(Naeil Care Hospital)

255
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,200
I can't believe you asked to meet me
behind the chairman's back.

256
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,630
What are you trying to do?

257
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,510
You're the only one who can help me,
Manager Gu.

258
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,740
Please protect me.

259
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,700
Mother.

260
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,300
Hold on.

261
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,710
This is the only way...

262
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,940
to be absolutely sure.

263
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,650
(Naeil Care Hospital)

264
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,160
Are you really Joo Young Chae?

265
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,130
- Mom! It's Young Chae.
- Cut the act.

266
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Do you think I'll fall for that?

267
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,870
Who is this trash?
How dare she say that to Young Chae.

268
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,570
Just a friend I met recently.

269
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,680
But she's spouting nonsense
that I'm not your daughter.

270
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,950
What?
I ought to tear that witch apart!

271
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,090
Where are you now?
I'm coming over to wring her neck!

272
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,460
Chairman Gong Nan Sook clearly called
that girl Joo Young Chae.

273
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,900
I don't want to get mixed up in this.

274
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,000
Whether I'm the real Joo Young Chae
or not,

275
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,300
does that really matter?

276
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,040
That fake Joo Young Chae
messed with you.

277
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,940
This is the perfect chance
to make her pay.

278
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,050
You're right.

279
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,820
It doesn't matter if you're
the real Joo Young Chae or not.

280
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,330
As long as
I can finally crush that brat.

281
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,770
- What do you need me to do?
- Get me out of here.

282
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,370
What?

283
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,440
I get a health checkup once a month.

284
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,100
That'll be our D-Day.

285
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,970
Hey.

286
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,440
How am I supposed to do
something like that on my own?

287
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,350
Just do exactly as I say.

288
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,190
You don't look like
the mother of the groom.

289
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,360
You look like a bride yourself.

290
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,060
Does that mean I need
a new groom, then?

291
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
What?

292
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,790
Today is your health checkup.

293
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,800
I'm here to escort you.

294
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,740
This is all such a hassle.

295
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,140
All right, let's see.

296
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,250
Well, you clean up nicely.

297
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,520
Just get us through today.

298
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,490
Then three percent
of Kunhyang's shares will be ours.

299
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,120
Chairman... I mean,

300
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,230
it'll be yours, Mom.

301
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,800
Better yet, it's a small wedding,

302
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,370
so your face won't be seen.
How nice is that?

303
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,000
Still, it's better
to cover your face more...

304
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,900
with the veil, don't you think?

305
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,740
By the way, how did you
even convince your father?

306
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,740
He threw a fit
over calling off this marriage.

307
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,980
Don't tell me...

308
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,250
you lied to Cha Ki Beom,
that jerk, I mean, your father,

309
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,650
and said you'd
call this wedding off, did you?

310
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,460
Did I have any other choice?

311
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,460
Gosh. And here I thought
I was the master of scheming.

312
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,900
But you really take the cake.
Good grief.

313
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,470
Oh, my.

314
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,170
Who's calling at a time like this?
I'm swamped.

315
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,810
Yes, this is Gong Nan Sook.

316
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
What?

317
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,020
Listen, do whatever it takes
to keep her there until I arrive.

318
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,120
Got it?

319
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Darn it.

320
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,930
Manager Kim. Good job
making Young Chae look beautiful.

321
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,900
- She looks lovely.
- Thank you.

322
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,340
Young Chae, I'll see you
at the ceremony later.

323
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,820
Your mother from the laundromat
was here looking for you.

324
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,670
What are you doing?
The guests are already here.

325
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,300
I can't find Se Mi anywhere.

326
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,610
Is she the one getting married?
I'm sure she'll show up eventually.

327
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,970
Let's go.

328
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,610
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

329
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,350
That idiot Manager Gu
won't pick up his phone!

330
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,060
Is she someone who owes me money?

331
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:06,440
May I ask all of our esteemed guests
to please face the rear?

332
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,740
Here comes the groom!

333
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,330
Our son looks
particularly dashing today.

334
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,030
Look at that boy,
grinning from ear to ear.

335
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,410
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

336
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,050
The bride will enter now.

337
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,780
Please welcome her
with a big round of applause.

338
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,450
Here comes the bride!

339
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,320
The bride has disappeared.

340
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,650
You know something, don't you?

341
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,150
Did you sneak her out?

342
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,650
(A Graceful Liar)

343
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,620
Say no more.
Right now, I'm Joo Young Chae.

344
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,720
What if your dad finds out?

345
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,720
It's all a lie! You're an impostor!

346
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,290
Whether it's a lie or I'm a fake,
I'll decide my own path.

347
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,360
Stop right there.

348
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,630
Don't go through with this marriage.

349
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,160
I don't care.
I will climb higher and higher.

350
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,870
I'm almost there. So close.

351
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,940
Kunhyang is as good as mine.

352
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,370
You abandoned me to become...

353
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,570
the matriarch
of a conglomerate family.

354
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,970
And I will never forgive you for it.

355
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,080
I will make your life a nightmare.

356
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,440
I swear on my life.

357
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,750
