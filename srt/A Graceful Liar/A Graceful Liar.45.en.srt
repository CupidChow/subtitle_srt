(in this drama are fictional.)

(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,950
Joo Young Chae.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,010
(Episode 45)

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,320
How dare you fool me into believing
you're Gong Nan Sook's daughter?

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,560
What should I do with you?

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,600
You think I'm going to let you live?

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,800
Cha Su A.

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,940
I thought I got rid of you
25 years ago.

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,010
You're a hard one to kill.

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,610
Where have you been hiding
all this time to show up now?

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,480
And as my daughter-in-law,
of all things.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,320
Did you think Se Hoon or me, no...

15
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,120
Did you think the Kunhyang Group
was a joke to you?

16
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,030
How did you find out?

17
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,300
You're not even begging and pleading
your innocence.

18
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,670
You've got some serious nerve.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,300
Don't tell me...

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,000
it's Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

21
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,610
She said she had no reason
to protect the girl...

22
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,540
who was kicked out,
despite being her own daughter.

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,450
What else did she say?

24
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,720
I'll strip the real Su A bare
and abandon her in the wilderness,

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,920
and leave her there to see...

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,990
if she can survive on her own
or freeze to death.

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,960
You think you can fool me?

28
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,460
You want to see the girl
tell Han Hye Ra...

29
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,030
that she's her daughter
and get revenge on her.

30
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,060
Isn't that it?

31
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,700
Is that true?

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,730
Did you marry into my family...

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,940
just to get revenge on Han Hye Ra?

34
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,070
Yes, that's right.

35
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,870
You've got guts. I'll give you that.

36
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,810
You'll be even more impressed...

37
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,640
once you hear my proposal.

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,810
You don't think I'll let this go,
do you?

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,350
- You dare to bargain with me?
- Whether it's a worthy bargain...

40
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,250
is for you to decide
once I'm done, Chairman.

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,420
Fine. I suppose I can grant
a dead woman's last wish.

42
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,590
Go on, let's hear it.

43
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,090
If anything were to happen to me,

44
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,930
you'll be
in a difficult position, Chairman.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,060
Extremely difficult.

46
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,830
- What?
- It'll shake Kunhyang to the core.

47
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,240
Who do you think you are?

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,310
The heir to Kunhyang,
Jin Se Hoon, is in love with me.

49
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,810
His entire life will fall apart.

50
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,010
And as for Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra,

51
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,920
she'll find out that
I'm the real Su A.

52
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,180
I'll ensure she never finds out.

53
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,680
The truth always comes out.

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,460
You can try to hide it all you want,
but it will be revealed eventually.

55
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,760
So you started this charade
knowing you'd get caught?

56
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,630
Do you think that makes you
Kunhyang's daughter-in-law...

57
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,930
- when I know everything?
- That's the problem.

58
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,740
You're the one who knows
and wants to end me the most.

59
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,170
If anything were to happen to me,

60
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,340
don't you think you'd be
the prime suspect?

61
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,050
You'd lose the woman you love.

62
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,280
You're quite something.

63
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,320
What do you want?

64
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,850
Just leave things as they are.

65
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,520
Let me live as Joo Young Chae...

66
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,990
and as Jin Se Hoon's wife.

67
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,660
What's in it for you?

68
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,490
My mother, who abandoned me,
Han Young Sun...

69
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,200
I want to unleash
all my pent-up rage...

70
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,440
on the woman
who now lives as Han Hye Ra.

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,840
So I'm just supposed to watch
you get revenge on Hye Ra?

72
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,310
Wouldn't that be better than
losing the woman you love?

73
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,510
- And what do I get?
- Peace for the Kunhyang family.

74
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,420
Leaving you alone is "peace?"

75
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,820
You're a ticking time bomb.

76
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,220
What if it comes out that
I'm the real Su A?

77
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,460
What about the fake Su A?

78
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,330
Won't it come out that she was part
of your scheme with Chairman Gong?

79
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,970
Do you think
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra...

80
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,070
would ever forgive you?

81
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,740
(Kunhyang Group)

82
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,580
She's not wrong about any of it,
Chairman.

83
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,580
CEO Joo, you knew all along,
didn't you?

84
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,010
How long did you plan on keeping me
in the dark?

85
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,720
I tried to fix this tangled mess,
but it was beyond my abilities.

86
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,050
I apologize. I didn't mean to
deceive you, Chairman.

87
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,460
Unbelievable.

88
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,690
How long is this charade
going to go on?

89
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,930
So basically, everyone knows
except my wife, Se Hoon, and Se Mi.

90
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,130
Promise...

91
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,470
you'll keep Jung Won safe.

92
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,970
And if I do?

93
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,510
What's in it for me, CEO Joo?

94
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,050
I'll be your most steadfast ally.

95
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,150
And if I refuse?

96
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,850
Then I'll become your most powerful
and terrifying enemy.

97
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,690
I'll keep getting back up,
even if you knock me down,

98
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,330
until I plunge a dagger
through your heart.

99
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,930
Your fake sister's safety
is that important...

100
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,730
to you?

101
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,230
Yes.

102
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,800
(Kunhyang Group,
Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

103
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,880
I need to find out for sure
if you're the real Su A.

104
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,620
And then,
I'll decide what to do with you.

105
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,800
Ha Neul...

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,100
Young Chae?

107
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,150
Why would you provoke Chairman Jin?

108
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,250
What about your business?

109
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,720
What if you get hurt from this?

110
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,450
Now is not the time
to worry about me.

111
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,560
You're one to talk.
Why did you provoke Chairman Jin?

112
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,060
Then what was I supposed to do?

113
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:58,030
Should I have just cried and begged,
telling him how scared I was?

114
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,660
Get on my knees and grovel?

115
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,270
I'll deal with Chairman Jin.

116
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,370
You...

117
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,540
need to get out of
this pretend play.

118
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,940
- Please.
- How?

119
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,250
So I should go to Vice Chairman Han,

120
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,850
confess I'm a fake Joo Young Chae,
a fake daughter-in-law,

121
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,750
and that I'm the real Su A?

122
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,490
Should I tell her everything?

123
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,160
Then what happens to Young Chae,
the fake Su A?

124
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,860
She'll be Young Chae again.

125
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,530
And you can go back
to being Cha Jung Won.

126
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,100
Whatever you say,
I'll make the decision.

127
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,400
Stay out of my life.

128
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,510
Stop being Se Hoon's wife.

129
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,750
Divorce him.

130
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,580
That's where you need to start over.

131
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,950
You want me to divorce Se Hoon
and start over from the very bottom?

132
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,660
You must be out of your mind.

133
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,430
So it was Su A
who tampered with the food...

134
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,600
and not my daughter-in-law
during the Kunhyang Association gathering?

135
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,530
And even though she knew that,

136
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,300
Vice Chairman Han covered it up
for her.

137
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,980
She must be furious with Young Chae
over the anonymous post.

138
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,740
Father, please help her.

139
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,080
You love her that much?

140
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,980
Just as you love Mother,

141
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,550
I'll love Young Chae forever.

142
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,120
But what if...

143
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,230
she were a woman with nothing,
someone beneath your status?

144
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,490
Could you still stand by her
to the very end?

145
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,970
CEO Joo also said
something similar to me.

146
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,900
Does Young Chae have a secret
I don't know about?

147
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,610
I'm telling you to examine...

148
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,340
how great and deep your love is,

149
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,980
whether it's real or not.

150
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,210
I bet it started
when they were kids.

151
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,650
- What?
- I sometimes hung out at her house.

152
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,390
Ha Neul...

153
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,120
I mean, CEO Joo.

154
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,520
The way he looked at her wasn't
how a brother looks at his sister.

155
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,100
I guess at that time,

156
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,900
I was naive and thought all brothers
saw their sisters that way.

157
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,700
- That's what I thought.
- Stop it!

158
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,070
You're a real pro at driving a wedge
between people.

159
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,870
It's pathetic.

160
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,380
If you really trust her,
then nothing I say should matter.

161
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,780
Whatever it is you want,
I'll take care of it for you.

162
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,920
- What?
- You said you wanted more...

163
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,220
and wanted to be on top?

164
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,090
I'll do all of that for you,
instead of Se Hoon.

165
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,730
- Ha Neul.
- Don't call me that.

166
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,830
Not anymore.

167
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,430
I'm done playing that role.

168
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,200
To me,

169
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
you're a woman.

170
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,840
Even now,

171
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,380
I still feel the same, Father.

172
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,150
Even love has a shelf life.

173
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,020
A love you thought
would last forever...

174
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,120
can one day, out of the blue,

175
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,250
just vanish...

176
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,620
as lightly as a feather.

177
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,790
As the most romantic guy
in the world,

178
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,900
you're not exactly one to talk.

179
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,000
Back in college, I hid the fact that
I was from the Kunhyang family...

180
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,370
and lived in a studio apartment
near campus for a while.

181
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,940
I fell for a girl named Young Sun,
whose family ran my favorite diner,

182
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,340
who happened to be an underclassman
at my college.

183
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,750
When the Kunhyang elders
forced us to break up,

184
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,550
I thought I could forget her.

185
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,190
And so you married my birth mother.

186
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,860
Even if it was brief,

187
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
I did love your mother.

188
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,690
But then...

189
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,570
You're saying...

190
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,670
you once loved my mother?

191
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,470
It wasn't until I met Hye Ra again
that I realized...

192
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,210
my one true love...

193
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,710
had always been her.

194
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,450
I know this is hard for you to hear.

195
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,220
But after you go through a breakup,

196
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,550
and someone you thought
was the one is gone,

197
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,790
you realize who your true love was.

198
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,530
For me, there's only Young Chae.

199
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,300
I thought I loved Ahn Ji Na,
but that fell apart quickly.

200
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,560
Young Chae is different.

201
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,630
I am never letting her go.

202
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,670
I'll make it so
Young Chae can't leave me.

203
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,670
I'm going to show her
what a great husband I can be.

204
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,480
I'm going to
protect my love, Father.

205
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,350
No matter who gets in my way,

206
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,920
even if it's Mother.

207
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,190
You've got some nerve.
I expected Jin Tae Seok to end you.

208
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,330
Are you disappointed
that I'm completely unscathed?

209
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,060
A little bit.

210
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,730
What sweet-talking did it take
to get Jin Tae Seok to back off?

211
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,570
If Chairman Jin Tae Seok found out
I was Su A,

212
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,670
you knew he could hurt me.

213
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,410
But you exposed me anyway?

214
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,210
Was I no longer of any use to you?

215
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,140
You're not entirely useless.

216
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,350
It's just that...

217
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,850
if the odds are 49 to 51,
I'm taking 51.

218
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,250
- So I'm 49?
- Exactly.

219
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,960
Having you pose as my daughter...

220
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,760
and act
as Kunhyang's daughter-in-law.

221
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,030
I had to run the numbers to see
if it was still profitable.

222
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,440
What's this?
The agreement we signed?

223
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,940
"Cha Jung Won
will live as Joo Young Chae,"

224
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,940
"Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter.
However..."

225
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,710
Is there any point
in reading the rest?

226
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,450
So?

227
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,080
Your usefulness to me...

228
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,980
is over now.

229
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,620
You've lost your mind.

230
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,930
Do you think you can manage anything
without my backing?

231
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,260
From now on,

232
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,130
I will make all the decisions
and solve all the problems.

233
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,130
You will make the decisions
and solve the problems?

234
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,370
The nerve on you is unbelievable.

235
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,500
You were the one
who threw away our agreement.

236
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,240
- So what?
- You said you'd set the stage...

237
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,970
so I could fly with your wings.

238
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,980
You told me to kick up a storm.

239
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,180
But that stage you set,

240
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,550
I'm tearing it down
and building my own.

241
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,580
I'll fly with my own wings,

242
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,150
and I'll be the one
calling the shots.

243
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,260
You must have a death wish.

244
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,660
You dare to make an enemy
of Gong Nan Sook?

245
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,330
If I'm not willing to bet my life,

246
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,260
how could I stand up to you
and Chairman Jin?

247
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,130
Worry about the fake Su A,
your dear Young Chae.

248
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,970
What are you planning to do
to my Young Chae?

249
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,010
You're the one who told Chairman Jin
that I was Su A.

250
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,510
So I guess I should return the favor
and tell Vice Chairman Han...

251
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,380
that her so-called real daughter
is actually an impostor...

252
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,120
I'm not going to just stand here
and take this.

253
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,390
Don't make the mistake of thinking
I'm still the fake Joo Young Chae,

254
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,560
your fake daughter.

255
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,900
Why is she brimming with spite?

256
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
Fine.

257
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,880
Let her find out the hard way
how harsh and lonely this battle is.

258
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,750
I hope she won't come crawling back,
begging on her knees.

259
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,420
How pathetic.

260
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,170
I'm surprised you have the time
to summon me.

261
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,930
Are you feeling better
now that you're kicked out?

262
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,000
Apologize to me first.

263
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,040
- Apologize?
- For tampering with the food...

264
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,440
and pinning it on me.

265
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,270
That's nothing to apologize for.

266
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,380
What?

267
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,540
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
knew all along it was me.

268
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,950
She saw it all.

269
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,750
Then why did she humiliate me
and kick me out?

270
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,090
Because a daughter is more precious
than a daughter-in-law?

271
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,590
Too bad for you.

272
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,760
The truth that you're the fake Su A
is about to come out.

273
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,990
When that happens,

274
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,030
your act
as the fake Joo Young Chae...

275
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,200
and Kunhyang's daughter-in-law
will be over.

276
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,800
It will be over
between you and Jin Se Hoon.

277
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,840
Only my act
as the fake Joo Young Chae will be over.

278
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,870
What?

279
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,270
Se Hoon loves me for who I am,
whether I'm Joo Young Chae or not.

280
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,680
Even if I'm Cha Jung Won again...
No, Su A,

281
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,040
I'll still be right
by Se Hoon's side,

282
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,910
and my place in Kunhyang is safe.

283
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,350
What makes you so confident?

284
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,820
The only person
I need to believe in is myself.

285
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,220
So what do you think
will happen to you...

286
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,790
when you can't even trust yourself?

287
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,420
You won't be able to play the part
of the fake Su A anymore.

288
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,290
So you will have to go back
to being Joo Young Chae,

289
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,590
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter.

290
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,590
Just like you wanted
in the first place.

291
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,460
Things will get
more interesting, right?

292
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,300
I'm Han Hye Ra's daughter.

293
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,970
That's my rightful place.

294
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,410
Weren't you getting revenge?

295
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,080
After I put things back in order,

296
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,740
that's when I'll get
my real revenge.

297
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,710
Your dream of being
a Kunhyang daughter will be over.

298
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,020
That's why I wanted to see you.

299
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
Be ready to go back to your place.

300
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,860
What?

301
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,160
Young Chae and CEO Joo Ha Neul?

302
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,670
They weren't acting like siblings.

303
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,930
Divorce him.

304
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,800
That's where you need to start over.

305
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,240
You want me to divorce Se Hoon
and start over from the very bottom?

306
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,780
You must be out of your mind.

307
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,920
Even though
they're not blood-related,

308
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,450
she's still
Kunhyang family's daughter-in-law.

309
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,490
But she's hitting on Ha Neul.

310
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,620
Come on, Se Mi.
You must be mistaken.

311
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,730
I'm telling you, I saw it myself.

312
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,630
Maybe you saw
what you wanted to see.

313
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,630
Mom.

314
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,730
Are you saying
I can't trust my own eyes?

315
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:37,000
It's your perspective that's skewed
because of your jealousy.

316
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,470
You're home.

317
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,070
- Did you hope I wouldn't come home?
- Of course not.

318
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,540
As if my son Se Hoon would ever
leave Kunhyang that easily.

319
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,210
Get some rest.

320
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Young Chae...

321
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,750
is married to your brother.

322
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,090
I won't tolerate any more
of this nonsense.

323
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,190
This is driving me crazy.
It's the truth!

324
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
What do you think you're doing?

325
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,060
You're totally my type.

326
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,830
Get out. I need to change.

327
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,780
That's enough.

328
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,680
Knock it off.

329
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,850
But I don't want to.

330
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,590
This will never happen,

331
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,420
but even if it doesn't work out
with Young Chae,

332
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,430
it will never be you.

333
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,130
Why her and not me?

334
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,030
I don't feel a spark. Not at all.

335
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,570
You felt a spark with her
from the start?

336
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,070
Yes, I almost had a heart attack.

337
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,570
What if...

338
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,870
I wasn't the real Su A?

339
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,010
And what if you and Young Chae
were over?

340
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,010
- What?
- Would you still not choose me?

341
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,310
A no is a no.

342
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,650
What does...

343
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,490
she have that I don't?

344
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,520
For starters, Young Chae doesn't go
after men who are already taken.

345
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,560
Especially when I am
practically your brother.

346
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,630
Have some class.

347
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,330
My mother, who abandoned me,
Han Young Sun...

348
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,570
I want to unleash
all my pent-up rage...

349
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,010
on the woman
who now lives as Han Hye Ra.

350
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,510
So I'm just supposed to watch
you get revenge on Hye Ra?

351
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,910
Wouldn't that be better than
losing the woman you love?

352
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,550
I see the stock price fell again.
Is it serious?

353
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,130
Are rumors spreading that Kunhyang
kicked out their daughter-in-law?

354
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,290
It's not showing
any signs of recovery.

355
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,200
But I can't just welcome her back
unconditionally after what she did.

356
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,870
Of course. I just...

357
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,070
think you went a bit overboard.

358
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,310
Don't you think
you owe her an apology?

359
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,210
Su A tampered with the food
and then framed our daughter-in-law.

360
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,480
- You knew, but...
- Is that what Se Hoon told you?

361
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,280
This isn't a marriage
into some ordinary family.

362
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,750
Shouldn't we...

363
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,590
nip it in the bud
if there's any potential problem?

364
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,550
(Kunhyang Group)

365
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,890
You must be wondering
why I wanted to see you...

366
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,320
and if I had a change of heart
so soon.

367
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,020
You must have a lot on your mind.

368
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,890
When you asked me to come here,

369
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,790
I assumed this wasn't a meeting...

370
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,400
between a mother-in-law
and her daughter-in-law.

371
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,330
You're a smart one.

372
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,100
You're good at reading people too.

373
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,070
- Then why do something like that?
- If it's about the anonymous post,

374
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,240
I have nothing to say about that
at this time.

375
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,680
Do you still not realize
what you did wrong?

376
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,880
I had my reasons
and circumstances...

377
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,550
You wouldn't understand them
right now.

378
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,850
So you're admitting you did it?

379
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,630
I wanted to expose what you did
to the world.

380
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,600
Only by ripping off your mask
of lies and deceit...

381
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,400
would you finally realize
what you've done wrong.

382
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,740
At least you're not lying
and denying it.

383
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,440
You owe me an apology too, you know.

384
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,180
For what Su A did.

385
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,050
Fine.
So I knew she was framing you...

386
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,710
Did you despise me that much?

387
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,080
Because you did something
much worse.

388
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,550
The anonymous post
and the article about Su A.

389
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,490
Before you point fingers about
who wrote that anonymous post,

390
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,360
you should first look long and hard
at the life you've lived.

391
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,890
Did you not want to try...

392
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,700
and see things from my perspective,

393
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,630
or even attempt to understand
the reasons for what I did?

394
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,070
Everyone has their excuses.

395
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,710
No matter what the reason,
what you did is unforgivable.

396
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,310
Just tell me what you want.

397
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,720
I'd like you to be the one...

398
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,490
to finish
Jo Mi Hyang's grand opening preparations.

399
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,060
Since I was the one in charge of it,
I should be the one to see it through.

400
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,030
I saw the place on the way home,
and it looked delicious.

401
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,900
I'm so glad a barbecue place
opened up in our neighborhood.

402
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,900
I heard this place
is supposed to be amazing.

403
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,940
Look how long this line is!

404
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,140
You haven't told Dad yet?

405
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,210
No, I couldn't bring it up.

406
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,540
Then what was your excuse
to be here?

407
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,810
I told him I had a get-together.

408
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,480
How are you going to come
to work every day, then?

409
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,920
I'll have to come clean
before he finds out.

410
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,460
Oh, my goodness,
this place is packed.

411
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,860
Excuse me, are you Jo Mi Hyang,
the owner?

412
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,960
"The owner?"
You must be from headquarters.

413
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
- Please come in.
- Yes.

414
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,400
- Even the sides are delicious.
- It just melts in your mouth.

415
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,840
- This looks amazing.
- Look at that meat.

416
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,640
- It's cooked perfectly.
- Come on, let's eat.

417
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,680
This is amazing.

418
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,450
My dear Jung Won... No.

419
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,380
Thanks to Ms. Joo Young Chae,

420
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,520
I became a barbecue place owner.

421
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,790
I'm over the moon.

422
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,620
You're a natural in the kitchen.
This place will be a huge hit.

423
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,530
We'd also appreciate it if you could
help us with new menu development.

424
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,960
A new menu?

425
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,400
(Ki Beom)

426
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,770
Did my wife just hang up on me?

427
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,680
It's not even spring.

428
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,010
Is her wild side acting up again?

429
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,160
No, Mi Hyang wouldn't do something
like that now.

430
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,100
Come on, pick up.

431
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,400
Jung Won, you picked up.
Where are you right now?

432
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,470
I don't care how busy you are.
Come meet me. Right now.

433
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,410
Dad.

434
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,140
You've really taken a toll
on your face since I last saw you.

435
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,980
That's because I've been
worried sick about you.

436
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,580
I'm doing fine.

437
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,950
You'd better be, after becoming...

438
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,750
a daughter-in-law of a rich family
behind my back.

439
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,990
If you wanted to soar that high,
you should be flying free.

440
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,360
I guess my wings
hadn't grown in all the way.

441
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,360
Or maybe they're just too heavy.

442
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,770
I realized it wasn't just vanity.

443
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,230
You weren't just coveting...

444
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,370
what wasn't yours or simply...

445
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,240
trying to steal from others.

446
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,240
I completely understand...

447
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,180
why you want to get revenge...

448
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,310
on the woman you hate and resent
for abandoning you.

449
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,150
But Jung Won,

450
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,850
you're the one who's suffering
the most from this.

451
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,220
The anger and resentment
are eating you alive.

452
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,430
Why are you so nice?

453
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,160
How can you be so forgiving?

454
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,700
What's the point of revenge?

455
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,470
She's already living
in her own nightmare.

456
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,370
I just know it.

457
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,040
What?

458
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,110
What if she was really
in an accident,

459
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,980
and that was why she couldn't
keep her promise to come get you?

460
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,810
Or maybe that accident...

461
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,320
was caused by Jin Tae Seok.

462
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,050
Just to stop Han Young Sun
from getting to you.

463
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,350
Nothing's changed.

464
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,420
If Jin Tae Seok finds out
you're really Su A,

465
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,230
he'll try to hurt you...

466
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,830
Chairman Jin already knows.

467
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,960
Jin Tae Seok knows? Are you sure?

468
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,740
That can't be.
Jin Tae Seok is a monster.

469
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,240
He's the one who framed me
for murder.

470
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,150
The Cha Jung Won written here...

471
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,480
is my daughter-in-law, right?

472
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,680
The one pretending
to be Joo Young Chae.

473
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,820
That's correct, sir.

474
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,790
Gong Nan Sook was right.

475
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,860
Su A was my daughter-in-law,
the fake Joo Young Chae.

476
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,000
Dad, it's an emergency!

477
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,040
Se Hoon,
what do you think you're doing?

478
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,900
The Kunhyang house means
nothing to me without Young Chae.

479
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,710
So I'm leaving as well.

480
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,580
Kunhyang's future is up to you,
and you're just going to leave?

481
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,980
You ungrateful brat!

482
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,280
If you walk out that door,
you might not be able to come back.

483
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,080
There are no exceptions,
not even for the heir to Kunhyang.

484
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,650
Can you live with that?

485
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,460
Seriously? You seduced Jin Se Hoon?

486
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,160
You'll really stoop to anything,
won't you?

487
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,060
But Jin Se Hoon thinks
you're really Su A.

488
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,930
He must have been so stunned.

489
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,000
So what if I am Su A?

490
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,040
Su A and Se Hoon
aren't blood-related, just like us.

491
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,010
You have feelings for Se Hoon?
You don't.

492
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,370
I like him.

493
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,180
No. I have to like him.

494
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,910
What kind of twisted logic is that?

495
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,320
They'll find out
I'm not the real Su A soon enough.

496
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,190
Why? Does Vice Chairman Han
suspect you?

497
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,360
I keep having close calls,
but I can't hold on for much longer.

498
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,020
Besides,
Chairman Jin Tae Seok already knows.

499
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,730
I'm walking on eggshells.

500
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,630
And your solution is
to seduce Jin Se Hoon?

501
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,960
If Se Hoon falls for me,
it's good for you too, isn't it?

502
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,470
You'd be free
to go after Cha Jung Won.

503
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,370
She knows that
you like Cha Jung Won too?

504
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,740
- You knew too, Mom?
- That's enough!

505
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,380
Regardless of how I feel
about Jung Won,

506
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,480
what you're doing to Se Hoon
is wrong.

507
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,780
- That makes it even more exciting.
- What?

508
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,220
Being righteous and honest,
doing things by the book,

509
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,890
it's all so boring.

510
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,060
That's my girl.

511
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,930
Whatever. Go back to
the Kunhyang house.

512
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,460
There's no need
to get yourself caught.

513
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,460
And while you're at it,
make a play for Jin Se Hoon.

514
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,770
You know what they say.
Dripping water wears down a stone.

515
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,770
How can you say something
like that to her?

516
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,000
Are you two out of your minds?

517
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,680
What's Jin Se Hoon doing here?

518
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,320
Don't tell me
he moved out of the Kunhyang house.

519
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,340
I'm going to be living here
starting today...

520
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
with Young Chae.

521
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,790
What if she was really
in an accident,

522
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,660
and that was why she couldn't
keep her promise to come get you?

523
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,470
Or maybe that accident...

524
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,000
was caused by Jin Tae Seok.

525
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,740
Just to stop Han Young Sun
from getting to you.

526
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,840
Could the accident
really have been deliberate?

527
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,760
Young Chae was always so kind,
affectionate, and thoughtful.

528
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,130
Why would she portray me like this?

529
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,070
How could she come
to hate me so much?

530
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,210
(My Daughter-in-law)

531
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,810
What's this about?

532
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,550
Let me just ask you one thing.

533
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:52,260
You said there was a major accident
25 years ago, right?

534
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,890
If that accident hadn't happened,
were you...

535
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,090
really going to come and get Su A?

536
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,560
Why are you asking the obvious?

537
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,630
Then why don't you recognize her?

538
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,930
Su A.

539
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,070
I am...

540
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:12,380
Su A.

541
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,390
(A Graceful Liar)

542
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,350
How would you feel
if we started over from the beginning?

543
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,890
What is she trying to expose now?

544
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,560
She's out of her mind.

545
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,530
Too many people know the real Su A
is our daughter-in-law.

546
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,630
What's gotten into you?
Is this amateur hour?

547
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,700
Leave it to me.

548
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,230
I'll deal with that
jerk Cha Ki Beom myself.

549
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,670
Did you give this music box
away to Young Chae?

550
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,740
I don't remember.

551
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,670
No, actually,
I think I wanted to forget.

552
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,740
You're not Su A. Who are you, then?

553
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,240
- Why did you...
- That's enough, Hye Ra!

554
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,840
You orchestrated this, didn't you?

555
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,450
She's not my daughter, is she?

556
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,380
