(Episode 54)

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,960
Why did you have a private meeting
with Chairman Jin?

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,400
Did you ask for his blessing
for you and Jung Won?

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,400
I declared war.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,900
Declared war?
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,230
He did something unforgivable.

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,570
Chairman Jin Tae Seok, I mean.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,640
You think my father was involved
in Cha Ki Beom's death?

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,010
Are you just going all out
because it's about Jung Won's dad?

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,080
It's about my father too.

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,250
What does my father have to do
with yours?

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,920
Chairman Gong Nan Sook is the one
who killed my father.

16
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,520
And it's very likely
Chairman Jin Tae Seok helped her.

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,420
Chairman Gong Nan Sook
and my father?

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,430
And to cover that up,
they framed Cha Ki Beom for murder?

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,800
Let's stop here for today.

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,100
So you share the same pain?

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,140
You and Jung Won?

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,140
Is that why you two
have such a special, tragic bond?

23
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,780
Jung Won and I both lost our fathers
to injustice.

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,350
And we're getting closer
to the hidden truth.

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,020
I've come to realize how much pain
Jung Won must endure...

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,060
and how hard she'll have to fight.

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,660
Shared pain...

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,230
and a shared goal?

29
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,960
So she shares something with you
that she doesn't with me?

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,100
Do you have any idea
how much that infuriates me?

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,770
It makes me want to hold
Jung Won even tighter.

32
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,740
Then...

33
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,110
why did you do that to Young Chae?

34
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,350
I saw you and Jung Won together,

35
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,920
and I lost it.

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,090
The fact that I could no longer be
with the woman I love...

37
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,790
drove me crazy. I felt so pathetic.

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,330
That's when Young Chae
came on to me.

39
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,200
- I wasn't thinking straight.
- Young Chae is my sister.

40
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,230
Don't use her to fill some void
or to take out your anger on.

41
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,100
Cut the protective big brother act.

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,440
Young Chae is a beautiful woman.

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,040
When she's all over you like that,
what man could say no?

44
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,420
- Let's just stop.
- No, you stop.

45
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,420
Don't push me.

46
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,620
Because I'm scared of
what I might become.

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,360
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

49
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,170
Did Chairman Gong Nan Sook
really go that far?

50
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,210
Then why would CEO Joo
declare war on you?

51
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,980
Declare war?

52
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,550
He's a fool who's biting off
more than he can chew.

53
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,710
The nerve of him.

54
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,680
How far were you involved?

55
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,320
Gong Nan Sook asked for my help.

56
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,420
She said she killed Joo Sang Cheol
during a fight.

57
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,420
What was I supposed to do?

58
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,030
At the time, Kunhyang...

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,600
was desperate for her money.

60
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,930
And what about Cha Ki Beom's death?

61
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,070
Are you hiding something?

62
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,440
I thought Vice Chairman Han
pushed him down the gallery stairs,

63
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,840
and that's how he died.

64
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,480
What would you do if you were me?

65
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,210
The woman you love
accidentally kills someone.

66
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,250
Would you be able to
handle the aftermath?

67
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,250
The Kunhyang family...

68
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,620
has become the sworn enemy
of Cha Jung Won and Joo Ha Neul.

69
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,060
Now do you see...

70
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,290
why you have to let Cha Jung Won go?

71
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,800
My head understands perfectly.

72
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
But...

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,530
my heart won't listen.

74
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,070
You, of all people,
should know that.

75
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,600
You have to be different from me.

76
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,610
The woman you want is
your mother's biological daughter.

77
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:00,350
That's not all.
She has a knife pointed at Kunhyang.

78
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,180
So what am I supposed to do?

79
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,450
Cut her off. No, not just her.

80
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,090
Make sure she can't dream of
pointing that knife at Kunhyang.

81
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,500
Our mother-daughter act is over,
but you still summon me on a whim.

82
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,230
Did you hear it too? The audio file?

83
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,900
After what you did,

84
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,810
how could you let Ha Neul
call you "Mother?"

85
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,640
That's not all you have to say,
is it?

86
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,610
How could you pin your crime...

87
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,580
on my poor, innocent father?

88
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,220
It wasn't my idea.

89
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,020
- Was it Chairman Jin Tae Seok?
- No.

90
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,770
Listen to who really framed
your father.

91
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,770
Tae Seok, I want to be with you.

92
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,480
Good decision.
Just come to the Yangpyeong Villa.

93
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,610
But I can't betray Ki Beom.

94
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,450
I can't live without you.

95
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,420
Then make it so I have no choice
but to leave Ki Beom.

96
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,790
How?

97
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,290
Do you want me
to throw him in prison?

98
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,360
Or frame him for murder?

99
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,790
That would be perfect.

100
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,360
After all,
I could never be a murderer's wife.

101
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,070
No way.

102
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,910
It's not true.

103
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,310
I went through a lot to get this.
Do you get it now?

104
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,910
Do you get what kind of person
your mother, Han Hye Ra, really is?

105
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,120
Why do you have this?

106
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,520
A recording like this
is easy enough to fake.

107
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,220
I was in Chairman Jin Tae Seok's car
for business.

108
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,390
Jin Tae Seok was the one driving,
I think.

109
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,660
- I just happened to overhear it.
- You're lying.

110
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,770
Believe me or don't. It's up to you.

111
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,140
But the Han Hye Ra you think
you know isn't the real her.

112
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,740
You need to know the truth
so you don't get played again.

I can't live without you.

115
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,220
Then make it so I have no choice
but to leave Ki Beom.

116
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,850
How?

117
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,860
Do you want me
to throw him in prison?

118
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,920
Or frame him for murder?

119
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,260
That would be perfect.

I could never be a murderer's wife.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,630
- You're saying I said that?
- You don't remember?

(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

123
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,880
I guess you won't tell me
even if I ask where you got this.

124
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,250
Just answer my question.

125
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm surprised that
it described exactly how I felt.

126
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,050
That's exactly how it was.

127
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,850
I knew it.

128
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,660
You wanted to be with
Chairman Jin Tae Seok,

129
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,190
so you needed an excuse.

130
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,760
You framed my dad as a murderer...

131
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,830
and tore me away from him?

132
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,400
Don't try to figure out
who was more at fault...

133
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,010
or why things happened
the way they did.

134
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,280
The more you find out,
the deeper you fall into the abyss.

135
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,780
Every answer you find will only lead
to more questions,

136
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,750
and you'll realize
just how terrifying your enemy is.

137
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,020
- That's exactly why I have to know.
- And once you know, what then?

138
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,390
I'll fight.

139
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,860
You'd be a candle in the wind.
It's David versus Goliath.

140
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,260
And in the end,
David defeated Goliath.

141
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,040
If I back down in fear,
nothing will ever change.

There's not even
a one-percent chance.

And how are you any different?

145
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,050
Do you really think
you're any better...

146
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,110
than Chairman Gong Nan Sook
or Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

147
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,020
The death of Ha Neul's father.

148
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,790
The death of my own dad.

149

You're tied to every single tragedy.

150

In fact, you might be the one
who started it all.

151

No.

152
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,060
Maybe you're the one
pulling Chairman Jin's strings.

153
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,370
Then I suppose
you'll have to destroy me first.

154
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,840
Go ahead, then.

155
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,910
But...

156
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,410
once you start, don't you dare
take a single step back.

157
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,450
Cut out the root of all this evil,
even if it's my heart.

158
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,320
Cut it out without mercy.

159
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,020
I will, with pleasure.

160
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,060
What? A fake recording?

161
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,260
Han Hye Ra is just going
to get a little hurt.

162
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,630
You didn't think to discuss this
with me first?

163
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,840
Since when did you start
playing around on top of my head?

164
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,570
What would've been the point?

165
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,340
You're so smitten with Han Hye Ra,

166
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,940
so you would've been against it.

167
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,340
What's your angle here?

168
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,950
What's with you?

169
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,810
We must split up
Han Hye Ra and Cha Jung Won forever.

170
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,220
There's a reason
blood is thicker than water.

171
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,820
This is the last time you pull
a stunt like this behind my back.

172
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,020
Fine.

173
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,490
Oh, gosh. I'm getting a call. Bye.

174
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,630
Hello? Gong Nan...

175
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,400
Did she just hang up on me again?

176
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,800
Did you make that fake recording?

177
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,410
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

178
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,910
What recording?

179
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,240
You're hearing of this
for the first time?

180
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,280
Yes.

181
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,350
Then why don't you seem surprised
at all?

182
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,150
I can't be surprised
if I don't know what you're saying.

183
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,850
It was a recording of the call
where I asked you for help.

184
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,690
The one where I asked you to frame
Cha Ki Beom for murder.

185
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,160
Did Cha Jung Won
play that recording for you?

186
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,500
But...

187
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,170
- why do you suspect me?
- Because you...

188
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,740
don't want Su A and me to be close.

189
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,740
Actually,

190
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,570
given the chance,

191
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,680
you'd want to get her
out of my sight.

192
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,480
That was a long time ago.
I've changed.

193
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,820
- How have you changed?
- I want to give you what you want.

194
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,520
You don't know what I want?

195
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,850
Why don't you tell me?

196
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,960
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

197
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,360
Is it true that you've missed her
for 25 years?

198
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,430
Do you even want to accept her
as your daughter?

199
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,700
I didn't make that recording.

200
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,140
But...

201
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,110
it does reflect how you really felt
back then, right?

202
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,610
I did miss Su A.

203
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,480
Now, I'm afraid of her.

204
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,510
When I look at her,

205
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,620
I'm reminded of the wrong I did her
and the terrible sin I committed.

206
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,820
She's a constant reminder.

207
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,030
That girl is poison to you now.

208
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,330
The kind that instantly spreads
through your whole body.

209
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,630
Before you even have a chance
to stop it,

210
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,140
she will be your ruin.

211
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,170
Do you want to sit?

212
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,610
- Having a tough time?
- Having a tough time?

213
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,760
Tell me.

214
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,260
Chairman Gong Nan Sook played...

215
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,630
the recorded call
between Chairman Jin...

216
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,960
and Vice Chairman Han...

217
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,800
from 25 years ago for me.

218
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,270
She was asking him
to frame my dad for murder.

219
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,850
It could be a fake.

220
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,950
But...

221
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,050
I'm surprised that
it described exactly how I felt.

222
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,560
That's exactly how it was.

223
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,770
My lunch break must be over.

224
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,870
Thanks for
always hearing me out first.

225
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,240
We can talk later about...

226
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,870
what you wanted to tell me.

227
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,770
(Kunhyang Group)

228
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,060
- Haven't you had lunch?
- I lost my appetite.

229
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,760
Perfect. Let's eat together.

230
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,340
You're acting like
you're my girlfriend or something.

231
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,040
Your girlfriend?

232
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,040
I like the sound of that.

233
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,110
Stop this nonsense.

234
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,210
Nonsense?

235
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,720
Was I the only one into it?

236
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,490
- You enjoyed it too, you know.
- I feel like I'm going crazy now,

237
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,990
so just leave.

238
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,240
The trend is that there is no trend.

239
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,610
Talk about a needle in a haystack.

240
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,790
Do you have any good ideas?

241
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,100
Now, individuality and originality
are more important than ever, right?

242
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,130
Fashion is a tool
for self-expression.

243
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,000
And people don't want
to look like everyone else.

244
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,480
How about this?

245
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,410
Linen?

246
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,680
- It's so soft.
- Silk.

247
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,850
- Organic cotton.
- They're all natural fabrics?

248
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,520
Fashion is so close to our skin,

249
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,860
so it's our most personal self-care.

250
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,730
- What do you think of the concept?
- I like it.

251
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,430
Using eco-friendly, healthy,
high-quality fabrics,

252
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,930
I'd like to present a tailored look.

253
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,340
Cha Jung Won.

254
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,470
I wonder what kind of design
she'll come up with.

255
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,110
What about this?

256
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,920
An ultra-luxurious, feminine look
for the untouchable upper class.

257
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,280
Ultra-luxurious?

258
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,790
Do you think clothes
for high-class will actually sell?

259
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,720
Everyone dreams of being high-class.

260
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,320
That's why we should be aiming
for high fashion.

261
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,100
If people can taste high-class
for a reasonable price,

262
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,300
who would say no to that?

263
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Hey.

264
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,700
Are you even paying attention
to this meeting?

265
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,100
Get a grip.

266
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,170
Says you. After you threw yourself
at Jin Se Hoon...

267
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,580
only to get shot down cold.

268
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,940
What?

269
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,110
Why did you bring me onto this team?

270
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,450
To make me watch you
try to win over Jin Se Hoon?

271
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,750
Hey, let's talk about this later.

272
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,420
No, forget it.
I won't be on your team! I can't!

273
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,360
Everyone is making good progress.
Remember our team dinner tonight?

274
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,270
(The Witch)

275
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,270
Don't you know I work
at the Design Team?

276
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,080
Why keep pulling me from there?

277
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,750
- Has Cha Jung Won said anything?
- Like what?

278
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,350
Everyone's swamped preparing
for next year's new collection.

279
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,920
- What about Han Hye Ra?
- Mom, what did you do now?

280
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,090
Goodness, why is everyone
being so quiet?

281
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,200
Sweetheart, whatever schemes I pull,

282
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,800
or if I dance on a knife's edge,

283
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,740
it's all for you,
my dear Young Chae.

284
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,340
Oh, please. You don't fool anyone.
You do it all for yourself.

285
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,870
Everyone knows you want
Kunhyang Group for yourself.

286
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,480
And if I get Kunhyang Group,
who do you think it'll go to?

287
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,450
What's wrong?

288
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,850
Did Jin Se Hoon give you
the cold shoulder again?

289
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,460
I don't know. I'm so frustrated.

290
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,320
On top of that, Ahn Ji Na
is stressing me out,

291
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,430
and that wench Jung Won is boasting
she'll beat me with her design.

292
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,630
Gosh, I'm going to lose my mind.

293
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,400
Why those little brats...

294
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,100
Chairman Gong Nan Sook?

295
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,000
How did you get my number?

296
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,010
Is there anything I don't know?

297
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,110
Hey, your father is
Assemblyman Ahn Jung Soo, correct?

298
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,210
Yes, he is. Why do you ask?

299
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,580
I make it a practice to keep a list
of people who've taken my money.

300
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,750
My father...

301
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,150
took money from you, Chairman Gong?

302
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,260
That's what they call
political funding, sweetie.

303
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,530
In other words,
your father's political career...

304
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,160
runs on my money.

305
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,460
What does that have to do with me?

306
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,170
Why am I surrounded by people...

307
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,170
who need me to spell
every single thing out for them?

308
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,770
What are you trying to say?

309
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,640
It means depending on my decision,
your father's political career...

310
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,980
could be over.

311
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,350
From now on, you'll shut your mouth
and take Young Chae's side.

312
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,750
And stop drooling over Jin Se Hoon.
Got it, you little brat?

313
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
We're done.

314
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,140
You've probably had enough tea.
Why don't we sit down and talk...

315
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,400
You piece of trash.

316
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,640
Oh, really?

317
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,310
I've let this slide,

318
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,550
but do you really think
I'm a pushover?

319
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,050
You forged a recording file
and sent it to my Su A?

320
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,290
Who sees right through you
better than I do?

321
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,790
For a crude loan shark like you,

322
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,800
you have the nerve to claim
you can read my mind?

323
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,070
Crude? Fine.

324
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,140
Jin Tae Seok is blinded by love,
so he has no idea what you think.

325
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,340
But I'm different.
I know everything.

326
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,450
You just have a prettier exterior,
but you're just like me.

327
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,620
How dare you compare me
to the likes of you?

328
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,790
I've always wondered about that.

329
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,960
Why would Jin Tae Seok, a greedy man
who'd step on anyone to get ahead,

330
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,790
choose you?

331
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,230
Because he loves me.

332
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,430
So why would he love you?

333
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,670
That's always bugged me.

334
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,070
You came from nothing,
had a pathetic, dirt-poor husband,

335
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,640
and even abandoned
your own young daughter.

336
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,670
Why would he love you, Han Hye Ra?

337
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,810
Was being his first love all it took
for him to accept you...

338
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,410
even after knowing everything?
Are you really that special?

339
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,850
You went from being a nobody
to the Kunhyang's matriarch,

340
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,420
and you think you deserve respect
with that gentle, elegant smile?

341
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,730
- My goodness.
- So the rumor was true.

342
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,660
And here I thought
it was just a silly rumor.

343
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,060
- What was?
- When you were single,

344
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,870
you sent a photo of yourself
to Kunhyang through a matchmaker.

345
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,240
And that photo was thrown out
without Jin Tae Seok ever seeing it.

346
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,210
This is embarrassing.
Did you see it? Who told you that?

347
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,380
Was that why?

348
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,480
That's why you've been trying
to sabotage me and bring me down.

349
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,920
Oh, my.

350
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,850
Are you jealous?

351
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,390
Jealous? Why would I be?

352
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,130
What do I have to be jealous of?
What do I lack?

353
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,260
My looks? My body?

354
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,600
- My brains? What?
- You want to love and be loved.

355
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,600
But you've never had that.

356
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Darn.

357
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,470
I don't care
how you've lived your life...

358
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,310
or how you choose to live it now.

359
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,150
But just remember one thing.

360
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,410
As for my relationship with Su A,

361
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,180
don't you dare meddle in it again.

362
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,920
I can't believe the nerve.

363
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,560
Hey, has it ever occurred
to you to thank me?

364
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Why are you so attached
to a daughter...

365
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,290
who just showed up in her 30s?

366
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,400
Besides, she's running around,
making a scene about her revenge.

367
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,400
You're the one
who came to me complaining.

368
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,540
That you were sick of your daughter
and her sob story about abandonment.

369
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,740
And you were so sick
of the maternal love thing...

370
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,110
that you wanted to throw it out.

371
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,180
Isn't that true?

372
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,280
That's my business and my choice.

373
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,280
Gong Nan Sook, I won't stand...

374
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,620
for your meddling anymore. You see,

375
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,520
I'm not the same Han Hye Ra
I used to be.

376
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,790
Remember that.

377
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,590
I'll be sure to remember.

00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,130
I'm already grateful

Why are you working
with your sleeves rolled up?

381

I can't let you struggle
all by yourself, Mom.

Oh, it looks like
today's not a good day.

383

I'll come back another time.

You may have walked in on your own,
but you're not leaving so easily.

an extra pair of hands today.

I'm in!

388

Oh, my goodness,
with so many pretty ladies here,

389
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,870
the whole place just lights up.

390
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,640
Not there. Over here.

391
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,940
Shouldn't you be taking our order?

392
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,080
So you're the director.

393
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,650
That's very impressive
for someone so young.

Please take good care
of our Jung Won.

395
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,320
You're the mother who raised
Ms. Cha Jung Won, correct?

396
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,960
But last time, you said you were
Designer Kim Sung Hee's aunt.

397
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,390
Sometimes in life,

398
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,460
you must tell white lies
you don't mean to.

Director Jin,
can we really order a lot?

406
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,680
Of course.

407
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,120
Hey, Part-timer Hwang!
Bring us the meat!

00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,030
Manager Hwang?

409
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,860
- Did you call him here?
- Manager Hwang is a regular here.

410
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,830
That's right.
I'm just helping out for the day.

411

Please enjoy your meal.

It just melts in your mouth.

413
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,230
You should eat up too.

You need to put some meat
on your bones.

415
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,830
Thanks. You too, Ji Na. Eat up.

416

How dare she bring us
to Jo Mi Hyang's restaurant?

420
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,050
How brazen of her.

421
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,850
I have nothing to hide
or run from anymore.

422
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,590
What about you?
Do you feel no shame?

423
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,830
Why did you ask me
to come to your home?

424
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,570
Nothing much. I just wanted to
give you a proper, home-cooked meal.

425
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,680
You didn't have to go
to all this trouble.

426
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,780
It occurred to me
that I don't know...

427
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,850
a single thing about
what you like to eat.

428
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,390
I'm not a picky eater.

429
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:57,360
Good! Let's see you eat two bowls
like you did last time, okay?

430

Grandma is telling me
you should be careful of a woman.

431
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,300
What? What's that supposed to mean?

432
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,110
Our Chef Hong here is
a pretty good judge of character.

433
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,410
I guess your fortune says you'll be
surrounded by many women.

434
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,810
What good does that do me...

435
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,050
when the woman I love
is in love with someone else?

436
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,580
She says you're not meant to be
with that woman.

437
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,250
Who is that woman?

438
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,660
Joo Young Chae.

439
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,360
Grandma!

440
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,740
The old Joo Young Chae...

441
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,740
- or the current Joo Young Chae?
- I wouldn't know.

442
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,410
I'm just passing on
what Grandma tells me.

Please enjoy your meal.

444
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,750

the old Joo Young Chae.

with Young Chae, right?

The real Joo Young Chae!

450
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,770
You even slept together,
and now you're going to play dumb?

451
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,800
Do you really think
any of this makes sense?

452
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,740
That I must be with Joo Young Chae,
no matter what?

453
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,580
Whether she's the real one or not?

454
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,040
That's how it is on paper.

455
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,510
To be more precise,
as long as I work with Kunhyang,

456
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,220
- we must remain in-laws.
- I have feelings too.

457
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,590
I need to find out for myself...

458
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,620
if I can even sort out
my own feelings.

459
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,860
And I need time to do that.

460
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,090
It's not that
you dislike Young Chae, is it?

461
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,430
So there's a chance?

462
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,870
Thank you for dinner.

463
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,400
But in the future,
I'd appreciate it...

464
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,200
if you didn't make me
so uncomfortable.

465
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,280
What? So they can sleep together,
but she can't be with him?

Did you have to ruin everything?

the honorifics?

00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,330
When did I do that?

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960

00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,810
Do you think I'll go easy on you
because you're Hye Ra's daughter?

518
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,810
I wouldn't provoke me
if I were you, kid.

519
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,110
It looks like Se Hoon
suspects Vice Chairman Han.

520
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,350
What about the security footage?

521
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,610
The footage from the hall and room
was deleted...

522
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:00,820
right before Vice Chairman Han
got here and left.

523
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,690
Someone's trying to frame me.

524
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,890
