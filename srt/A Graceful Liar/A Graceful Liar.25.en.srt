1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,670
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,070
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,180
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,850
To be absolutely sure,

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,020
this is the only way.

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,940
How can she call herself
a human being?

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,970
(3 days ago)

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,170
And she calls herself a mother?

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,080
Where is that woman?
Take me to her, right now!

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,110
No.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,720
Meeting Young Chae's mother
won't change anything, Dad.

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,350
I'm the problem.

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,520
I want to keep living
as Joo Young Chae.

14
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,290
Were you that ashamed of me
as your father?

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,630
I wasn't ashamed.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,100
I'm still not.

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,670
- But...
- But what?

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,340
I can't spread my wings and fly!

19
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,740
Not as long as I'm your daughter.

20
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,580
And what is "flying" to you?

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,010
Using a fake name
and a fake family...

22
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,150
to marry into a conglomerate family?

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,350
- That's right.
- It's a dream you'll wake up from.

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,090
That place and life are not yours!

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
It's all going to come
crashing down.

26
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,360
Stop this now. Please, Jung Won.

27
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,800
It's too unfair not to even try
just because I might fail.

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,170
That rich heir...

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,610
doesn't know you're Cha Jung Won,
does he?

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,810
Se Hoon loves me.

31
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,680
He would love me
even if I weren't Joo Young Chae.

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,010
But he thinks you're someone else.

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
Is that really love?

34
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,420
What about you? Do you love him?

35
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,450
He's not bad.

36
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,750
No, I do like him.

37
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,060
The adoring look in his eyes,

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,430
his expression, and his smile.

39
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,830
That feeling is not real love,
Jung Won!

40
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,830
I don't care!

41
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,900
Does love have to be passionate?

42
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,240
All that passion does
is burn you out.

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,540
I prefer a comfortable warmth.

44
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,570
As long as it brightens
my future and life,

45
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,380
and gives me wings.
That's all I need.

46
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,810
Wrens should live like wrens.
Why are you trying to be a stork?

47
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,110
I'm not a wren!

48
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,820
Just because you're a wren,
don't you dare treat me like one!

49
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,620
I'm a stork!

50
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,990
I don't need to be your daughter!

51
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,460
No, I don't want
to be your daughter!

52
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,060
How dare you!

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,170
This is my fault.

54
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,670
It's because I'm a failure.

55
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,010
He may not understand now,

56
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,120
but someday he'll see
why I did this.

57
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,790
A small wedding?

58
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
You know the saying,
"like mother, like daughter?"

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,230
It certainly doesn't apply to you
and your daughter, Chairman Gong.

60
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,500
I thought you would want them to wed
on a luxury cruise ship.

61
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,140
I was the one who wanted
a small wedding.

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,270
But why?

63
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,140
They're not celebrities.
The paparazzi are a hassle.

64
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,880
And can you imagine the headlines
about an over-the-top wedding?

65
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,280
And most of all, the guest list.
It's a headache to put together.

66
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,590
Exactly. Then you have to deal with
who got an invite and who didn't.

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,720
And don't even get me started
on the seating chart.

68
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,260
You took the words right
out of my mouth.

69
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,400
Guests complaining that someone
"beneath" them got a better table.

70
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,500
Let's not even go there.
We should keep it simple.

71
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,440
After so long, Chairman Gong,
we're seeing completely eye to eye.

72
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,910
After all, you and I have been
through thick and thin...

73
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,110
for nearly 30 years.

74
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,980
The fact that nothing has changed
between us in three decades...

75
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,220
means we're a real family...

76
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,560
I have to take this, it's urgent.

77
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,520
Let's talk later.

78
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,760
(Kunhyang Group,
Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

79
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,560
Family? Coming from
a low-life loan shark?

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,130
As if I can't see her scheme
to marry off her daughter...

81
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,500
to get in with my family.

82
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,140
Hello? Hello...

83
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,540
What could possibly be more urgent
than their wedding?

84
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,150
And what happened to when you were
dying for the cash in my safe?

85
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,050
You're so transparent.
I see right through you.

86
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,550
A "small wedding?"

87
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,010
Are you Mr. Hiccups?

88
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,020
I was hoping we could meet.

89
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,320
Have you been crying?

90
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,870
It's okay.

91
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,810
If you need to cry,
just let it all out.

92
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,510
Get it all out of your system.

93
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,200
An artist pours their heart and soul
into their paintings.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,140
Are you sure you're okay to paint
in this condition?

95
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,140
It's fine.
I'm very fond of my model.

96
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,460
I knew it.

97
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,260
Mr. Hiccups.

98
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,530
So you knew everything all along.

99
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,370
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,970
And do you know the whole story?

101
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,780
Please, you don't have to be formal.
Just talk to me like you did before.

102
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,020
My daughter's life is on the line.

103
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,550
I need to know how she ended up
pretenting someone else...

104
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,690
and why she's stuck floundering
in this absurd fantasy.

105
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,190
I know this is a lot to ask,

106
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,460
but for just a little while,

107
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,460
could you please just wait and see
what happens?

108
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you involved
in this whole thing?

109
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,170
It's a personal matter
for my family as well.

110
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,010
What do you mean?

111
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,980
Joo Young Chae.

112
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,380
She's my younger sister.

113
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,550
Joo Ha Neul.

114
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,460
Joo Young Chae.

115
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,860
They have the same last name,

116
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,560
but it never occurred to me
they could be siblings.

117
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,370
Did you pretend to be my son-in-law
to fool me?

118
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,530
What’s your game?

119
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,800
How far are you planning
to drag my Jung Won down?

120
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,810
That wasn't my intention at all.
In fact, I...

121
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,780
I feel terrible for Jung Won,

122
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,180
and I'm worried about her.

123
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,890
If you feel that way,
you should've stopped her instead.

124
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,820
I didn't mean to,
but I suppose that's how it looks.

125
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,330
It's not too late.

126
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,730
We can still make things right.
If you'll just help me...

127
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,200
This is too tangled a web
to unravel now.

128
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,230
All we have to do is
reveal the truth.

129
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,970
I won't let your family use Jung Won
for their own greedy ambitions.

130
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,140
I need to meet with your mother.

131
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,850
- Right now.
- My mother...

132
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,150
is not someone
who will bend her will.

133
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,350
If anything, Jung Won and you...

134
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,190
will only end up getting hurt
even more.

135
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,910
What on earth is she like?

136
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,420
You want to fly?

137
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,860
Then fly.

138
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,960
I'll give you a push.

139
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,230
No, it's okay. I was just saying.

140
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,770
It's just a swing. It's no big deal.

141
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,170
My point exactly.
What's stopping you from riding it?

142
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,570
All right.

143
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,950
I have to stop this, no matter what.

144
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,910
She's my daughter.

145
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,480
I have to protect her.

146
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,560
Let's call it a day.

147
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,630
I was struggling to hold my breath.

148
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,070
I never told you not to breathe.

149
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,670
- I didn't want my stomach to show.
- What stomach? You're so slim.

150
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,110
You're the queen of self-care,
Mother.

151
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,440
That compliment means even more...

152
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,810
since it's from
my future daughter-in-law.

153
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,710
It's not a compliment. It's a fact.

154
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,850
Let me get you something to drink.
I'll be right back.

155
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,700
Happy birthday to you

156
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,840
Happy birthday, dear Mommy

157
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,580
Happy birthday to you

158
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,920
Mother.

159
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,830
Thank you.

160
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,200
You added extra grapefruit?

161
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,930
I thought you could use some sugar.

162
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,540
Which doll is your favorite?

163
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,550
Except for this one.

164
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,160
It looks a little worn.
Does this one have special meaning?

165
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
Yes.

166
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,770
This one looks good.

167
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,880
Should I put it here?

168
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,550
No, that's not right.
It'll look better standing up.

169
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,050
How pretty.

170
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,890
Yes?

171
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,690
Did you have a nice time out?

172
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,660
I did. She even got me a gift.

173
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,560
What?

174
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,360
But that's the gift I gave her...

175
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,630
after I won it at the claw machine.

176
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,170
Oh, dear. Is my son feeling
a little jealous?

177
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,610
I didn't realize
I could be so jealous.

178
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,810
Come on.

179
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,710
Here, take it back then.
Go on, take it.

180
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,010
No.

181
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,790
Jung Won has a heart of gold.

182
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:11,130
I don't know what made her
go off the rails like this, though.

183
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,800
She says she wants to fly.

184
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,800
What's that supposed to mean?

185
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,140
How can a person fly?
It's not like we have wings.

186
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,310
I'm so sorry.

187
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,910
Why?

188
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,680
Is it because of me...

189
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,880
that Jung Won is changing her name
and background...

190
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,580
to marry into a rich family?

191
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,620
It's all my fault.

192
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,350
There's no better father than you.

193
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,490
You'd walk through fire
for Jung Won.

194
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,700
So which rich family
is she marrying into?

195
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,730
The one passing Jung Won off
as her own daughter...

196
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,470
and marry her to a rich family.

197
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,470
Who is that brainless woman?

198
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,580
Mr. Hiccups...

199
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,710
and that girl, Joo Young Chae
or whatever.

200
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,150
He is her older brother, right?

201
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,850
Mr. Hiccups' company name was...

202
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,090
It was Sky Que... something...

203
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,820
Right, Question. It's Sky Question.

204
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,860
"Sky Question"?

205
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,270
"The Crown Capital."

206
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,970
It says Gong Nan Sook.

207
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,640
So that wench is the one
behind all this!

208
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,210
(CEO of Global AI Startup,
Joo Ha Neul)

209
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,270
(Revealed as Son of Crown Capital
Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

210
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,880

Joo Ha Neul)

211
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,410
(Revealed as Son of Crown Capital
Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

212
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,110
Gong Nan Sook?

213
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,560
I'm here to see the chairman.

214
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,270
Do you have an appointment?

215
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,500
I don't have an appointment,

216
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,110
but it's urgent that I see her.
Please, I ask you.

217
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,510
I'm sorry, sir.

218
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,950
Then could you at least give me
her number?

219
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,720
I must speak
with Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

220
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,720
Security, please come
to the lobby, now.

221
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,250
I'm begging you here. Please.

222
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,830
Hey, let go of me. I said, let go!

223
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,830
Gong Nan Sook, come out here!

224
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,500
Gong Nan Sook!

225
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,630
I said, come out! Gong Nan Sook!

226
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,030
Gong Nan Sook, come out here!

227
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,930
Gong Nan Sook, come out here!

228
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
- Let me go!
- That's Cha Ki Beom, right?

229
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,210
- Gong Nan Sook, come out!
- Yes, he is.

230
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,340
Come out!

231
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,610
- Gong Nan Sook!
- Bring him to me. Quietly.

232
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,580
Gong Nan Sook!

233
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,180
Darn it.

234
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,570
So it was you.

235
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,800
You were the monster who
passed my daughter off as your own.

236
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,140
You were that desperate to become
in-laws with a conglomerate family?

237
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,710
You could've used your own daughter,
who ran away to Paris,

238
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,580
even if you had to leash her!

239
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,650
Why are you toying
with my daughter's life?

240
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,490
You are barking up
the completely wrong tree.

241
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,760
What?

242
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,660
Frankly, your daughter's life
was a pathetic pile of trash.

243
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,200
I'm turning it into a rose garden.
So why are you so upset?

244
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,400
I just don't get it.

245
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,570
You should be on your knees
thanking me.

246
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,300
If you dig a little deeper
into that "rose garden,"

247
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,040
it's obvious it's nothing
but sand, gravel, and mud.

248
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,440
What? "Thanking you"?

249
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
"On my knees"?

250
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,910
Watch your darn mouth.

251
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,550
You really don't know
your own daughter, do you?

252
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,060
You think I wanted to pass
your daughter off as my own?

253
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,390
I would've written
my own daughter off as dead...

254
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,170
than let that devious Cha Jung Won
marry into the Kunhyang family.

255
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,230
Shut it!

256
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,140
I guess it takes one to know one.

257
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,440
Of course, Jung Won wouldn't seem
good to someone as wicked as you.

258
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,210
Do you know what she said to me?

259
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,720
She said she'd rather die
than stop living as Young Chae.

260
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,850
Is it really that sweet?
Living as Young Chae?

261
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,290
It's so sweet...

262
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,120
that it's intoxicating.

263
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,330
Like a moth to a flame,

264
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,300
she'd willingly fly into the fire?

265
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,500
Why on earth would Jung Won
say something like that?

266
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,870
I guess being the daughter
of a murderer...

267
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,470
must've been worse
than death for her.

268
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,340
You.

269
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
You know who I am?

270
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,780
How could I not?

271
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,850
My ex-husband, Joo Sang Cheol.

272
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,690
You killed him.

273
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,100
And you are?

274
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,970
You don't need to know my name,

275
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,770
but I felt I should thank you.

276
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,670
What?

277
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,010
For getting rid of my husband,
Joo Sang Cheol..

278
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,450
for me.

279
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,550
You must have really hated him
to say something like that.

280
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,350
Are you here
looking for my sympathy?

281
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,530
I'm not the one
who killed your husband.

282
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,300
Does anyone in this world
not suffer injustice?

283
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,530
Just consider it an act of charity.

284
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,370
It wasn't me. I didn't kill him!

285
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,510
You were...

286
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,980
Joo Sang Cheol's wife.

287
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,220
No way.

288
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,090
Are you using my Jung Won
to get revenge on me?

289
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,890
Revenge?

290
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,460
You think that lowlife,
Joo Sang Cheol,

291
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,300
is even worth getting revenge for?

292
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,000
If it hadn't been you, Cha Ki Beom,

293
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,440
- I would've killed that man myself.
- I didn't kill him!

294
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,340
The truth doesn't matter.

295
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,350
You are the one...

296
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,050
- who killed Joo Sang Cheol.
- Stop spouting nonsense!

297
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,550
If you really didn't do it,

298
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,090
how can you treat the truth
like it's garbage?

299
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,690
To me, who was framed as a murderer,

300
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,200
and to my daughter, who's been
branded a murderer's child,

301
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,630
the truth is a life-or-death matter.

302
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,370
And both of your lives...

303
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,970
are right in the palm of my hand.

304
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,840
I want your father's life.

305
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,780
The man who murdered my ex-husband.
I'm going to kill him myself.

306
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,450
I was wrong.

307
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,550
I was arrogant and foolish.

308
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,650
Please spare my father.

309
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,560
To save my life, my Jung Won...

310
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,860
has to become your puppet?

311
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,000
She's quite the devoted daughter.

312
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,170
To save her precious father,

313
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,300
she'd gladly lay down her own life.

314
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,770
If you ever breathe a word of this,

315
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,910
you and your daughter...

316
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,480
will be dead in my hands.

317
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,210
You think a pathetic threat
like that scares me?

318
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,580
And I'd just let you
ruin my daughter's life?

319
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,150
Don't you dare...

320
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,320
toy with Jung Won's life
as you please.

321
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,730
I won't let you get away with this,
Gong Nan Sook!

322
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,270
Gosh, seriously...

323
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,840
Why hasn't Ki Beom called me?

324
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,640
He went to see Gong Nan Sook
and must've lost it on her.

325
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,040
What if he got hauled off
to the police station?

326
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,980
Ki Beom!

327
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,220
Did you meet with Gong Nan Sook?

328
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,650
What did she say?

329
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,560
Ki Beom! Are you
killing me with this suspense?

330
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,240
(The Crown Capital)

331
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,680
Cha Ki Beom must have been
pretty shaken up.

332
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,090
He made it seem like I was dead set
on ruining his daughter's life.

333
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,750
Let's be real. If it weren't for me,

334
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,560
could she dream
of marrying into a rich family?

335
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,630
Cha Ki Beom is going to...

336
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,030
- stop this marriage.
- How so?

337
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,200
Listen, even if the sky falls,
Cha Jung Won will marry Jin Se Hoon.

338
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,300
I'd bet my life on it.

339
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,400
He knows whose son I am now.
So I can't keep...

340
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,610
spying on his family anymore.

341
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,550
Why? Are you sad to see it end?
Have you grown fond of them?

342
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,780
What are you going to do now?

343
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,250
Why don't you meet with her?

344
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,660
- Me?
- She opens up to you...

345
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,760
after playing siblings for so long.

346
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,370
For some reason,
whenever I see Mother's painting,

347
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
my heart aches.

348
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,190
- Let's talk about this some more.
- There's nothing to talk about.

349
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,080
My daughter's life is more important
than mine.

350
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,880
Give up this fake life.

351
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,220
Please.

352
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,100
How can I stop now
after coming all this way?

353
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
No way.

354
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,640
I can never go back.

355
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,740
I'm not a wren!

356
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,340
Just because you're a wren,
don't you dare treat me like one!

357
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,350
I'm a stork!

358
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,280
I don't need to be your daughter!

359
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,850
No, I don't want
to be your daughter!

360
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,490
How dare you!

361
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,560
This is my fault.

362
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,170
It's because I'm a failure.

363
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
I'm a stork.

364
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,380
The wren life has to end
with your generation, Dad.

365
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,700
It must be cold out there.

366
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,600
Do you hate the thought
of me succeeding that much?

367
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,940
- Enough to make you want to die?
- If you want to marry rich,

368
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,510
do it with your head held high
as my daughter, Cha Jung Won.

369
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,950
Then you'll have my blessing.

370
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,280
How is that even possible...

371
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,620
for someone like me?

372
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,750
Then give up.

373
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,690
Just give up
on this pipe dream, please.

374
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,030
After everything I've done
to get here!

375
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,100
Why are you trying to stop me? Why?

376
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,100
You said you would risk my life,
didn't you?

377
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,670
You said you'd obey
Gong Nan Sook, right?

378
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,040
My life? If it's for you,

379
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,380
I'd give up a dozen times over.

380
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,750
But when it comes
to ruining my daughter's life,

381
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,380
I will risk my own life to stop it.

382
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,550
- Please don't marry him.
- Dad!

383
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,390
Rather than be the father
who ruins his own child's life,

384
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,330
I'd rather end my own life.

385
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,160
Dad, don't say that!

386
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,040
I won't do it!

387
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,570
I'm not getting married!

388
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,650
I apologize for insisting on meeting
at your home.

389
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,820
Please, come and have a seat.

390
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,560
I was hoping we could speak
somewhere quiet.

391
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,360
You can wait in my study.
I'll go make some tea.

392
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
It's okay.

393
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,990
I can do anything for my dad.

394
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,010
I drew this when I was a kid.

395
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,980
What's this doing here?

396
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:54,540
(A Graceful Liar)

397
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,000
Are you ready to be Cha Jung Won?

398
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,770
How am I supposed to live as her?

399
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,680
That's the only way for you
to be Joo Young Chae again.

400
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
As soon as
she marries Jin Se Hoon...

401
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,610
Are you really Joo Young Chae?

402
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,180
Just get us through today.

403
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,150
Then three percent
of Kunhyang's shares will be ours.

404
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,490
It'll belong to the chairman,
no, I mean, to my mother.

405
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,490
- So you're calling off the wedding?
- I need to confirm one thing first.

406
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,060
That woman who abandoned me,
Han Young Sun.

407
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,430
Don't you ever mention
that woman's name again.

408
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,200
How could a mother
forget her own child?

409
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,730
Su A.

410
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,800
There's no way Vice Chairman Han
could be my mother.
