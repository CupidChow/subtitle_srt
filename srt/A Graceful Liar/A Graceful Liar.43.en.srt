1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,940
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,440
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,210
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,560
What's wrong with these prawns?

5
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,900
Oh, no.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,740
I think Young Chae
added the wrong ingredient.

7
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,070
Did you cook this yourself,
Young Chae?

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,910
Yes. I'm sorry, Mother.
I made a mistake...

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,590
As head of the kitchen,
the mistake was mine.

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,950
I've remade it
with the greatest care.

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,290
Now, this is
how it's supposed to taste.

12
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,300
For a moment there,
I thought Vice Chairman Han...

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,630
had ruined it with vinegar
on purpose.

14
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,220
Say that again, Manager Hwang.

15
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,730
The anonymous post was made
directly from this phone.

16
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,300
We found traces
that the records were then deleted.

17
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,600
So you're saying
it's 100 percent certain?

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,900
That's correct.

19
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,640
Honey.

20
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,210
It is time for
the Kunhyang Association members...

21
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,310
to head home.

22
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,750
Will you be all right?

23
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,520
(Episode 43)

24
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,260
Su A.

25
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,020
Vinegar?

26
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,020
You should've been more careful.

27
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,990
How could you make such a mistake
for such an important event?

28
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,160
Did you do this?

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,000
- What?
- This was sesame oil before.

30
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,000
- Stop trying to pin this on me.
- Why would you sabotage the food?

31
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,740
You did this just to humiliate me
in front of everyone.

32
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,970
It wasn't me.

33
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,080
I said it wasn't me!

34
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,080
What do you think you're doing?

35
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,220
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,930
This is all my fault.

37
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,560
What's going on? What's happening?
What's wrong?

38
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,530
What's wrong, Su A?

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What...

40
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,740
Who did this?

41
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,500
Did you do this?

42
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,810
- No, I didn't.
- She even slapped me.

43
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,680
I swear I didn't do anything.

44
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,510
You did it!

45
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,150
This is all your doing!

46
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,520
What in the world is going on?

47
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,160
Why are you giving Young Chae
a hard time again?

48
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,330
Se Hoon, you stay out of this!

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,370
Come to my study, Young Chae.

50
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,110
A surprise hug from Se Mi?

51
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,190
I know that must have been awkward
for you to see, but...

52
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,790
Could you two become a couple?

53
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,150
- There is!
- Absolutely not.

54
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,730
Se Mi is Se Hoon's little sister,
and your daughter, sir.

55
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,360
- She's like a cute sister to me...
- But you think I'm cute?

56
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,700
Hey, stop fooling around!

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,470
I'm sorry, sir.

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,840
Stop putting CEO Joo
in a tough spot.

59
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,940
- Just take it slow.
- I don't know if I can.

60
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,940
She's the apple of my eye.
Please cut her some slack, CEO Joo.

61
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,180
Things have been a little chaotic
within the Kunhyang family lately.

62
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,920
Let's grab a drink
once things settle down.

63
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,190
Yes, sir.

64
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,060
By the way, the anonymous post
and the article about Su A.

65
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,790
Did Young Chae really do it?

66
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,630
I'm asking if it's been confirmed.

67
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,330
That's right. It was Young Chae.

68
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,700
Your sister is the one who did it.

69
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,900
You're 100 percent certain?

70
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,440
You need to see this for yourself,
Chairman.

71
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,720
You called for me, Mother?

72
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,930
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

73
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,530
- What?
- You wanted to humiliate me...

74
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,230
before the Kunhyang Association members...

75
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,870
by messing with the food.

76
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,430
It was a mistake.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,440
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up!

78
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,510
A mistake is still my fault.

79
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,410
I'll be careful to make sure
it never happens again...

80
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,980
We found you wrote...

81
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,790
the anonymous post using that phone,
and then deleted the history.

82
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,890
Your father-in-law
confirmed it himself!

83
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,070
This is Han Hye Ra.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,440
Come and get your daughter,
Chairman Gong.

85
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,380
Young Chae is no longer
a daughter-in-law...

86
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,580
of the Kunhyang family.

87
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,160
"Come and get your daughter?"

88
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,290
So they're really throwing her out?

89
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,860
Did Madam Sa really twist the knife?

90
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,370
Or did my Young Chae
really drop a bombshell?

91
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,270
Gosh, I'm dying of curiosity.

92
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,340
Should I just go and drag her back?

93
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,940
I would advise you to be patient
for just a little longer.

94
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,710
- "Advise?"
- Yes.

95
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,850
Hey. Just because I let you eat
at my table for once,

96
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,750
you think we're friends now?

97
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,720
Go on, drop the formalities!

98
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,690
- No, ma'am.
- Why you...

99
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,830
I've committed a grave sin.
Please, don't feed me to the fishes.

100
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,260
You just never get it.

101
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,870
Go get me a glass of water!

102
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,970
I'll bring you cold water, ma'am.

103
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,070
- Or perhaps warm water...
- Bring me cold water! Cold water!

104
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,470
Right away, ma'am.

105
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,010
Sometimes I swear
he does that on purpose.

106
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,910
Honestly...

107
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,590
What is it? I'm busy.

108
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,960
Hey, Han Hye Ra demanded
I go and get your sister-in-law.

109
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,490
So it worked? Unbelievable.

110
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,000
You're my daughter, after all.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,570
I thought you were a bear cub,
but you turned out to be a fox cub.

112
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,670
You've got
some impressive new moves.

113
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,170
"Moves?" I did a whole trapeze act.

114
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,710
Don't let it become a clown act.
One slip and you come crashing down.

115
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,010
One wrong move, and it's all over...

116
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,750
I said I'm busy.
I'm not done fanning the flames yet.

117
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
I'm hanging up.

118
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,620
Hey, Young Chae! Hey, Su A, wait...

119
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,590
These kids are always hanging up
on me first.

120
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,560
It's really ticking me off.

121
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,100
Chef Hong, where are you?
Get over here right now.

122
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,440
There was a sliver of hope...

123
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,010
that you weren't behind this.

124
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,110
I was so fond of you.

125
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,340
I thought of you as my own daughter.

126
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,580
- Remembering that time hurts.
- I was wrong.

127
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,420
So you're admitting you did it?

128
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,550
I didn't do it.

129
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,060
But I made it impossible
for you to trust me.

130
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,090
- It's my fault.
- You're lying.

131
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,290
It's the truth.

132
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,930
But I don't believe
the anonymous post was a lie.

133
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,400
- What?
- I asked my contacts in New York...

134
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,800
and looked into Hwang Mi Soo's art.

135
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,270
You looked into me behind my back?

136
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,110
I wanted to know the truth.

137
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,280
- And?
- From your work,

138
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,810
the way you use colors,
to your brushwork,

139
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,680
I realized they're nearly identical
to Hwang Mi Soo's work.

140
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,090
I don't know what kind of person...

141
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,490
you are, Mother.

142
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,790
I don't know if you're the woman
I thought you were.

143
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,160
- I'm so confused.
- And you believed all of that?

144
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,430
Is that why you so brazenly did
what you did?

145
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,130
Are you scared?

146
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,840
- What?
- Regardless of who wrote that post,

147
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,310
if the anonymous post isn't true,

148
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,210
then it shouldn't bother you, right?

149
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,950
The point is...

150
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,910
that you're the one who did it.

151
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,120
My trusted daughter-in-law
slandered and smeared my name,

152
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,060
and is adamant on digging up
my past.

153
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
Do you...

154
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,260
have any idea
how deeply that wounds me?

155
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,800
I don't think...

156
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,770
I can ever forgive you.

157
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,440
Mom, it's all my fault.

158
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,040
She tampered with the food...

159
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,650
and wrote that anonymous post
on a separate phone.

160
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,720
That's because I showed up
out of the blue.

161
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,720
Please forgive Young Chae.

162
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,020
Stop it!

163
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,760
- You're the one who did all this!
- Are you blaming Su A again?

164
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,230
What has my Su A ever done to you?

165
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,970
Do you dislike the fact
that she’s my daughter?

166
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,100
No, Mother.

167
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,140
Yes, you do.

168
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,570
Come on, Young Chae.
You've hated me since high school.

169
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,440
That's enough, Joo Young Chae.

170
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,410
Why should I?
This is way too much fun!

171
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,820
I said stop!

172
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,650
That phone
that was part of your plan, right?

173
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,990
Stay away from Su A.

174
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,290
Don't you dare touch my daughter!

175
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,560
Please, that's enough!

176
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,900
Come with me.

177
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,270
Don't do this, Se Hoon.

178
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,540
You're just making this harder
if you do this in front of Mother.

179
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,810
I know, but...

180
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,010
I can't stand to watch this.

181
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,310
The way my mother and Su A
treat you so horribly.

182
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,750
Let's say you wrote
the anonymous post secretly about my mom.

183
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,350
Let's say you leaked Su A's story too.

184
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,460
But it's true!
Mother lied about her entire past!

185
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,830
But it wasn't me.

186
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,100
- If you doubt me, what do I do?
- Young Chae.

187
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,670
Why is she still here?

188
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,470
Get that out of my sight now!

189
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,440
What did you just say?

190
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,540
Is Young Chae an object to you?

191
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,250
She's my wife before anything else.

192
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,650
Is Kunhyang's heir a joke to you?

193
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,880
Shut up!

194
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,850
How dare you say such things
in this house?

195
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,460
I decide who the heir is. Get out.

196
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,520
Father!

197
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,630
Dad, stop! It's not his fault.

198
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,960
Father, it's my fault
for causing this misunderstanding.

199
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,730
Please don't scold Se Hoon.

200
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,500
Father, you need to...

201
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,140
- keep a tight rein on him.
- You're worried about me now?

202
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,470
You're too kind for your own good.

203
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,670
Father.
I can't live without this woman.

204
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,340
You need time to see how deep
those feelings go,

205
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,980
and if they're even real.

206
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,650
Spend some time living away
from your wife.

207
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,880
Father!

208
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,360
When the Kunhyang family decides
what to do with you, Young Chae,

209
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,390
we'll be in touch.

210
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,300
Let's go.
Forget about the Kunhyang Family.

211
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,270
- Young Chae!
- Se Hoon! Don't go. Not right now.

212
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,340
- Honey, stop Se Hoon.
- If you walk out now,

213
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,240
Se Hoon, you'll no longer be part
of the Kunhyang family.

214
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,060
Don't do this.
Ha Neul, why are you...

215
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,960
I mean, CEO Joo,
why are you getting involved?

216
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,990
Stop.

217
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,630
Let's stop everything here.

218
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,970
The Kunhyang family is on to you.
You can't hold on any longer.

219
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,130
Revenge?

220
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,170
Give up on that too.

221
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,070
Give up?

222
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,070
How can I give up
when my heart is still in shreds?

223
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,710
If I could have,
I would've given up a long time ago.

224
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,350
Whatever it is you want,
I'll take care of it for you.

225
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,550
- What?
- You said you wanted more...

226
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,190
and wanted to be on top?

227
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,160
I'll...

228
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,090
do all of that for you,
instead of Se Hoon.

229
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,330
- Ha Neul.
- Don't call me that.

230
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,330
Not anymore.

231
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,170
I'm done playing that role.

232
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,100
To me,

233
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,940
you're a woman.

234
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,200
What? Young Chae, no, Su A did that?

235
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,200
Messing with food...

236
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,140
is the one thing
Grandma hates most.

237
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,610
My gosh. Grandma, are you furious?

238
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:37,510
I was this close to snapping
her wrist right off!

239
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,890
My goodness, Grandma.
Crude talk is for me, Gong Nan Sook.

240
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,860
Please calm down, all right?

241
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,520
To that child,

242
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,860
loneliness has become toxic.

243
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,630
She lashes out with daggers
at every turn.

244
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,170
And that's all...

245
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
And?

246
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,340
your fault, Gong Nan Sook!

247
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,140
What? Why are you blaming me?

248
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,110
Is she the only lonely person?

249
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,150
I will prepare
a late-night snack, ma'am.

250
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,980
Your loneliness comes
from an empty stomach.

251
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,780
What? You're Chef Hong again?

252
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,120
Come on, this is so confusing.

253
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,960
Mother.

254
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,860
There you are. Are you just coming
from the Kunhyang house?

255
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:24,900
You...

256
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,330
Did they really throw you out?

257
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,700
I brought her here.

258
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,940
What?

259
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,780
Se Hoon? What are you doing here?

260
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,050
I mean, how could you...

261
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,310
give your thirty-something sister
a piggyback ride?

262
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,150
Ha Neul?

263
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,390
You even know the passcode?

264
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,060
What are you doing here?

265
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,790
It started way back then.

266
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,700
Looks like you could use a drink?

267
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,510
You know that Young Chae
and CEO Joo Ha Neul,

268
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,280
aren't blood-related, right?

269
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,150
Young Chae is...

270
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,490
the daughter of Chairman Gong
and the missing CEO Shin Jae Ho.

271
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,690
And Joo Ha Neul is...

272
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,430
the adopted son of Joo Sang Cheol,

273
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,930
who was murdered by Cha Ki Beom.

274
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,460
They don't share a drop of blood.

275
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,070
They're brother and sister
in name only.

276
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,670
The vibe between them
is always so strange.

277
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,500
Don't jump to conclusions
so recklessly.

278
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,810
But you saw and heard it yourself,
didn't you?

279
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,340
I'll do all of that for you,
instead of Se Hoon.

280
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,810
To me,

281
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,910
you're a woman.

282
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,680
I bet it started
when they were kids.

283
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,950
- What?
- I sometimes hung out at her house.

284
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,850
Ha Neul...

285
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,990
I mean, CEO Joo.

286
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,790
The way he looked at her wasn't
how a brother looks at his sister.

287
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,100
I guess at that time,

288
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,900
I was naive and thought all brothers
saw their sisters that way.

289
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,670
- That's what I thought.
- Stop it!

290
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,100
You're a real pro at driving a wedge
between people.

291
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,010
It's pathetic.

292
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,810
If you really trust her,
then nothing I say should matter.

293
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,380
You look like you could explode.

294
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,920
I'll leave you to drink in peace.

295
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,090
In a way, I was jealous
of Young Chae.

296
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,530
I wished I'd had
a strong older brother like him.

297
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Goodnight.

298
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,040
Ha Neul,
how could you do this to me?

299
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,490
That wicked girl.
I just can't take it anymore.

300
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,690
- What's this?
- That rude little brat sent it.

301
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,500
- What?
- That rude brat isn't back yet.

302
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,330
Looks like she plans on moving in
with the Kunhyang family for good.

303
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,740
They must be treating our Jung Won
horribly over there.

304
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,610
Young Chae, why does she have
to cause such useless trouble?

305
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,110
Don't.

306
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,310
Just you wait.
I'm going to go over there myself.

307
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,120
What's that noise?

308
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,190
A burglar?

309
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,490
Be quiet.

310
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,670
Hey, you punk! What do we have
that's worth stealing?

311
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,040
You thief!

312
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,710
Come on. I'm not a thief!

313
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,610
Are you crazy?
Who are you calling a thief?

314
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,710
You...

315
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
Are you trying to leave now? Why?

316
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,280
Are you feeling guilty
after sending that awful picture?

317
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,020
Han Hye Ra told me
to move into the Kunhyang house.

318
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,050
I mean, my mom did.

319
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,460
- What?
- What am I supposed to do now?

320
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,230
The fake daughter-in-law
of the Kunhyang family was cast out.

321
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,530
What are you saying,
you little brat?

322
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,530
Every time you open your mouth,
it's nothing but lies and trouble.

323
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,730
Young Chae,
you'd better start making sense!

324
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,900
Something happened to our Jung Won,
didn't it?

325
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,540
Joo Ha Neul,
are you out of your mind?

326
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,540
When you should have stopped them
from kicking her out,

327
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,280
you brought her here yourself?

328
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,380
Now they're going to think
I put you up to this!

329
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,780
- That's enough, Chairman Gong.
- Enough of what?

330
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,850
Stop using Young Chae and Jung Won.

331
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,390
I won't stand by and watch anymore.

332
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,430
I let you get away with too much,
and now you think you control me.

333
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,030
What is it you won't stand for?

334
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,130
What has gotten into you?

335
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,730
Don't tell me...

336
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,700
you have feelings
for Cha Jung Won.

337
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,910
Good grief.

338
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,310
Stay away from Su A.

339
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,420
Don't you dare touch my daughter!

340
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,920
Why is she still here?

341
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,790
Get that out of my sight now!

342
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,250
I'm your daughter.

343
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,460
I thought all I felt
was anger and resentment.

344
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,530
But I hate you more...

345
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,390
for not recognizing me
and choosing Young Chae...

346
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,530
as your daughter.

347
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,180
Do you feel sorry for me?
Do you pity me?

348
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,580
Don't mistake those feelings
for love.

349
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,590
No.

350
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,690
I've felt this way for a long time.
These special feelings.

351
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,960
My mother locked Young Chae's room,
so you can sleep here for now.

352
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,570
I can sleep in my studio.
I've got a mountain of work anyway.

353
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,770
Ha Neul.

354
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,210
Please let those feelings go
if you can.

355
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,340
Or rather, keep them hidden.
Just like you're doing now.

356
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,280
I'm a junior colleague
you care about...

357
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,380
and the wife of Se Hoon,
your business partner.

358
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,130
The Kunhyang family is all mine now.

359
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,470
And Cha Jung Won
is out of the picture.

360
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,040
Any word from Chairman Gong?

361
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,140
It's the calm before the storm.

362
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,910
It's too quiet.

363
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,580
She's not one to just sit back.

364
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,980
She got kicked out
because she deserved it.

365
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,090
Maybe she's given up?

366
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,590
You still haven't changed your mind?

367
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,090
If I were going to change my mind,
I wouldn't have thrown her out.

368
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,930
What about our business
with Chairman Gong and CEO Joo?

369
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,560
I don't care
if the deal falls through.

370
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
Look,

371
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,330
Young Chae was in the wrong.

372
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,670
But business...

373
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,440
and kicking her out are different.

374
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,870
My mind won't change.

375
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,010
It’s even scarier when a kind person
like Mom gets angry.

376
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,810
For crying out loud.

377
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,620
Then I'm leaving too.

378
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,450
Fine, go ahead.

379
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,560
Mi Hyang!

380
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,230
Mi Hyang!

381
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,300
Where did she go?

382
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,560
Goodness.

383
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,490
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

384
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,260
Just as I thought.
As if he wouldn't call.

385
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,830
Is that Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

386
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,300
- Yes.
- Why aren't you answering?

387
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,730
A phone call isn't going to cut it.

388
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,800
They should come
and beg on their knees.

389
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,700
He's not the type to kneel.

390
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,840
Who mentioned Jin Tae Seok?
Han Hye Ra should get on her knees.

391
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,510
That's never going to happen.

392
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,910
What? Are her knees made of gold?

393
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,710
I've been on my knees many times
to get by.

394
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,750
So much that my kneecaps are
practically worn down to the bone.

395
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,790
Don't you want me...

396
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,420
to go back to the Kunhyang family,
Chairman Gong?

397
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,790
I couldn't care less if you go back
to the Kunhyang family.

398
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,570
The only thing that matters is
that I, Gong Nan Sook, win,

399
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,430
no matter what.

400
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,400
So as long as you win,

401
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,440
you don't care whether or not
I go back into the Kunhyang family?

402
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Bingo!

403
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,350
And what does winning even mean?

404
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,520
- What?
- If you make Vice Chairman Han...

405
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,250
kneel by using
the real and fake daughters,

406
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,220
you don't care
if the daughters' hearts are broken?

407
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,190
You think my heart wasn't broken?

408
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,960
And what about you, Ha Neul?

409
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
- Is your heart okay?
- Chairman Gong.

410
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,060
Call me "Mother."

411
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,070
The truth is, you never really cared
if I called you Mother, did you?

412
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,840
Putting me down to feel victorious
was always more important to you.

413
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,310
Crushing others is a strength.
That's what power is.

414
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,280
So who are you rooting for now?

415
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,010
The fake daughter?
Or the real one?

416
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,190
Fake or real,
it'd be great if they got along.

417
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,490
But it seems they won't be happy
until one is completely destroyed.

418
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,130
So what do you expect me to do?

419
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,390
Besides,
watching the Kunhyang family...

420
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,730
fall apart is pretty amusing.

421
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,300
The bottom line is,

422
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,900
as long as someone comes out on top,

423
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,840
I'm perfectly fine with that.

424
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,840
I'll find a way to get back
into the Kunhyang family.

425
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,010
- You need to stop this.
- This is my life.

426
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,510
Ha Neul...

427
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,120
No, CEO Joo doesn't get
to tell me what to do.

428
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,630
You'd better keep that brat in line.

429
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,030
Don't let her go around
making a scene.

430
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,640
(Missed Call,
Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

431
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,920
Okay.

432
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,420
You have a lunch appointment
after your meeting.

433
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,420
I need to talk to you.

434
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,570
Show him to a quiet room.

435
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
This way, please.

436
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,710
It's fall.

437
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,040
The fall foliage is... Oh my!

438
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,250
Who are you?

439
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,550
If you presented my daughter
as yours...

440
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,720
and married her into a rich family,

441
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,580
you should take responsibility
for her life. You crazy wench!

442
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,760
You're the witch who tore out
my hair, aren't you?

443
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,890
Is Jung Won in there?

444
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,890
Bring her out right now.
I'm taking her home!

445
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,430
Where do you think you're going?

446
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,400
Let go. You're going to pull out
all my regrown hair!

447
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,570
I said, let go!

448
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,770
Hey!
You really think I'd let you go?

449
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,870
- Darn it!
- Goodness. You're asking for it!

450
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,310
Okay.
Only one of us is leaving standing.

451
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,280
- Hey!
- I will handle this.

452
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,410
Stay out of this.

453
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,110
- Take this. Let's be fair.
- I'll step aside as you've ordered.

454
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,180
- Come here! Hey, let go
- Bring it on.

455
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,650
- Let go of me! Hey!
- You let go!

456
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,990
- Hey!
- Hey!

457
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,450
Darn it!

458
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,160
- Get over here!
- Hey!

459
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,060
This is so chaotic.

460
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,170
Oh my, why is this old hag crying?

461
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,340
Anyone watching would think
I beat her up.

462
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,970
Give me a break.

463
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,140
Whose daughter is Cha Jung Won?
You think you can just take her?

464
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,980
Don't even dream of it.

465
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,620
I didn't think you'd actually come
to see me in person.

466
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,760
There's something you must know.

467
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,900
Why is Cha Ki Beom here
to see my mother?

468
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,380
(Joo Young Chae)

469
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,580
Are you worried
I won't take good care of our Su A?

470
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,020
Was I being too selfish?

471
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,320
Maybe I should have waited
a bit longer to bring her here.

472
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,460
But I just couldn't wait
to have her in my arms.

473
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,660
Su A...

474
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,030
Our Jung Won...

475
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,570
The girl you have now
isn't our daughter.

476
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,200
What...

477
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,810
What are you talking about?

478
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,610
You wouldn't even take my calls.

479
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,880
I didn't think this was
a conversation for the phone.

480
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,990
Stop eyeing my chair
and come talk to me face-to-face.

481
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,220
Who are you to talk? You're a coward
hiding behind your wife's skirt.

482
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,290
What?

483
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,990
How dare you abandon her
when you knew she was my daughter?

484
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,300
Jin Tae Seok,

485
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,430
I would've never
let you get away with it...

486
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,500
if she had been my real daughter.

487
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,570
You're saying
she's not your daughter?

488
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
You're lying, right?

489
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,870
That girl...

490
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,880
- is pretending to be Su A.
- What do you mean, "pretending?"

491
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,150
Then who is she?

492
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,060
Then where's our Su A?

493
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,790
That brat is not my daughter.

494
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,260
She's Han Hye Ra's daughter.

495
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,270
(Kunhyang Group,
Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

496
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,310
(A Graceful Liar)

497
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
She tampered with the food
and then slapped you?

498
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,880
I hated Young Chae.

499
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,650
Su A tampered with the food
and framed Young Chae, right?

500
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
I'm only human.

501
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,390
Did you beg my father...

502
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,090
to get rid of my mother
by locking her...

503
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,560
in that nursing home,
Vice Chairman Han?

504
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,060
How could you turn me into a woman
who kicked out your birth mother...

505
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,790
and took her place
in the Kunhyang family?

506
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,930
Gong Nan Sook, what have you done?

507
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,260
Is the Kunhyang family a joke?

508
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,600
How dare you play me for a fool!

509
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,770
Right about now,
I bet Jin Tae Seok...

510
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,840
is putting Cha Jung Won
through the wringer.

511
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,740
I wonder if she'll make it
out of there alive.

512
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,440
How can you not recognize your child
when she's right under your nose?
