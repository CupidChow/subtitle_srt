1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,140
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,270
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,140
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,530
Joo Ha Neul.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,200
How dare you order me around?

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,570
Look at you. You've grown bold.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You're here.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,270
You're going to hand over
the slush fund ledger?

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,240
Don't you remember...

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,040
this place?

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,180
Of course. I knew as soon as
I heard the address.

12
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,190
It's where your pathetic excuse
for a father took his last breath.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,320
He was still alive.

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,600
You took his last breath.

15
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,230
- You did, Jin Tae Seok.
- How could I ever forget?

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,740
The sight of this floor
stained with his blood...

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,670
is still fresh in my mind.

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,510
Do you not...

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,610
feel any regret?

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,750
Regret? What for?

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,890
All I did was kick a little stone
out of my path.

22
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,790
You piece of scum!

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,460
A monster like you deserves to die.

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,630
And I'll kill you with my own hands.

25
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,130
- You little jerk!
- You think I can't do it?

26
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,440
A piece of trash like you...

27
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,900
deserves to die by my hand.

28
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,710
That's the only way to make
everything right again!

29
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,920
Don't do it, Ha Neul!

30
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,830
- How did you find me here?
- Is there anything I don't know?

31
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,700
I knew you'd come through. Thanks.

32
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,900
What are you even talking about?

33
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,910
Gong Nan Sook, are you crazy?

34
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,240
How dare you
get on Ha Neul's nerves?

35
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,510
You are so dead.

36
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,920
(The Crown Capital)

37
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,100
I tried to kill Jin Tae Seok.

38
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,570
Why would you do something
like that, Ha Neul?

39
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,430
If anyone's going to do it,
it should be me.

40
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,100
I tried to kill him even though
I knew he was your real father.

41
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,470
My father...

42
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,810
is the one who passed away.

43
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,310
I can't bear the fact that...

44
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,220
Jin Tae Seok is my father.

45
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,890
I'm so sorry to you too.

46
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,060
I have...

47
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,830
become the daughter of your enemy.

48
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,630
I can't bear to think
about it either.

49
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,130
But Jung Won...

50
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,670
It's not your fault.

51
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,940
I can't hate you for
what our parents did.

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,050
This is too cruel.

53
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,820
Do you think...

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,950
we can overcome...

55
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,520
this twisted fate?

56
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,470
Where did he go?

57
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,340
The number you have dialed
is not available.

58
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,340
Transferring to voicemail...

59
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,850
He's still not answering his phone.

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,450
What on earth is he doing?

61
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,760
Pour me one too.

62
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,090
How are you feeling?

63
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,590
What do you mean?

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,400
Right.

65
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,370
My stomach still hurts a little,
but I'm much better.

66
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,240
Were you worried about me?

67
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,820
I'm going to stay at
the Kunhyang house from now on.

68
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,390
And I'll take care of Mother
until she wakes up.

69
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,490
I should go say hi
to your father first.

70
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,020
He's not in his study.

71
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,060
He's not answering
his phone, either.

72
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,430
But he had nowhere to go.

73
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,100
Do you think something happened?

74
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,670
Don't tell me... Cha Jung Won?

75
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,900
It's not about Ms. Cha Jung Won.

76
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,640
Do you know something, Jung Guk?

77
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,210
Have a pleasant evening.

78
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,280
I'll look into it.

79
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,580
It might have something
to do with Madam Gong.

80
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,190
The only person who could go up
against my father right now...

81
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,850
would have to be Chairman Gong.

82
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,480
Wake up, already!
The sun's about to come up.

83
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,690
- Where am I?
- And what good would knowing do?

84
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,920
Gong Nan Sook.

85
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,890
How dare you pull a stunt like this
on the chairman of Kunhyang?

86
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,590
You want to end up in prison?

87
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,400
If you're not in jail,
why would I be?

88
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,830
I gave you a clear warning,
didn't I?

89
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,170
I told you to stay away from my kid.

90
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,970
I didn't lay a finger on him.

91
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,940
He was the one who tried to kill me.

92
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,580
Besides, if Ha Neul, who is a saint,
wanted you dead,

93
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,110
then you deserve a thousand deaths.

94
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,650
So instead of Joo Ha Neul,

95
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,150
you're going to
finish me off yourself?

96
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,120
That's how
we've always operated, right?

97
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,390
What are you going to do to me?

98
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,720
The usual.

99
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,660
Gong Nan Sook!

100
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,570
Get your hands off me! Let go!

101
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,170
You still don't get the picture,
do you?

102
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,770
Come on, let's go home.

103
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,970
Spare me.

104
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,080
What was that?

105
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,410
There was no soul in that.

106
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,680
I'm not feeling any desperation.

107
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,750
You have to do better than that
to move me.

108
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,290
For instance,

109
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,920
- try calling me "ma'am."
- Spare me!

110
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,830
Ma'am.

111
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,500
I never thought I'd live to hear
Jin Tae Seok call me "ma'am."

112
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,740
Did you hear that, Manager Gu?

113
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,840
Loud and clear, ma'am.

114
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,450
All right, how about we do this,
little brother?

115
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,880
Make me the next chairman.

116
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,090
I want to climb to the very top
of Kunhyang Group.

117
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,150
That's not happening.

118
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,960
That position is mine.

119
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,490
I guess you need your head dunked
before you can think straight.

120
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,260
You don't have a choice
in the matter.

121
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,070
Manager Gu, give our little brother
a taste of the water.

122
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,370
You're going to regret this,
Manager Gu.

123
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,040
Manager Gu, do you want
to be the first to test the waters?

124
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,410
No, ma'am.

125
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,760
Gong Nan Sook.

126
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,800
I'll kill you!

127
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,470
Jin Tae Seok.

128
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,070
Do you have any idea
why you're in this mess?

129
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,810
You want the chairman's seat
at Kunhyang that badly?

130
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,010
That's secondary.

131
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,340
What's the first?

132
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,510
You drove my Ha Neul
to want to kill you.

133
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,610
And I can't forgive you for that.

134
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,950
What's so special about him?

135
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,590
Why do you care so much about
Joo Sang Cheol's son?

136
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,260
There's water everywhere,

137
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,260
but not a drop to drink, Manager Gu.

138
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,100
I'll go get you something.

139
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,130
Lukewarm?

140
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,570
- Iced.
- Yes, ma'am.

141
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:01,910
Mom!

142
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,380
Where's my mom?

143
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,990
That's for my mom, isn't it?

144
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,190
I have an urgent matter to see to.
If you'll excuse me.

145
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,630
Then just tell me one thing.

146
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,760
- What is it?
- My mom is up to something again,

147
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,330
isn't she?

148
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,300
I wouldn't know.

149
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,700
You've changed, Manager Gu.

150
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,370
You're being mean.

151
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,940
Well...

152
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,340
Why did Han Hye Ra drink poison
in Cha Jung Won's place?

153
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,810
Don't tell me...

154
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,910
Chairman Jin Tae Seok tried to kill
Cha Jung Won again.

155
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,750
He's even more terrifying
than Madam Gong...

156
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
Don't compare him to Chairman Gong.

157
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,960
At least Chairman Gong doesn't try
to kill her own child.

158
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,160
Her own child?

159
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,060
Excuse me.

160
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,030
Cha Jung Won is
Jin Tae Seok's biological daughter?

161
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,150
Gong Nan Sook.

162
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,660
I'll give you whatever you want.
Just untie me.

163
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,230
You should've been this cooperative
from the start, little brother.

164
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,730
How about you write an oath in blood
to show you mean it?

165
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,600
Don't do this.

166
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,270
What is Joo Ha Neul to you
that you'd go this far?

167
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,770
- Have you forgotten who I am?
- Hardly.

168
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,010
You're Jin Tae Seok.

169
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,280
Joo Ha Neul? He's my son.

170
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,120
He's not someone
for scum like you to dare touch.

171
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,750
My precious son.

172
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,550
If you lay a hand on him,

173
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,230
I don't care if you're Jin Tae Seok
or the devil himself.

174
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,560
I will make you regret it.

175
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,010
Why did Mom lock up Father?

176
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,420
Don't tell me
it's because of Ha Neul.

177
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,520
What are you talking about?

178
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,620
What do you mean,
"because of Joo Ha Neul?"

179
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,660
It's nothing.

180
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,160
I was just starting
to open up to you.

181
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,300
Aren't you going to do the same?

182
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,870
We're married,

183
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,670
so no more secrets.

184
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,710
Married?

185
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,050
Actually...

186
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,260
How could this happen?

187
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,800
Jung Won, your real father...

188
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,040
was my father, Jin Tae Seok?

189
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,470
Apparently so.

190
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,540
Life is something else.

191
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,510
I felt so guilty about
what I did to you, Se Hoon,

192
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,350
that I couldn't even
bring myself to apologize.

193
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,020
Even though I knew
how much I hurt you,

194
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,360
I just pretended not to notice.

195
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,860
I guess this is my punishment.

196
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,860
You and I...

197
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,230
were never meant to be.

198
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,930
I think it was for the best...

199
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,300
that we broke up.

200
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,500
But then why did my father...

201
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,070
try to kill you
even though he knew...

202
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,570
you were his daughter?

203
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,680
I just can't wrap my head around it.

204
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,080
To Jin Tae Seok, you and Se Mi
are his pride and ambition,

205
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,380
but I'm just a source of shame.

206
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,380
A dirty secret he wants to hide.

207
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,090
Knowing my father,
he might think like that.

208
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,860
Because he thinks
he has to be perfect.

209
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,530
Jung Won, I want you to be happy.

210
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,200
I can't bring myself to root for
you and Joo Ha Neul,

211
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,300
but you don't have to
feel guilty about me anymore.

212
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,410
Don't even think like that anymore.

213
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,480
Chairman Gong Nan Sook
did that to my father?

214
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,260
Please wake up now.

215
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,400
We have so much to talk about.

216
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,670
You were willing
to give up your life for me.

217
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,070
You cared that much about me,

218
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,980
so why were you always
so cruel to me?

219
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,280
Was it all just a lie?

220
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,290
Were you trying to protect me
from Jin Tae Seok?

221
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,620
Don't ever do that again.

222
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,730
I...

223
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,400
missed you.

224
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,440
I've always wanted to call you Mom.

225
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,280
Like a normal mother and daughter,

226
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,980
making tteokbokki together...

227
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,250
On the first snowy day of the year,

228
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,120
we'd build a snowman together.

229
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Just like Se Mi,

230
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,730
I wanted to be able
to whine and complain,

231
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,430
and I dreamed of
falling asleep in your arms...

232
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,740
while listening to
the music box's lullaby.

233
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,870
That's all I ever wanted.

234
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,110
But that never happened for us.

235
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,420
Why, of all people, did Jin Tae Seok
have to be my father?

236
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,420
I want to ask you that.

237
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,290
I want to demand to know
how you could love that monster.

238
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,160
I want to ask you so much,

239
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,170
but what am I supposed to do
if you won't open your eyes?

240
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,040
Please wake up now.

241
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,480
You must make up for all the things
you couldn't do for me.

242
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,680
It's okay even if you
don't smile brightly at me...

243
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,220
or be affectionate with me.

244
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,520
Just let me...

245
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,760
hear the sound of your footsteps...

246
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,800
and your breathing, please.

247
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
Please...

(Damga Charcoal Grill)

250
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,410
I'll let you hit me
as much as you want...

251
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,140
until you've gotten it
out of your system.

252
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,780
Get out now! Right now!

253
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,380
And when I say don't come back,
I mean it.

254
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,790
I never want to see your face again.
Now, get out!

255
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,490
I'll be back.

Away with you, foul spirits!

260
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,450
If Chairman Gong has Jin Tae Seok,

261
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,790
where would she be keeping him?

262
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,090
I have a place in mind.

263
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,840
Chairman Gong has my father?

264
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,580
I guess I have to save him.

(Kunhyang Group)

266
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,910
Young Chae, it looks like
you still need more time to recover.

267
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,480
- Are you sure you'll be okay?
- I'm fine.

268
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,820
Things are a mess at the office,
so I need to be here.

269
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,620
If it's too much, just let me know.
I'll approve your sick leave.

270
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,790
Yes, Director Jin.

271
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,560
Have you decided on the concept
for next year's FW collection?

272
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,730
We've settled on a tailored look,
and we're discussing the details.

273
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,670
Good.
Report when the drafts are done.

274
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,870
Yes, Director Jin.

275
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,800
By the way,

276
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,700
is that rumor true?

277
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,910
What rumor?

278
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:59,480
The one about Chairman Han Hye Ra
collapsing from being poisoned...

279
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,680
That's a false rumor.

280
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,310
Right. Of course it is.

281
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,280
There goes my big mouth again.

282
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,090
It's not entirely baseless, is it?

284
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,560
- Watch your mouth.
- Am I wrong?

285
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,690
We're practically family here.

286
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,100
Why do we have to be
so quiet about it?

287
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,800
That means...

288
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,130
the chairman's seat is open again.
Who's going to...

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200

Where in the world
did Jin Tae Seok go?

295
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,070
Did someone sneak him out?

296
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,940
Was it you?

297

It wasn't.

What's on your mind?

302
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,310
Actually,

303
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,450
I think you're the one
with something to say to me.

305
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,590
Do you have him?

306
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,060
I was thinking
we could have lunch together.

307
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,160
But I guess I'll be eating alone.

308
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,130
You're not going to tell even me?

309
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,640
Why would I have Jin Tae Seok?

310
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,270

I would've killed him ages ago.

314

So you're not the one
hiding Jin Tae Seok.

I have absolutely no idea...

316
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,500
- what you're talking about.
- I'm thinking...

317
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,630
of having Jin Tae Seok drowned.

318

Utterly hopeless.

00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,790
(Pretty but dumb daughter,
Young Chae)

357
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,890
Goodness.

358
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,260
What is it? What?

359
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,170
The chairman's office.

360
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,270
I'm in Kunhyang's chairman's office,
sitting in my rightful chair. Why?

361
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,380
Are you crazy, Mom?

362
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,980
You silly girl.
You're more dense than Manager Gu.

363
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,650
How can you not get what I'm doing?

364
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,420
No wonder I have you saved...

365
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,120
as "Pretty but dumb daughter, Young Chae"
on my phone?

366
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,420
I'm too smart for my own good.
It's exhausting.

367
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,830
You get that from me. It's natural.
Anyway, what is it?

368
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,300
My father-in-law disappeared?

369
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,300
But I'm sure I saw him
in your basement.

370
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,170
- You went down there?
- What?

371
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,010
- Yes.
- And you told Jin Se Hoon?

372
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,840
Of course. We're married.

373
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,380
And even after that,
he just pretended he didn't see him?

374
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,380
I can't believe that rotten jerk!

375
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,950
After everything
Jin Tae Seok did for him?

376
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,450
Mom, whose side are you on anyway?

377
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,960
If you're so worried about him,
why did you lock him up?

378
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,790
Because I felt like it.
Is there a problem?

379
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,030
- Let's go, Yeong Soo.
- Yes, ma'am.

380
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,500
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

381
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,240
What in the world is going on?

382
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,040
Grandma.

383
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,310
I asked who took Jin Tae Seok.

384
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,150
Quiet! You're breaking
my concentration!

385
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,560
My goodness!

386
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
What? Why are you crying?

387
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,460
Is Jin Tae Seok dead?

388
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,630
Oh, my.

389
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,800
A father tried to kill his child
time and time again.

390
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,470
Yet his child,
even though it would tear her apart,

391
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,110
still tries to save his life.

392
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,740
What will become of
my poor, sweet child?

393
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,980
Don't tell me...
Cha Jung Won helped Jin Tae Seok?

394
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,250
No, that can't be, right?

395
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,690
But what's the use?
Her father is pure evil.

396
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,820
Even my own grandma
would shake her head at him.

397
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,860
He is the worst kind of scum
there is.

398
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:59,530
My poor child's tragic fate.

399
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,130
Grandma, don't cry.

400
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,200
When you cry,

401
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,740
it makes me start tearing up too.
Oh, dear.

402
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,770
Not for me. Give it to him.

403
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,310
Here you go.

404
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,050
Oh, gosh. Why have I been
crying so much lately?

405
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,580
I start crying
while watching TV dramas.

406
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,580
It must be menopause.

407
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,720
Grandma? Stop crying!

408
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,620
My goodness.

409
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,540
Kill me.

410
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,370
Kill me!

411
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,540
I'm immortal.

412
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,400
If I wanted you dead,

413
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:44,770
you already would be,

414
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,670
Father.

415
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,410
Don't call me Father!

416
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,470
It's disgusting!

417
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,980
How could someone like you,

418
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,120
a child raised with no roots,
be my own flesh and blood?

419
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,880
And what do you mean
by "having no roots?"

420
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,350
Being born
into the Kunhyang Family...

421
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,990
and educated like
a conglomerate family heir?

422
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,060
That's not all.

423
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,260
As my blood, you should at least...

424
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,430
I should what?

425
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,000
You'd never dare to aim your arrows
at Kunhyang...

426
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,370
or trick my son into marrying you.

427
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,800
You never should have done that!

428
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,880
So I'm a disgrace to you?

429
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,280
You're a humiliation.

430
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,610
How could my own blood...

431
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,280
be shared with someone like you?

432
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,550
I was born to you and Han Hye Ra,
the woman you love most.

433
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,220
- And you still find me humiliating?
- Hye Ra is different!

434
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,230
She is a flower that I cultivated.

435
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,730
My personal flowerbed,
grown beautiful only in my embrace.

436
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,930
Hye Ra...

437
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,370
can only come into full bloom
with my touch.

438
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,740
How disgraceful.

439
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,740
I'm the one who's disgraced.

440
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,750
- What?
- That you gave me your blood,

441
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,880
and that you're the father
who gave me flesh and bone,

442
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,690
is what's truly horrific
and disgusting.

443
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,090
Then why did you save me?

444
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,620
You had the chance to kill me.

445
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,830
I wanted to.

446
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,670
But I had to be different.

447
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,570
Are you going to forgive me?

448
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Not a chance.

449
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,240
Then what is it you plan to do?

450
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,950
I'll show you that living
is a fate worse than death.

451
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,320
You'll see everything you love
crumble before your eyes.

452
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,350
So keep your eyes wide open
and watch.

453
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:44,890
Cha Jung Won!

454
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,030
Hwang Jung Guk! You betrayed me?

455
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,630
I have merely found a new master.

456
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,930
How may I be of service?

457
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,870
Shut his noisy mouth.

458
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,100
Yes, ma'am.

459
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
Jin Tae Seok.

460
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,880
Though you're here in your palace,
the Kunhyang estate,

461
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,120
no one in the Kunhyang family
will ever know you're here.

462
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,250
You'll spend the rest of your days
alone in here,

463
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,660
playing your little game
of being chairman.

464
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,130
I missed you.

465
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,770
I've always wanted to call you Mom.

466
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,140
Please wake up now.

467
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,520
You must make up for all the things
you couldn't do for me.

468
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,960
(A Graceful Liar)

469
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,960
You could have died for me.
Why would you do that?

470
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,630
Because it would be better
if I were the one to die.

471
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,490
We were so worried about you.

472
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,630
How dare you steal my prey?

473
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,530
Don't tell me Se Hoon did that
after hearing from Young Chae.

474
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,200
I wish he'd just disappear forever.

475
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,970
You think I'll take over as chairman
if my father disappears?

476
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,670
You know where Jin Tae Seok is,
don't you, Jung Won?

477
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,040
What makes you think that?

478
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,380
Because if I were you,
I wouldn't have let him get away.

479
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,250
That's my boy.
You're the only one I can count on.

480
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,020
Why did you kill my mother?

481
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,420
