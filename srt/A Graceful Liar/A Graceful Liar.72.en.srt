1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,010
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,270
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,240
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,070
So, what's on the agenda
for today's board meeting?

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,100
The damage
to Kunhyang Group's image,

6
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,540
and what to do about Han Hye Ra,
who was behind the interview.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,550
- That's the discussion...
- No.

8
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,750
We're here to expose
everything you've done...

9
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,850
and how far you've dragged down
Kunhyang Group.

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,050
That's what this meeting is about.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,130
So, it's a showdown to see who wins.

12
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,160
I love watching a good fight.
Time to get the popcorn.

13
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,880
It's not just about
former Vice Chairman Han's interview.

14
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,390
Since you held a press conference
as a mere temporary vice chairman,

15
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,190
this is also for your reprimand.

16
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,960
It might be the other way around,
you know.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,930
You think the board
is going to praise...

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,730
the former and current Vice Chairmen?

19
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,360
A responsible executive.

20
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,570
Won't they see me as an executive
who really cares about Kunhyang?

21
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,870
They'll just think
you're an outsider...

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,810
trying to scheme your way in
and push out the establishment.

23
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,850
Jung Won.

24
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,650
Give me the strength...

25
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,860
to see this through.

26
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,030
(Episode 72)

27
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,110
Hello? Over here.

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,450
The nerve of them.

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,920
I tried so hard
to get on the same side as them,

30
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,120
and they won't even look at me?

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,650
Those ungrateful brats!

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,330
Interim Vice Chairman
Joo Ha Neul's press conference.

33
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,870
Former Vice Chairman
Han Hye Ra's interview.

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,770
Because of these two incidents,

35
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,470
Kunhyang Group
is facing a major crisis.

36
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,340
This undermines
the entire organization.

37
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,480
And they both went against
Kunhyang Group's official statement.

38
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,880
An official statement
should be based on facts.

39
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,290
There's no proof that Cha Ki Beom
was abusive or had an affair.

40
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,060
It's nothing more than
baseless speculation.

41
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,290
So that allowed you to hold
a press conference...

42
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,460
and drag my name into it?

43
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,530
I made you the Vice Chairman,
and you repay me...

44
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,230
by trying to frame me as a criminal?

45
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,570
This is unacceptable.

46
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
Not just Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul,

47
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,400
but also
former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra...

48
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,940
has dragged our company's name
through the mud.

49
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,210
How about we determine
who exactly...

50
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,640
dragged Kunhyang through the mud,
shall we?

51
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,320
You're blaming Jin Tae Seok?

52
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,620
An owner who is supposed
to have a long-term vision...

53
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,860
- deliberately distorted the truth.
- Han Hye Ra!

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,260
She's right. Times have changed.

55
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,200
If we rush to cover up the truth
and crush the weak and the wronged,

56
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,230
we will never be able to
overcome this crisis.

57
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,570
You've got a lot to say for someone
who made this whole mess worse.

58
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,600
Is telling the truth
what you call making it worse?

59
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,770
Do you really not see
what is making things worse?

60
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,710
This whole thing is
about to blow up.

61
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,780
As long as Chairman Jin Tae Seok
remains in his position,

62
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,680
it will be impossible
to overcome this crisis.

63
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,450
Are you telling me
to step down as chairman?

64
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,320
- That's right.
- I believe it's worth considering.

65
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,430
Hearing all this, it sounds like
Jin Tae Seok is really at fault.

66
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,660
And I bet there's a mountain
of evidence, too.

67
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,800
Evidence? There's no such thing.

68
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,100
How dare you all try to paint me
as a criminal?

69
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,770
Have you all lost your minds?

70
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,140
We'll see who's really crazy
in the end.

71
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,880
Apologize to the Chairman now.

72
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,650
Former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra,
you will retract your interview.

73
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,520
And Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul,
you will resign immediately.

74
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,990
(Voice Recording)

75
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,860
You should've taken Gong Nan Sook
down sooner...

76
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,130
if you didn't want to die
like a dog.

77
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,370
He's still alive.

78
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
What is this?

79
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,370
Are you saying Chairman Jin Tae Seok
tried to kill someone?

80
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,610
My father,

81
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,710
Joo Sang Cheol, was murdered
by Chairman Jin.

82
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,250
The murderer of Joo Ha Neul's dad,
Joo Sang Cheol,

83
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,860
- is Chairman Jin Tae Seok.
- Cut the nonsense!

84
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,560
Han Hye Ra
and Joo Ha Neul set me up!

85
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,130
Let's hear a little more
of the recording.

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,730
No, we don't need to hear any more!

87
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,870
I'm telling you,
Jin Tae Seok fooled me for 25 years.

88
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,010
I actually thought I was the one
who killed Joo Sang Cheol!

89
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,780
Make some sense!

90
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,410
You know Joo Sang Cheol
was my ex-husband, right?

91
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,880
This is an official meeting.

92
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,410
Please use formal language.

93
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,690
Formal tone, my foot.
You clearly don't know who I am.

94
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,420
I'm going to speak my mind.

95
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,160
You can pretend I'm being polite.

96
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,890
Gong Nan Sook! Will you shut up?

97
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,760
You shut your trap, Jin Tae Seok!

98
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,130
And the rest of you
better listen up.

99
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,870
Because I'm only saying this once.

100
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,780
This is the undeniable truth.

101
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,050
That's a lie!

102
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,820
- I didn't do it.
- You didn't, right?

103
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,760
- It's a lie, right?
- Why would I lie...

104
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,490
when I'm dealing with Jin Tae Seok?

105
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,090
You did it.

106
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,130
And that's not all.

107
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,230
You framed Cha Ki Beom for it,

108
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,070
and then you killed him.

109
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,170
And he pushed Cha Jung Won,
the daughter...

110
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,710
of former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra,
off the rooftop.

111
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,380
Chairman! What is the truth?

112
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,610
Tell us yourself.

113
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,250
A criminal can't remain chairman.
Step down!

114
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,550
Please, don't be swayed by this.

115
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,150
Who has protected Kunhyang Group?
It's Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

116
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,250
You can't use unproven evidence...

117
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,090
to oust the man who is Kunhyang.

118
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,630
Everyone, be quiet!

119
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,890
Shut up and listen to me.

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,960
I am Jin Tae Seok!

121
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,700
Who dares to insult me?

122
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,640
Who dares try to drag me down
from the chairmanship?

123
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,010
Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

124
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,420
I'm Lieutenant Lee Dong Han,
Violent Crimes Unit, Seocho Police.

125
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,820
I'm placing you under arrest...

126
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,260
for the attempted murder
of Cha Jung Won.

127
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,260
What?

128
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,960
You have the right to an attorney
and the right to make a statement.

129
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,730
What do you think you're doing?

130
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,570
Attempted murder?

131
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,730
Where's the proof?

132
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,560
I am the proof.

133
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,330
Cha Jung Won.

134
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,840
What's going on here?

135
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,370
Chairman Jin Tae Seok
pushed me off that rooftop.

136
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,710
He tried to kill me.

137
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,680
Please come with us.

138
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,790
There's been a misunderstanding.

139
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,620
I'll be back shortly.
There's nothing to worry about.

140
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,890
Step aside.

141
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,340
(Kunhyang Group)

142
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,940
Hey, did you see the looks
on the directors' faces?

143
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,380
Jin Tae Seok, the unbreakable oak,
started to teeter,

144
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,180
and they all looked like
the sky was falling.

145
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,850
So what do you think will happen
to Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

146
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,060
The statute of limitations expired
on the Joo Sang Cheol case,

147
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,190
and there's not enough evidence
for Cha Ki Beom's death.

148
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,100
Pushing Cha Jung Won off the rooftop
is clearly attempted murder.

149
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,130
And since Jung Won survived
to testify,

150
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
he won't be able to
get out of it easily.

151
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,210
You really think so?
We're talking about Jin Tae Seok.

152
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,740
Even if he goes to jail,
he'll walk out like it's a vacation.

153
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,350
He might even come out
looking completely refreshed.

154
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,380
Then we'll just have to
throw him back in.

155
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,820
We'll keep finding more evidence,
so he can never run away again...

156
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,890
or make a mockery
of the law ever again.

157
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,790
That's exactly what I want.

158
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,090
Someone who's powerful
but is a filthy bad guy.

159
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Someone stronger than me
that I'm just dying to crush.

160
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,170
But you know,
that's not something anyone can do.

161
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,910
Somehow, I have a feeling
that if it's you,

162
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,910
you might just be able to
pull it off.

163
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,350
Someone I want to see crushed.

164
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,780
You're on my list.

165
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,520
Sure. I'm always up for it.

166
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,590
Bring it on!

167
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,190
But...

168
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,090
- But what?
- You can't just be reckless.

169
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,960
If you rush in without a plan,
you're sure to lose every time.

170
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,760
You're the one
who should be careful.

171
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,530
You've made Chairman Jin Tae Seok
into an enemy.

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
You must prepare
for his retaliation.

173
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,970
Wait, you're worried about me?
Oh, you're making my heart flutter.

174
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,410
Don't be ridiculous.

175
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,910
Even though
Jin Tae Seok was the real culprit...

176
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,310
who killed my father,

177
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,280
you must also pay for your crimes.

178
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,390
Fine. I told you
that I'd pay for them.

179
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,750
I will.

180
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,790
But I was fooled for 25 years too.

181
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,060
By the way, where are
Han Hye Ra and Cha Jung Won?

182
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,500
My baby,
you came back to me alive.

183
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,210
It's finally sinking in.
I couldn't believe it at first.

184
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,810
I had a dream.

185
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,680
Don't go any further.

186
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,220
Come to Mom.

187
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,920
I was so exhausted and worn out...

188
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,620
that I thought
I just wanted to rest.

189
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,890
At the end of the forest,

190
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,960
I felt like Dad was calling me.

191
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,000
But then,

192
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,570
you beckoned for me to come back.

193
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,210
I'm so glad you did.

194
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,180
I was so scared
something would go wrong...

195
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,050
that I'd never see my girl again.
I was terrified.

196
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,330
My prayers were answered.

197
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,160
Jung Won's awake?

198
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,530
Jung Won.

199
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,010
Doctor, how is she?

200
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,680
Her own will to live
created a miracle.

201
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,180
The swelling in her brain
is gradually subsiding,

202
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,350
and the hemorrhaging has stabilized.

203
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,950
She'll still need rehabilitation
and observation,

204
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,260
but we believe
she can make a full recovery.

205
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,460
Thank you, Doctor.

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,600
As for it not feeling real,

207
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,840
I feel the same way.

208
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,540
When I opened my eyes,

209
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,670
the whole world had changed.

210
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,080
Like you were joined at the hip,

211
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,350
you and Chairman Jin Tae Seok,
who seemed inseparable,

212
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,220
are now turning
on each other publicly.

213
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,290
He did something unforgivable.

214
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,130
While you were in a coma,

215
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,970
I found out the truth.

216
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,270
Now I know for sure
who I need to get my revenge on.

217
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,500
Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

218
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,940
- He was behind every evil deed.
- This is far from over.

219
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,050
Do you really think Jin Tae Seok
is finished just like that?

220
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,920
You may have survived,

221
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,250
but you could be killed again.

222
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,490
Chairman Jin Tae Seok...

223
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,890
will try to kill me again?

224
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,120
You think he won't?

225
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,360
Then,

226
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,530
I guess I'll just have to die again.

227
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,870
Do you have any idea who I am?

228
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,870
Go ahead, investigate all you want!

229
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,940
Is there anyone in the police
or the prosecutors’ office...

230
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,370
who hasn’t taken Kunhyang’s money?

231
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,680
How dare you...

232
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,380
Father, please calm down.

233
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,150
I can walk out of here right away,
can't I?

234
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,720
They say it's going to take a while.

235
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,260
I've retained
Kunhyang's legal counsel.

236
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,230
What did I do wrong?
Why do I need a lawyer?

237
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,130
Father, you have to cooperate
with the investigation.

238
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,030
- It's just protocol.
- What protocol?

239
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,430
Cha Jung Won is awake.

240
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,340
Of course, she reported you.

241
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Watch your mouth.

242
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,310
I had them stop recording.

243
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,640
You don't actually think I'd show up
without handling that first?

244
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,280
So Cha Jung Won reported me?

245
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
Yes.

246
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,920
For attempted murder.

247
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,620
A moment of pity
only complicated things.

248
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,160
I should have finished her off then.

249
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,370
What do you mean, you should die?
What are you talking about?

250
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,000
They say, "To seek death is to live,
and to seek life is to die."

251
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,470
I've already died once.

252
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,440
What's to keep me from dying
a second or third time?

253
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,070
Anything that doesn't bend breaks.

254
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,680
It's okay...

255
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,610
to hide behind me now.

256
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,010
You want me to hide?

257
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Kunhyang.

258
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,050
I'm going to take it for myself.

259
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,990
I was wondering why you turned on
Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

260
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,100
Of course, that's just like you.

261
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
I thought that now
we could finally...

262
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,300
take down
Chairman Jin Tae Seok together.

263
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,370
Together?

264
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,710
Kunhyang is mine.

265
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,410
You just watch and be happy
with the scraps.

266
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,350
That's your place.

267
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,720
Hiding behind Jin Tae Seok...

268
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,690
and enjoying his wealth and power
wasn't enough for you?

269
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,890
So you're finally
showing your claws.

270
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,160
Did you want me to wake up...

271
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,560
just so you could show me this?

272
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,960
Or did you actually wish
I hadn't woken up?

273
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,800
It's not like that.

274
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,540
Just stay alive.

275
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,270
Don't do anything else.

276
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,210
There's nothing you can do,
Jung Won.

277
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,380
You want me to just breathe?

278
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,950
- So I should just lie low?
- That might be for the best.

279
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,760
What would it take for no one
to ever mess with you again?

280
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,890
I don't know.

281
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,060
We're just on parallel tracks,
aren't we?

282
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,300
You and I, always.

283
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,500
Let me be clear.

284
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,600
You go after what you want.

285
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,340
I'll do what I have to do.

286
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,080
I can't let Jung Won
put herself in more danger.

287
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,720
I have to protect her,
no matter what.

288
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
What?

289
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,990
Did Cha Jung Won really show up
at the board meeting?

290
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,330
- And Chairman Jin got arrested?
- That's what I said.

291
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,370
Mom, did you know about this?

292
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,300
Why are you asking me
something so obvious,

293
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,010
as if you're surprised?

294
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,580
It was me
who took him down hard!

295
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,480
Weren't you and Chairman Jin
supposed to be allies?

296
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,280
Alliances are temporary.

297
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,620
It's like boats.
You get on, and then you get off.

298
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,850
That's just how it is.

299
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,490
If you make it to port, you've won.
The destination doesn't change.

300
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,060
Taking over Kunhyang Group?

301
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,530
Of course, and if I can't have it,
I'll burn it all down.

302
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,570
So you're teaming up
with former Vice Chairman Han?

303
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,900
And you backstabbed Chairman Jin?

304
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,840
What are you talking about?
He's the one who betrayed me first!

305
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,410
How is everything, ladies?

306
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,040
The taste of betrayal? It's foul.

307
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,080
I was the one
who was betrayed first, wasn't I?

308
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,880
You'll get played again, sweetie.

309
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,420
Me? Again?

310
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,690
What are you talking about?

311
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,460
Why are you looking at Young Chae?

312
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,130
Young Chae, are you
planning on betraying me?

313
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,970
What are you even asking?
Who sits around planning a betrayal?

314
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,540
You've betrayed me more than once!

315
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,870
Are you taking
Cha Jung Won's side again?

316
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,470
Then what about my Se Hoon?

317
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,140
Oh my.

318
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:26,910
Seriously...

319
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,410
Grandma, why are you staring
at me like that again?

320
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,520
You know I hate it when you pity me
with your eyes, don't you?

321
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,590
So, is Young Chae
going to betray me?

322
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,700
My mom has no idea, does she?

323
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,270
What are you referring to?

324
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,800
The video you stole
of Cha Ki Beom's death and gave to me.

325
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,040
I did no such thing.

326
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,410
I would never betray Chairman Gong.

327
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,710
Right. I believe you.

328
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,510
If you know how terrifying
Madam Gong can be...

329
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,320
Or rather, you should know
I can be even worse.

330
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,690
Don't you forget it, Manager Gu.

331
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,390
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

332
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,590
Why haven't I heard
from Jung Won at all?

333
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
She said she was going to put
Jin Tae Seok in jail today.

334
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,730
Jung Won was going to
tell you this herself.

335
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,970
Jin Tae Seok was arrested...

336
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,640
at the board meeting
for attempted murder.

337
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,010
Really?

338
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Mom!

339
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,050
Why didn't you call me first?

340
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,020
The deities were on our side.
Thank you.

341
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,390
I missed you, Mom.

342
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,820
I was worried sick about you.

343
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,960
My Jung Won,
let me get a good look at you.

344
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,990
Are you okay?

345
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,030
That's a relief.

346
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,140
- A phone?
- You need a new one, don't you?

347
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
You're a feisty one.

348
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,350
- Were you recording this?
- My word alone isn't enough.

349
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,450
They will only believe
a confession straight from you.

350
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,860
Jin Tae Seok...

351
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,230
threw my phone off the rooftop.

352
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,130
Because you recorded his confession?

353
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,000
But it's useless now.

354
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,510
They said the phone
was beyond repair.

355
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,010
But we should be able
to recover the data.

356
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,040
I know a guy.
He's the best there is at this.

357
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
He can almost certainly do it.

358
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,420
So we could have hard evidence
besides my testimony?

359
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Exactly.

360
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,820
What is it?

361
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,760
To be with you like this again,

362
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,100
to talk with you,

363
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,530
look you in the eye,

364
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,800
and be this close to you.

365
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,840
I can't believe it's real.

366
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,540
When I first opened my eyes...

367
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,810
and saw you, Ha Neul,

368
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,650
I was so happy.

369
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,890
I know we have a tough fight
ahead of us,

370
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,430
but having you by my side
gives me strength.

371
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,300
Of all the people who hoped
I would wake up,

372
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,570
the one who had the warmest heart...

373
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,580
and made my heart flutter...

374
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,680
was you.

375
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,250
I wanted to tell you that.

376
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,530
Even if it's a path of thorns
or a quagmire of mud,

377
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,030
as long as I can be with you...

378
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,700
That alone is reason enough...

379
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,740
for me to open my eyes again.

380
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,070
(15 Days Later)

381
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,960
Hey. You're well enough
to come into the office?

382
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,260
Long time no see.

383
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,030
Seriously?
Giving me the cold shoulder?

384
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,770
And I was kind of hoping
she'd wake up.

385
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,270
Just because I was bored.

386
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,480
The sight of her
just makes my blood boil.

387
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,250
She really has a special talent
for ticking people off.

388
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,720
How has everyone been?

389
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,190
Cha Jung Won, it's been forever.

390
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,560
Are you feeling okay now?

391
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,560
Jung Won, are you really okay?

392
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,900
- I knew you'd pull through.
- Thank you.

393
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,540
You're looking well.
That's a relief.

394
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,010
That's enough of a welcome party.
Don't we have work to do?

395
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,580
Putting on quite a show
for someone who's on suspension.

396
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,280
While you were out,

397
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,120
we got new design samples
for the new collection.

398
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,830
Do you have any good ideas?

399
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,360
What if we tried
changing the buttons?

400
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,830
A single button can add flair.

401
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,900
I like that.

402
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,570
I'll add that right away.

403
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,110
- What do you think?
- I hate all of your ideas.

404
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,680
Wasn't your desk in the break room?

405
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,180
That's right.
And now that Jung Won is back,

406
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,520
you should go back to
where you belong.

407
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,360
Designer Joo Young Chae?

408
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,930
Your suspension has been lifted.

409
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,300
- Really?
- All of a sudden?

410
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Why?

411
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,230
It's Vice President Jin's order.

412
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,040
Since it's an emergency now,
all ongoing disciplinary actions...

413
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,770
have been temporarily suspended.

414
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:42,150
We'll see if this ends up being
a blessing or a curse for you.

415
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
Just you watch.

416
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,650
I'll be the one who wins in the end.

417
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
This is Cha Jung Won.

418
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,930
Questioning as a witness?

419
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,500
So are you saying Jin Tae Seok
followed you to the rooftop...

420
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,270
with the intention of murdering you?

421
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,770
Yes, that's correct.

422
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,470
Chairman Jin.

423
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,740
What are you doing here?

424
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,840
It's a beautiful view.

425
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,680
And the weather is perfect.

426
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,180
It's quite high up.
It makes your head spin.

427
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,280
Are you here to stop
my press conference?

428
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,390
Or...

429
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,460
are you here to do something to me?

430
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,590
I can't go easy on you anymore.

431
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,630
This will be your grave.

432
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,800
Why would Jin Tae Seok
try to kill you?

433
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,740
- What was his motive?
- He needed to silence me.

434
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,910
So he wanted to stop the conference
you had scheduled?

435
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,210
That's not all.

436
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,110
I was recording Jin Tae Seok's voice
on my phone.

437
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,580
He realized what I was doing
and pushed me.

438
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,680
A recording?

439
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,490
What was on it?

440
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,760
A recording of me confessing
to murdering Cha Ki Beom?

441
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,470
That's a lie.
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

442
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,240
I don't know why Cha Ki Beom died.
If there's a recording, play it!

443
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,640
The recording is gone.

444
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,940
Chairman Jin Tae Seok
took my phone...

445
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,840
and threw it off the rooftop.

446
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,250
See?

447
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,820
Can you lock me up on her testimony
and no evidence, Prosecutor Kim?

448
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,120
Watch your tone, Mr. Jin Tae Seok.

449
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,460
"Mr. Jin Tae Seok?"

450
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,890
Do you have any idea whose money
put your boss in his seat?

451
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,030
Sometimes,
it's best to know your place.

452
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,240
I'm just biding my time
until this all blows over.

453
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,610
With one call, I can get a rookie
like you fired in an instant.

454
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,550
What? Han Hye Ra,
what did you just say?

455
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,180
I said I was going to become
the chairman of Kunhyang.

456
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,150
Are you out of your mind?

457
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,460
No, I'm perfectly sane.

458
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,260
Gong Nan Sook,
if you'll just help me,

459
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,830
nothing's impossible. Am I wrong?

460
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,270
And why would I help you?
If anyone's to be chairman, it's me.

461
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,740
You think Kunhyang would hand over
the chair to a lowly loan shark?

462
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,940
Be realistic.

463
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
Fine.

464
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,550
Then make me a realistic offer.

465
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,050
If I help you become the chairman,
what's in it for me?

466
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,230
Be my shadow, Gong Nan Sook.

467
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:01,310
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

468
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,120
(A Graceful Liar)

469
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,210
You're family and a top shareholder.

470
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,010
Take over as the gallery's director.

471
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,620
Don't think for a second
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

472
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,250
You won't even take my scraps?
How disappointing.

473
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,590
You helped
former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra...

474
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,920
attack my dad.

475
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,920
Have you abandoned me?

476
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,890
You want to be Kunhyang's Chairman,
don't you?

477
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,690
So which side should you be on?

478
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,030
Jin Tae Seok,
I want to see you fall.

479
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,360
Even lower than you are now.

480
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,530
I took you in and cared for you,
but you bit the hand that fed you.

481
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,900
Snap out of it,
Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

482
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,370
It's already over for you.

483
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,480
I'm taking your seat outright.

484
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,280
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
