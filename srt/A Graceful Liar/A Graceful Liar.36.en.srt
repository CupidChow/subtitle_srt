1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,840
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,380
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,080
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,410
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,120
(Kunhyang Group)

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,950
Vice Chairman Han arranged a meeting
with Cha Ki Beom.

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,550
I'll update you
once I've tracked her movements.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Where is she right now?

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,800
He would never hurt Su A.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,600
You think he mistook
Mi Hyang's daughter for Su A?

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,900
What happened
to Mi Hyang's daughter, Jung Won.

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,040
It was just bad luck.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,710
You know it too.

14
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,410
You know exactly what kind of man
Jin Tae Seok is.

15
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,810
He won't lay a hand on Su A.

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,480
I'll protect her with my life.

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,990
If Jin Tae Seok was behind that,

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,220
and if he tries anything again,

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,660
I won't let him get away with it.

20
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,890
Just leave Su A alone.

21
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,560
That's the only way to protect her.

22
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,000
Even if I had the whole world,

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,970
even if everyone bowed down to me,

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,240
my life without my daughter Su A...

25
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,910
felt like sand slipping
through my fingers.

26
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,000
Su A doesn't want that.

27
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,570
She never wants to see you again.

28
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,270
Does she know...

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,140
- that I'm her mother?
- She'll find out someday.

30
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,310
No,

31
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,840
she'll find out soon.

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,650
- What?
- Once I'm sure that girl is Su A,

33
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,720
I'll tell her myself.

34
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,420
That I'm her mother.

35
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,390
"That girl?"
Who are you talking about?

36
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,460
You've met Su A in person? How?

37
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,730
How dare you call her out here?

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
Escort Vice Chairman.

39
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,170
Please come with me.

40
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,190
Don't you think it's time
to tell your father the truth?

41
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,560
That you're married to Jin Se Hoon,
the heir to Kunhyang Group.

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,330
I can't. Absolutely not.

43
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,700
Because I'm Cha Su A.

44
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,110
You're Su A?

45
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,240
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra's real daughter?

46
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,310
When did you find out?

47
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,480
- You knew before the wedding?
- I did.

48
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,980
You said you wanted to soar...

49
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,790
and shine.

50
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,460
You said there was something
more important than marrying Se Hoon.

51
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,260
Was it about getting revenge
on your mother who left you...

52
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,330
by becoming her daughter-in-law?

53
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,530
That's right.

54
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,240
I know how painful it is
to lose someone you love.

55
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,840
I know you were abandoned.

56
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,180
The hurt, the resentment,
and the rage.

57
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,750
I may not understand everything,
but I get it. I really do.

58
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,920
But is getting revenge worth
turning your whole life into a lie?

59
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,320
Her life is a lie too.

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,460
She changed her name,
from Han Young Sun to Han Hye Ra,

61
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,760
to become the matriarch
of the Kunhyang family.

62
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,430
You should just tell
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra the truth.

63
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,200
That's the only way
to start untangling this whole mess.

64
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,970
And what about the fake Su A?

65
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,740
The fake Su A?

66
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,140
Cha Ki Beom,
I should've killed you back then.

67
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,910
I should have thrown away
any shred of pity!

68
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,680
Jin Tae Seok, you're the one
who should have died at my hands!

69
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,380
Darn it.

70
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,200
Teach him a lesson,

71
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,230
but don't kill him.

72
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,110
He's the one who framed me
for murder,

73
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,480
all so he could have you
for himself.

74
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,250
Jung Won was only seven.

75
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,760
Why was such a sickly child hit
by a car, all alone?

76
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,090
He mistook Jung Won for Su A...

77
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,630
Jin Tae Seok is more than capable
of something like that.

78
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,560
Something like what?

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,740
Do you think I might've killed
Cha Ki Beom with my own hands?

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,170
What did you do to Ki Beom?

81
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,910
How dare you say that jerk's name
to my face?

82
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,480
Do you still feel guilty
and sorry for him?

83
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,350
Does your heart ache for him?
Do you still long to be in his arms?

84
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,790
- Han Hye Ra.
- Did you...

85
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,820
frame Ki Beom for murder?

86
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,960
Did you harm Mi Hyang's daughter,
Jo Jung Won too,

87
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,190
thinking she was my daughter, Su A?

88
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,060
Tell me.

89
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,730
Answer me!

90
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,570
So Chairman Gong and Chairman Jin...

91
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,040
are passing Young Chae off
as fake Su A?

92
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,370
Are you sure you heard that right?

93
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,770
I confirmed it...

94
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,510
with Chairman Gong.

95
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,310
They're all insane!

96
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,450
To deal with these lunatics,

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,220
I have to become even crazier.

98
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,820
I can't see what's ahead.

99
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,390
It's like I'm in a raging storm
in the dark,

100
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,930
standing all alone.

101
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,170
I'm so scared.

102
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,060
It's not true, is it?

103
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,620
You're not that cruel a person,
are you?

104
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,860
I would have, if I could.

105
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,460
What?

106
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,130
If I could have you all to myself,
I would have done anything.

107
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
So?

108
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,000
If Cha Ki Beom was framed,
it was Gong Nan Sook's doing.

109
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,440
You know, Joo Sang Cheol,
Gong Nan Sook's ex-husband.

110
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,380
That whole thing may have
brought you to me sooner,

111
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,780
but I had nothing to do with it.

112
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,080
What about Jo Mi Hyang's daughter,
Jo Jung Won?

113
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,390
I don't even know who she is.

114
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,260
But I mistook her for your daughter?

115
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,790
Did you think I was a monster
who hurts people?

116
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,330
And your own daughter, no less?

117
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,230
Why on earth are you suddenly
bringing this up after 25 years?

118
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,170
I was scared.

119
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,180
That my suspicions might be true.

120
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,610
And that my distrust of you
would just keep growing.

121
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,450
Look at me.

122
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,950
The whole world may bow down to me,

123
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,690
but I have always knelt before you.

124
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,630
Find Su A first.

125
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,890
If we find Su A,

126
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,330
can you accept her
as part of our family?

127
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,870
Your daughter is my daughter.

128
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,980
I was being paranoid...

129
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,910
because of this whole thing
with Su A.

130
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,650
Get some rest,

131
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,720
and you'll feel more at ease.

132
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,560
The DNA test results should be here
any minute.

133
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,230
But the results are already
a foregone conclusion, aren't they?

134
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,100
I'm talking about Young Chae.

135
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,670
Wasn't a fake Cha Jung Won enough?

136
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,740
Now a fake Su A?

137
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,940
I can't even have a thought
in the morning...

138
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,810
without the Kunhyang family
gossiping about it by evening.

139
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,780
CEO Joo.
You have sharp ears, don't you?

140
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,050
Or is your intuition just that good?

141
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,890
Why complicate this even further?

142
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,920
Use that business sense of yours
and try to figure it out.

143
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,460
- Our very own CEO Joo.
- Chairman Gong!

144
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,690
It's Mother.

145
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,660
Wasn't taking Kunhyang Group
using the fake Young Chae enough?

146
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,600
I mean, wasn't using
Cha Jung Won enough?

147
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,830
It's your ploy to bring down
Vice Chairman Han...

148
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,540
by making Young Chae a fake Su A.
Am I wrong?

149
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,770
A ploy?

150
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,640
I called it business.
And a brilliant move, at that.

151
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,180
- Stop this now.
- And if I don't?

152
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,980
I will not stand by
and let this happen.

153
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,080
- I have to stop this madness...
- Stop it?

154
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,850
Are you going to reveal...

155
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,050
that Cha Jung Won
is Han Hye Ra's real daughter?

156
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,920
At least, you shouldn't use
Young Chae to pose as a fake Su A.

157
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,990
Not if you're her mother!

158
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,660
And what if this is
all for Young Chae's sake?

159
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,030
You think this is just about
taking down Han Hye Ra?

160
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,170
Once I've taken both
Jin Se Hoon and Jin Se Mi,

161
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,270
you never know...

162
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,240
Young Chae might just become
the heir to the Kunhyang Family.

163
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,170
So you're going to use Young Chae
as your puppet again?

164
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,480
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

165
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,980
Anyway, that can wait.

166
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,190
Right now, we have to handle
this mess about Su A.

167
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,390
Han Hye Ra is bound to find out...

168
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,160
that her daughter-in-law is
her real daughter.

169
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,590
The truth is bound to come out.
This just speeds it up.

170
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,760
A lie has become the truth,
and what's fake has become real.

171
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,930
And if you keep this up,

172
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,870
you will face divine retribution.

173
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,300
Joo Ha Neul,
have you lost your mind?

174
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,110
- How dare you talk to me like that?
- So you are afraid of retribution,

175
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,880
Chairman Gong Nan Sook?

176
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,820
What's gotten into him
all of a sudden?

177
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:14,990
Has he gone mad?

178
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,550
Why...

179
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,390
Hey!

180
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,860
What on earth did you say to him?
He completely snapped...

181
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,000
Joo Ha Neul is about
to do something disastrous.

182
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,840
You protect the DNA test
for Han Hye Ra and Young Chae.

183
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,040
A DNA test?

184
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,620
Secretary Yoon,
where are you right now?

185
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,590
Honey...

186
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,790
What happened?

187
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,930
- Did you get in a fight?
- No.

188
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,000
I had a few drinks,

189
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,430
and I missed a step
and fell down the stairs.

190
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,700
It doesn't look like
it's from a fall.

191
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,840
I'm tired. I need to get some rest.

192
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
What about dinner?

193
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,470
I'm not hungry.

194
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,610
He lives for food.

195
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,450
Why isn't she home yet?

196
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,980
What about dinner?

197
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,850
I don't need to eat.

198
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,150
Did they plan this or something?

199
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,460
The mood is so strange.

200
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes.

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,300
To the Kunhyang Family?

202
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,230
You still have
the test results, right?

203
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,440
Okay, hurry over here, Min Jung.

204
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,710
What if it's not her
this time either?

205
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,550
Su A?

206
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,290
I did change my name to Jung Won
when I was a kid.

207
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,020
I wonder if my name
was Su A back then.

208
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,260
I can't really remember.

209
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,530
It's weird, isn't it?

210
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,300
Whenever I see you,

211
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,070
I'm reminded of my mom
who left me when I was seven.

212
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,870
Cha Jung Won...

213
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,740
is my Su A.

214
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,150
- What are you doing here, CEO Joo?
- I'm glad I caught you.

215
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,450
I'm not sure what you mean.

216
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,460
I need to see the test results.

217
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,800
- I don't know what you mean.
- I don't mean any harm.

218
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,260
I don't mean to cause you trouble,
Secretary Yoon.

219
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,100
- Young Chae.
- We need to talk.

220
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,570
- Later. This is more urgent...
- I said, we need to talk.

221
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,850
Those test results are fake.

222
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,220
If Vice Chairman Han gets them
as is, chaos will erupt.

223
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,430
There's no way Dr. Kim
would deceive Vice Chairman,

224
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,930
CEO Joo Ha Neul.

225
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,110
You want me to let her believe
those fake DNA results?

226
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,480
Why on earth?

227
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,610
Because it's not the right time.

228
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,410
You don't want Vice Chairman Han
to find out that you're Su A?

229
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,650
If it's going to be revealed,
I'll be the one to do it.

230
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,250
At the most opportune moment.

231
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,060
At the most painful moment.

232
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,060
Then Young Chae will become
a fake Su A.

233
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,600
I guess there's no such thing
as a free lunch.

234
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,130
I stole Young Chae's place,
and now she's trying to steal mine.

235
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,470
This is more than swapping lives.
It's denying the sacred family bond,

236
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,840
and you both swapped lives
based on a lie.

237
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,010
I almost understand Chairman Gong.
But why is Chairman Jin involved?

238
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,050
He doesn't want Vice Chairman Han
to meet the real Su A.

239
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,220
Chairman Jin knows that Cha Jung Won
is not Cha Su A.

240
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,530
Though he doesn't know
she is actually Young Chae.

241
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,460
Then why does he want to make
Cha Jung Won a fake Su A?

242
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,460
Because Vice Chairman Han thinks so.

243
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,570
So he plans to find the real Su A
on his own? In secret?

244
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,770
- And then...
- He won't let the real Su A be.

245
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,610
- That puts you in danger.
- To protect me,

246
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,150
I need a fake Su A...

247
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,650
even if it has to be Young Chae.

248
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,840
(There is a 0.123 percent match
in the genetic relationship...)

249
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,350
I'm reminded of my mom
who left me when I was seven.

250
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,550
(No biological relationship
established)

251
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,430
I did change my name to Jung Won
when I was a kid.

252
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,330
I wonder if my name
was Su A back then.

253
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,530
(There is a 99.998 percent match
in the genetic relationship...)

254
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,370
(between Han Hye Ra
and Cha Jung Won.)

255
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,040
I found my Su A.

256
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,010
(There is a 99.998 percent match
in the genetic relationship...)

257
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,010
(between Han Hye Ra
and Cha Jung Won.)

258
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,290
(There is a 99.998 percent match
in the genetic relationship...)

259
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,290
(between Han Hye Ra
and Cha Jung Won.)

260
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,330
Jung Won was
Han Hye Ra's biological daughter, Su A.

261
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,610
Your real daughter is posing
as Joo Young Chae, your son's wife.

262
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,680
And Joo Young Chae is the fake Su A.

263
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,710
Now you have to live with that.

264
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,780
That's your karma, Han Hye Ra.
It's divine retribution.

265
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,660
What a relief. That Cha Jung Won...

266
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,230
isn't Han Hye Ra's
biological daughter.

267
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,860
I know you're more tight-lipped
than anyone, but...

268
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,130
I'm aware.

269
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,730
That this is a secret
I must take to my grave.

270
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,270
But they say secrets
don't stay secret for long.

271
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,580
Why do you doubt my decision?

272
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,180
If I say the sky is the ground,
then it's the ground!

273
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,280
And if I say the ground is the sky?

274
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,820
Then it is the sky, sir.

275
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,550
That's what it takes...

276
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,250
to be one of my men.

277
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,330
- Find the real Su A, fast.
- Understood.

278
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,630
The girl who died in a car accident.

279
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,230
What was her name?

280
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,400
Her name was Jo Jung Won.

281
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,670
If Jo Jung Won...

282
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,040
is Jo Mi Hyang's
biological daughter,

283
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,040
then what about Cha Jung Won,
the fake Su A?

284
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,080
I will look into it.

285
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,680
Do it without a trace.

286
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,410
All secrets...

287
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,180
should be known by me alone.

288
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,450
I will take that to heart, sir.

289
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,090
(Jin Se Hoon)

290
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,900
Hey, the DNA test results
came in, right?

291
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,070
I guess Secretary Yoon delivered it
to Vice Chairman,

292
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,970
and you gave it to Chairman...

293
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,700
without letting Vice Chairman know.

294
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,540
- I need to know too.
- You sure you can handle it, sir?

295
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,950
For you, sir, this means
a powerful rival has just appeared.

296
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,210
There you go with that "sir" again.

297
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,380
- I said drop the formalities.
- Until now,

298
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,650
you've had more support
from Vice Chairman than Chairman.

299
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,120
That's what solidified your position
as the successor.

300
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,790
So you're saying my mother,
who's always fully supported me,

301
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,560
is going to shift her affection
to her real daughter?

302
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,900
What if the Vice Chairman gives
Kunhyang Group to that daughter?

303
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,840
I guess the line
of succession could change.

304
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,140
- I know it's premature, but...
- Unbelievable.

305
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,680
So my mother's real daughter
has actually shown up.

306
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,980
This is making me nervous.

307
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,280
So, who is Su A?

308
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,220
No, let me rephrase that.

309
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,590
It's not anyone I know, is it?

310
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,360
You'll find out when you meet her,
Vice President Jin.

311
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,730
She'd hand over power
to her own daughter?

312
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,500
Care for a glass of wine?

313
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,080
I wonder who Su A is.

314
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,180
She's sure to make a grand entrance
in the morning.

315
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,380
I wonder what she's like.

316
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,320
What if...

317
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,320
this new sister of yours, Su A,

318
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,520
turns out to be someone
you don't like?

319
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,120
Why would that matter?

320
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,100
- She's my mother's birth daughter.
- But what if your mother...

321
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,300
cares for her real daughter,
who newly appeared, more than you?

322
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,070
What if she wants
to give her the world?

323
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,910
Mother will be desperate
to make up for lost time.

324
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,210
She'll want to give her everything
she's ever wanted, and the world...

325
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,310
Maybe she even wants to give her
the entire Kunhyang Group.

326
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,080
You need to be prepared.

327
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,220
Are you worried
that my position will be threatened?

328
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,790
I'm worried that my position
will be threatened.

329
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,190
What?

330
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,570
You're worried you'll have to
deal with a new sister-in-law...

331
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,230
worse than Se Mi?

332
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,970
No matter what happens,

333
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,410
you'll take my side, right?

334
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,110
You're actually scared, aren't you?

335
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,610
If my new sister
gives you a hard time,

336
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,620
I promise I'll teach her a lesson.

337
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,750
That's reassuring.

338
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,190
(Cha Jung Won)

339
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,260

343
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,920
- How did you get this?
- This is easy when I actually try.

344
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,390
The fake Su A.

345
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,260
- You've set your mind to play her?
- Yes. I'm going to see it through.

346
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,030
How does it feel?

347
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,830
You're a step away
from having your life stolen.

348
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,730
It's the exact opposite.

349
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,300
I'm the one letting you pretend
to be Su A...

350
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,470
for a little while.

351
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,080
The number you have called
is currently unavailable...

352
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,520
(Young Chae)

353
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,530
Once I'm sure that girl is Su A,

354
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,800
I'll tell her myself.

355
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,460
That I'm her mother.

356
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,670
I wonder
if Han Young Sun met with Jung Won.

357
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,140
Did you secretly meet
with Han Young Sun?

358
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,370
- Well, I...
- You did.

359
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,240
Why do you keep seeing Young Sun?

360
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,040
You think I want to see her?

361
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,480
I know I’ll be in trouble
if I meet her.

362
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,480
Chairman Jin Tae Seok
beat you to a pulp, didn't he?

363
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,290
You're lucky
your legs weren't broken.

364
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,690
I tried
to call Jung Won's new number,

365
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,720
but she didn't answer.

366
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,260
Don't you worry about Jung Won.

367
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,060
She can take care of herself
better than you or I can.

368
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,960
Am I worried
she can't take care of herself?

369
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,170
I'm worried Han Young Sun
will mistake Jung Won for Su A.

370
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,470
You two worry about
the silliest things.

371
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,180
You're back.

372
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,680
That brat has no manners.

373
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
Unbelievable.

374
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,570
We need to talk tomorrow.
It's incredibly urgent.

375
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,600
You must come to the cafe near home
by 10 a.m.

376
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,320
I wonder what Su A
would want me to wear.

377
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,220
What food should I make for her?

378
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,190
Mom.

379
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,330
Am I invisible to you?

380
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,300
- Se Mi.
- So you have another daughter,

381
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,530
and you've finally found her,
haven't you?

382
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,030
I hear she's coming
to meet you today.

383
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,540
I'm so sorry
I couldn't tell you sooner.

384
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,850
There were...

385
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,050
circumstances that kept me
from telling you.

386
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,050
I have a right to know
that I have a sister.

387
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,990
I feel like an outcast
in this family.

388
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,560
- I know this is confusing for you.
- I'm hurt too.

389
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,160
Oh, no, what should I do?
I will be...

390
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,600
much more thoughtful from now on...

391
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,540
so you won't get hurt again, okay?

392
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,270
But still,

393
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,010
I'm happy that you're my mom.

394
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,340
Are you still happy
that I'm your daughter?

395
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,650
How could you even ask that?

396
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,890
My sweet girl.

397
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,660
What time is she coming,
my sister Su A?

398
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,220
Your sister Su A?

399
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,430
- Around lunchtime.
- I'll get ready and look my best.

400
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,100
Where are you off to?

401
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,170
What? I'm stepping out for a bit.

402
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,370
I'm having lunch with Manager Kim
from the luxury goods department.

403
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,940
All dressed up like that?

404
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,850
I thought you were sneaking off
to meet a lover.

405
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,650
Stop it. I'll be back before dinner.

406
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,000
What's with them?

407
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,840
Starting today,
I'm Han Hye Ra's daughter, Cha Su A.

408
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,840
No, I'm Jin Su A.

409
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,380
What's taking her so long?

410
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,620
That brat.
She definitely saw my message.

411
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,590
I know because
the unread notification is gone.

412
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,960
It's been over half an hour.

413
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,530
I think she came to see Jung Won
behind my back.

414
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,240
What on earth
has Jung Won gotten herself into?

415
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,410
Mi Hyang and Jung Won
are both acting suspicious.

416
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,540
The number you have called
is currently unavailable...

417
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,050
This won't do. I have to go
to the Kunhyang house.

418
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,280
I have to stop this before Ki Beom
finds out all the secrets.

419
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,450
The Kunhyang house?

420
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:48,450
Secrets?

421
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,080
She should be here by now.

422
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,790
How can she be so excited
about this?

423
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,890
Has she forgotten abandoning
her daughter in the first place?

424
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,690
I've never seen Mom so antsy before.

425
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,630
I feel so betrayed.

426
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,060
Don't let it show, Se Mi.

427
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,600
Thank you.

428
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,100
I'm going to go check outside.

429
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,040
Is she even going out to greet her?

430
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,360
Cha Jung Won, you joined
the Kunhyang family...

431
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,860
as their daughter-in-law,

432
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,690
and I'll take my place
as Han Hye Ra's daughter.

433
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,070
Who will be better
at this pretend play?

434
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,370
This is going to be fun.

435
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,440
(A Graceful Liar)

436
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,610
It's finally started.
The circus Gong Nan Sook arranged.

437
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,780
Only you can stop this, Chairman.
This fake Su A charade.

438
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,320
How dare you lecture me,
the chairman of Kunhyang Group?

439
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,920
How should I introduce her?

440
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,620
I'm sure everyone
already recognizes her.

441
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,830
- Cha Jung Won is Cha Su A.
- She's Jin Su A from now on.

442
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,430
Welcome. Now, the Kunhyang house
is your home, Su A.

443
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,200
Are you asking if Jung Won
is living at the Kunhyang house?

444
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,470
Where Mi Hyang went to see Jung Won
was the Kunhyang house.

445
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,300
Make sure Cha Ki Beom
keeps his mouth shut.

446
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,510
Otherwise, I'll have to send him
to the afterlife.

447
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,540
Got it?

448
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,210
