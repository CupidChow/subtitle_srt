00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,460
Why...

8
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,530
Why does it say Jo Jung Won,

9
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,830
not Cha Su A?

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why?

11
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,940
Could Ki Beom have been lying?

12
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,180
My Su A...

13
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,110
My Su A is alive.

14
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,950
I'm sure she's alive.

(Episode 32)

16
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,390
Sneaking in like a stray cat...

17
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,230
to play the lady of the house
while Chairman Gong is at work?

18
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,970
Whether it's that house or here,
they both belong to my mom and me.

19
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,270
The one you stole from me.

20
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,010
Did you call me here just to whine
about how unfair it is?

21
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,440
You...

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,010
have an old music box, don't you?

23
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,880
Why do you ask?

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,850
Vice Chairman Han asked Mom
if Cha Jung Won...

25
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,120
gave it to Joo Young Chae.

26
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,160
It's Chairman Gong.

27
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,360
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra moved fast.

28
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,500
Why is Vice Chairman Han
so interested in your music box?

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,170
- Why are you asking me?
- You're me, and I'm you, right?

30
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,170
If we say Joo Young Chae gave it
to Cha Jung Won,

31
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,870
we need to have
the same story, right?

32
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,710
On one condition.

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,140
Your promise not to get in my way...

34
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,180
to become a Kunhyang designer
isn't enough.

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,820
You have to actively help me.

36
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,780
A promise?

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,790
Do you even know
how to keep a promise?

38
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,260
I'll handle the music box myself.

39
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,790
Don't lie about what you don't know.

40
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,360
Lie?

41
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,170
Hey. Isn't your whole life a lie?

42
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,500
I was going to stop living as you.

43
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,210
But now, I have to live as
Joo Young Chae.

44
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,510
I must.

45
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,210
It wasn't my lies
that stole your life.

46
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,980
You threw your own life away.

47
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,380
Don't just call me
whenever you please.

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,490
Being a Kunhyang daughter-in-law
isn't a leisurely position.

49
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,930
Why is that stupid music box
such a big deal anyway?

50
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,970
(Chairman Jin Tae Seok)

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,310
Se Mi has a similar music box.

52
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,810
I saw it too. Isn't it amazing?

53
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,640
It's not a common design.
I heard Mother bought it for her.

54
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,250
Did Chairman Gong buy yours?

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,520
It must be pretty unique,
seeing how everyone's so curious.

56
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,420
You still haven't answered
my question.

57
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,560
I was too young to remember
who bought it for me...

58
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,700
or who gave it to me.
I can't remember that far back.

59
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,600
It's like it was fated to be mine.

60
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,070
All I know is that
it's something precious.

61
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,150
(Kunhyang Group)

62
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,850
Sir, it's time for
the board meeting.

63
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,660
I'll stop by Vice Chairman's office
on my way.

64
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,030
Vice Chairman can't attend.
I got a call from her secretary.

65
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,660
Is something wrong?

66
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,330
Mi Hyang.

67
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,600
My Su A...

68
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,810
is alive, isn't she?

69
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,950
What are you talking about?
She passed away ages ago.

70
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,750
October 5, 2000.

71
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,350
That's right.

72
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,590
That poor child.
We lost her that day.

73
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,400
It's all my fault.

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,100
I was right there with her,

75
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,400
but I stepped away to make lunch.

76
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,970
If only I hadn't gone to fix
that one stupid meal,

77
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,110
I wouldn't have lost her like that.

78
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,880
My poor baby.

79
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,050
Right.

80
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,050
Mi Hyang, your child, Jo Jung Won.

81
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,620
She's the one
who passed away that day.

82
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,960
I went back to the tree burial site.

83
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,070
At first,
the nameplate was for my Su A.

84
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,840
But now, it's for Jo Jung Won,
your daughter.

85
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,140
You must have been seeing things.

86
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,180
No. I saw it clearly.
Stop lying to me.

87
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,910
My Su A.

88
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,050
Where is she now?

89
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,520
Why say she's alive when she's dead?
It's heartbreaking.

90
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,160
I didn't abandon Su A.

91
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,930
I had no other choice...

92
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,060
but to break my promise...

93
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,730
to come back for her.

94
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,970
Don't you dare
tell such a blatant lie.

95
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,640
What on earth is more important
for a mother than her own child?

96
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,740
I was in a car accident.

97
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,740
When I went back to find her,
both you and Su A...

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,610
were gone.
Ki Beom wouldn't let me visit him,

99
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,150
and he never answered
any of my letters.

100
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,250
If you were so desperate to see her,
you should have looked for her.

101
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,960
I did.
I searched for her frantically.

102
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,830
- For 25 long years.
- Don't give me that!

103
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,960
It's not that
you couldn't find Su A.

104
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,200
- You didn't want to.
- How could you say that?

105
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,140
How could I not look for my child?

106
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,640
If you hadn't hidden her away
from me...

107
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,370
Even if I had hidden her
in the fiery pit,

108
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,980
you should've found her.

109
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,340
The truth is,

110
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,550
no matter how you try to deny it,
Young Sun,

111
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,650
you cared more about
being a rich man's wife...

112
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,890
than you ever did
about finding your child.

113
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,260
That's not true. It's not!

114
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,320
You...

115
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,390
wouldn't find your own child
even if she was right in front.

116
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,860
You wouldn't even recognize her.
That's the kind of mother you are!

117
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,870
Mi Hyang!

118
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,470
Jo Mi Hyang
won't tell you the truth.

119
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,280

(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

121
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,380
A music box?

122
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,320
- The one that plays a lullaby?
- Do you know something about it?

123
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,480
Why are you looking at that
without asking?

124
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,450
It's a great drawing.

125
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,150
It's like
I can almost hear the music.

126
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,650
It was for my drawing class.

127
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,090
We had to draw
one of our personal belongings.

128
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,590
But it's not just some random thing.

129
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,960
It's special to you, isn't it?

130
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,200
Did your parents get it for you?

131
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,800
- My mom.
- A gift from your mom?

132
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,940
I don't have one.

133
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,570
A mom, I mean.

134
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,010
I'm sorry.

Jung Won, is the tteokbokki ready?

137
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,350
Yes, Young Chae. It's amazing.

138

asked Mother...

139
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,170
about Cha Jung Won's music box?

140
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,540
It's so strange.
I'm sure they're connected somehow.

141
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,440
Is this really the time for you
to worry about a music box?

142
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,210
Why are you acting like
this doesn't concern you?

143
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,380
You can afford a studio apartment
for me, can't you?

144
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,880
What if a rumor starts
that I'm dating Cha Jung Won...

was coming for her.

Of course. It was on my orders.

as Vice President.

- And who is this?
- This is my team. Stay out of it.

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,250
You're curious too, aren't you?

177
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,880
So imagine how I feel.

178
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,690
When Su A was young,
she lived with Cha Jung Won, right?

179
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,160
And Cha Jung Won was friends
with our daughter-in-law.

180
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,460
My Su A...

181
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,560
is alive.

182
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,630
- What?
- Jo Mi Hyang and Cha Ki Beom lied.

183
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,430
How can a dead girl come back alive?

184
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,500
You wish she were dead, don't you?

185
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,310
Even if she were alive,

186
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,240
- you'd want her dead, right?
- That's enough.

187
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,880
No, you're the one
who needs to stop!

188
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,750
What, am I not your wife anymore...

189
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,250
just because I'm meeting
Jo Mi Hyang and Cha Ki Beom?

190
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,180
Your obsession...

191
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,190
and your jealousy.
I am sick and tired of it!

192
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,190
Don't meet Cha Ki Beom.
I'll find Su A myself.

193
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,860
And I mean it.

194
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,670
I'm very busy.

195
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,870
Now get out of my office.

201
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,700
I think Mom has another daughter.

202
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,730
What?

203
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,740
What ridiculous rumor
have you been listening to now?

204
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,070
I heard it with my own ears.
Her name is Su A.

205
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,820
Where's Dad?

206
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,420
He's out picking up laundry.
It's time for his rounds, isn't it?

207
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,960
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra
was here? Again?

208
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,860
Young Sun is looking for you.

209
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,900
But she abandoned me.

210
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,330
She said she had a major accident...

211
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,630
and couldn't keep
her promise to you.

212
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,000
- She's looked for you for 25 years.
- That's a lie.

213
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,440
As if there's anything
the Kunhyang family can't do.

214
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,770
Even if I did change my name,

215
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,210
all she had to do
was find you and Dad.

216
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,150
That's why
I gave her a piece of my mind too.

217
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
I told her...

218
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,390
that you were dead.

219
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,760
- I did, and so did your dad.
- Dad met with her too?

220
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,360
He wouldn't have told her
about me, right?

221
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,760
You see,

222
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,500
to finally put an end
to that twisted fate,

223
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,470
he told her
you died in a car accident.

224
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,240
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,610
What?

226
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,340
- How could he tell a lie like that?
- Your dad was only trying...

227
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,150
to cut that toxic bond for good.

228
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,850
And what was her reaction?

229
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,350
She looked exactly
like a mother who'd lost her child.

230
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,020
Su A...

231
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,790
is no longer with us.

232
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,260
She's not dead!

233
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,200
Tell me again! She's not dead!

234
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,200
I almost let it slip...

235
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,200
and told her that Su A was alive
and has grown into a lovely woman.

236
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,470
I nearly blurted out
the whole truth.

237
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,280
That promise she made
to come get you.

238
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,710
I'm starting to think
there really was a reason...

239
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,720
- why she couldn't keep it.
- It's all an act.

240
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,550
Her entire life is a performance.
It's all lies.

241
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,320
She presents herself as the kindest,
most generous person in the world,

242
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,160
as if she gives away
more than she even has.

243
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,960
She didn't have the look of a mother
who'd abandon her own child.

244
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,600
Don't ever see her again.

245
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,700
Even if you meet her by chance,

246
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,270
don't ever mention that I'm alive
or that I'm her daughter-in-law.

247
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,440
What about your dad?

248
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,150
It's a secret from Dad too.

249
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,050
What's a secret?

250
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,690
What are you two plotting
over there?

251
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,500
I got you a surprise gift
since I couldn't make the wedding.

252
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,170
I know this is late,

253
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,840
but congratulations on your wedding.

254
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,680
I wish you a long and happy life,
Mom and Dad.

255
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,550
What's all the fuss about
our wedding at our age?

256
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,280
There's no need
for our grown-up daughter...

257
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,520
to make such a fuss.

258
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,720
Our Jung Won is a great daughter,
isn't she?

259
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,520
She means we've lived well,
although life was rough,

260
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,960
and she's wishing us a happy
and loving life from now on.

261
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,630
It's her way of
giving us her blessing.

262
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,430
I, Cha Ki Beom,

263
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,260
may have been falsely accused
and even served time in prison.

264
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,500
But those five years?

265
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,970
I can chalk it up to a life lesson.

266
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,380
If there's anyone happier than me,
I dare them to step forward!

267

00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,660
Why is everyone so obsessed
with your music box?

270
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,630
So the news even reached
my fake brother.

271
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,470
- About my music box.
- I saw it in your sketchbook...

272
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,700
when you were in high school.

273
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,110
I asked if it was from your mom,
but you said you didn't have one.

274
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,980
You have a killer memory.

275
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,310

who abandoned you?

a sincere piece of advice...

Or rather, a request.

279
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,190
Don't ask where I got my music box,

280
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,700
or what I plan to do with it.

281
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,570
- Look who's worrying.
- And stop worrying about me.

So it's serious enough
that I could get hurt?

284
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,070
That makes me even more worried.

285
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,680
It's time to go back to being
the Kunhyang daughter-in-law.

will turn back into a pumpkin?

strikes midnight,

aren't you scared your princess gown
will turn back into rags?

I have nowhere to live!

346
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,830
How is that
not living like a beggar?

347
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,730
You have to give her an out.

348
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,300
Even a cornered rat will fight back.

349
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,200
Good grief...

350
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,950
Move into Cha Jung Won's house.

351
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,720
Use any means necessary. Understand?

352
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,360
- Mother.
- Ha Neul, stop it.

353
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,320
It's no use.

354
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,900
Let's go, Ms. Young Chae.

355
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,680
How dare she defy me?

356
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,650
You're going too far.

357
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,250
Did you have to go this far?

358
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,390
- Mother.
- I'm addressing you as CEO Joo.

359
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,090
Do you think you can
walk all over me?

360
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,300
Of course not.

361
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,260
- To Young Chae...
- Her name is Cha Jung Won.

362
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,870
Try to see it from her perspective
for once.

363
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,070
This is beyond right and wrong.
She must feel terribly wronged.

364
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,950
What if she gets vindictive
and decides to blow everything up?

365
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,480
If that's her, I'll disown her.
What choice do I have?

366
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,220
If you can at least find her a place
to live...

367
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,960
Stay out of it.
She's my daughter. It's up to me.

368
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,190
- So she's not my sister?
- Whether I make her or break her...

369
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,030
is up to me.

370
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,900
If you interfere one more time,
I don't care if you're CEO Joo.

371
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,240
I will not forgive you.

372
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,870
Mark my words.

373
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,070
I've been far too lenient with you.

374
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,780
That ends now,

375
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,710
Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

376
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,890
Don't meet Cha Ki Beom.
I'll find Su A myself.

377
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,860
Now that I know she's alive,

378
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,300
how can I...

379
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,010
Where are you going?

380
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,250
Honey. Hye Ra!

381
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,300
Where am I supposed to go?

382
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,800
This is all Cha Jung Won's fault.

383
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,520
- Are you going on a trip?
- I have nowhere to go.

384
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
All thanks to you.

385
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,290
- What about your house?
- She sold it behind my back.

386
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,930
Then you should go and throw a fit
in front of Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

387
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,770
- Why did you come to me?
- I told you, I was kicked out.

388
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,080
- What do you want?
- Give me money for a house.

389
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,780
I thought you had so much money
you didn't know what to do with it.

390
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,350
I guess your life got more fun...

391
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,550
- with you being broke.
- You need to fix this.

392
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,760
Or else, I'm going to your dad
and tell him everything.

393
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,730
How you've stolen my name,
my identity,

394
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,260
and passed yourself off as
Kunhyang Family's daughter-in-law.

395
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,730
We're going to your house.

396
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,570
Right now.

397
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,010
I'll be the one taking you.

398
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,950
Oh, gosh.

399
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,270
Goodness.

400
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,970
Who keeps calling at this hour?
What's so urgent?

401
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,940
Who is this?

402
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,790
Who is it at this hour?

403
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
What?

404
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,590
What do you think you're doing
in here?

405
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,060
What's wrong?

406
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,540
What do you think you're doing?

407
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,040
What? My Su A died?

408
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,640
In a car accident?

409
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,210
You're her father,

410
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,480
so how could you lie that our child
died in such a gruesome way?

411
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,110
How could you?

412
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,190
Young Sun, that's enough.

413
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,220
My daughter Jung Won died
in a car accident.

414
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,030
- Is that true?
- Mi Hyang's daughter, Jung Won.

415
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,100
When she was seven...

416
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,800
Then what about our Su A?

417
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,970
She's alive.

418
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,340
Things are about to get messy.

419
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,110
It was the only way to break...

420
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,650
this cruel twist of fate.

421
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,780
How can you sever the sacred bond
between a parent and child?

422
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,690
- You think you can break that bond?
- Your greed is what broke it.

423
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,590
- That sacred bond.
- Greed?

424
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,930
You're right.

425
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,100
Right, my greed wasn't for you.
But it was for my daughter, Su A!

426
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,330
More than caring about you
being framed for murder,

427
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,200
I couldn't let my daughter Su A
live as a murderer's daughter.

428
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,170
I couldn't let her be scorned forever
as a murderer's daughter.

429
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,580
What's the point of saying that now?

430
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,910
Do you have any idea
how much Su A has suffered?

431
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,350
She painfully resented you,
and yet still longed for you.

432
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,580
All that built-up resentment, anger,
and all the difficult years,

433
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,590
I want to make it all up to her.

434
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,730
I want to give our Su A
the finest clothes and food.

435
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,430
I want her to live
her whole life smiling brightly.

436
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,870
Please let me see her, Ki Beom!
Why are you keeping her from me?

437
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,070
You've leeched off me long enough.

438
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,510
So just serve your time quietly
and disappear.

439
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,480
Unless you want to lose
your daughter Su A, as well.

440
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,120
As long as Jin Tae Seok is alive,
it's never going to happen!

441
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,460
She storms out on me...

442
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,260
and runs straight to
Cha Ki Beom's house?

443
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,310
(A Graceful Liar)

444
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,710
This is my friend, Joo Young Chae.

445
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,710
Why should that friend of yours
live in our house?

446
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:56,810
I guess her mom's still mad.
She cut her off and sold the house.

447
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,280
This is temporary. Tell her
to find somewhere else to stay soon.

448
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,120
Young Chae is in that house?
You actually managed to pull it off?

449
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,150
Where's Su A?
Are you supposed to be meeting her?

450
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,490
Do you happen to know
someone named Su A?

451
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,890
I've seen her around,
but we've never been introduced.

452
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,690
What right do you have to appear now
and act like a devoted mother?

453
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,960
If they find out that Jung Won is
Young Sun's real daughter, Su A,

454
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,030
and the fake Joo Young Chae
posing as the daughter-in-law...

455
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,870
There's a good chance that girl is
Han Hye Ra's daughter, isn't there?

456
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,540
What are you suggesting?
That I'm Han Hye Ra's daughter?

457
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,810
