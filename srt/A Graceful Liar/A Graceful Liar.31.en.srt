(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,780
(in this drama are fictional.)

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,080
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,620
(Jo Jung Won)

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,720
Why...

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,690
Why does it say Jo Jung Won,

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,490
not Cha Su A?

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,190
Why?

9
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,290
(Jo Jung Won)

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,500
(Somang Childcare Center)

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,440
Oh, dear.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,810
Kunhyang Association is organized
by Kunhyang Group,

13
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,870
or rather, to be more precise,

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,240
I understand it's led
by Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
Is that correct?

16
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,450
No, that's not the case.

17
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,280
It was formed by a few of us
who wanted to be examples of giving.

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,850
It's always the Han Hye Ra show,
isn't it?

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,790
And what does the name
"Kunhyang" mean?

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,430
It means to walk a path of wellness
and grace together.

21
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,830
Ms. Joo Young Chae.

22
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,470
You're her daughter-in-law, correct?

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,700
Yes.

24
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:12,710
She will uphold the spirit of giving
as a Kunhyang Association member.

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,610
Why don't you say a few words
as well?

26
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,990
I'll spend my life giving back
as much as I've received.

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,420
Thank you.

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,890
I've noticed you often volunteer
at orphanages.

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,590
Is there any particular reason
for that?

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,060
I want to heal the hearts...

31
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,530
of children...

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,140
who've been abandoned
by their families.

33
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,310
A wound caused by a person...

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,410
can only be healed by another.

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,160
"Heal the hearts of children..."

36
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,960
"who've been abandoned
by their families?"

37
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,590
Do you even have the right?

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,730
You abandoned your daughter
when she was seven.

39
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,200
You turned your back on your husband
when he was framed for murder.

40
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,770
I will...

41
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,840
rip off that mask of yours...

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
piece by piece.

43
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,090
What's wrong?
Do you have indigestion?

44
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,560
I'm fine.

45
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,270
Where did you get it?

46
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,310
It just happened...

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,910
It just happened to find
its way to me.

48
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,880
Does Young Chae still get
under your skin?

49
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,920
(Episode 31)

50
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,520
No. Your advice was a big help.

51
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,660
The children took to her so well.

52
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,060
Kids are drawn to kind people.

53
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,460
Like you.

54
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,040
Drink that slowly.

55
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,410
I just want to get
a good night's sleep.

56
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,250
About Young Chae...

57
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,950
Why don't you groom her
to be the next Han Hye Ra?

58
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,890
Make her the perfect new face
for Kunhyang Group.

59
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,360
That's a good idea.

60
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,170
Everyone raves
about your amazing business acumen.

61
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,010
Is it possible...

62
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,180
that you fabricated your credentials
just for show?

63
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,880
Fabricated my credentials?

64
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,580
I hear that's all the rage
these days.

65
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,390
Where can I buy a diploma
from New York Hudson University?

66
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,430
Today must have been hard, honey.

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,760
I heard...

68
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,700
your mother studied painting
at New York Hudson University.

69
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,200
- Why do you ask?
- I didn't know she painted.

70
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,070
Didn't your mom tell you?

71
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,170
I thought everyone knew.

72
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,210
You know my mom and yours
don't really get along.

73
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,610
She's just jealous, though.

74
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,580
That's true. The vice chairman
is in a class of her own.

75
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,750
She has a businesswoman's cool head,

76
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,490
plus the sensibility and soul
of an artist.

77
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,090
It's a shame.

78
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,820
What is?

79
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,560
With her eye for art and talent,

80
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,130
she shouldn't have
only done business.

81
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,970
She'd never let on, but I'm sure
that deep down, she regrets it.

82
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,640
Creative types need to pour
all their passion into their work...

83
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,340
to feel truly fulfilled.

84
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,780
So that was it?

85
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,280
Whenever Mother would stare off
into the distance and sigh,

86
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,850
I just assumed it was
because work was difficult.

87
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,720
You should focus
more on business now.

88
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,260
Then she can immerse herself in art,
which is what she's always wanted.

89
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,160
For Mother?

90
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,560
I never thought of it that way.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,600
That she gave up her dream of being
an artist for Kunhyang Group.

92
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,370
And she has no idea
you've thought so deeply about her.

93
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,980
I don't understand her.

94
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,380
As long as you never change,
I can get through anything.

95
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,530
This bum has done nothing for days,
just sleeping his life away.

96
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,330
And you call yourself a man?

97
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,640
If nothing was going to change,

98
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,970
why on earth
did we waste money on the wedding?

99
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,380
You clueless idiot.

100
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,610
Darn it.

101
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,460
My goodness.

102
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,290
Just looking at money
makes me so happy.

103
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,400
(Kunhyang Group)

104
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,570
We'll soon know the identity
of the new designer you mentioned.

105
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,240
I've contacted the galleries
in the Marais, Paris,

106
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,710
and the director of one of them
replied that they've met her.

107
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,550
Tell them to send over
any photos they've taken with her.

108
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,010
Understood.

109
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,850
Is something on your mind?

110
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,190
Min Jung,
about my daughter-in-law...

111
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,090
Why is she so hostile toward me?

112
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,730
Why...

113
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
does she have the music box
I bought for Su A as a child?

114
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,400
Should I run...

115
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,070
a deeper background check
on Ms. Young Chae?

116
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,640
Not just what's on the surface.

117
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,450
I need you to find out
what she's hiding.

118
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,950
I should go see Jo Mi Hyang first.

119
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,590
At the Kunhyang Fashion Design Team?

120
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,730
- Me?
- I need someone I can rely on.

121
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,930
I'd love that. I started out
as a designer, after all.

122
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,700
If it's not too late for me.

123
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,040
Think of it as a chance
to fully showcase your skills.

124
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,110
So what should I call you now?
Madam?

125
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,280
Ms. Young Chae?

126
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,790
- What if the real one shows up?
- She has.

127
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,790
She's joining Kunhyang
as a designer.

128
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,930
Manager Kim. Please have my back.

129
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,800
We need to deal with
the most pressing matter first.

130
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,500
Sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.
She made me promise not to.

131
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,440
Mom?

132
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,020
I called you so many times.

133
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,380
I was desperate
I had to ask Manager Kim to get you.

134
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,750
You heartless girl.

135
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,600
- How's life with your rich in-laws?
- It's good.

136
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,370
Actually, it's thrilling.

137
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,600
Not answering my calls is one thing,
but why haven't you called your dad?

138
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,640
Because I'd have to
lie to him again.

139
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,210
Does that mean you should act like
you've cut us off?

140
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,650
I'm a newlywed.
I haven't had a moment to spare.

141
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,220
How's newlywed life for you two?
Is it good?

142
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,890
Don't even get me started. Anyway...

143
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,130
Where did you get all this money?

144
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,670
The crazy woman dropped it off.

145
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,470
She asked me
to take in her daughter.

146
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,970
Chairman Gong Nan Sook?

147
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,610
You're having Young Chae
live with you?

148
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,410
Does that even make sense?

149
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,980
And what are you going to tell Dad?

150
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,880
Absolutely not.

151
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,950
No, even if it were possible,
why did you take this money?

152
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,760
I've never seen this much money
in my entire life.

153
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,530
My head was just spinning.
I got a little greedy.

154
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,460
- No, a whole lot greedy.
- Mom.

155
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,120
Why did you want to see me?

156
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,720
You and I have no reason
to see each other anymore,

157
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,960
and we have nothing left to say.

158
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,930
- What is this?
- Do you recognize it?

159
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,440
My Su A had one just like this
when she was little.

160
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,740
- So what?
- I saw Su A's recently too.

161
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,650
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you keep any of her things?

162
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,220
- Did you just sell them all off?
- What?

163
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,220
How dare you say that to me?

164
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,290
Then why does someone else
have my Su A's music box?

165
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,690
Who is this person?

166
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,190
- My daughter-in-law.
- What about your daughter-in-law?

167
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,670
- Her name is...
- Joo Young Chae.

168
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,150
This is a music box I custom-made
for Su A when she was little.

169
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,260
Why does my daughter-in-law have it?

170
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,890
How would I know?

171
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,530
My daughter-in-law was friends with
your daughter, Cha Jung Won.

172
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,270
Did your daughter have
my Su A's keepsake?

173
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,000
Don't you dare bring up poor Su A,
who died after you abandoned her.

174
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,140
It reminded me too much of Su A,
so I sold it.

175
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,710
Just believe that's what happened.
Are we clear?

176
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,750
Jo Mi Hyang is lying too.

177
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,500
Are you all right?

178
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,040
I'm fine.

179
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,890
Hold on a moment.

180
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,760
There's something I must do.

181
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,160
Besides becoming a daughter-in-law
of a rich family?

182
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,200
There's something more?

183
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,630
It's more important than that.

184
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,900
Jung Won, that foolish girl.

185
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,970
She must've married
into that family,

186
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,640
knowing Han Hye Ra was her real mom.

187
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,380
Are you going somewhere?

188
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,860
Please excuse my behavior
upon our first meeting.

189
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,390
But we've met before.

190
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,460
She doesn't remember me.

191
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,670
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

192
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,840
Why are you bringing this to me?

193
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,410
Did Jo Mi Hyang tell you to keep it?

194
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,720
Young Chae.

195
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,920
You're going to make her live
with my family?

196
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,450
Of course.
She needs to live as Cha Jung Won.

197
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,290
How are you going to
convince my dad?

198
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,690
Why would I do the convincing?

199
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,900
If Jo Mi Hyang can't manage it,

200
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,730
then you have to, since you're
living as Joo Young Chae.

201
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,070
There's no way.
My dad will never accept her.

202
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,540
No, you can do it.

203
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,370
- Find a way. You've got this.
- But Chairman...

204
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,570
"Mom."

205
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,980
Mom, how can I do something
that even you can't?

206
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,650
I've heard you're even sharper
than I am.

207
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,750
Who told you that?

208
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,060
I guess I'm just used to people
who are obsessed with taking it all.

209
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,860
To just give it right back...

210
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,330
How novel.

211
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,300
Manager Gu, come in here.

212
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,640
- Put this back in the safe.
- Pardon?

213
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,910
- Did something happen?
- What's it to you?

214
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,840
I told you not to try and think
for yourself.

215
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,440
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,850
Now, get out.

217
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,450
You too. Get out.

218
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,890
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

219
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,560
Gosh, what a surprise.

220
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,130
What brings you to call, my in-law?

221
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,370
Young Chae is going to live
in Mr. Cha's house?

222
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,470
- How is that even possible?
- It's a problem I have to solve.

223
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,880
Right now, she can't stay
at her own place or with us.

224
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,080
And we can't just leave
a loose cannon like her...

225
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,150
to stay in a hotel by herself.

226
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,050
Even if I were the chairman... No.

227
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,920
Even if I were Mom,
I would've had the same idea.

228
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,520
Why don't we just tell your father
the truth?

229
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,720
Dad would collapse from the shock.

230
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,760
And it's not like we can tell him
to rent a room to her.

231
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,380
What's going on?
We just saw each other.

232
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,880
You'd better get
your story straight.

233
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,280
You know...

234
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,390
who Han Hye Ra is, right?

235
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,260
I just met with Han Hye Ra.

236
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,630
Why would you meet her?

237
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,930
She asked about the music box
you used to listen to as a child.

238
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,730
My music box?

239
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,170
Why would she ask you about that?

240
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,340
What right does that woman have?

241
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,310
You know, right?
You do know, don't you?

242
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,780
That Han Hye Ra...

243
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,440
That Han Young Sun...

244
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,810
- is your birth mother...
- No.

245
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,250
That woman is not my birth mother.

246
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,590
She's the monster who abandoned me.

247
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,460
What am I going to do with you?

248
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,020
Monster or not,
you knew who she was...

249
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,930
when you married into that family,
didn't you?

250
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,500
Why? Are you trying to get revenge?

251
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,000
I am.

252
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,030
The pain I've suffered...

253
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,940
and the despair and betrayal
my dad felt.

254
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,410
I'll make her pay it all back
100, no, 1,000 times over.

255
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,080
What will revenge accomplish?
You should just live your life...

256
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,780
and let Young Sun live hers.

257
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,250
The best revenge...

258
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,690
- is to forget they exist, right?
- How can I forget?

259
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,590
I can never forget.

260
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,190
I won't forget.

261
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,460
I'll make her cry tears of blood.

262
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,330
I will make her suffer pain
worse than the fiery pit.

263
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,110
(Kunhyang Group)

264
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,810
You want to partner with
CEO Joo Ha Neul?

265
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,880
- Yes.
- You said it was...

266
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,150
an AI video generation startup.
Is it promising?

267
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,350
Based on my assessment, it is.

268
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:01,450
Then tell Joo Ha Neul
to prepare a presentation for us.

269
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,590
- The group will do a formal review.
- Understood.

270
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,660
Vice President,
marriage has changed you.

271
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,730
I can see it in your eyes.

272
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,200
It's because I'm starting to enjoy
the business.

273
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,860
Is it because you wed the right one?
Like I did?

274
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,940
Like you, Chairman,
I have someone precious to protect.

275
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,070
Gosh, you.

276
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,570
You've become much more mature.

277
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,510
You may go.

278
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,520
What is it?

279
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,630
Gosh, you're here.

280
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,270
What brings my oh-so-busy in-law
to such a humble place?

281
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,300
I never thought I'd see the day.

282
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,140
Goodness me, pigs must be flying.

283
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,710
I was curious to see your office,

284
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,920
and I have an important question
for you.

285
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,160
Se Mi's music box?

286
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,630
Why would Vice Chairman Han
meet Jo Mi Hyang...

287
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,060
and show her Se Mi's music box?

288
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,860
I was only observing
from outside the cafe,

289
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,000
so I couldn't ascertain that.

290
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,300
Watch Vice Chairman Han's
every single move.

291
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,670
Understood.

(Kunhyang Group)

293
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,640
Why is she still...

294
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,810
meeting with people
close to Cha Ki Beom?

295
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,750
Why?

296
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,630
This is a music box, isn't it?

297
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,530
It seems to have a bit of age on it,

298
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,860
and it looks like a valuable piece.

299
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,840
So, what's this about?

300
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,780
I was wondering if you bought
one like it for my daughter-in-law.

301
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,910
What is this hag up to?

302
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:14,220
You know, I've bought so much
for Young Chae.

303
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,920
I've probably bought her...

304
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,190
a dozen or so cheap music boxes
like this one.

305
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,160
I can't be expected to remember
every single design.

306
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,490
Then allow me to ask one more thing.

307
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,100
Did her high school friend,
a girl named Cha Jung Won,

308
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:34,240
ever give my daughter-in-law
a music box like this?

309
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,140
Why is she bringing up
Cha Jung Won all of a sudden?

310
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,110
My Young Chae is always so generous
with her gifts.

311
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,550
Maybe she felt awkward
always being on the receiving end.

312
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,090
Whether that girl gave her
a tacky music box like this or not...

313
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,990
is not something I would remember.

314
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,490
But let me ask you something.

315
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,500
Why is this so important to you?

316
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,070
I was just curious.

317
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,370
- I have a dinner engagement.
- Excuse me?

318
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,440
I'll be on my way.

319
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,910
Wait...

320
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,610
She asked me to see me,
and she's just leaving?

321
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,780
If we weren't in-laws, I swear...

322
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,180
Have a good evening.

323
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,990
What on earth is the story
behind that music box?

324
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,690
Gosh, I'm dying to know!

325
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,800
What am I going to do
about this twisted fate?

326
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,070
Twisted fate? You mean us?

327
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,010
Gosh, my back.
Did someone kick me or something?

328
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,380
I'm making dinner with a bad back,
and this is the thanks I get?

329
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,420
Why are you cooking? You never do.

330
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,450
I won't die if I miss one meal.

331
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,650
I thought you'd compliment me,
not get angry.

333
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,560
Something's up, right?

334
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,300
- What? Nothing's going on.
- Then why the long face?

335
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,100
What is it? What's going on?

336
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,040
Don't tell me you already found
something new you want.

337
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,210
Do you think I'm some spoiled brat
who's always asking for things?

338
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,040
- I'm going to go lie down.
- But what about dinner?

339
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,650
I'm not hungry.
You can eat without me.

340
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,920
You're someone who'd wake up
for food. What's gotten into you?

341
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,120
Honey.

342
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,690
What is it? Tell me.

343
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,060
No, it's nothing. Forget it.

344
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
What is with her?

(The Crown Capital)

346
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,770
Maybe we should've gotten champagne.

347
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,910
Let's not pop it yet.
We'll save it for the signing.

348
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,880
With Chairman Jin being like that,
it's 99 percent a done deal.

349
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,750
Thanks.

350
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,720
I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

351
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,250
I was bored as Kunhyang Group's VP
and the department store's CEO.

352
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,520
So, what? Do you want to
produce a movie or what?

353
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,490
- I'd be down for that.
- You're something else.

354
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,870
Why would you just barge in
without calling?

355
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,340
I bought this house with my money,
and you're living as Cha Jung Won.

356
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,040
Do I really need your permission
to stop by?

357
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,510
Did you come just to annoy me?

358
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,310
Now, think carefully.

359
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,750
In high school, did Cha Jung Won
ever give you a music box?

360
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,050
A music box?

361
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,620
You mean, the kind
that plays a song?

362
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,690
Please.
As if she could even afford a gift.

363
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
That's a good point.

364
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,290
- So why did she ask?
- Did Cha Jung Won say something?

365
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,760
Is she claiming she gave me a gift?

366
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,800
No, Han Hye Ra asked me
if that ever happened.

367
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,170
Vice Chairman Han asked you?

368
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,870
I don't know what this is all about,
but it's clearly important to her.

369
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,510
She may ask you, so you need to ask
Cha Jung Won about the music box...

370
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,480
No. Just be sure to
ask Young Chae beforehand, okay?

371
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,520
- Come on, Mom!
- Move out of this house now.

372
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,860
The Kunhyang family thinks
you're Cha Jung Won,

373
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,460
but if you keep living here,
you'll blow your cover, you fool.

374
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,460
- Then where am I supposed to live?
- How many times have I told you?

375
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,100
Move into the house Cha Jung Won
used to live in, by any means.

376
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,630
Unbelievable.

377
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,010
She's asking if Jung Won
gave me a music box?

378
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,750
Why is that important
to Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra?

379
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,610
Father.

380
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,580
Is that music box yours?

381
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,980
I've had it since
I was a little girl.

382
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,950
It must be very precious to you.

383
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,720
Yes.

384
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,160
Se Mi has a similar music box.

385
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,830
(Jo Jung Won)

386
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,200
(May you be free of pain
and play to your heart's content.)

387
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,500
(Jo Jung Won)

388
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:41,570
Why...

389
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,570
Why does it say Jo Jung Won,

390
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,410
not Cha Su A?

391
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,080
Why?

392
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,720
Could Ki Beom have been lying?

393
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,190
My Su A...

394
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,790
My Su A is alive.

395
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,890
I'm sure she's alive.

396
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,700
(A Graceful Liar)

397
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,630
My Su A is alive, isn't she?

398
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,130
Why say she's alive when she's dead?
It's heartbreaking.

399
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,570
Young Sun, you cared more about
being a rich man's wife...

400
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,940
than you ever did
about finding your child.

401
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,140
Don't ever see her again.
Even if you meet her by chance,

402
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,180
don't ever mention that I'm alive
or that I'm her daughter-in-law.

403
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,350
Wasn't Jo Mi Hyang enough?
Now you're going to see Cha Ki Beom?

404
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,920
It's my Su A's music box.
The one I bought for her as a child.

405
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,090
Then why does our daughter-in-law
have that child's keepsake?

406
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,020
You have an old music box,
don't you?

407
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,390
Why is everyone so obsessed
with your music box?

408
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,600
Don't ask where I got my music box
or what I plan to do with it.

409
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,700
You'll get hurt.

410
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,370
