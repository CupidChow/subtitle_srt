1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,270
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,340
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,280
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,820
We have the data...

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,220
from Cha Jung Won's phone
from the rooftop incident.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,920
Can I check it now?

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,930
Hye Ra killed your father.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,560
Actually, it might just be easier
for you to believe that.

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,230
Are you saying Han Hye Ra
wasn't the one who did it?

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,940
- You want to know?
- Tell me the truth.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,540
Was it you?

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,970
That's right.
Cha Ki Beom was very much alive.

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,710
They say people cling to life.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,120
After he fell and his head bled,
he was still alive.

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,520
Do you have any idea
how terrified I was?

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,990
On Jung Won's phone,

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,660
there was a recording
of Jin Tae Seok's confession.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,060
Jin Tae Seok.

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,770
I got you.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,130
This is decisive evidence.

21
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,440
What are you going to do with it?

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,910
I'm going to use it, of course.

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,980
Do you have any idea
how terrified I was?

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
(Voice recording)

25
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,920
How did you get this?

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,090
Why are you playing this for me?

27
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,630
I'm weighing my options.

28
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,460
What should I do with this?

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,000
Are you going to submit this
to the prosecutors as evidence?

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,300
That's one option.

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,670
Then...

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,010
you'd be locked up for sure.

33
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,150
But if there's no physical evidence,

34
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,180
you might avoid being detained.

35
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,080
So there's a chance
you won't submit it?

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,060
If you take my offer...

37
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,860
What offer?

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,370
You killed his birth mother!

39
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,910
Now Se Hoon will blame me for this.

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,580
Do you even realize
what you've done to me?

41
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,580
Look,
just because you're angry with me,

42
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,080
why did you kick Young Chae
out of the house?

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,690
What if she goes into shock
and something happens to A Reum?

44
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,160
Did you order my mother's murder,
Chairman Gong?

45
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,160
Is that what Jin Tae Seok told you?

46
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,070
Fine.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,840
Let's get all the facts out.
You know I'm direct, right?

48
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,440
- Just give me the facts.
- Jin Tae Seok ordered it.

49
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,140
My father...

50
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,080
ordered you to kill my mother?

51
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,620
It had to look like
Han Hye Ra murdered her.

52
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,520
Why on earth would you go that far?

53
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,220
It was to break you and Cha Jung Won
up for good.

54
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,390
So you thought
I would cut her off if Jung Won...

55
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,090
was the daughter
of my mother's killer?

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,960
Exactly. And I had to make sure
that Young Chae became your wife.

57
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,870
And as a result,
we're right back where we started.

58
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,970
Do you want to see me lose my mind?

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Jin Tae Seok is behind all this.
I was just a go-between...

60
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,680
Cut the excuses!

61
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,210
Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

62
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,320
I never want to see you
and your daughter Young Chae again.

63
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,150
You think that's possible?
Not with A Reum on the way.

64
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,220
As for A Reum,

65
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,860
the Kunhyang Family will take her in
when she's born.

66
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,290
Okay, I get it!

67
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,930
Go take it up with your father,
Jin Tae Seok.

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,130
I'll handle it.
You just brace yourself.

69
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,470
I won't let you get away with this.

70
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,050
He's getting so irritable.

71
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,550
Gosh, what am I supposed to do
with him?

72
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,630
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

73
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,550
Is the interrogation room
your office, Chairman?

74
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,410
Making calls as you please.

75
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,380
Kunhyang's owner does as he pleases,
wherever he is.

76
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,090
I have a board meeting soon.

77
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,290
Just get to the point.

78
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,990
So the board meeting matters more
than getting me out of here?

79
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,660
I'll call you later.

80
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,870
How dare he!

81
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,570
If you take my offer...

82
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,610
- What offer?
- The chairman's seat.

83
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
You step down from it.

84
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,690
- So you want to be the chairman?
- Why not?

85
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,060
You don't think I can do it?

86
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,330
Between Hye Ra and Se Hoon,

87
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,670
who should I side with?

88
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,180
You got a 15 percent stake
in The Crown Capital through David Kay?

89
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,990
- That's correct.
- Sell it all,

90
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,090
and with the proceeds,

91
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,090
buy Kunhyang Group stock.

92
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,730
Understood.

93
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,100
However, there is something
you should know.

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,210
Ms. Young Chae has two videos.

95
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,280
What do you mean, two videos?

96
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,580
The video of Jin Tae Seok pushing
Jung Won off the rooftop...

97
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,710
and...

98
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,020
the video your mother had.

99
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,820
You mean, the video
of Chairman Jin Tae Seok's involvement...

100
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,620
in Cha Ki Beom's death, right?

101
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,760
That's right.

102
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,800
Who did you just say has them?

103
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,430
I believe it's time for me to leave.

104
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,010
Cha Jung Won, please tell no one
that you saw me here.

105
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,180
Tell me what that was all about.

106
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,050
Young Chae filmed what happened
on the rooftop?

107
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,590
And she also has the rest
of the video of my dad's death?

108
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,790
Se Hoon might have seen it too.

109
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,060
They most likely shared it
with each other.

110
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,970
What about Manager Gu?

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,470
We'll worry about that later.

112
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,370
We have more important things
to deal with right now.

113
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,880
What am I going to do?

114
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,310
What if Se Hoon says
he never wants to see me again?

115
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,020
You're meant to be
over three months pregnant now, right?

116
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,250
My belly is supposed to be growing.
What am I going to do?

117
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,590
Aren't you wearing a fake belly?
You didn't even put any padding in?

118
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,560
- It's too uncomfortable. I can't.
- You're driving me nuts.

119
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,860
Manager Gu! Yeong Soo! Get in here!

120
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,670
How may I help you?

121
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,070
Hey, go get me a ton
of belly wraps and padding.

122
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,470
A ton.

123
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,080
I brought everything you asked for.

124
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,520
Good grief, is she having triplets?
We could make a blanket with this.

125
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,390
- I'm not married, so I don't know.
- What should I do with all this?

126
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,090
- Thanks, you can go now.
- Yes, ma'am.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,530
Let's make a fake belly.
We'll add some padding, okay?

128
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,600
Gosh, what is this?

129
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
My figure is totally ruined.
This is so annoying.

130
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,570
Quiet! Now get over to Kunhyang.

131
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,910
How can I?
If I go now, won't I look pathetic?

132
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,480
So what?
Are you just going to wait for him?

133
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,780
I don't think he will.

134
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,520
Cha Jung Won and Jin Se Hoon are
seeing each other at Kunhyang house.

135
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,920
If sparks fly between them,
we'll have a problem.

136
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,320
I said go now!

137
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,160
So Se Hoon saw the video...

138
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,470
and probably has the file?

139
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,810
You're here.

140
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,950
What about Se Hoon?
Did you two work things out?

141
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,190
You're starting to show a little.

142
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,830
Hold on.

143
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,770
- It's lovely. Try it on!
- Right here?

144
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
What's the issue? We're both women
and I'm your mother-in-law.

145
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,710
Oh, dear. Our little A Reum...

146
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,720
You must be very sensitive
at this stage.

147
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,220
Come out when you've changed.

148
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,030
I shouldn't have worn
this stupid thing.

149
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,010
Gosh, what is this?
It totally ruins the silhouette.

150
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,310
Seriously.

151
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,540
Oh, my. It's beautiful.

152
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,780
Se Hoon will love it.

153
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,920
You think so?

154
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,760
With A Reum on the way,
Se Hoon is sure to come around.

155
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,890
Can we talk for a minute?

156
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Yes.

157
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,910
Why do you think
Se Hoon is acting this way?

158
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,320
It's because Madam Gong
hurt his birth mother...

159
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,260
- Are you okay? And A Reum...
- I told you I'm fine!

160
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,530
Are you even pregnant?

161
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,470
- What?
- Just so many things seem wrong.

162
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,310
You don't have any morning sickness,

163
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,780
- and you're not sensitive to smell.
- Mother, that's going too far.

164
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,550
I know you don't approve of me,
but how can you not believe me?

165
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,880
I'm sorry, I crossed a line.

166
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,990
I apologize.

167
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,920
But...

168
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,930
let me just ask you one thing.

169
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,730
Earlier,

170
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,100
you seemed to say
Chairman Gong Nan Sook...

171
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,040
did something
to Se Hoon's birth mother.

172
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,910
I never said that.
You must have misheard me.

173
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,240
I'm going to go try
to smooth things over with Se Hoon.

174
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,660
I'm done with Cha Jung Won.

175
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,930
This will take me to
Vice Chairman of Kunhyang Group,

176
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,630
and all the way to Chairman.

177
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,210
Let me see it.

178
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,810
Something to make Vice President Jin
the Chairman of Kunhyang?

179
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,650
I'm curious what it could be.

180
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,220
It's nothing.

181
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,050
The video of Chairman Jin
pushing me off the rooftop.

182
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,520
Did you see it too?

183
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,560
What are you talking about?

184
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,860
- If you did,
- Of course...

185
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,830
you should have given it to me.
It's a chance to get Jin Tae Seok.

186
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
It is.

187
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,900
Show me what you were just watching.

188
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,630
- Now.
- I told you, it's nothing.

189
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,770
By hiding it,

190
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,070
were you trying to protect
Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

191
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,240
By hiding the evidence,

192
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,710
you wanted
to protect your position as heir?

193
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,650
Any guilt I felt toward you,
Se Hoon,

194
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,750
is gone now.

195
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,490
- Use it to get what you want.
- I intend to.

196
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,060
I won't let you throw my life
into chaos anymore.

197
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,830
- I'll use this if I can ruthlessly.
- Fine.

198
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,000
If that's what it takes...

199
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,140
to finally break
this twisted fate we have,

200
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,400
if that's your choice, Se Hoon,

201
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,710
even if you're going
down the wrong path,

202
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,810
I have no right to stop you.

203
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,930
Jung Won.

204
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,370
You didn't go home?

205
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,770
I came here thinking it was empty.

206
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,540
Did you see Se Hoon?

207
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,680
I've always felt so guilty
about Se Hoon.

208
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,380
So guilty I could barely
apologize to his face.

209
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,690
I know.

210
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,590
Se Hoon...

211
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,330
is changing for the worse.

212
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,100
Jin Tae Seok killed my dad,

213
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,430
and even tried to kill me.

214
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,440
Se Hoon's using the crucial evidence
that could nail Jin Tae Seok...

215
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,740
out of greed to be the chairman
of Kunhyang Group.

216
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,110
It's all my fault.

217
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,780
He has every right to be angry
and feel betrayed by you.

218
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,280
But judging right from wrong
in any situation...

219
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,650
is Se Hoon's own values
and his way of life.

220
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,720
That's not your responsibility.

221
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,660
Se Hoon...

222
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,890
is a completely different person.

223
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,260
It's like I'm looking
at Jin Tae Seok himself.

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's even starting to scare me.

225
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,030
We're on completely
different paths now.

226
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,540
And we want different things.

227
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,970
For his own selfish desires,

228
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,140
he's become someone
who would turn a knife on me.

229
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,280
I'll even cast aside any remorse
I feel toward him.

230
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,020
That's why we both need
to toughen up.

231
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,660
It's the only way we can take on
a giant like Kunhyang Group.

232
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,800
Why are you here?

233
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,510
Did you end things
with Cha Jung Won?

234
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,540
The fact that I saw the footage
of her falling from the rooftop.

235
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,710
- How does Jung Won know about that?
- How should I know?

236
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,410
- Young Chae, you told her, right?
- No, it wasn't me. I swear.

237
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,450
Then who?

238
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Does that even matter?

239
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,150
The fact that you have the video
of Cha Jung Won's fall,

240
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,820
and that you meant to use it for me
and our A Reum, not for her.

241
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,190
- That's important...
- No!

242
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,490
I was going to use it for myself.

243
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,670
Are you nuts? It's bad for the baby.
This is hard liquor.

244
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,350
Young Chae, are you okay?

245
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,180
I'm sorry. The baby...

246
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,090
I should get going.
You look like you want to be alone.

247
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,200
Stay here tonight.

248
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,370
Can I really do that?

249
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,560
- Staying with Jin Se Hoon tonight?
- Yes, in our honeymoon suite.

250
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
It's the first time.

251
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,790
- What about the fake belly?
- I guess I shouldn't have worn it.

252
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,760
I could have
sealed the deal with him tonight.

253
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,100
He pushed me away,

254
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,600
saying to be careful
until the first trimester is over.

255
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,400
For crying out loud.
This is driving me insane.

256
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,570
Because of that stupid fake belly,

257
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,270
you couldn't be more intimate
with him.

258
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,140
But it's not like
you can stop wearing it.

259
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,140
Maybe you should have a miscarriage.

260
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,550
A miscarriage?

261
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,190
From now on, when you're in bed
with Jin Se Hoon, don't wear it.

262
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,320
How else are you supposed
to actually get pregnant?

263
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,490
Gosh, I don't know. When do I
take it off and put it back on?

264
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
I'm hanging up.

265
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,030
So, Se Hoon let her spend the night.
That's a good first step.

266
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,440
I can see the wheels turning again.
Stop it and have some of this.

267
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,010
Grandma, do you think
Han Hye Ra will pull it off...

268
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,510
at the board meeting tomorrow?

269
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,780
What can't a woman
more terrifying than you do?

270
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,550
But Jin Tae Seok will
slither out of it...

271
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,580
due to a lack of evidence.

272
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,650
Do you really think she can do it?

273
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,820
I thought you said
you were only eating one meal a day.

274
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,660
- That's enough for you.
- Hey, I was just...

275
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,460
Darn it, taking back what you
just gave is the lowest of the low.

276
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,630
And it looked so good.

277
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,170
(Kunhyang Group)

278
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,210
These are the final samples.
Just one last review and tweaks.

279
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,410
Now I can finally rest easy.

280
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,280
Do you think we should finalize this
and submit the final design?

281
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,090
- Are these the final samples?
- Yes, Director Jin.

282
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,990
They look a little different
from the design I remember.

283
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,020
We came up with a new idea
and decided to add it.

284
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,260
And what idea was that?

285
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,530
Go ahead, tell her.
It was your idea.

286
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,170
I boldly removed the excess decor,
but I worried it might look plain.

287
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,840
So I incorporated a major trend
from high fashion lately.

288
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,010
I mean, the Hybrid Silhouette.

289
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,480
"Hybrid Silhouette?"

290
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,480
Like pairing a feminine tweed jacket
with casual denim shorts,

291
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,050
or a silk dress
with a large-buckled belt.

292
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,190
It's a style that masterfully blends
classic luxury with modern utility.

293
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,730
For young customers who want comfort
and a distinct personal style,

294
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,100
this will definitely
catch their eye.

295
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,730
Impressive.

296
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,730
You haven't been back long
since your accident,

297
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,440
- and you're doing great work.
- Thank you.

298
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,380
For a more systematic workflow,
I'm going to appoint...

299
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,550
a team leader for the Design Team.

300
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,560
To help me lead, this person needs
skill, experience, and integrity.

301
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,720
This person
truly has to have it all.

302
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,090
That's me, then.

303
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,330
I believe Cha Jung Won
is the best fit for team leader.

304
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,640
- What does she have over me?
- A lot.

305
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,210
Ideas, diligence, and character,
for a start.

306
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,150
Right, I'd agree with that.

307
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,090
Look at her, running off to tattle
to the Vice President again.

308
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,330
You earned this.
Don't let her get to you.

309
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,090
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

310
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,220
Please leave a message...

311
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,760
I wonder if something urgent
came up for Min Jung.

312
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,740
You know why I called you here,
don't you?

313
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,570
I do not.
I'm not sure what you want.

314
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,010
Bring me the evidence
that Hye Ra has.

315
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,150
The recording of my voice.

316
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,280
Do you mean the audio file...

317
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,450
that you confess
you killed Cha Ki Beom?

318
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,690
That's the one.

319
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,200
Have you forgotten?
My dealings with you, Yoon Min Jung,

320
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,830
go back twenty-five years.

321
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,710
Tell me what Young Sun
put you up to.

322
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,610
Young Sun...

323
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
has made a life-or-death choice.

324
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
What choice?

325
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,320
It seems she can't forgive herself
for wanting to be with you.

326
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,720
If she dies in a car accident,

327
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,930
- she'll consider it her penance.
- And if she survives,

328
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,930
she'll come to me...

329
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,960
and abandon Su A?

330
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,110
How is she planning
to stage a car accident?

331
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,280
She paid off a truck driver.

332
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,580
Get him here. Now.

333
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,550
I don't care what you have to do,
she can't die.

334
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,750
- If she does, I'll kill you myself.
- Yes, sir. I understand.

335
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,590
Just make sure she lives.
You hear me?

336
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,630
If Hye Ra were to
find out about this,

337
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,000
what do you think
would happen to you?

338
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,930
I'd say that I had no choice
and that I did it to save her...

339
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,570
And what about being my pawn
behind Hye Ra's back?

340
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,910
What about spying on Gong Nan Sook
for me?

341
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,750
The evidence that Hye Ra has.

342
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,550
I'll get it for you.

343
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,790
Of course you will.

344
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,360
Looks like I'll be getting out soon.

345
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,050
Were you busy?

346
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,820
Too busy to take my calls?

347
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,420
I'm so sorry.
I had my phone on silent in my bag.

348
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,460
I'll be more careful.
It won't happen again.

349
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,270
I'll take you home now, sir.

350
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,000
No, I think I'll get a room
at a hotel and rest up.

351
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,110
If I'm going on the offensive
at tomorrow's secret board meeting,

352
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,140
- I need to be fully prepared.
- You should have dinner first, sir.

353
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,750
This place has great reviews.

354
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,090
A barbecue restaurant
is a good idea.

355
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,590
Let's get some alcohol, too.

356
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,890
Yes, sir.

357
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,960
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

358
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,330
Allow me, sir.

359
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,670
This is pretty good.

360
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,140
It's to die for, isn't it?

361
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
What do you think?

362
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,010
I marinated it in a special sauce,
just for you, Chairman.

363
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,120
She looks familiar.
Where have I seen her before?

364
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,020
I just couldn't put it in the meat.
It's too precious to me.

365
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,660
So I poisoned your alcohol instead.

366
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,100
Are you out of your mind?
Do you have any idea who I am?

367
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,230
I know exactly who you are.

368
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,800
You sent my beloved Ki Beom
to his grave,

369
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:01,000
and you pushed Jung Won
off the rooftop, Jin Tae Seok.

370
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,440
Mi Hyang, what are you doing?

371
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,880
- You're a regular here?
- Yes, sir. The meat is excellent.

372
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,580
You knew this was her restaurant,
and you still brought me here?

373
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,850
Of course not, sir.

374
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,780
I apologize
if you were uncomfortable.

375
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,550
Have this tofu
and straighten your life out.

376
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,390
Or else I'll kill you
with my own two hands!

377
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,560
Mi Hyang, please.

378
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Darn it!

379
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
I apologize, sir.

380
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,500
Jin Tae Seok must be out by now.

381
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,310
Will it be okay
at the board meeting?

382
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,240
Jin Tae Seok won't just sit back
and take it.

383
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,680
Just make sure you hold up
your end of the deal.

384
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:48,550
I'll put you in the spotlight.
Make sure you handle your shadow.

385
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,790
Will I be able to
do this well tomorrow?

386
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,060
You're a major shareholder
in Kunhyang Group now.

387
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,830
You have to pull your own weight.

388
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,600
This is the first time
you've taken my hand first.

389
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,770
You always held mine first.

390
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
Thank you.

391
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,920
(Kunhyang Group)

392
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,230
The probe into Chairman Jin Tae Seok
has caused a management crisis.

393
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,530
This meeting is about our response,
so the floor is now open.

394
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,160
As for former Vice Chairman
Han Hye Ra,

395
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,770
she already stepped down...

396
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,370
due to her scandals
and hiring problems.

397
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,970
This discussion today...

398
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,540
should not become an opportunity
for her to stage a comeback.

399
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,380
The issue is managing this crisis,
not dwelling on the past.

400
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,720
Enough of this bickering.
Let's just appoint a new chairman.

401
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,680
Without clear leadership,

402
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,290
neither the company nor the market
can expect any stability.

403
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,660
So you're proposing
we elect a new chairman?

404
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,260
That's right.

405
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,700
We need a structure that allows
for clear decisions and execution.

406
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,340
I nominate former Vice Chairman
Han Hye Ra to be the new chairman.

407
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
I agree.

408
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,080
Chairman Jin Tae Seok's successor
should be Jin Se Hoon.

409
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,110
I nominate
Vice President Jin Se Hoon.

410
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,220
I agree.

411
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,320
I'm in favor.

412
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,350
Chairman Gong Nan Sook,
what is your opinion?

413
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,720
If you don't back me,

414
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,530
I will tell this entire board...

415
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,860
you killed my birth mother.

416
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,830
Then you'll have to reveal
that your father gave the order.

417
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,800
I was just following orders.

418
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,340
Then there goes your shot
at being the successor.

419
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,110
Until the chaos subsides,

420
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,110
having former Vice Chairman
Han Hye Ra...

421
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,180
step in as interim chairman
wouldn't be a bad idea.

422
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,820
What is she talking about?

423
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,290
It seems our board of directors...

424
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,160
is split exactly down the middle.

425
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,070
If only someone
could cast the tie-breaking vote.

426
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
There is.

427
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,710
I am Cha Jung Won.

428
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,080
I have voting rights as well.

429
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,320
Ms. Cha is merely a designer
in Kunhyang's Design Team.

430
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,320
- What voting rights?
- I am also a major shareholder,

431
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,960
owning five percent
of Kunhyang's shares.

432
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,160
- Is that true?
- It is.

433
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,770
Cha Jung Won,
in her capacity as my daughter,

434
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,110
has received a gift
of five percent...

435
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,640
of my 18 percent stake.

436
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,650
Then Ms. Cha Jung Won does have
decision-making rights.

437
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,950
So, Cha Jung Won,
which of these two will you support?

438
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,460
I support
former Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra.

439
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,910
All right, then.
For the position of chairman,

440
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,380
we appoint former Vice Chairman
Han Hye Ra. The matter is settled.

441
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,490
What do you think you're all doing?

442
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,100
You're kicking me out
to put Han Hye Ra in my place?

443
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,760
Says who?

444
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,770
This is all null and void!

445
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,050
(A Graceful Liar)

446
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,040
You're making Cha Jung Won
director of the Kunhyang Gallery?

447
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,580
I'm empowering her.
So she can stand on her own.

448
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,750
And you think that's enough
to protect Cha Jung Won?

449
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:45,620
What a shame.
I've already taken you out.

450
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,980
Make Se Hoon the Vice Chairman.

451
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,190
Se Hoon is becoming
more and more like you.

452
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,750
The video showing the truth
behind Cha Ki Beom's death.

453
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,920
If I have it,

454
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,090
the chairmanship of Kunhyang Group
will soon be mine.

455
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,230
Break ties with Han Hye Ra...

456
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,930
and side with me.

457
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,230
