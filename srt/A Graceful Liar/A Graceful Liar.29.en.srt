00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,180
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,450
Goodness.
We meet again, Mr. Cha Ki Beom.

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,420
Goodness,
look at the state of this place.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,660
What are you doing here?
What are you pulling this time?

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,330
I don't even know where to begin...

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,230
on renovating this place.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,170
The whole thing's a lost cause.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,770
- Maybe we should get a new house.
- What are you saying?

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,710
Do you still plan to take...

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,540
my daughter as yours
and marry her to a rich family?

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,950
You still haven't given up on that?

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,480
You should've gratefully taken it
when you had the chance.

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,250
It's always the poor ones
who are so hung up on pride.

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,060
What gives you the right
to barge in here and cause a scene?

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,390
You're Gong Nan Sook, aren't you?

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,530
And who might this be?
How dare you say my name?

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,230
The tramp who tempted my Jung Won
and gave her false hope.

20
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,070
"Tramp?"

21
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,210
Seems another tramp
has a death wish.

22
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,970
What? "A death wish?"

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,540
All right, it's you or me today!

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,710
- Goodness!
- Hey!

25
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,110
You old hag!

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,950
What do you think you're doing?
Break it up and talk. Let go!

27
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,390
I said let go!

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,630
Gosh, women are way scarier
when they fight.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Darn it.

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,530
Do you have any idea
how much this hairdo cost me?

31
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,770
What did you put in your hair
that it's completely unscathed?

32
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,010
You ripped out a bride's hair,
you wicked witch.

33
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,810
Hey, before everything falls apart,
get Cha Ki Beom out of here.

34
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,020
All right.

35
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,120
Gosh.

36
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,360
What, is this a contest to see...

37
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,790
who can drink
cold water the fastest?

38
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,930
Ki Beom! Just look at my hair.

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,730
- My scalp is showing.
- What?

40
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,070
- Go buy me root touch-up spray.
- Now?

41
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,530
It's urgent. Hurry up.

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
What about her?

43
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,040
I'll handle her.

44
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,540
Don't try anything funny.

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Here, take this!

46
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,020
Yes, bring it here.

47
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,400
It is a gift for you.

48
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,400
You think
I can't afford my own juice?

49
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,470
What is this?

50
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,940
A bribe?

51
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,910
I think we met briefly
at the wedding.

52
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,250
- You know, don't you?
- Know what?

53
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,950
That Cha Jung Won already married
into a rich family.

54
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,590
And it looks like
Cha Ki Beom has no idea.

55
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,130
Let my dear Young Chae...

56
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,030
live here in this house.

57
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,140
You think Ki Beom
would ever agree to that?

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,540
Why else would I be bribing you?

59
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,080
Is that head on your shoulders
just for decoration?

60
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,840
You need to use your brain.

61
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,610
Darn it.

62
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,180
You're clearly rich enough,

63
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,250
so why can't you just get
a new house for her?

64
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,620
If only I could do that,
my life would be so much easier.

65
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,600
What are you doing here?
You're Mother's personal secretary.

66
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,240
The vice chairman has assigned me
to assist you, ma'am.

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,710
So she's assigned me a watchdog.

68
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,670
Ma'am? Don't be ridiculous.

69
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,580
Just call me Young Chae.

70
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,980
I will address you
as Madam Young Chae.

71
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,750
I will do my utmost to assist you.
I look forward to working with you.

72
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,950
No, I'm the one
who should be grateful.

73
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,820
Just a moment.

74
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,300
I picked this up on my honeymoon.
I thought it would suit you.

75
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,000
I couldn't possibly.

76
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,140
I'll be upset if you refuse.

77
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
It's perfect for you.

78
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,220
I think this would suit
the Vice Chairman more.

79
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,520
I also got gifts for the family.

80
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,620
Please, enjoy wearing it.

81
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,620
Thank you.

82
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,190
Please help me get settled in...

83
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,190
so I can adjust to being part
of the Kunhyang family.

84
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,060
I'm sure you'll do just fine.
More than fine.

85
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,880
Where should I begin?

86
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,980
Should I start by organizing
Mother's dressing room?

87
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,190
The Vice Chairman organizes
her own clothes.

88
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,490
I see.

89
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,700
The rules you've set in place...

90
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,470
and the hearts of everyone
in the Kunhyang family...

91
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,370
who think you're the warmest
and kindest person alive,

92
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm going to slowly ruin
it all for you.

93
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,180
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra.

94
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,890
I believe you were informed.

95
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,760
The Vice Chairman handles
her own clothes...

96
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,220
She did, yes.

97
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,520
Until now.

98
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,660
From now on, I'll be doing it.
I'm sure Mother will love it.

99
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,730
After all,
she adores my taste, you know.

100
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,140
Yes, Mother.

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,250
I just got back from my outing.

102
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,420
Right now?

(Kunhyang Group)

104
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,490
I'm starting work
with the Design Team soon?

105
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,960
Of course.
You won the Kunhyang design contest.

106
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,160
We postponed it for the wedding.

107
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,460
Otherwise, you would've started
much sooner.

108
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,830
I understand.

109
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,330
I'm so glad
my sister-in-law can join the team.

110
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,770
We're at the office,
Director Jin Se Mi.

111
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,300
Gosh. My bad.

112
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,310
No, I mean, my apologies.

113
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,640
And our daughter-in-law's title?

114
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,710
She's married to Kunhyang's heir.

115
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,680
The head of fashion spot is vacant.
That spot would be perfect for her.

116
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,990
As my direct boss?

117
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,890
The staff will say
she got it unfairly.

118
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,190
Director Jin.

119
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,960
And you weren't?

120
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,030
The position makes the person.

121
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,800
Let's do as the Chairman says.

122
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,970
May I offer my opinion?

123
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,710
I'd like to start
at an entry-level position.

124
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,380
Are you sure about that?

125
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,080
It was a blind competition.

126
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,020
I want to be judged on my merits,
not as Kunhyang's daughter-in-law.

127
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,350
Manager Hwang,
what are your thoughts?

128
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,260
I believe it's a very wise decision.

129
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,530
Why are you still here?
My daughter-in-law...

130
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,640
should be heading home by now.

131
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,970
She says she's going home
with her husband.

132
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,480
So, how was she at the house?

133
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,320
Did anything seem off?

134
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,890
Just as you've observed,
she's sharp and very bright.

135
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,520
You have that list of talented,
up-and-coming designers, don't you?

136
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,160
Yes, we have
about five or six names on it.

137
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,060
There's one rookie in particular
you might find interesting.

138

the Global Fashion World by Storm)

140
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,370
- Find out who that is.
- Yes, ma'am.

141
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,000
It's not just photorealistic.
You can make entire movies with it.

142
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,430
So I can just ask a generative AI...

143
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,970
to make promotional materials
for Kunhyang Group?

144
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,870
I've got just the thing for you.

145
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,410
This is the power of Sky Question.

146
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,580
It's really that easy?

147
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,620
I guess you have to give it
the right prompts.

148
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,950
You can't just say, "Make a logo."

149
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,520
You have to be specific.

150
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,220
And you have to know how to ask
for it precisely.

151
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,330
So the final result changes
depending on who's at the helm?

152
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,790

Yes, the Chairman and Se Mi too.

I'll tell you later.

Right.

to say you lied and were wrong.

178
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,150
Why?

179
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,790
To survive.

180
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,060
I can't go on like this.

181
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,730
No one...

182
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,800
treats me like a human being.

183
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,230
And how is that my problem?

184
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,240
(Cha Jung Won)

185
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,420
Please review my work.

186
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,150
I want to be evaluated
on my own merit.

187
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
And if I do?

188
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,320
I want to work as a designer
at Kunhyang Fashion.

189
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,930
Does that sound reasonable to you?

190
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,500
If you judge my work on its merit,

191
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,060
by all means.

192
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,430
Leave it here.

193
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,970
I'll have the appropriate person
review it.

194
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,380
I love being alone with you.

195
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,880
We're at the office.

196
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,950
What if someone sees us?

197
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,980
So what if they do?
Everyone knows we're newly married.

198
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,050
I was told to start working
for the Design Team.

199
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,820
What?

200
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,090
Are you not happy about it?

201
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,420
No, of course not.

202
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,760
Seeing you at home and the office...

203
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,360
is great,

204
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,630
but I want your eyes and touch
just for me.

205
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,830
I want you all to myself.

206
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,840
So when you go to work,
should I just wait for your return,

207
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,340
thinking of what meals to cook...

208
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,480
or what you'd want me to wear?

209
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,610
Is that what I'm supposed to do?

210
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,510
That would be a total waste
of your talent.

211
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,650
Good, as long as you understand.

212
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,220
So, head of the fashion department?

213
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,620
As a new designer.

214
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,520
- What?
- It's my choice.

215
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,460
But why?

216
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,000
You said,
"I want to be judged on my talent," right?

217
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,300
You're adorable.

218
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,470
But I need a favor.

219
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,510
Manager Kim Sung Hee.

220
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,610
Transfer her to the Design Team.

221
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,280
You mean Manager Kim
from the luxury goods department?

222
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,680
I need someone on my side.

223
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,920
Am I not enough for you?

224
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,990
To get a footing in the Design Team,
I need at least one person I trust.

225
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,390
But Se Mi is there. And my mother...

226
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,790
I mean,
the Vice Chairman will back you up.

227
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,830
Is it really necessary?

228
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,270
Why?

229
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,540
Is she already giving you trouble,
like some awful mother-in-law?

230
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,240
No, it's not that.

231
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,690
(Kunhyang Group)

232
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,630
It's a pleasure to meet you.

233
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,630
My name is Cha Jung Won.

234
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,720
Why is Chairman Gong Nan Sook
helping you?

235
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,490
What do you mean by that?

236
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,160
The Park Kyung Shin case was buried
by Chairman Gong's influence.

237
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,260
And you walking around freely
is also her doing.

238
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,970
She wasn't helping me.

239
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,030
She was helping her own daughter,
Joo Young Chae.

240
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,370
Explain that more clearly.

241
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,100
You knew that Young Chae
and Park Kyung Shin dated...

242
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,410
for a while, right?

243
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,580
If the Park Kyung Shin case
had blown up before the wedding,

244
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,340
it would have turned into
a huge scandal.

245
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,380
So to ensure the wedding went well,
she helped you?

246
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,720
That's Gong Nan Sook for you.

247
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,650
So what's the bottom line?

248
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,190
Why are you here in front of me?

249
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,930
I want to make a deal
with you, Chairman.

250
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,290
What?

251
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,830
A deal?

252
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,670
She really thinks you're the one...

253
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,740
who threw out
the emerald jewelry set?

254
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,300
That is the first time...

255
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,170
I've ever seen your mother
that angry.

256
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,110
How could you do such a thing?

257
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,040
You threw a precious gift from me
in the trash?

258
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,050
I didn't throw it out,
but I was careless. I'm sorry.

259
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,480
You threw it away because
you didn't like it, didn't you?

260
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,550
Now you're blaming others
and lying on top of it.

261
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,390
This is what happens
when you're nice to your inferiors.

262
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,230
Mother is so unbelievably two-faced.
Anyone can make a mistake.

263
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,370
So much for being her
"dear daughter-in-law."

264
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,340
- Who cares about that stupid set?
- Please don't, Se Hoon.

265
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,740
I should have been more careful.

266
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,680
I can't take this anymore.

267
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,880
What does that make me look like?

268
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,280
It makes me look like a tattletale.

269
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,580
I don't care. I won't stand for it.

270
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,950
Honey.

271
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,960
I don't want you to look like a fool
defying your mom because of me.

272
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,500
You sweet thing.

273
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,930
It breaks my heart
to see you like this.

274
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,170
I'm so sorry.

275
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,640
Manager Hwang.

276
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,170
Hold on a second.

277
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,950
Please review my work.

278
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,680
I want to be evaluated
on my own merit.

279
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,650
And if I do?

280
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,890
I want to work as a designer
at Kunhyang Fashion.

281
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,290
You have something
to tell me, don't you?

282
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,210
I came to ask for a moment
of your time over some tea.

283
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,210
Don't let me interrupt.

284
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,450
I'm sure it's nothing.

285
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,390
He looked like something
was weighing on him.

286
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,820
Something's definitely up.

287
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,730
What?

288
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,730
A deal?

289
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,640
Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

290
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,070
I know far more about her
than you might think.

291
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,880
Make me one of your people.

292
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,780
You'll reap a reward that's sweeter
and more potent than you imagine.

293
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,350
So you have some dirt
on Chairman Gong?

294
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,320
If this gets out,
it could destroy her.

295
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,790
- And why should I trust you?
- What have you got to lose?

296
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,360
From your perspective, I mean.

297
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,530
As for this deal,

298
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,200
what do you want from me?

299
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,740
I want to work as a designer
for Kunhyang Fashion.

300
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,140
The Kunhyang family wants nothing
to do with you.

301
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,040
- You know that.
- Then judge me on my skills alone.

302
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,610
I'm not in charge of fashion.

303
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,150
The Vice Chairman has the final say.

304
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,850
I gave her my design book
before coming here.

305
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
And?

306
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,590
She'll reject me,
no matter how good my work is.

307
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,590
Actually, she probably
won't even acknowledge it.

308
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,760
So you need me to back you up?

309
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,680
I'm impressed.

310
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,650
No, it's brilliant.

311
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,580
Who's the designer?

312
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,490
Is this some hidden gem
you've discovered?

313
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,720
You don't need to concern yourself
with it.

314
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,260
I may not have your eye for fashion,

315
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,490
but look at this. It's so fresh.

316
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,830
The lines are so alive.
They practically jump off the page.

317
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,160
Her style is very similar
to our daughter-in-law's.

318
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,070
Then we have to recruit her.

319
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,540

I'm friendly with the reporter,
Ma Sang Ki.

And he'll just run an article
for a friend?

- Those days are over.
- Right.

- is actually quite well-known.

your work is not well-known.

to push my buttons?

No. The opposite.

in public.

00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,030
Together.

353
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,000
Are you trying to use me again?

354
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,030
You can use me, too.

355
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,540
I shouldn't have taken this.

356
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,180
Should I just give it back?

357
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,380
She's only giving it to me
because she's rolling in it.

358
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,720
So it's okay for me
to take it, right?

359
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,650
How can I...

360
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,490
pass your daughter off as Jung Won?

361
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,290
And what would I tell Ki Beom?

362
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,690
Just tell him
you're renting out a spare room.

363
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,430
As long as she's Cha Jung Won
in public, it'll be fine.

364
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,670
She wants me to pull the wool
over his eyes?

365
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,370
No, I can't do that.

366
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,240
But with this much money,

367
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,340
I might not be able to buy
the whole department store,

368
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,180
but I could buy out
a good chunk of it.

369
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,410
Get a hold of yourself.

370
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,250
Jo Mi Hyang!

371
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,150
I'll get through tomorrow's wedding,
then I'm giving this back.

372
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
Right.

373
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,620
I'm starving.
Hey, get me something to eat.

374
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,130
Gosh, you scared me.
You nearly scared me to death.

375
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,700
What's the big deal?

376
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,240
Did Gong Nan Sook give you cash
or something?

377
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,470
I'm not crazy.

378
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,310
I'd never do something like that
just to get myself killed by you?

379
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Seriously...

380
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,890
How's business?

381
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,350
It's going pretty well.

382
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,920
No need to be so modest.

383
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,130
I hear they call you a tycoon
with matching capital and vision.

384
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,100
I owe it all to you, Mother.

385
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,530
It's time for me to cash in
on some of that success.

386
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,640
- Yes?
- Jin Se Hoon.

387
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,240
Do we have him yet?

388
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,270
I heard you offered him
a partnership.

389
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,480
He'll come around soon enough.

390
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,950
We need to get him in our pocket.

391
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,320
That's how we'll get Kunhyang
right in the palm of our hand.

392
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,550
Not "our" hand.

393
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,420
You mean in the palm of your hand.

394
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,890
What's yours is mine, isn't it?

395
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,470
Is something on your mind?

396
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,210
Give me your professional opinion
as a designer.

397
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,440
- What do you think?
- I'm in no position to judge.

398
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,050
This is my design book.
The one Young Chae stole from me.

399
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,490
It's excellent.

400
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,230
Is that all? Just "excellent?"

401
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,330
Why are you so interested
in what I think?

402
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,230
I'm thinking of hiring this designer
to work for Kunhyang Fashion.

403
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,100
Young Chae as a designer
at Kunhyang Fashion?

404
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,810
It's original and uninhibited.

405
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,680
I don't know who the designer is,
but they're too talented to pass up.

406
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,750
I'm not a fan of the person,
but I covet the talent.

407
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
So?

408
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,420
With this kind of talent,
you have to bring them on board.

409
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,870
Using my design book,

410
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,770
she thinks she can become a designer
at Kunhyang Fashion?

411
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,590
So, our daughter-in-law said
she's too good to pass up?

412
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
Yes.

413
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,490
Without even knowing
who the designer is?

414
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,600
And you? Do you know
who owns the design book?

415
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,060
How would I know?

416
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,540
I see why you're always going on
about "our daughter-in-law."

417
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,340
She thinks like a true member
of the Kunhyang family.

418
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,710
I need to go change.

419
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,360
He knows that's
Cha Jung Won's design book.

420
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,330
Why is he trying to
drag her into this?

421
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,990
Why does our daughter-in-law
keep getting under my skin?

422
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,030
To the most beautiful bride
in the world.

423
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,800
Congratulations on your wedding,
Mom.

424
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,770
I'm so sorry, and I love you.

425
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,670
Please tell Dad for me.

426
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
(Congratulations on your wedding,
Mom)

427
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,810
(I'm so sorry, and I love you.
Please tell Dad for me.)

428
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Who are you texting?

429
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,020
That's an invasion of my privacy.

430
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,780
What? My girl's privacy
is my property.

431
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,320
- Give it to me.
- Hey, no way.

432
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,060
By the way,
my mother's asking for you.

433
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
Why?

434
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,440
You were looking for me, Mother?

435
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,140
Did you...

436
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,370
reorganize my closet for me?

437
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,740
Yes.

438
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,340
Are you upset?

439
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,250
I will organize my own clothes.

440
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,950
Since you appreciate my taste,
I thought you'd be pleased.

441
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,120
Did you do this on purpose?

442
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,590
You made a show of throwing
the emerald necklace and earrings...

443
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,860
I gave you in the trash,

444
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,000
and then you turned
my closet upside down.

445
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,870
What's your angle?

446
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,200
What angle?

447
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,940
It's a misunderstanding, Mother.

448
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,810
- I'd never think such a thing...
- I praise you for a job well done,

449
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,610
and you think
you can just walk all over me?

450
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,180
I am the matriarch
of the Kunhyang family.

451
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,850
If you ever pull a stunt
like this again,

452
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,120
I will never forgive you. Ever.

453
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,110
(A Graceful Liar)

454
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,040
Was being a designer
at Kunhyang Fashion your dream?

455
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,310
I'll take back what's mine.

456
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,440
And you'll come crashing down.

457
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,610
It'll be torment.
Why would you even consider it?

458
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,250
Are you worried that I'll steal
Jin Se Hoon away from Cha Jung Won?

459
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,680
With my design book you stole?

460
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,220
You'll end up shooting yourself.

461
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,890
You're being too harsh
on Young Chae.

462
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,690
If you let your woman upset
my wife one more time,

463
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,460
- I won't let it slide.
- Me? As the head of Kunhyang Group?

464
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,030
You're the heir to the group.
At least make it to Vice Chairman.

465
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,830
When I'm with you,
I feel like a much greater man.

466
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,430
I'll back you up. I promise.

467
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,230
Have you made up with Young Chae?

468
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,700
She keeps getting on my nerves,
like she's doing it on purpose.

469
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,170
Your family trusts you completely,
but I'll make them abandon you.

470
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,840
