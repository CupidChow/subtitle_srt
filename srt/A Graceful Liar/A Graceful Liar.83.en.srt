00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,910
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,040
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,380
(Episode 83)

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,490
Are you back at work?

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,500
Wait, how did you two
show up together?

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,570
Don't tell me
you came from my mom's house.

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,910
Don't be ridiculous.

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,780
Thanks to you, I was forced
to take a temporary leave...

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,310
from my post
as Vice Chairman at a crucial time.

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,250
You two seem to suit each other
more and more...

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,650
like a fairytale couple.

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,650
I'll be on my way now.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,100
Vice President Jin Se Hoon.

15
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,800
Come to the Vice Chairman's Office
in ten minutes.

16
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,240
- That scumbag...
- Control yourself.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,180
Ha Neul won't be on top for long.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,250
You are the only one fit to be
Kunhyang Group's Vice Chairman,

19
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,010
no, its Chairman.

20
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,700
Vice President Jin Se Hoon,
stand up and greet me properly.

21
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,810
- What did you say?
- Didn't you hear me?

22
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,510
I said, greet me with proper respect
before you sit down.

23
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,160
Satisfied?

24
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,590
Get to the point,
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul.

25
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,200
While I was away,

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,430
I'd like you to brief me
on the situation at Kunhyang Group.

27
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,000
Will one day be enough?

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,600
You think if you left,

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,140
Kunhyang Group
would just fall apart?

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Manners.

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,380
After cheating death,

32
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,250
you've changed a lot,
Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul.

33
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,550
If I don't,

34
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,250
how can I possibly beat
Jin Tae Seok and you?

35
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,490
The moment I woke up,
I had a new goal.

36
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,030
I'm not just going to be
the Vice Chairman of Kunhyang Group.

37
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,230
I'm going to become
the chairman myself.

38
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
What?

39
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,240
Joo Ha Neul,
you've completely lost it.

40
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,140
- You're trying to take our company?
- Shut up and get out.

41
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,240
And make sure
that your briefing is thorough.

42
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,950
Here, drink this.

43
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,090
Thank you.

44
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,390
You don't believe me, do you?

45
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,930
That must be Cha Jung Won's design.

46
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,600
- Why would you say that?
- Because I've been so awful to you.

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,710
I hid what I did
about the blind hiring...

48
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,580
and had a fit because I didn't want
to share my mom with you.

49
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,110
I believe you.

50
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,680
I know you're not someone...

51
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,420
who would sabotage others' work
behind their backs.

52
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,850
This was Joo Young Chae's doing.

53
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,220
- I know.
- Joo Young Chae will never confess.

54
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,720
I have a plan.

55
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,530
Family drama should stay at home.

56
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,540
I can't believe
it's ruining our work too.

57
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,870
We have to sort this out,
but the most urgent matter now...

58
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,810
is preparing for the new season.

59
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,910
I agree.

60
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,510
We can't waste time figuring out
who stole or tore up the design.

61
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
What are your thoughts,
Director Jin?

62
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,190
I'm giving Team Leader Cha Jung Won
full authority.

63
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,190
Take the lead.

64
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,990
What gives Team Leader Cha Jung Won
the right?

65
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,260
She's also responsible
for failing to protect her design.

66
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,000
It's not like she can just whip up
a new design out of thin air.

67
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,630
She has a point.

68
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,770
Of all the designs submitted,
Joo Young Chae's stands out most.

69
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,240
Joo Young Chae should lead
the new season's preparations.

70
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,510
I agree.

71
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,950
I also bear some responsibility
for this incident.

72
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,950
It's right
for Designer Joo Young Chae...

73
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,580
to lead this fall and winter season.

74
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Are you okay?

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,540
What? Young Chae,
your design was chosen...

76
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,340
for the new fall
and winter collection?

77
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,180
Yes.

78
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,410
You didn't do that this time?

79
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,520
- Didn't what?
- I'm asking if you stole...

80
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,880
Cha Jung Won's design again.

81
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,850
No, of course not!

82
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,660
I didn't graduate from
the New York Royal Art School for nothing!

83
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,760
I know. We threw
so much money at that school.

84
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,030
If all you're still capable of
is stealing others' designs,

85
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,270
you should just quit designing.

86
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,570
Mom!

87
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,240
She said she didn't do it.

88
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,210
You have to show trust to earn it.

89
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,410
Manager Gu, have you been taking
smart pills or something?

90
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,810
Or have you been taking pills
that make you more talkative?

91
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,380
Manager Gu has a point.

92
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,150
You always act like I'm stupid,

93
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,790
so it's no wonder
I'm losing my confidence.

94
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,790
What good would that confidence
do you, anyway?

95
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,100
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

96
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,240
Hey, Manager Hwang.
I need to tell you something.

97
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,840
Yes, what is it?

98
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,980
I've tried my best to be patient,

99
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,910
but I won't rest until
I teach Jin Se Hoon a lesson.

100
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,230
Why a barbecue joint?

101
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,330
I thought we'd be less likely
to be seen here.

102
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,500
If you're in league with my enemies,

103
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,870
I'm pretty sure I warned you
that you'd be my enemy too.

104
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,970
I no longer work for Chairman Jin.

105
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,510
So you want me to hire you
as my secretary?

106
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,540
I've decided to work
for Chairman Han Hye Ra.

107
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,780
I felt I should let you know.

108
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,450
Why Chairman Han, of all people?

109
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,580
- What about Secretary Yoon?
- She'll help Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

110
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,020
Did my father and Chairman Han
discuss this and decide together?

111
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,290
Have they patched things up?

112
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,230
I wouldn't know about that.

113
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,260
Then why did you call me here?

114
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,360
I did.

115
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,530
Ms. Jo Mi Hyang?

116
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,870
- Do you work here?
- I own the place.

117
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,070
Then why did you call for me?

118
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,380
Are you crazy?

119
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,390
Oh dear, my hand slipped.

120
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,690
It was just a small mistake.

121
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,960
There is no need to call me
a crazy woman.

122
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
What did you just say?

123
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,430
Didn't you accidentally almost
run over Jung Won with your car?

124
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,760
And Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul
got hurt too.

125
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,900
You shouldn't get so worked up
over a little tofu to the face.

126
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,370
Manager Hwang.
Is this why you brought me here?

127
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,570
Manager Hwang is moonlighting.

128
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,110
He's a part-timer here.

129
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,010
He's the one who talked me out of
running you over with my car.

130
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,880
This is outrageous!

131
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,350
Wait, a sharp dresser like you
can't go out looking like that.

132
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,890
Let me clean you up.

133
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,460
Ms. Jo Mi Hyang,
I will never forget this insolence.

134
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,970
Nor will I!

135
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,740
You're worse than your father!

136
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,310
Even Jo Mi Hyang thinks she can
walk all over me?

137
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,840
I need to act fast.

138
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,780
I must either take down
Joo Ha Neul...

139
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,120
or become the new chairman.

140
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,220
And how do you plan to do that?

141
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,130
I'm going to need your help.

142
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,760
I thought I told you
to prove that you're on my side.

143
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,130
Take out Joo Ha Neul for me first.

144
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,000
There you go again.
You can't even do this simple thing.

145
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,270
Joo Ha Neul declared that he's going
to become the chairman.

146
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,340
What?

147
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,910
So he used this David Kay guy
to buy up all the Kunhyang stock,

148
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,450
so that was his plan all along.

149
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,780
How many shares did he buy?

150
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,690
If Joo Ha Neul is behind David Kay,
he holds the most shares after me.

151
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,590
Are you just going to stand by
and let this happen?

152
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,030
Not a chance.

153
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,400
(Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul)

154
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,340
- You wanted to see me?
- I have a difficult favor to ask.

155
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,970
You must find the video
that Vice President Jin Se Hoon has,

156
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,040
no matter what.

157
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,480
Are you referring to the video
of Cha Ki Beom's death?

158
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,350
It's the only way to bring
Jin Tae Seok to justice.

159
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,190
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

160
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,590
(Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul)

161
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,370
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

162
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,810
Is he in a meeting?

163
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,920
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

164
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,630
He still has the ring
Cha Jung Won gave him?

165
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,070
What's this?

166
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,140
What's that?

167
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,280
The video of the Cha Ki Beom case?

168
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,380
No.

169
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,280
Young Chae, don't worry about it.

170
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,760
(Vice Chairman Joo Ha Neul)

171
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,500
Found it.

172
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,230
I came here
so I could go home with you.

173
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,670
- I've got something to brag about.
- Brag about what?

174
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,300
My design was chosen...

175
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,140
for the next fall
and winter collection.

176
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,340
Really?

177
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,940
Not Cha Jung Won's?

178
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,480
So it's really yours?

179
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,580
What?

180
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,280
You think I stole
Cha Jung Won's design again or something?

181
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,590
Is something wrong?

182
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,930
We'll talk on the way.

183
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,360
Young Chae, I need your help
with something.

184
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,330
Ask me anything.

185
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,530
I'm always on your side, Se Hoon.

186
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,570
Ha Neul is buying up
Kunhyang's stock?

187
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,010
Why are you running away?

188
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
I'm not.

189
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,950
I just feel like maybe...

190
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,450
I shouldn't be alone with you.

191
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,960
You have a crush on me,
don't you, Manager Gu?

192
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,800
Yes, I do.

193
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,760
No! Absolutely not!

194
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,600
I get it. I totally do.

195
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,710
I mean, with a woman
as charming as me,

196
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,770
how could you
not be completely smitten?

197
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,550
Do you know anything...

198
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,680
about that foreign investor,
David Kay?

199
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Drink up.

200
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,420
Oh, dear.

201
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,130
So you do know who David Kay is.

202
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,740
Chairman Gong, help me!

203
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,110
What? What's going on? What...

204
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,210
Yeong Soo, why are you alone
with Young Chae again?

205
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,610
She's way out of your league,
so don't even...

206
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,150
I wasn't even looking!
She keeps coming on to me.

207
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,350
You little brat.

208
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,350
What for?

209
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,660
What were you trying to find out
by hitting on my manager?

210
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,130
I just asked who David Kay is,
and he freaked out.

211
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
You're ridiculous.

212
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,200
Did you tell her?

213
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,570
I didn't tell her...

214
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,970
that I'm David Kay.

215
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,910
I told you to shut up!

216
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,970
Yes, ma'am.

217
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,890
Manager Gu is David Kay?

218
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,690
(Vice President Jin Se Hoon)

219
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,910
David Kay is Manager Gu?

220
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,650
And my mom's involved, too.

221
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,250
It's not just Ha Neul.

222
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,250
So Joo Ha Neul and Chairman Gong
are working together?

223
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,160
My mom has always had a soft spot
for Ha Neul.

224
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,760
But she wouldn't let that get
in the way of business.

225
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,960
So your mother is using
Joo Ha Neul...

226
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,400
to get her hands on
more of Kunhyang's stock?

227
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,130
I wouldn't put it past her.

228
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,670
If you combine Ha Neul's
and David Kay's shares,

229
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,510
they become a major shareholder,
right?

230
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,880
What? Gong Nan Sook
is behind all of this?

231
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,720
Joo Ha Neul and David Kay
have 15 percent.

232
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,020
Gong Nan Sook has seven percent.

233
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,660
So they've secured 22 percent
of the shares.

234
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,320
That's one percent less than me.

235
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,690
But what if Cha Jung Won...

236
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,800
adds the five percent of shares
she got from Chairman Han,

237
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,060
Kunhyang will fall into
Gong Nan Sook's hands.

238
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,770
On top of that, Hye Ra's giving me
the cold shoulder.

239
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,040
I have to drive a wedge
between Hye Ra and Gong Nan Sook.

240
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,610
With our shares combined,
we only have 33 percent.

241
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,280
If Chairman Han and Cha Jung Won...

242
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,480
join Gong Nan Sook and Joo Ha Neul,
they'll have 40 percent.

243
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,080
We absolutely cannot
let that happen.

244
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,650
Se Hoon, you know what to do,
don't you?

245
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,490
First, I'll start
with Young Chae's three percent.

246
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,660
And I'll make sure
she's on our side. And then...

247
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,860
Even with that,
it's still only 36 percent.

248
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,230
I knew it.

249
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,830
I have to take care of
Gong Nan Sook first.

250
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,400
What are you talking about?

251
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,540
A tsunami is coming?

252
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,810
Grandma said...

253
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,140
the most vicious scumbags
in the world...

254
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,480
could devour you all at once.

255
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,180
What scumbags can swallow me?

256
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,220
They must have some big mouths.

257
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,890
Alligators? Hippos?

258
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,590
That will never happen.

259
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,590
My mouth is bigger than theirs.

260
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,830
I'll swallow every last one of them.

261
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,830
Please. Your mouth is no match
for a crocodile or a hippo.

262
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,670
But anyway, thanks.
It's the thought that counts.

263
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,400
Seriously...

264
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,410
So, Grandma, should I just take it?
Tell me what I should do.

265
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,740
You must get on your knees.

266
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,550
And who am I supposed to kneel to
on these worn-out knees?

267
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,050
To a woman more fearsome than you.

268
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,890
A woman who has something you lack.

269
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,320
Come on, do you mean Han Hye Ra?

270
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,500
You must be busy at the office.
What brings you here?

271
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:09,030
I was worried
because you didn't come in,

272
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,830
so I came to see if you were okay.

273
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,070
I'll be back soon.

274
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,770
For now, I can get reports
and sign documents.

275
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,710
I can do that just fine from home.

276
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,340
I know you're staying home because
Honorary Chairman Jin is here,

277
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,980
and you feel you need
to keep an eye on him.

278
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,550
If I'm here holding down the fort,

279
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,950
he won't be able to pull
any funny business so easily.

280
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,690
What is it?

281
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,230
Go on, you can tell me.

282
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,500
Well...

283
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,700
Lately,
Vice President Jin Se Hoon's movements...

284
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,870
have been unusual.

285
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,410
- I'll be back at the office soon.
- Okay.

286
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,690
Vice Chairman.

287
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,160
Didn't you find what you wanted
in the Vice President's office?

288
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,070
Yes.

289
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,400
Then, why didn't you
tell Chairman Han about it?

290
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,410
I feel I should discuss it
with Jung Won first.

291
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,350
Plus, now that Chairman Jin is home,
I'm a little worried.

292
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,680
As for Chairman Han,

293
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,120
I will protect her with my life.

294
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,050
Thank you.

295
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,190
I'm grateful to have
such a reliable ally.

296
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,570
So this is the video
of my dad's entire accident?

297
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,340
Jin Tae Seok did this to my dad...

298
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,410
Dad must have been in so much pain.

299
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
We can't let them...

300
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,900
take this video.

301
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,700
Don't worry.

302
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,470
I've already saved it
to several cloud accounts.

303
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,840
So what do you want to do now?

304
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,280
Should we take this to the police
right away?

305
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,950
But that would be reckless, right?

306
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,320
Slipping through the cracks
of the law...

307
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,190
would be easy for Jin Tae Seok.

308
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,320
Exactly.

309
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,630
Jin Tae Seok will likely only get
a suspended sentence.

310
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,730
And then he'll just go on
to do even worse things...

311
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,070
- without any real punishment.
- I can't let that happen.

312
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,340
Shouldn't we tell Chairman Han
about this?

313
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,240
Actually,

314
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,610
I already went to
the Kunhyang house.

315
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,610
I was worried...

316
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,480
you'd let your anger get the best of you
if you knew about this.

317
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,550
Mom...

318
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,950
No...

319
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,590
But she's your mom.

320
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,660
Call her what comes naturally.

321
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,690
Like last time,

322
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,390
I can't let my mom get hurt too.

323
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,630
That's why
I decided not to tell her.

324
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,400
Besides, you were the one
who needed to know about this first.

325
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,440
- I'll handle this...
- Leave it to me.

326
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,410
I'll find a way.

327
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,140
I'll look for one too.
Keep me in the loop.

328
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,650
Of course.

329
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,160
(Kunhyang Group,
Major Shareholders' Stock Ownership)

330
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,330
(Individual Major Shareholders:
David Kay, Gong Nan Sook, Joo Ha Neul)

331
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,830
Just as I thought.

332
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,830
There's a good chance...

333
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,540
Gong Nan Sook
is behind Joo Ha Neul and David Kay.

334
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,840
Gong Nan Sook...

335
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,680
Why would Grandma
have said something like that?

336
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,920
I think they're onto us.

337
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,990
They found out, right?

338
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,090
That you're actually David Kay...

339
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,260
That I'm not just some fool,
but actually a brilliant genius.

340
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,900
Did you just say you're a genius?

341
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,000
Don't make me laugh.

342
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,470
- For crying out loud.
- A genius...

343
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,670
Gong Nan Sook.

344
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,740
You seriously underestimated me.

345
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,570
What is it now?

346
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,540
Last time,
I tried to have you drowned.

347
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,250
Are you still waking up
in a cold sweat over that?

348
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,720
I'm busy plotting just how
I can destroy you...

349
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,850
in one single move.

350
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,260
Gu Yeong Soo, are you David Kay?

351
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,860
Hey, why are you going after
an innocent guy?

352
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,400
He's already working to death,
dealing with other stuff.

353
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,070
Your fight is with me directly,
okay?

354
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,440
So, Gong Nan Sook,
you've a soft spot for the helpless.

355
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,510
You're surprisingly soft
on good-hearted fools.

356
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,110
So what if I am?

357
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,350
But when I see a scumbag like you,
I can't just let it be.

358
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Gong Nan Sook.

359
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,190
You've been hiding
behind Joo Ha Neul...

360
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,190
and buying up Kunhyang stock.

361
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,260
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

362
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,460
What nonsense are you spouting now?

363
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:14,230
My son is just working hard
as the vice chairman of Kunhyang.

364
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,700
Why would I be pulling stupid stunts
behind his back?

365
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,940
I, Jin Tae Seok,
am not finished yet.

366
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,440
That's what a washed-up old man
would say.

367
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,880
I'll make you come to me
on your hands and knees...

368
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,380
and beg me to spare your life.

369
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,260
So Jin Tae Seok knows...

370
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,360
that we've been buying up
Kunhyang's shares?

371
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,230
Yes.

372
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,130
Then why did he threaten Madam Gong?

373
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,740
Are you helping me because of her?

374
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,180
Perhaps we should
play a game of chess?

375
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,690
Jin Tae Seok has nothing,
yet he acts so high and mighty.

376
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,430
What gives him the nerve
to threaten me?

377
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,900
What's his endgame, anyway?

378
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,670
Madam Gong,
what exactly is your endgame?

379
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,140
My endgame?
What are you talking about?

380
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,280
Are you the one behind Manager Gu?

381
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,410
Manager Gu?
He's been my man. Didn't you know?

382
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,380
Then I suppose you know
who David Kay is.

383
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,150
About David Kay,
I didn't give him any orders.

384
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,320
He helped you on his own accord.

385
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,290
- I just looked the other way.
- Why?

386
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,220
Why did you look the other way?

387
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,990
Why would I let it show that I know?

388
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,800
Buying up Kunhyang shares
to mess with Jin Tae Seok...

389
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,200
was something I'd always wanted
to do anyway.

390
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,870
In fact, I'm thinking
I might as well help you openly.

391
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,840
Do you have nine lives or something?

392
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,270
Are you worried about me right now?

393
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,980
I'm telling you,
just stay out of it.

394
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,340
Don't help me, openly or secretly.

395
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,280
Because I won't appreciate it
one bit.

396
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,220
You don't have to be grateful
at all.

397
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,050
My dear Ha Neul, you just do
whatever you want to do and...

398
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,390
You're leaving?

399
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,990
He turned out so well.
I wonder who raised him.

400
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,300
Look at him, worrying about his mom
in his own little way.

401
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,600
Get a hold of yourself, Nan Sook.
You're getting all sentimental.

402
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,410
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

403
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,010
Jin Tae Seok, the video footage
of you murdering Cha Ki Beom,

404
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,550
along with copies,
is stored in multiple locations.

405
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,680
The slush fund you've hidden
in a Swiss account...

406
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:52,760
and proof of your illicit assets
will also soon be in my possession.

407
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,930
Liquidate all your shares and
voting rights in Kunhyang Group...

408
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,730
and resign from all your posts now,
including honorary chairman.

409
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,440
Any meddling
in the company's management,

410
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,370
using your foundations, affiliates,
or personal connections,

411
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,440
won't be tolerated.

412
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,510
You have 72 hours from the moment
you receive this letter.

413
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,880
The second you miss that deadline,

414
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,880
you will only be known
as Jin Tae Seok, the murderer,

415
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,890
and a hollow shell who will rot
in prison for embezzlement.

416
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,330
So, you think this is ready to send?

417
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,370
This is for Jin Tae Seok, right?

418
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,570
Of course.
It'll be sent anonymously.

419
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,440
- You think it'll work?
- We'll keep at it until it does.

420
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,310
If we get knocked down,
we get back up and fight.

421
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,880
If we get knocked down again,
we get up and win.

422
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,270
(Chairman Han Hye Ra)

423
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,560
What is it, Chairman Gong?

424
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,400
I have a really bad feeling
about this.

425
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,060
The psychic I see told me this.

426
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,800
It makes my skin crawl
just thinking about it.

427
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,270
To a witch scarier than me...

428
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,140
- Me?
- Yes, you.

429
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,240
She said I would end up
on my knees before you.

430
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,980
But that's not
in Gong Nan Sook's playbook?

431
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,610
Now that sounds interesting.

432
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,880
Interesting, my foot.

433
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,150
Even if I die...

434
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:02,350
No, if I die and come back to life
a dozen times,

435
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,020
I'll never kneel to you, Han Hye Ra.

436
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,520
No, I won't.

437
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,090
But the thing is, I feel like...

438
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,500
You feel like what?

439
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,130
My gut tells me Jin Tae Seok
is plotting something.

440
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,440
So you want me to be your shield?

441
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,810
When I don't even know
what I'd be protecting you from?

442
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,940
Let me tell you,
my psychic is the real deal.

443
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,450
She's so good, and she's over 80,

444
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,950
but she's still full of energy
and goes all over the place.

445
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,150
I'll consider it when it blows up.

446
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,460
Hey!

447
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
Oh my...

448
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,960
Now I don't want to be your shield,
even if you groveled at my feet.

449
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,800
All right, I get it.

450
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,670
So you'll have my back
when it all goes down, right?

451
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,770
Go on, now.
Enough with the child's play.

452
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,340
Darn you...

453
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,610
You're making my pinky swear
look pathetic.

454
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,950
I'm losing my cool here.

455
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,050
Anyway, you're having my back,
got it?

456
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,720
No take-backs. That's a promise.

457
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,750
I'm leaving.

458
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,660
Hey, you better keep your promise,
you hear me?

459
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,100
I'm leaving.

460
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,700
I wonder what's about to happen
to Jin Tae Seok.

461
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,840
Se Hoon, was this you?

462
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,110
Why would I?
I don't stoop to methods like these.

463
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,580
If not you, then it must be
Cha Jung Won and Joo Ha Neul.

464
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,320
What are you going to do?

465
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,060
I'm going to make them regret
pulling a stunt like this.

466
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,240
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

467
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,110
I am Administrator Kim Yong Hyuk
from the Seoul Regional Tax Service.

468
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,150
This is an audit of Crown Capital.
Your cooperation is required.

469
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,920
A tax audit?

470
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,750
Are you planning to get rid of
Cha Jung Won again?

471
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,560
Gong Nan Sook comes first this time.

472
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,820
(A Graceful Liar)

473
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,410
Jin Tae Seok, did you really think
I wouldn't know it was you?

474
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,810
That's right, I did.

475
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,610
You dare back Joo Ha Neul
and Cha Jung Won?

476
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,950
Get on your knees.

477
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,880
You think you can win
against the honorary chairman?

478
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,350
Chairman of Kunhyang Group
is my title. Have you forgotten?

479
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,390
You planted hidden cameras
and stole it?

480
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,790
Give me back my video!

481
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,560
It's our trump card
for taking down Jin Tae Seok.

482
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,300
That monster? The one who tried
to kill his own daughter repeatedly?

483
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,570
This must be the work
of Joo Ha Neul and Cha Jung Won.
