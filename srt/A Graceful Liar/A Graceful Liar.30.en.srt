(This production followed all

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,230
The Vice Chairman organizes
her own clothes.

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,560
I see.

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,510
Why does our daughter-in-law
keep getting under my skin?

7
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,850
To the most beautiful bride
in the world.

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,590
Congratulations on your wedding,
Mom.

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,720
I'm so sorry, and I love you.

10
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,430
Please tell Dad for me.

Mom)

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,490
(I'm so sorry, and I love you.
Please tell Dad for me.)

13
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,670
Who are you texting?

14
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,700
That's an invasion of privacy.

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,540
What? My girl's privacy
is my property.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,910
- Give it to me.
- Hey, no way.

17
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,980
By the way,
my mother's asking for you.

18
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,250
Why?

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,420
You were looking for me, Mother?

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,090
Did you...

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,030
reorganize my closet for me?

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,300
Yes.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,230
Are you upset?

24
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,140
I will organize my own clothes.

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,940
Since you appreciate my taste,
I thought you'd be pleased.

26
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,340
Did you do this on purpose?

27
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,580
You made a show of throwing
the emerald necklace and earrings...

28
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,120
I gave you in the trash,

29
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,120
and then you turned
my closet upside down.

30
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,290
What's your angle?

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,490
What angle?

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,860
It's a misunderstanding, Mother.

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,690
- I'd never think such a thing...
- I praise you for a job well done,

34
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,900
and you think
you can just walk all over me?

35
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,930
I am the matriarch
of the Kunhyang family.

36
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,340
If you pull a stunt like this
one more time,

37
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,340
I will never forgive you. Ever.

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,910
What's going on?

39
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,310
I was wrong.

40
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,820
It won't happen again.

41
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,120
Honey.

42
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,660
It's not like you to scold her
first thing in the morning.

43
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,770
(Episode 30)

44
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,610
What's wrong?

45
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,080
You haven't left for work yet?

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,940
Did Mom give you a hard time?

47
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,550
- No, it's nothing.
- Don't give me that.

48
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,450
What did she say this time?

49
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,850
I organized her closet.

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,690
She hates that.

51
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,800
It's all my fault.
I had no idea she hated it.

52
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,360
She got that angry
over a little thing like that?

53
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,700
Don't. Just leave it alone.

54
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,940
I can't take this anymore.

55
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,440
No, honey. Se Hoon!

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,180
What's gotten into him?

57
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,400
You've always doted on her.
Why are you so angry?

58
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,140
Something's off with her.
She's not like before.

59
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,470
You're right.
I was being too sensitive.

60
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,910
Mother.

61
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,080
You're being too harsh
on Young Chae.

62
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,410
Did Young Chae tell you
that I'm being too harsh?

63
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,720
You said she was kind and bright.

64
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,690
You adored Young Chae,
even more than me.

65
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,490
Was that all an act?

66
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,990
You insolent brat!

67
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,190
I used to think that with you,
she'd have no in-law troubles.

68
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,890
But I guess I was wrong.

69
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm so disappointed in you.

70
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,060
Honey.

71
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,070
I'm trying so hard not to hit you.

72
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,600
Your wife isn't the only one
who's precious.

73
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,840
My wife is precious to me, too.

74
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,070
Are you okay?

75
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,670
You don't need to concern yourself
with me.

76
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,310
If you let your woman upset
my wife one more time,

77
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,510
I won't let it slide.

78
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,390
How does it feel
to be slowly pushed away...

79
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,920
by the family you believed...

80
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,590
would always be on your side?

81
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,960
I'm going to make them
abandon you completely.

82
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,830
I'll teach you exactly
what that pain feels like.

83
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,230
Devastatingly.

84
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,640
Let's go.

85
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,800
What did I just see?
Se Hoon isn't acting like himself.

86
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,110
Don't tell me Young Chae is
up to something.

87
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,050
(Friend)

88
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
What is it?

89
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,690
What did that brat do now?

90
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,230
How did you know I wanted to be
a designer at Kunhyang Fashion?

91
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,730
Goodness.
How many times must I tell you?

92
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,440
I'm your mother, Gong Nan Sook.
The baddest woman alive.

93
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,510
Who on earth is the mole
inside Kunhyang Group?

94
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,940
It'll be torment.
Why even consider it?

95
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,610
For crying out loud.

96
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,520
There's a line you don't cross.

97
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,380
Why did you meet Han Hye Ra
and Jin Tae Seok?

98
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,120
Did you think that if you met them,

99
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,320
they'd just give you
what you wanted?

100
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,990
You told me to be Cha Jung Won.

101
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,360
Why walk into the lion's den?

102
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,690
Are you trying to get eaten alive?

103
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,930
You never know.
I might actually pull it off.

104
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,630
Even better than you expect.

105
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,900
I'm not running away anymore.

106
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,340
I'm going to fight back fiercely.

107
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
No.

108
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,210
I'll drag that tramp Cha Jung Won
down to the bottom.

109
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,810
As for Jin Se Hoon,

110
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,780
I'm going to steal him away.

111
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,820
What's done is done.

112
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,960
If you're going to start something,
you'd better finish it.

113
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,530
Whether it means becoming a designer
or stealing Jin Se Hoon.

114
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,270
Show them what it really means
to be Gong Nan Sook's daughter.

115
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,180
You're drinking in the daytime?

116
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,880
This is me holding back
from drinking the hard stuff.

117
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,310
Are you actually worried about me?

118
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,380
Why do you sound so surprised?

119
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,750
It's only natural for a big brother
to worry about his little sister.

120
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,150
Goodness.

121
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,160
Do you want me to tell you
what's behind that smile?

122
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,230
What?

123
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,160
You're worried I'm going to steal
Jin Se Hoon away from Cha Jung Won.

124
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,960
Why would you do something
so foolish?

125
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,330
You don't love Jin Se Hoon.

126
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,840
You don't even like him.

127
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,970
This is your chance, too.
A chance to win over Cha Jung Won.

128
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,610
Why do you keep trying
to paint me that way?

129
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,770
You can deny it all you want,
but the truth is, Joo Ha Neul...

130
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,010
is in love with Cha Jung Won,
the one living as me.

131
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,150
Stop standing on the sidelines.

132
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,890
- I'm just watching.
- No. You're being a bystander.

133
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,190
Are you in any position
to be lecturing me?

134
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,330
Is that the only way
for you to live as Cha Jung Won?

135
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,460
As a designer at Kunhyang?

136
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,260
And stealing Jin Se Hoon.

137
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,270
You can't forget that part.

(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

140
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,550
You said she was kind and bright.

141
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,420
You adored Young Chae,
even more than me.

142
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,150
Was that all an act?

143
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,520
Could my daughter-in-law
be exaggerating things?

144
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,230
I was thinking the same thing.

145
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,660
Se Mi...

146
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,370
Director Jin,
is there something you know?

147
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,070
This is no time
for grace or dignity.

148
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,610
There's something off
about Young Chae.

149
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,910
What makes you say that?

150
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,810
I saw Se Hoon talking back to you.

151
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,250
You were spying?

152
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,650
She was the one spying.
I saw by chance.

153
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,820
Gosh. Just tell me what's going on.

154
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,460
I saw Se Hoon storm
into your bedroom, fuming.

155
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,290
Young Chae followed him...

156
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,360
and then hid and watched
from outside the door.

157
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,260
And that's not all.

158
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,200
I'm Joo Young Chae. I love you.

159
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,810
It was so creepy!

Se Mi.

161
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,110
Are you sure that's what you saw?

162
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,880
You shouldn't falsely accuse her.

163
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,220
I wish I were.

164
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,060

You do? Do you have any idea
what that means?

174
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,950

with the most on your plate.

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,630
No, with your mother-in-law's help.

179
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,200
That's the easy way out, isn't it?

180
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,240
What about you?

181
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,280
If the real and fake Joo Young Chae
were in a life-or-death battle,

182
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
whose side would you be on?

183
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,620
Stupid question.

184
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,180
You'd obviously side
with your real sister.

185
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,090
That's just like you.

186
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,930
This is Joo Young Chae.

187
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,770
We could've just met outside.

188
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,340
- Why come all the way here?
- It's more convenient this way.

189
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,140
Plus, it's private.

190
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,310
Do you really think
you own the place now?

191
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,050
Was being a designer
at Kunhyang Fashion your dream?

192
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,320
To declare war?

193
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,530
I thought you knew everything,
so I wondered why you didn't react.

194
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,030
I was a little curious about
what you were plotting.

195
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,530
Wherever you are
and whatever you do,

196
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,430
I couldn't care less.

197
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,900
You think you're so much better
and more powerful than me?

198
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,570
And as long as
Chairman Gong Nan Sook has your back,

199
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,480
- you're untouchable to me?
- I can't say you're wrong.

200
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,210
You trust Chairwoman Gong Nan Sook?

201
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,820
She's just going to use you up
and toss you aside.

202
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,490
- The position you stole from me...
- You're the one who gave it up.

203
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,890
I simply protected it.

204
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,460
It's going to be my position again.

205
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,230
And you're going to come
crashing down.

206
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,200
- Don't just talk. Show me.
- I already am.

207
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,470
With my design book you stole?

208
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,470
Is that really your talent?

209
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,210
You're just going to shoot yourself
in the foot.

210
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,810
Don't you dare underestimate me.

211
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,940
Let your guard down,
and you'll get burned.

212
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,210
I won’t make the same mistake
you did.

213
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,350
Bring it on.

214
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,550
See if I even bat an eye.

215
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,460
You'll have to do better than this
to beat me.

216
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,440
You'll have to kill me.

217
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,540
That's the only way
you'll get rid of me.

218
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,370
Jung Won.

219
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,040
I'm not going to stop you.

220
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,480
I'm not going to play dirty.

221
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,950
Just try to get in
on your own merit.

222
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,220
I'll welcome you...

223
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,820
with open arms.

224
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,630
- Gosh.
- I'm so sore.

225
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,930
- Finally, we're home.
- My back...

226
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,240
- Gosh.
- Goodness, I'm exhausted.

227
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,640
I was on my feet all day,

228
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,640
and now my feet are all swollen.

229
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,940
- Gosh, here. Let me see.
- Goodness.

230
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,610
- It won't come off.
- Here, let me.

231
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,780
My back.

232
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,920
What are we doing...

233
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,090
on our first night after our wedding
without going on a honeymoon?

234
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,590
We've been together 20 years.
Who needs a honeymoon?

235
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,490
Forget it.

236
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,400
- My back...
- What good are you with a bad back?

237
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,930
For goodness' sake, stop nagging.

238
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,000
Still no word from Jung Won?

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,370
If you ask me 1 more time,
it will be the 100th.

240
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,710
I told you she texted this morning,
saying she loves us and was sorry.

241
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,880
That's still strange.

242
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,220
She's probably too guilty to call.

243
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Gosh, my back...

244
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,380
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

245
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,410
Please leave a message...

246
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,480
Is she that busy
on her business trip to Paris?

247
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,560
Dad.

248
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,360
I can't come here.

249
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,830
I'm the daughter-in-law
of the Kunhyang Family now.

250
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,620
I guess Han Hye Ra...

251
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,020
wanted to soar, just like me.

252
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,890
Did betraying Dad
and abandoning me...

253
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,730
allow her to soar higher?

254
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,730
I'm going to break...

255
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,400
those wings...

256
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,470
Just wait a little longer.

257
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,270
Dad.

258
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,150
There's something off
about Young Chae.

259
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,320
Go on to sleep.
You'll ruin your skin.

260
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,860
My skin...

261
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,790
By the way, I heard
she has a music box just like mine.

262
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,330
I know. I've seen it.

263
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
You've seen it?

264
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,670
Is it really that similar?

265
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,500
Yes.

266
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,940
Who knew you and Chairman Gong
had the same taste?

267
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,740
She said Chairman Gong
bought it for her.

268
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,140
This music box.

269
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,210
Is it yours?

270
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,380
- Yes.
- Have you had it...

271
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,890
since you were a little girl?

272
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,650
No.

273
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,320
A few years ago, I went to Insa-dong
to do some sketching,

274
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,490
and I bought it at a vintage shop.

275
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,660
I fell in love with the melody.

276
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,330
That was a lie.

277
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,880
I'm not lying. It's true.

278
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,150
You're more than capable of it.

279
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,490
Me? As the head of Kunhyang Group?

280
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,490
- No way.
- Why not?

281
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,960
You're the heir to the company.

282
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,330
You may not be chairman overnight,

283
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,160
but you should aim
for the vice chairman position.

284
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,630
Vice chairman?

285
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,400
No one's saying
it has to be right now.

286
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,100
Getting started is half the battle.
Thoughts create actions.

287
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,670
I'll back you up, all the way.

288
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,740
What good is three percent
of the stock?

289
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,080
What if you combined it with yours?

290
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,080
Since I have ten percent....

291
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,750
So, 13 percent?

292
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,750
What if Ha Neul lends you
his support, too?

293
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,990
You want me to go into business
with Ha Neul?

294
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,050
That's for you two to sort out.

295
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,290
But I can help get Ha Neul
on your side.

296
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,230
What's the rush?

297
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,500
Kunhyang Group will be mine
eventually anyway.

298
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,700
There are plenty of people
to do the hard work.

299
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,840
I just want to live it up
as much as I want,

300
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,940
enjoy life with you, and then...

301
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,940
That's a turn-off.

302
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,740
A man with no ambition.

303
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,780
But...

304
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,280
Was all that confidence just an act?

305
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,480
You're making me doubt this wedding.

306
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,520
What?

307
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,680
My heart just sank.

308
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,720
My heart feels like
it's going to burst.

309
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,660
Because an amazing man like you
is all mine.

310
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,660
When I'm with you,

311
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,030
I feel like a better version
of myself.

312
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,800
You're incredible.

313
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,440
You truly deserve to be
the head of Kunhyang Group.

314
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,920
It's so similar...

315
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,720
to the one I bought for Su A.

316
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,490
What are you doing in here?

317
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,330
Did Chairman Gong really buy this
for you?

318
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,600
You told me...

319
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,070
you bought it secondhand.

320
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,510
Does it really matter...

321
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,410
where I got the music box?

322
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,410
No.

323
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,880
There's something more important.

324
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,480
Why is my daughter-in-law
lying to me?

325
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,990
Have you never lied, Mother?

326
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,120
Telling the truth isn't always easy.

327
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,590
Everyone has their reasons.

328
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,190
So you lied.

329
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,730
Where did you get it?

330
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,510
You're the one who bought it for me
when I was a little girl.

331
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,910
This isn't something
you can just find anywhere.

332
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,010
It looks so familiar.

333
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,020
It just happened...

334
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,920
It just happened to find
its way to me.

335
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,960
"It just happened?"

336
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,190
No matter what I say,

337
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,860
you're not going
to believe me now anyway.

338
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,130
They say lies come
in different colors.

339
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,870
Just please know this.

340
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,040
This isn't a black lie
told with ill intent,

341
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,210
or a red one to cover up a crime.

342
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,740
So you're telling me
it's a white lie?

343
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,150
This is where I come
when I want to be alone.

344
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm glad you've found
your own little space...

345
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,130
in this huge Kunhyang house.

346
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,940
They say the closer people are,
the more distance they need.

347
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,340
Don't cross the line.

348
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,210
I'd hate for the affection
I have for you to disappear.

349
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,820
If a warning like that
was enough to shake me,

350
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,090
I never would have started this.

351
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,970
Hey.

352
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,470
- Sit.
- Goodness.

353
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,710
Gosh, look how knotted up you are.

354
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,610
Your shoulders are
practically up to your ears.

355
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,650
Have you made up
with Young Chae yet?

356
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,720
I want to,

357
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,450
but she keeps getting on my nerves,
like she's doing it on purpose.

358
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,120
When you have high
expectations at first,

359
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,920
you're bound to be disappointed.

360
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,560
Go back to square one
and rethink it.

361
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,290
From square one?

362
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,700
Don't see her
as the perfect daughter-in-law,

363
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,760
but as one with a lot to learn.

364
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,630
Take her with you
to your volunteer work, too.

- Thank you for the meal!

367
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,410
Here comes the last piece of meat!
Zoom!

368
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,250
- It's good.
- Is it?

369
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,560
All right, one for Jung Woo too!
Zoom!

370
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
It's the best!

371
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,300
Looks like Mi Na
and Jung Woo are all done.

372
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,930
Let's brush up and have fun, okay?

373
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,170
- Yes!
- Yes!

374
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,700
- Teacher, let's go outside!
- Let's go!

375
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,770
- I want to go out too!
- Come on, hurry!

376
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,270
Come on! Let's go play!

377
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,810
Hurry up!

378
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,010
Your daughter-in-law
is very popular.

379
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,550
Yes, the children really like
my daughter-in-law, thankfully.

380
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,090
Children are pure of heart.
They can tell right away...

381
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,120
that she's warm and kind,
just like you.

382
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,600
That's lovely. What is it?

383
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,100
It's so pretty. That's it,
go on and draw.

384
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,240
Let's see you draw.

385
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,280
She just added a simple outline,

386
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,480
and the whole picture
just comes to life.

387
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,750
You went to
the New York Royal Art School, right?

388
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,320
Vice Chairman Han,
you also majored in art, didn't you?

389
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,890
I double-majored
in painting and business...

390
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,960
at New York Hudson University.

391
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,660
I also went
to the business school there,

392
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,600
so why don't I remember
ever seeing you?

393
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,270
I was so interested in art
that I often skipped business class.

394
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,640
I heard
you were a phenomenal painter.

395
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,680
Why don't you paint anymore?

396
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,250
I've been too busy
with the business.

397
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,680
Everyone raves
about your amazing business acumen.

398
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,350
Is it possible...

399
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,720
that you fabricated your credentials
just for show?

400
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Fabricated my credentials?

401
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,600
I hear that's all the rage
these days.

402
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,400
Where can I buy a diploma
from New York Hudson University?

403
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,910
My jokes never land, do they?

404
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,210
Pardon my rudeness,
Vice Chairman Han.

405
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
So that's it.

Kunhyang Association is organized
by Kunhyang Group,

408
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
or rather, to be more precise,

409
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,300
I understand it's led
by Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra.

410
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Is that correct?

411
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
No, that's not the case.

412
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,310
It was formed by a few of us
who wanted to be examples of giving.

413
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,910
It's always the Han Hye Ra show,
isn't it?

414
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,850
And what does the name
"Kunhyang" mean?

415
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:14,750
It means to walk a path of wellness
and grace together.

416
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,820
Ms. Joo Young Chae.

417
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,460
You're her daughter-in-law, correct?

418
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,590
Yes.

419
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,800
She will uphold the spirit of giving
as a Kunhyang Association member.

420
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,700
Why don't you say a few words
as well?

421
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,240
I'll live my life giving back
as much as I've been given.

422
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,340
Thank you.

423
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,880
I've noticed you often volunteer
at orphanages.

424
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,650
Is there any particular reason
for that?

425
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,150
I want to heal the hearts...

426
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,660
of children...

427
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,290
who've been abandoned
by their families.

428
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,460
A wound that is caused
by a person...

429
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,460
can only be healed
by another person.

430
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,310
"Heal the hearts of children..."

431
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,880
"who've been abandoned
by their families?"

432
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,620
Do you even have the right?

433
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,790
You abandoned your daughter
when she was seven.

434
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,360
You turned your back on your husband
when he was framed for murder.

435
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,930
I will...

436
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,800
rip off that mask of yours...

437
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960

Cha Ki Beom is looking
for Young Chae?

440
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,140
You can do it. Find a way.

441
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,170
Dad would collapse from the shock.

442
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,210
This is a music box I custom-made
for Su A when she was little.

443
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,950
Why does my daughter-in-law have it?

444
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,580
It reminded me too much of Su A,
so I sold it.

445
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,150
Jo Mi Hyang is lying, too.

446
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,850
You'd better get your story straight.

447
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,720
You know who Han Hye Ra is, right?

448
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:06,120
I'll make her pay for hurting me
100, no, 1,000 times over.

449
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,390
I heard your mother studied painting
at New York Hudson University.

450
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,630
She's in a class of her own.

451
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,600
She has a businesswoman's cool head,

452
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,100
plus the sensibility and soul
of an artist.

453
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,970
It's a shame.
You should focus on business now.

454
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,070
Then she can immerse herself in art,
which is what she's always wanted.
