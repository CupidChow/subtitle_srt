1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,940
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,810
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,140
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,850
Sky Question wants to develop models
familiar with Korean culture...

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,280
and the Korean language.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,050
How is that different
from other companies?

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,520
- Will it still be competitive?
- It absolutely will be.

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,630
While current generative AI
is limited to making short videos,

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:30,030
Sky Question has overcome that limit
to produce long-form videos.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,940
So you're saying
you can even produce movies?

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,210
Absolutely.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,550
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Is it weird that I came uninvited?

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,150
Don't be ridiculous.

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,560
You're the future designer
for Kunhyang Fashion,

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,590
and you'll be the lady of Kunhyang.

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,890
You belong here.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,860
You can't even separate business
from personal matters.

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,530
What does she think this place is?

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,210
Did you get
on my mother's bad side again?

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,710
We aimed to make it quick and easy
to create videos for everyday use.

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,880
- Focus on his presentation.
- Business owners...

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
can promote their shops,

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,020
and you can even make videos
for a child's first birthday.

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,950
But getting the prompts right
for specific needs won't be easy.

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,690
- I can't hear Ha Neul!
- Right, and that's why...

26
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,060
we'll also provide a guide
with frequently used prompts.

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,730
The era in which anyone
can easily and quickly create...

28
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,900
and share AI videos.

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,730
That is the goal of Sky Question.

30
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,740
So did you provoke Jin Se Mi
and Ahn Ji Na,

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,070
saying that...

32
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,680
Kunhyang's daughter-in-law wrote
the anonymous post?

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
That's not the half of it.

34
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,810
I also leaked that I'm Su A,
Han Hye Ra's daughter.

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
What?

36
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,620
Don't you think you revealed
too much?

37
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,050
It was bound to come out
sooner or later.

38
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,760
So Kunhyang is trying to
flip the media narrative?

39
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,260
By even leaking articles about Su A?

40
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,300
Han Hye Ra and Jin Tae Seok
would never have approved this.

41
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,370
What if they think
I was the one who leaked it?

42
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,570
I bet that brat, Cha Jung Won,
is behind this.

43
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,110
Not your daughter
"Joo Young Chae" this time?

44
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,040
You're calling her Cha Jung Won
all of a sudden.

45
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,910
That's not what's important.

46
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,580
We need to figure out her scheme.

47
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,980
Exactly.
That way, we can play defense.

48
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,950
Defense isn't enough.

49
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,050
We must ensure
she can't mess with us again.

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,260
How?

51
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,530
What if this goes wrong
and Chairman Jin Tae Seok gets mad?

52
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,260
What if I can't join
the Kunhyang family then?

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,130
You need to get your head straight.

54
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,800
There's a very fine line...

55
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,070
between moving up
and getting knocked out.

56
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,640
We must make everyone believe
Kunhyang's daughter-in-law did this.

57
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,940
Both the anonymous post
and the article about Su A.

58
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,240
Exactly.

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,350
You need to get Han Hye Ra
on your side,

60
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,920
no matter what it takes.

61
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,920
She's always saying,
"My dear daughter-in-law."

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,720
She adores that brat.

63
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,120
But you're her daughter,
more special than any daughter-in-law.

64
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,520
She found her child after 25 years.

65
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,690
She'd pluck the stars
from the sky for you.

66
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,230
She'd believe Jin Su A
if she told her black was white.

67
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,470
Seriously, the things you say.

68
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,570
If I succeed, you'd better
get rid of Cha Jung Won.

69
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,940
If you can manage that,
then of course.

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,210
All right, I'd better go have a talk
with Reporter Ma.

71
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,150
- What for?
- To nip any trouble in the bud.

72
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,420
- I'll go with you.
- No, you stay out of it.

73
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,720
For heaven's sake.

74
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,030
Is this coffee or poison?
It's so bitter.

75
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,060
All high-society women love it.

76
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,400
High-society?

77
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,200
I'll drink it, even if it's bitter.
Elegantly.

78
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,570
It's so bitter!

79
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,110
CEO Joo Ha Neul,
your presentation was impressive.

80
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,850
That's his way
of saying he loved it.

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,920
- Thank you.
- With our capital and your vision,

82
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,560
we could even take on
the global market.

83
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,020
I'll do my best
to live up to your expectations.

84
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,460
Draw up the investment contract.
We'll sign it when it's ready.

85
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,830
I object.

86
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,200
You're the one
who brought this project to me.

87
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,800
Why ruin a deal that's done?

88
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,400
What's the problem?

89
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,340
That's right.
I'm the one who pushed for this.

90
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,070
That's why, rather than on
the Kunhyang Group level,

91
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,910
I, Jin Se Hoon, want to partner
with CEO Joo personally.

92
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,250
What's gotten into you?
I didn't know you had such ambition.

93
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,320
It's not ambition.
Please see it as passion, Chairman.

94
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,490
(Investment Contract)

95
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,930
What's this?
You already prepared a contract?

96
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,130
Leaving Kunhyang Group out of this
was never part of my plan.

97
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,170
Add it to your plan now.

98
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,000
This wasn't in your plan either.
When did this start?

99
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,670
From the moment you suggested
we go into business together?

100
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,840
No, that's not it.
Since Young Chae and I got together.

101
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,880
You want to be a good husband
to Young Chae?

102
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,620
- Bingo.
- You're already good enough.

103
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,990
Shall we finish our business first,
CEO Joo?

104
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Why would I pass up a powerhouse
like Kunhyang Group...

105
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,560
to partner with you personally,
Vice President Jin?

106
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,000
That doesn't seem like a fair deal,
does it?

107
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,270
How long do you think Kunhyang
will be Chairman Jin Tae Seok's?

108
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,270
What?

109
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,110
If I were you,
I'd gladly invest in the near future.

110
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,610
So you're saying the future owner
of Kunhyang Group is you?

111
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,820
Business is business.
I'll need time to think about it.

112
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,020
Vice President Jin Se Hoon.

113
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,390
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

114
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,960
This is a very interesting article.

115
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,700
It seems like
you're on Kunhyang Group's side,

116
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,030
but then you stab them
right in the back.

117
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,770
I don't take sides.

118
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,570
To satisfy the public's right
to know,

119
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,710
I chose a profession
where I wield a pen.

120
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,240
Whatever.
Save it for someone who cares.

121
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,040
Once you get a bite on a story,

122
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,580
you're just itching to show off
and call it an exclusive.

123
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,180
Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

124
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,620
Aren't you going a little too far?

125
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

126
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,360
You think that's all I can do?

127
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,600
Do you even know why the rumor about
how even crying babies stop...

128
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,400
when they hear the name
Gong Nan Sook goes around?

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,430
What is it that you want?

130
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,440
Come work for me.

131
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,740
And don't give me any
of that bull about loyalty...

132
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,380
or any other nonsense like that.

133
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,380
How much does Kunhyang pay you?

134
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,280
What are you even implying?
I haven't accepted anything.

135
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,450
Why you...

136
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,020
I'll double it. No, I'll triple it.

137
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,220
In return,
I get to see any articles...

138
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,960
about Kunhyang first.

139
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,800
I can't just take your word for it.

140
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,800
(Chairman Gong Nan Sook)

141
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,640
Consider it a retainer
for business with Gong Nan Sook.

142
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,620
Dig deeper into
Han Hye Ra's true colors.

143
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,690
I'm sure the dirt on her is endless.

144
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,150
She has more layers than an onion.

145
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,090
Whatever information you find,
I'll buy every last bit of it.

146
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,730
But aren't you in-laws
with the Kunhyang family?

147
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,970
Isn't your daughter Vice Chairman
Han Hye Ra's daughter-in-law?

148
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,970
Han Hye Ra's ex-husband
murdered my ex-husband.

149
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,900
- Cha Ki Beom.
- Is that true?

150
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,240
What am I, your informant?

151
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,310
It's your job to expose that,
Reporter Ma.

152
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,810
And one more thing.

153
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,810
Where did you get your info about...

154
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,150
Su A being
Han Hye Ra's biological daughter?

155
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,560
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

156
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,730
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

157
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,730
Did you give the contract
to Jo Mi Hyang?

158
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,300
Yes. As you instructed, I clarified
that Kunhyang and you, Mom,

159
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,100
had nothing to do with it.

160
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,880
Address me as "Mother."

161
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,750
You said calling you "Mom"
felt more familiar and closer.

162
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,050
We're at the office.

163
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,820
What will people think hearing that?
They'd think you don't respect me.

164
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,920
They'd think
I was a weak mother-in-law.

165
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,260
How are we going to get
through this crisis?

166
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,370
I'm curious what you think.

167
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,840
What if you asked for help
from the people who truly trust you?

168
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,910
Help?

169
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,510
There's no such thing.

170
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,780
You have to bait them to get them
on your side, even if it's a lie.

171
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,320
So you don't care
if it's not sincere?

172
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,520
Even sincerity loses its value...

173
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,920
once it's no longer of use.

174
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,460
What about your husband?

175
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,390
What?

176
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,590
His love for you...

177
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,160
doesn't seem to be
about your usefulness.

178
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,400
He loves you steadfastly,
no matter what you're like.

179
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,040
It's an obsession.
And I'm sick of it.

180
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,970
My son will be devoted as well.

181
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,140
- Like father...
- Like son.

182
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,760
But will you be as devoted?

183
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,390
Even after you find out
I'm the fake Joo Young Chae?

my source confidential...

186
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,950
Now that you're taking my money,
if you ever get cocky with me,

187
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,520
you'll disappear without a trace.
Got it?

188
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,090
I'm going to ask you one last time.

189
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,430
Who was your source
that leaked info on Su A?

190
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,200
It was your daughter, Chairman Gong,

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,870
Han Hye Ra's daughter-in-law,
Joo Young Chae.

192
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,130
My Young Chae?

193
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,210
I swear, that little brat!

194
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,540
Yes. Like mother, like daughter.

195
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,010
By the way,
do you even know who Su A is?

196
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,550
I'm Cha Su A.

197
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,890
I told you to stay out of this!

198
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,160
Don't I have more to do
with this than you?

199
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,130
I'm Su A. No...

200
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,760
That I'm Jin Su A...

201
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,730
I want you to run an article on it.

202
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,370
Look, I need to have solid proof...

203
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,240
Would a DNA test result
be enough proof?

204
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,740
Come on now.

205
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,670
I've already got my hands on it.

Cha Jung Won...

207

Joo Young Chae!

208
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,920
I ought to strangle her.

209
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,420
My head is killing me.

210

You can't even separate business
from personal matters.

211
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,640
What does she think this place is?

212
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
Address me as "Mother."

213
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,880
You said calling you "Mom"
felt more familiar and closer.

214
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,110
We're at the office.

215
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,980
What will people think hearing that?
They'd think you don't respect me.

216
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,120
They'd think
I was a weak mother-in-law.

217
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,220
Han Hye Ra knows...

218
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,360
that I wrote the anonymous post...

219
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,760
and that I leaked
everything on Su A.

220
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,900
There's nowhere I can go
to even catch my breath.

I can finally breathe.

227

It was bad enough
you couldn't breathe?

228
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,770
Then why are you trying
to be someone you're not?

229
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,510
Then who am I supposed to be?

230
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,120
Now I see why
I always come to you...

231
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,890
whenever I'm having a hard time.

232

Even when I feel like
I'm becoming a bad person,

233

that embraces me.

234

if that's what you expect.

You're a sturdy tree I can lean on,

but I like that
you don't blindly say I'm right.

that I'm more Hamlet,

to be the crazy one.

Of course.

What would I possibly have to gain?

344
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,310
I'm only going to ask
you this one more time.

345
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,180
Who was your source
that leaked info on Su A?

346
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,980
She's your daughter, Chairman Gong,

347
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,280
Han Hye Ra's daughter-in-law,
Joo Young Chae.

348
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,520
My Young Chae?

349
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,550
I swear, that little brat!

350
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,060
She recorded this?

351
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,930
Has that crazy girl lost her mind?

352
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,660
Why are you...

353
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,500
manipulating my daughter-in-law?

354
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,870
This doesn't seem to be
just about business.

355
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,440
I believe you're gravely
mistaken about all of this.

356
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,610
That's not it.
Not me, and not Young Chae.

357
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,880
If my image is tarnished,
does that somehow improve yours?

358
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,150
Excuse me?

359
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:17,620
I treated you with respect,
and now you're going to talk back?

360
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,590
You think that's rude?

361
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,060
That's rich,
coming from a low-class loan shark.

362
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,760
Hey, Han Hye Ra!

363
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,270
Don't get so worked up.

364
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,040
Have a seat, please.

365
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,610
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

366
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,950
If you're really not involved,
then as for Young Chae,

367
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,980
you won't mind
if I have her thrown out...

368
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,350
for stabbing me in the back?

369
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,500
I'm glad we had a good meal,

370
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,500
but I want to march over
to the Kunhyang house right now...

371
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,600
and drag Jung Won home myself.

372
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,970
Dragging her home
won't solve anything.

373
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,370
Then what am I supposed to do?

374
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,670
Am I supposed to just sit back
while I'm sick with worry?

375
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,010
That's exactly
what you should do for now.

376
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,210
Sir.

377
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,320
Let me be the one to stay
by Jung Won's side for you.

378
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,220
You're so thoughtful.

379
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,420
Jung Won is there
pretending to be your sister.

380
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,290
She married her birth mother's son
to get revenge.

381
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,060
And your real sister...

382
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,500
She is posing as
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra's daughter.

383
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,570
And you're still taking
Jung Won's side?

384
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,840
- It's not about taking sides.
- Oh, my goodness.

385
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,970
You must really have feelings
for our Jung Won.

386
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,710
No, it's just
I can't leave her like this.

387
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,710
Even now that she's married
to Jin Se Hoon?

388
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,880
You still feel that way about her?

389
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,250
This isn't about romance.

390
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,350
I just feel bad for Jung Won,

391
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,290
and she seems like she's in danger.

392
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,230
See? I think we can worry less
about Jung Won now.

393
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,700
She has CEO Joo firmly on her side.

394
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,330
I guess so.

395
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,310
I can't believe this.

396
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,210
I'm so ticked off!

397
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,350
You think it's okay
to just summon me to the house?

398
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,520
What will you do
if Han Hye Ra finds out I'm a fake?

399
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,490
Get over here!

400
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,090
Get in here!

401
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,630
Hey, were you recording me?

402
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,760
You little fool.

403
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,430
- Do you know what she did to me?
- Please!

404
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
How dare you?

405
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,870
Why are you shocked
by a small betrayal?

406
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,910
- What?
- You think only you can play dirty?

407
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,580
So you dared to play games with me?

408
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,450
Don't get all worked up.

409
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,480
- Not yet, anyway.
- What are you planning to do now?

410
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,450
That depends on you, Chairman Gong.

411
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,220
My heart is already frozen solid,

412
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,620
and my blood runs cold.

413
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,960
I'm cold-blooded.
Have you forgotten?

414
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,660
Why, you...

415
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,660
Hey!

416
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,700
Hey!

417
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,400
You can't afford to make an enemy
of your own mother.

418
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,280
To take over Kunhyang,
we have to stick together like glue.

419
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,650
So don't treat me
like I'm disposable.

420
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,380
If you keep looking down on me,
Han Hye Ra's daughter, Jin Su A,

421
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,390
might want to ruin Gong Nan Sook
for good.

422
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,130
That's my girl.

423
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,460
You really do have my blood
in your veins.

424
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,470
If someone wrongs you,
you wrong them twice as hard.

425
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,340
If they step on you once,

426
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,610
crush them so badly
they'll never dare face you again.

427
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,380
Even if that person is me,
Gong Nan Sook, your own mother.

428
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,710
Understand?

429
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,160
The anonymous post's IP traces
back to where?

430
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,390
The Kunhyang house annex?

431
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,660
The room that only Young Chae uses?

432
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,260
Why would Young Chae
do something like that?

433
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,730
Don't jump to conclusions, Father.

434
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,670
- Someone could be framing her.
- Who?

435
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,600
Who would frame the daughter-in-law
of the Kunhyang family?

436
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,370
Maybe someone else sees
Young Chae as a threat.

437
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,850
Se Hoon, what are you getting at?

438
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,980
Please keep this between us
until it's confirmed, Father.

439
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,950
I need to find out
if it was really Young Chae...

440
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,690
or if someone else...

441
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,350
dared to target
the daughter-in-law of Kunhyang.

442
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,260
I will find out.

443
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,190
And what if
it really was Young Chae?

444
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,560
I will step in if it is.

445
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,170
Leaking dirt on her mother-in-law
to the press?

446
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,970
Trying to rattle Kunhyang Group?

447
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,280
Then she doesn't belong
in the Kunhyang family.

448
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,450
Does Mother know about this?

449
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,520
That the anonymous post was traced
to Young Chae's room?

450
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,020
Where is she right now?

451
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,230
Mother.

452
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,410
You've started my portrait again.

453
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,640
This time, I'll capture...

454
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,110
- your true self.
- It looks different from before.

455
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,780
You'll see when it's finished.

456
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,290
Warm and affectionate
on the outside,

457
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,790
but full of lies on the inside?

458
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,830
You must be capturing
the heartless woman...

459
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,760
who abandoned her child
with another man...

460
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,430
to become the lady
of the Kunhyang family.

461
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,900
Why did you do it?

462
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,700
Why did you abandon
your seven-year-old daughter?

463
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,780
How can you go on with such a serene
and happy look on your face?

464
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,010
So that's why you did it.

465
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,080
And to think how highly
I thought of you.

466
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,720
I thought of you as my own daughter.

467
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,990
How could you do something so vile?

468
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,490
You're despicable.

469
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,930
I don't need a daughter-in-law
like you.

470
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,600
Get out now.

471
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,430
- Get out of the Kunhyang house!
- You're kicking me out?

472
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,340
So you're abandoning
your daughter-in-law now, too?

473
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,240
- What?
- I'm sure this is easy for you...

474
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,870
since it's not your first time.

475
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,410
So you hate me now, don't you?

476
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,610
You despise me
for abandoning my daughter...

477
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,750
and for betraying my ex-husband
and running away?

478
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,920
I can't say you're wrong.

479
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,890
If I were Su A...

480
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,660
If you were Su A?

481
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,860
I would never forgive you. Ever.

482
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,610
(A Graceful Liar)

483
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,170
You think I did it, too?

484
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,310
Cha Jung Won,
who kidnapped Park Kyung Shin,

485
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,410
is more than capable
of doing something like that.

486
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,510
After how much you cared for her...

487
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,540
I can't stand her.

488
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,810
She spoke as if she were Su A.

489
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,450
Su A, you were in Young Chae's room
at the annex, weren't you?

490
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,320
How dare she mess
with my daughter, Su A?

491
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,360
The IP address was traced
to Young Chae's private room, right?

492
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,060
Proof Young Chae wrote
the anonymous post is in there.

493
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,130
Go through everything.
See what she searched and posted.

494
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,960
Are you nervous that Su A
suddenly appeared, Young Chae?

495
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,800
Why did your accident
from 25 years ago...

496
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,330
have to happen then?

497
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,070
I should have died back then.

498
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,870
She even stopped me
from looking into it.

499
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,940
Why?

500
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,280
