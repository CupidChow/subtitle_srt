1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,010
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,440
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,240
(This production followed all
guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,850
(Episode 10)

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,880
Would your second answer
be the same?

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,920
No.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,190
Even if Joo Young Chae wasn't
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter,

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,760
I'd still love her.

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,700
So she's more important to you
than a strategic partnership?

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,500
Yes, for sure.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,510
What about Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra?

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,380
I don't know.

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,480
My mother is much more
of a businesswoman than I am,

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,450
so she might not see it
the same way, but...

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,680
I agree with my son.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,160
Even if Young Chae weren't
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter,

17
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,660
I'd still want her
as my daughter-in-law.

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,470
If there's anything at all
I can do to help,

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,100
just let me know, Se Hoon.

20
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,910
I would pretend
that my Young Chae is dead.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,340
But to replace her
with the likes of you?

22
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,050
I said, let's go!

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,660
What if it gets out
that I'm the fake Young Chae?

24
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,190
Won't you be in trouble too,
Chairman?

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,970
- What?
- You made me pose as Young Chae.

26
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,400
What about your business deal
with Kunhyang Group?

27
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,470
Won't the business deal be affected?

28
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,380
I'm the only card you have to play,
aren't I?

29
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,960
You only see half the picture.

30
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,090
If it got out...

31
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,460
that I knew you were a fake...

32
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,730
and still passed you off
as Young Chae,

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,870
it'd be much more fatal.
Why don't you realize that?

34
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,670
Let me tell you something
about business.

35
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,810
You have to cut your losses now
to avoid an even bigger loss later.

36
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,650
Then why did you make me pretend
to be Young Chae in the first place?

37
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,020
I thought this
would only last a week.

38
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,220
I was sure
I'd find Young Chae real soon.

39
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,990
The longer this goes on,
the worse my odds get.

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,230
In times like this,
the smart move is to fold quickly.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,260
Then what am I supposed to do?

42
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,400
I don't care what happens to you.

43
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,840
You should be glad you got to live
the high life as Young Chae.

44
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,270
This started
because Young Chae asked me to.

45
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,810
What about now?

46
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,780
You want to steal her life,
don't you?

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,580
- You thief.
- Don't call me a thief.

48
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,250
Young Chae's the one
who stole my design book!

49
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,220
The book she submitted...

50
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,490
for the new designer contest
at Kunhyang Fashion was mine too.

51
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,890
In high school,
she stole my designs...

52
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,960
to get into the New York Royal Art School.
You knew that.

53
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,070
I'm not letting that happen
this time.

54
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,370
I'm going to take back the life
Young Chae stole from me.

55
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,470
No. Even if I'm just her stand-in,

56
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,910
I'm not giving up
what I've achieved so far.

57
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,310
A murderer's daughter
has some nerve.

58
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,680
A murderer's daughter?

59
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,590
That won't work on me.

60
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,820
It's too late for that.

61
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,860
Not Young Chae, not even you
can stop me.

62
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,330
You've completely lost your mind.

63
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,170
Will only death make you see sense?

64
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,740
Yes.

65
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,440
I'd rather be dead.

66
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,680
Is it really that sweet?
Living as Young Chae?

67
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,380
It's so sweet...

68
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,220
that it's intoxicating.

69
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,390
They say a moth throws itself
into the flame,

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,560
not knowing it's burning itself.

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
You're exactly like that moth.

72
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,510
How can I beat someone
who isn't afraid to die?

73
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,520
If you still want to impersonate
Young Chae, be my guest.

74
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,490
Do you mean it?

75
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
I do.

76
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,590
What about marrying Se Hoon?

77
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,030
Is it really okay for me to become
part of the Kunhyang family?

78
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,070
Is that what you really want?

79
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,900
There's that, but more importantly,

80
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,210
I want to work as a designer
at Kunhyang Fashion.

81
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,740
Because that is truly mine,
not Young Chae's.

82
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,580
Fine. Have it your way.

83
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,980
Thank you, Chairman Gong.

84
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,620
On one condition.

85
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,290
Cha Ki Beom.

86
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,990
I want your father's life.

87
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,730
The man who murdered my ex-husband.
I'm going to kill him myself.

88
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,600
I was wrong.

89
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,070
I was arrogant and foolish.

90
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,310
Please spare my father.

91
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,180
Is she not picking up?

92
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,180
Yes. I can't reach my mother
or Young Chae.

93
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,120
A surprise visit makes for
an even better gift.

94
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,860
And what will you do for me
if I spare him?

95
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,760
I'll do anything you say.
Absolutely anything.

96
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,570
If you want me to stop
and just leave, I'll go.

97
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,100
Please, I'm begging you.

98
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,710
A ring? For the likes of you?

99
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,680
Take that ring off now!

100
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,220
This is hugh. How many carats is it?

101
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,290
How dare you!

102
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,980
Young Chae.

103
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,720
- Are you okay?
- Just leave me alone.

104
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,120
Young Chae.

105
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,590
Chairman Gong.

106
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,590
What in the world are you doing
to Young Chae?

107
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,900
This ring...

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,730
What am I supposed to make of this?

109
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,210
Are you trying to call off...

110
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,340
their marriage?

111
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,050
This is urgent.

112
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,160
Chairman Han and Se Hoon...

113
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,530
genuinely like Cha Jung Won
for who she is.

114
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,230
Cha Jung Won...

115
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,430
is no longer just a stand-in
for Young Chae.

116
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,970
What is this nonsense?

117
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,700
Why would the Kunhyang family
want to say that?

118
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,770
If Young Chae weren't my daughter,

119
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,640
why would they want her
so desperately?

120
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,210
Isn't that right, Vice Chairman Han?

121
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,310
You're just after the stacks of cash
in my safe.

122
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,980
That's why you're so eager
to be our in-laws, right?

123
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,420
Why? What?

124
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,730
Se Hoon, what are you doing?

125
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,930
Chairman Gong.

126
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,070
I'm not speaking as the heir
to the Kunhyang Group.

127
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,170
As a man,

128
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,480
I love Joo Young Chae
for the woman she is.

129
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,410
Not as a business partner,

130
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,780
but as my partner for life.

131
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,950
I want to marry Young Chae.

132
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,590
Please give us your blessing.

133
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,390
What do you think you're doing,
Vice President Jin?

134
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,560
"Not as a business partner?"

135
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,630
Are you trying to
cut me out of this?

136
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,160
He's saying he loves your daughter
for who she is, Chairman Gong.

137
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,770
This is something you should be
genuinely happy about.

138
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,240
And what about you,
Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra?

139
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,240
Even if this girl, Young Chae,

140
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,340
weren't my daughter
and had no status,

141
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,810
you'd still want her
as your daughter-in-law?

142
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,520
That's correct.

143
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,650
That's how much I adore her.

144
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,690
Goodness.

145
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,760
- Mother.
- I felt like I'm going to pass out.

146
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,030
My goodness. I feel dizzy.

147
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,560
- Are you okay?
- Gosh.

148
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,730
You handled that well.

149
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,270
You still haven't
fully recovered yet,

150
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,710
so, dealing with Gong Nan Sook
must have drained you.

151
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,840
Quite the opposite.

152
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,940
You're energized?

153
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,480
Yes. Se Hoon knelt
before Gong Nan Sook...

154
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,050
for the woman he loves.

155
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,420
It even made my heart skip a beat.

156
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,160
What? That kid who thinks
the world revolves around him?

157
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,490
Yes. It was just like watching you
from 25 years ago.

158
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,500
Was it?

159
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,610
Slow down. You'll get drunk.

160
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,420
How am I
supposed to deal with this sober?

161
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,220
How am I supposed to stand
the sight of her now?

162
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,130
What am I supposed to do?

163
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,130
Should she go on as Young Chae?
Or...

164
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,200
Even if Jung Won...

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,070
reveals she's not Young Chae,

166
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,640
it won't do anyone any good.

167
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,540
In fact, the blow to you
will be much greater.

168
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,910
But what if they find out?

169
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,610
I won't get caught.

170
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,320
And even if they find out,
I'll say I did it all on my own.

171
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,820
Han Hye Ra and Jin Se Hoon
clearly saw us together.

172
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,290
Do you really think they'd believe
I didn't know?

173
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,990
I'll say by the time you found out,

174
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,090
it was already too late...

175
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,030
and that you only learned
the truth today.

176
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,740
So, you're saying
I was going to tell the truth,

177
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,010
but by then, Jin Se Hoon
had already fallen for you?

178
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,780
Yes.

179
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,050
Poor Young Chae is being left out.
This is so upsetting.

180
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,750
Even if Young Chae does return,

181
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,290
she won't want to marry
into the Kunhyang family. Absolutely not.

182
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,890
I need some time to think.

183
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,130
You just keep up your act.

184
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,660
Just don't get caught.

185
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,510
Can we meet for a minute?
I'll be waiting.

186
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,880
Was that Cha Jung Won?

187
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,650
Of course she wants to talk.
I'm sure she was shocked too.

188
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,860
Regardless of your true feelings,

189
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,760
don't you mess this up.

190
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,330
Not until I decide
what I'm going to do about this.

191
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,030
How must it have felt?

192
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,700
Watching the daughter of the man
who murdered your father...

193
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,270
on her precarious tightrope walk.

194
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,340
Was it entertaining?

195
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,610
You should get some sleep.
You're drunk.

196
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,880
I can't say I'm sorry.

197
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,890
Because I believe my father
isn't a murderer.

198
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,990
But I'm so upset.

199
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,490
My heart aches for you.

200
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:13,130
I can't imagine how confused
and difficult it must have been.

201
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,400
You must have hated me enough
to want me dead.

202
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,640
How could you do that?

203
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,870
How could you face the daughter
of the man who killed your father...

204
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,510
with such warmth,

205
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,950
give such sincere advice,

206
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,180
and worry?

207
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,650
I have never thought...

208
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,390
your father murdered my father.

209
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,960
With my own two hands,

210
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,760
I will catch the real killer.

211
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,670
Someday, I will prove
my father's innocence.

212
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,370
Let me help you.

213
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,240
When the time is right,
I'll ask for your help.

214
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
For now,

215
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,150
you should take comfort
in knowing...

216
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,580
that there are people
who genuinely care about you.

217
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,650
That's the only way
you'll get through this.

218
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,530
Vice Chairman Han and Jin Se Hoon.

219
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,930
I'm so thankful that
they like me for me.

220
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,800
And you too.

221
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,650
I'm heading out.

222
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,420
Okay. Go check
on this address for me.

223
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,690
- Where is it?
- You'll see when you get there.

224
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,190
I'm sure it's a pathetic sight
without even having to look,

225
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,230
but see if they have any decency,
and if they'll cause trouble later.

226
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,230
Go and give everything
a thorough check.

227
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,140
(61-5 Seonyu 5-ro, Yeongdeungpo-gu,
Seoul, Cha Ki Beom)

228
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,040
Mother, do we really have to drag
Jung Won's father into this?

229
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,510
Our family's fate depends on her.
So does my business.

230
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,850
Do you think I can just stand by?

231
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,180
Are you holding her father hostage?

232
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,390
So you can control her as you like?

233
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,360
It's a relief, isn't it?
That we have some leverage over her.

234
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,390
Mother.

235
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,590
Do I really have to be the one
to go?

236
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,630
Do you have any idea
how cruel that is to me?

237
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,530
I thought you said he was innocent.

238
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,630
That lowlife, Cha Ki Beom.

239
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,270
You still believe I'm the one
who killed your father, don't you?

240
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,380
You're the one who killed my dad.

241
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,580
You're a murderer!

242
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,920
Then go and face him.

243
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,820
See if Cha Ki Beom is the killer.
Who knows?

244
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,130
Maybe you will be
the one to figure it out yourself.

245
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,100
I had no idea
you were being so profound.

246
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,740
I'll be on my way.

247
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,990
Were you surprised I invited you
to such a humble place?

248
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,930
I was surprised, yes.
But not for the reason you think.

249
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,460
And why is that?

250
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,070
It's a secret, though.
My favorite food happens to be...

251
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,300
- bean sprout and rice soup.
- Me too.

252
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,100
- Especially with octopus.
- With octopus.

253
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,320
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

254
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,350
- Go on, dig in.
- Okay.

255
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,490
That hits the spot.

256
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,700
This is exactly it!

257
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,560
- What are you smiling at?
- What are you smiling at?

258
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,230
Are you feeling all better now?

259
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,300
I wasn't physically sick.

260
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,000
Then what was it?

261
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,990
My mind just wandered for a second.
Sorry.

262
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,460
I zone out all the time too.
Even with someone in front of me.

263
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,330
If you and I had a past life,

264
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,210
- we must have been lovers...
- Or mother and daughter.

265
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,480
If my Su A were still alive,

266
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,390
she would've grown
into a beautiful young woman,

267
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,890
just like you.

268
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,830
Are you all right?

269
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,470
Can we sit down for a second?

270
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,810
May I ask what was wrong that day?

271
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,010
In front of Chairman Gong...

272
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,480
I mean, in front of my mother.

273
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,080
Are you asking why
I was on my knees, crying?

274
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,730
My mom is like a witch
out of a fairytale.

275
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,360
My mother is like a witch.

276
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,060
The kind you read about
in fairytales.

277
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,860
How can you say something like that?

278
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:24,470
I'm sure she loves you an awful lot.

279
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,170
And that's what's so awful.

280
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,940
I need her permission
for everything.

281
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,740
My clothes, my friends,

282
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,310
even the guys I date.

283
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,480
It feels like...

284
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,580
I need her permission
just to breathe.

285
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,290
When you said you were coming
to my house to visit,

286
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,360
did she lay a hand on you?

287
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,770
A daughter as precious as you.

288
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,560
You must have felt so hurt.

289
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,230
My future daughter-in-law.

290
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,400
My poor baby...

291
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,680
(Jung Won's Dry Cleaners)

292
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,650
Cha Ki Beom.

293
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,690
The man who murdered my father.

294
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,480
- Thank you.
- It's no problem. After you.

295
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,040
All right, I'll take you up on that.

296
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,620
Oh, right.

297
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Thanks again.

298
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,600
You're not from around here,

299
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,370
and you don't look like
you're here for laundry.

300
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,900
Well...

301
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,110
Hello, Father.
My name is Joo Ha Neul.

302
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,220
Why are you calling me "Father?"
I don't have a son.

303
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,620
Oh, well...

304
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,760
Jung Won told me her father
runs a dry cleaners here.

305
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,760
- I was in the area, so I came by.
- In the area?

306
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Yes.

307
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,430
- And where do you live?
- In Hannam-dong.

308
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,740
What brings you from Hannam-dong
all the way to this neighborhood?

309
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,570
Whatever. Let's just say
you had a reason to be here.

310
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,740
So what are you to my Jung Won?

311
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,950
Well...

312
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,750
She's a junior colleague?
No, I mean...

313
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,290
An acquaintance? No.

314
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,460
My little sister's friend?

315
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,030
We just know each other.

316
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,660
If that's all,
why would you drop by?

317
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,160
Who said you were welcome?

318
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,900
You're right.

319
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,740
Well, in that case,
I'll just come back another time.

320
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,640
What are you doing?

321
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,180
Where do you think you're going?
It's dinnertime.

322
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,320
- Dinner?
- Stay and have some dinner.

323
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,040
Why are you just staring?

324
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Never seen a feast like this before?

325
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,180
It's hardly a feast.
I just made this with what I had.

326
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,120
Do you have a more refined palate,
our prospective son-in-law?

327
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,650
What are you talking about,
son-in-law?

328
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,090
A picky eater is the worst.

329
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,620
They pick at their food
and complain.

330
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,390
The type who drives his wife crazy
after she went to all that trouble.

331
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,500
- They're the worst.
- Come on.

332
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,140
Goodness.

333
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
What?

334
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,050
This soup is absolutely incredible.

335
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,820
It's Jo Mi Hyang's signature
soybean paste stew.

336
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,460
Some people may have never had it,
but no one's ever had it just once.

337
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,730
- Gosh, this is...
- Goodness.

338
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,160
All right then.

339
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,500
Oh, my.

340
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,210
You eat with such gusto!

341
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,710
He's basically filming an eating show.

342
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,540
My goodness.

343
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,050
He's got such a classy air
about him,

344
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,080
and he eats so heartily too.

345
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,280
We really hit the jackpot
with our prospective son-in-law.

346
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,220
I told you, he's not!

347
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,060
Hey, they say you shouldn't
even bother a dog while it's eating.

348
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,360
Careful, or you'll choke to death
on your food.

349
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,700
Then again, they say a full belly
makes for a happy ghost.

350
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,740
My gosh, what is wrong with you?

351
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,200
Here, take water. Slow down.

352
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,670
Slow down.

353
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,980
Thank you, Mother.

354
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,120
You really must be serious
about our Jung Won.

355
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,290
Since you're Jung Won's parents,

356
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,260
I thought it was appropriate
to call you Father and Mother.

357
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,670
I apologize if I was out of line.

358
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,770
Not at all.
We're Jung Won's father and mother.

359
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,310
You have such impeccable manners.

360
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,740
So why are you here?

361
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,310
Well...

362
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,250
I was curious
about Jung Won's parents.

363
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,990
You came to see what kind of family
our daughter comes from?

364
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,430
I wanted to know what kind of people
Jung Won's parents are...

365
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,900
for Jung Won
to be so pretty and kind,

366
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,630
and such a talented artist...

367
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,040
And?

368
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,410
And so radiant.

369
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,350
So you came to snoop on our family
behind her back?

370
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,550
Oh, my, what do we do?

371
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,990
- Here, drink this again. Quick.
- Yes.

372
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,050
There you go.

373
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,690
I'm fine...

374
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,730
Gosh, you.

375
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,030
My goodness!

376
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Hey, why would you hit
our precious guest?

377
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,170
I didn't hit him.
I was scaring them out of him.

378
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,970
See? His hiccups stopped.

379
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,510
You're right. Thank you.

380
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,810
Now, finish your meal.

381
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,310
Yes, Father.

382
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,750
He's so handsome,

383
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,780
and judging by the way he's dressed,

384
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,850
he must come from
a very well-off family.

385
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,590
Our Jung Won certainly
has a good eye for men.

386
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,760
You must come together next time.

387
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,460
Yes, we will.

388
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,300
Here. Eat.

389
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,840
Thank you.

390
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,010
You know, back when I was
studying abroad,

391
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,550
I was quite the cook.

392
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,220
I can't wait.

393
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,820
Now, where did I put the basil?

394
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,020
No, you stay seated.

395
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
I've got this.

396
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,460
A man who can cook is so sexy.

397
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,330
I don't just cook for anyone,
you know.

398
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,100
A man cooking a meal just for me.

399
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,740
I never even dared to dream of this.

400
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,740
This happiness may have started
with a lie,

401
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,880
but I still want to be happy.

402
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,180
That's why I can't end this lie.

403
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,520
So you checked them out.
They're nothing special?

404
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Right.

405
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,630
They're the kind of people
who invite a stranger in...

406
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,830
and make sure they're fed.

407
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,100
They don't have much,
but they're not greedy,

408
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,500
and live simple, happy lives.

409
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,510
You're awfully generous to the murderer
who killed your father.

410
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,380
Do you want me to stop
helping you then?

411
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,180
So what's the bottom line?

412
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,290
Even if they find out Cha Jung Won
is an impostor,

413
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,360
you think
they won't leech off of us?

414
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,730
Once naive people taste a good life,
they grow more desperate for it.

415
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,900
You've already made contact,
so keep visiting them.

416
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,500
Watch how often Cha Jung Won visits,
what she brings them,

417
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,640
and what they talk about.
Everything.

418
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,210
What is it now?
What are you so unhappy about?

419
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,510
Have you decided what you'll do
about Jung Won?

420
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,220
What do you think I should do?

421
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,550
Does my opinion
really matter to you?

422
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,320
They say even a light drizzle
will soak you through.

423
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,190
She's already worked her way in...

424
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,930
with Han Hye Ra and Jin Se Hoon.

425
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,830
So why should we be the ones
to throw cold water on it?

426
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,200
She's the stone that rolled in.
Once the original stone returns,

427
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,340
I can just get rid of her
whenever I feel like it.

428
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,110
Tell her to come see me
tomorrow morning.

429
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,250
Understood.

430
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,570
- That the life you're longing for...
- The number you called is unavailable...

431
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,170
is nothing
but a castle made of sand.

432
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,610
That the moment you have it,
it will become a nightmare.

433
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,080
That you have to stop
with every fiber of your being.

434
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,020
That if you don't stop now,
you never will.

435
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,450
That's what I wanted to tell her.

436
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,750
I'm leaving now.

437
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
But...

438
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,470
she's sinking
in a sea of sweet lies,

439
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,070
dreaming of an even sweeter dream.

440
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,740
Even if it's all just a mirage,

441
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,040
it's already too late...

442
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,850
for her to stop.

443
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,170
What do you think...

444
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,800
I've decided?

445
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,480
What's with that look on your face?

446
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,150
I will abide by
any decision you make.

447
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,090
Until Young Chae returns,

448
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,660
I will allow you to live
as Joo Young Chae.

449
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,400
However, once Young Chae is back...

450
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,300
I know you said it's unlikely,

451
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,900
but what if Young Chae
wants Jin Se Hoon...

452
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,240
and wants to marry
into the Kunhyang Family?

453
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,810
If that's
what Young Chae truly wants,

454
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,710
and if Se Hoon no longer loves me
and wants her instead,

455
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,520
then I'll gladly give everything up
and walk away.

456
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,890
Sign it.

457
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,670
(Cha Jung Won
will live as Joo Young Chae.)

458
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,070
(However,
if Joo Young Chae returns...)

459
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,140
(Name: Cha Jung Won)

460
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:21,240
(Pledge)

461
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,080
(Name: Cha Jung Won)

462
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,820
(Name: Cha Jung Won)

463
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,600
I am Joo Young Chae now.

464
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,200
The one officially recognized
by her mother,

465
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,700
Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

466
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,540
(A Graceful Liar)

467
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,830
I told you we can't be seen together
at official events yet.

468
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,970
But I want to.
I want to show you off.

469
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,000
Joo Young Chae,
that insufferable brat.

470
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,210
I'll join the Kunhyang Family.
But I want something in return.

471
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,710
Three percent of Kunhyang's stock.

472
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:31,010
I'm telling you, that girl is
one seriously cunning snake.

473
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,920
Ambition can even make a desert bloom.

474
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,620
I'm keeping my place
even if Joo Young Chae returns,

475
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,060
no matter what it takes.

476
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,130
Ki Beom. It's me, Young Sun.

477
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,360
Han Young Sun.

478
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,430
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
