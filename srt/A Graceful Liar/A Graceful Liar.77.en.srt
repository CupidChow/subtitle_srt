1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,370
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,240
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,960
(Calls)

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,160
(Cha Jung Won)

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,300
(Cha Jung Won)

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,000
Jung Won.

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,300
Is something wrong?

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,270
I just wanted to hear your voice.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,940
This is a first.

11
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,980
You've never called me before
just to talk.

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,910
Really?

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,420
I just wanted to say good night.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,720
Wait, hold on!

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,360
Brace yourself
for what I'm about to say.

16
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,330
I still need to double-check,

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,230
but Madam Gong...

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,940
ran a DNA test on you
and Chairman Jin Tae Seok.

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,740
What are you talking about?
Explain what you mean.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,140
Chairman Jin Tae Seok and you...

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,550
are father and daughter.

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,420
Jung Won, can you hear me?

23
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,690
Hey...

24
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,950
I know what I saw that day.

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,050
I couldn't move a muscle,

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,820
but I know for a fact
Jin Tae Seok tried to kill me again.

27
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,290
My own father...

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,500
tried to kill me twice?

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,470
No, that's impossible.

30
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,070
This makes no sense.

31
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,590
She asked to see me?

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,100
Cha Jung Won.

33
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,300
You should have died that day.

34
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,140
That's how it was supposed to be.

35
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,280
Then neither of us would need
to go through all this.

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,220
Yes, Manager Hwang.

37
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,590
What?

38
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,100
Chairman Jin Tae Seok?

39
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,510
Of course.
He must be out of his mind too.

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,340
So what am I supposed to do now?

41
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,410
Should I tell Jin Tae Seok or not?

42
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,980
(Episode 77)

43
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,730
I'm busy. Just get to the point.

44
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,200
I ran a DNA test
on you and Cha Jung Won.

45
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,770
Don't you have anything better
to do?

46
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,170
Are you trying to say
Cha Jung Won is my daughter?

47
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,670
You share a blood type that
only 0.1 percent of people have.

48
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,770
Isn't that odd?

49
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,080
She is your daughter.

50
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,290
There's a 99.998 percent probability
that you're biologically related.

51
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,420
Are you sure
the test was done correctly?

52
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,290
You didn't fake the results,
did you?

53
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,190
What would I possibly gain
from faking something like that?

54
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,330
Why are you...

55
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,630
telling me this
in the middle of the night?

56
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,840
Because I'm curious.

57
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,270
Can a monster like you
still bring yourself...

58
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,340
to kill Cha Jung Won,
knowing she's your own daughter?

59
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,280
And would that famous fatherly love
of yours...

60
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,120
extend to her too?

61
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,490
I'm just dying to know.

62
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,330
Cha Jung Won.

63
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,430
You're my daughter?

64
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,070
I won't be played for a fool
by Gong Nan Sook.

65
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,770
No.

66
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,340
But what if
you really are my daughter?

67
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,050
Did you poison this?

68
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,680
(There is a 99.998 percent chance
of a biological relationship.)

69
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,420
This can't be.

70
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,930
Chairman Han,
Cha Jung Won is in danger.

71
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,500
Do you want to kill me again?

72
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,930
Even if...

73
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,770
I am your daughter?

74
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,480
Then I'll die for you.

75
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,880
Gladly.

76
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,250
What are you doing?

77
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,260
What have you done?

78
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,460
It'll only be over when I'm dead.
You monster.

79
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,830
Hye Ra!

80
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,300
Hye Ra!

81
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,340
Jung Won!

82
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,240
Hye Ra!

83
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,260
Fortunately,
it wasn't a lethal dose.

84
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,060
The fast response
helped her survive,

85
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,630
but there could still be toxins
in her system,

86
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,400
so we'll have to monitor her
for a few days.

87
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,740
Thank you.

88
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,540
As you know,

89
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,240
this can't get out.

90
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,980
Understood.

91
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,250
Dad, what happened?

92
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,790
Why did Mom collapse
all of a sudden?

93
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,930
What do you mean
she drank poisoned wine?

94
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,730
Who on earth
would do something like that?

95
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,100
Don't tell me
you poisoned it, Father.

96
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,230
That's not what happened.

97
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,600
She just passed out from exhaustion.

98
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,810
When is Mom going to wake up?

99
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,210
You know your mom.
She'll be up soon.

100
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,780
She may seem fragile,
but you know she's a strong woman.

101
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,000
What are you doing?

102
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,770
What have you done?

103
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,150
It'll only be over when I'm dead.
You monster.

104
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,550
Why did you do it?

105
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,250
Why?

106
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,230
Cha Jung Won...

107
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,560
No, wait.

108
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,400
You should go see Mom too, Jung Won.

109
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,400
Kunhyang is mine.

110
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,670
You just watch and be happy
with the scraps.

111
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,270
Hiding behind Jin Tae Seok...

112
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,070
and enjoying his wealth and power
wasn't enough for you?

113
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,010
So you're finally
showing your claws.

114
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,410
Did you want me to wake up...

115
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,450
just so you could show me this?

116
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,280
Or did you actually wish
I hadn't woken up?

117
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,220
I thought you were living a lie...

118
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,730
just for your own greed.

119
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,060
But why did you do it?

120
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,000
Why would you try
to die in my place?

121
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,090
No, it's all right.
I'll do it myself.

122
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,300
Why did Chairman Han
drink the poisoned wine?

123
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,470
There's something I need
to tell you, Se Hoon.

124
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,210
Stop treating me like a friend.

125
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,110
I may end up
disappointing you someday.

126
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,310
What is that supposed to mean?

127
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,480
Are you rejecting my offer
to be my right-hand man?

128
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,690
An alliance requires
more than just mutual goodwill.

129
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,190
I thought you were my father's man.

130
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,730
Have you switched your allegiance
to Han Hye Ra and Joo Ha Neul?

131
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,400
Let me just say one thing.

132
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,140
Chairman Jin Tae Seok is the one
who poisoned the wine.

133
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,540
He tried to kill Jung Won again?

134
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,910
And Chairman Han drank it instead?

135
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,660
Because of that girl, Cha Jung Won,

136
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,560
Hye Ra tried to kill herself.

137
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,100
Is a person's life...

138
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,740
a joke to you?

139
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,440
Of course not.

140
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,340
She might be my daughter,

141
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,910
but I tried to kill her.

142
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,850
I couldn't stop myself.

143
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,790
Do you believe Cha Jung Won
is responsible for your downfall?

144
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,790
It's because Han Hye Ra
and Gong Nan Sook teamed up,

145
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,790
and Joo Ha Neul backed them.

146
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,700
- That's the bigger reason.
- I think I need to do a DNA test.

147
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,870
A DNA test of who?

148
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,200
Me and Cha Jung Won.

149
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,170
What does that...

150
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,870
Are you saying Cha Jung Won
could be the daughter...

151
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,710
of you and Chairman Han?

152
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,560
Manager Hwang, I have a job for you.

153
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,020
Do it discreetly.

154
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,340
I need...

155
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,510
to see the test results for myself.

156
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,840
I have to know
if Jin Tae Seok and I...

157
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,010
are truly bound
by the cruelest twist of fate.

158
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,150
Understood.

159
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,820
Are you sure about this?

160
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,660
You're saying
Jin Tae Seok did that...

161
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,690
knowing Jung Won was his daughter?

162
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,200
I was kind enough to call
and tell Jin Tae Seok myself.

163
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,030
That he and Cha Jung Won
are father and daughter.

164
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,230
He must not have believed me.
I mean, if he did,

165
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,640
he wouldn't have tried to poison
his own daughter, would he?

166
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,510
What if he did that,
knowing she was his daughter?

167
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,140
Come on. No way.

168
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,650
Jin Tae Seok really adores Se Mi.
He's a real fool for his daughter.

169
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,480
No matter how much he despises
Cha Jung Won,

170
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,920
he has a soft spot for family,
way more than I do.

171
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,320
I also told Jung Won...

172
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,520
that Jin Tae Seok
is her real father.

173
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,590
What?

174
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,330
Wait, she knows...

175
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,630
her real father tried
to kill her over and over again?

176
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,970
That poor girl, Cha Jung Won.

177
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,810
My goodness.
You seem very concerned about her.

178
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,380
What should we do?

179
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,340
- Manager Gu.
- Yes, ma'am.

180
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,910
It's all right.

181
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,480
Why did you choose that exact moment
to tell Jin Tae Seok...

182
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,320
that Jung Won
was his biological daughter?

183
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,260
I was incredibly curious.
I wanted to know if Jin Tae Seok...

184
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,160
was an even bigger monster
than I am,

185
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,500
and whether he could still
go through with killing her,

186
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
knowing Cha Jung Won
was his own daughter.

187
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,170
It's clear Jin Tae Seok isn't human.

188
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,240
(The Crown Capital)

189
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,050
No, it can't be true.

190
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,120
There's no way
Jin Tae Seok is your real father.

191
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,190
It's crazy, right?

192
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,690
But I confirmed it.

193
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,230
It's true.

194
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,860
Did you check it yourself?

195
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,130
How can this...

196
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,330
How can this be happening?

197
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,440
Jin Tae Seok must have checked
the results by now.

198
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,640
He must not have been sure
when he did it.

199
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,280
- At least, if he's even human.
- So it's okay to kill someone...

200
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,080
unless they're your daughter?

201
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,350
What if being his daughter
made him want to kill me even more?

202
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,880
Jin Tae Seok...

203
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,890
is exactly the kind of man
who would do that.

204
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,700
(DNA Test Results)

205
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,030
(There is a 99.998 percent chance
of a biological relationship.)

206
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,670
(DNA Test Results)

207
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,210
Of all people, why her?

208
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,580
What? You're kidding.
You didn't believe me...

209
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,150
and got your own DNA test?

210
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,780
I trust people who are trustworthy.

211
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,320
I don't trust a master of deception
like you.

212
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,490
What a waste. I said
you were her biological father.

213
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,090
Tell me about it.

214
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,000
Of all people, it had to be her.
She's the biggest headache.

215
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,770
To put it in your crude terms,
it's humiliating.

216
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,670
Humiliating?

217
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,070
Because the perfect, aristocratic
Chairman Jin Tae Seok...

218
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,240
of Kunhyang Group can't have
a child born out of wedlock?

219
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,810
Something like that.

220
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,180
But she's still the daughter
of you and Han Hye Ra, right?

221
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,950
With Hye Ra, I was her protector
and looked out for her.

222
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,450
I filled in her gaps
and cultivated her.

223
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,260
Is Han Hye Ra some delicate flower
for you to cultivate?

224
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,200
Your delusion is getting worse.
It's a very severe case.

225
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,200
Don't tell me you think only you
can save Kunhyang, the country,

226
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,170
and Han Hye Ra.
Is that your delusion?

227
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But it's true, isn't it?

228
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,740
How could this country, Hye Ra,
or Kunhyang survive without me?

229
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,610
Gosh.

230
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,480
So the one person who could
tarnish the honor...

231
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,750
of the perfect Jin Tae Seok
is Cha Jung Won?

232
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,460
If I'd known sooner,

233
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,830
I would've nipped it in the bud.

234
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,530
Or I would have finished her off
for good.

235
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,330
I wouldn't have fussed over trifles
like upsetting Hye Ra...

236
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,300
or felt pity for the girl...

237
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,710
just because she reminded me
of Hye Ra when she was young.

238
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,840
Oh, my. You're pure evil.

239
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,920
What? And what about you?

240
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,620
Why did you have to call me
right when I was poisoning the wine?

241
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,030
I couldn't care less
if you kill your daughter yourself.

242
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,030
- What?
- I'm in a very foul mood right now.

243
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,440
- Why?
- You see,

244
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,570
when I see a jerk who's stronger
and more evil than I am,

245
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,170
or someone tougher and filthier
than me,

246
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,210
my fingertips start to tingle,

247
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,040
and I get this irresistible urge
to destroy them.

248
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,650
You, Jin Tae Seok.
I'm serious, I just want to...

249
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,020
Maybe I should just drown you.

250
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,290
Hey, Gong Nan Sook!

251
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,590
What?

252
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,830
Ha Neul.

253
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,130
I don't know how to look
at you anymore.

254
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,340
What do you mean by that?

255
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,570
My biological father...

256
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,610
killed your father.

257
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,050
Jin Tae Seok also killed the father
who raised you.

258
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,120
I'm so sorry to you.

259
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,800
And to my dad,

260
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,800
I'm so sorry.

261
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,970
Your pain is my pain.

262
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,480
Jin Tae Seok killed my father...

263
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,150
and tried to kill his own daughter
multiple times.

264
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,950
I can never forgive him.

265
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,890
Never!

266
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,210
To think that little brat
could be my daughter.

267
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,750
Isn't this cause for celebration?

268
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,090
Or should we call it fate?

269
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,760
- What game are you playing?
- Why?

270
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,390
Are you afraid?

271
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,190
Are you afraid I might have poisoned
your wine?

272
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,700
Shall we play a game
of Russian roulette?

273
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,010
One of these glasses has poison,

274
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,610
the other is completely harmless.

275
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
Now,

276
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
choose.

277
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,220
All right.

278
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,420
Seeing your guts are
about to burst out of your body,

279
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,430
- I guess you're my flesh and blood.
- I said, choose.

280
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,060
Jin Tae Seok.

281
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,570
Are you playing some kind
of childish game?

282
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,670
Or should I just drink both glasses?

283
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,940
Still want to see me cough up blood
and die right in front of you?

284
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,850
We'll do it this way.

285
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,920
You drink the other one.

286
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Wait.

287
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,330
What is it?

288
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,870
Is the poison already spreading?

289
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,840
What did you put in this?

290
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,510
Did you actually poison it?

291
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,520
I hope you never wake up again.

292
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,690
I can never accept...

293
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,030
that you are my father.

294
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,070
What?

295
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
Dad.

296
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,570
(Tranquilizer, Alpdem)

297
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,170
Don't be alarmed, Se Mi.
He's just sleeping.

298
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,710
You hate my dad, don't you?

299
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,750
Do you want to go see Mom?
We can go together.

300
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,110
Thank you.

301
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,050
This is the first time seeing her
lying down like this.

302
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,280
I used to see my mom like this often
when I'd sleep next to her.

303
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,620
I wish she'd wake up soon
and call my name.

304
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,490
She's gentle outside,
but tough on the inside.

305
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,130
I'm sure she'll pull through.

306
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,460
Designer Cha Jung Won.

307
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,730
No, I mean...

308
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,830
When you were in the ICU, Jung Won,
Mom really struggled.

309
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,800
She went to pray all the time.

310
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,270
- Pray?
- She prayed for you to recover.

311
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,550
I know you must resent our mom...

312
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,780
and that you might even hate her,

313
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,920
but she drank that poison
in your place.

314
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,720
- It's not like that.
- I know that too.

315
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,860
I never thought Dad would
go that far with you.

316
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,400
I'm so sorry.

317
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,100
I'm sorry too.

318
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,770
For not letting you in.

319
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,780
I'm probably still going to act
like a brat sometimes.

320
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,510
And I'm not giving up on Ha Neul.

321
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,150
But...

322
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,320
the fact that you're also
Mom's daughter.

323
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,330
- I'll accept that.
- I know that's hard for you.

324
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,460
You can do whatever feels right.

325
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,830
Since it's what Mom would want,

326
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,570
I'll try.

327
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Me too.

328
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,420
If you're really out there,

329
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,750
please save the woman...

330
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,260
who gave me life.

331
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,460
I made such foolish
and arrogant choices.

332
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,770
All I did was nurture
my resentment and anger.

333
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,170
I never knew...

334
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,480
she'd be willing to risk her life
for my sake.

335
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,650
Please let us see each other again,

336
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,220
so we can finally
open up to one another.

337
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,250
Please.

338
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,660
Is it really true?

339
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,860
That my Jung Won was
about to be harmed,

340
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,260
and Han Hye Ra stepped in
to save her? Is that right?

341
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,700
- Yes.
- Was Jin Tae Seok behind it again?

342
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,730
It was Cha Jung Won's father.

343
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,970
Ki Beom? What about him?

344
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,240
- No, that's not it.
- Then spit it out. Now.

345
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,980
I can't possibly be the one
to tell you.

346
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,150
You'd better tell me,
unless you want to see me lose it.

347
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,520
If you don't, I'm going straight to
the Kunhyang house right now.

348
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,820
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

349
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,890
What is going on with you?

350
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,300
I have committed
an unforgivable sin.

351
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,830
What are you talking about?

352
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,430
Are you saying
that Jung Won almost got hurt...

353
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,900
because of you, Manager Hwang?

354
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,470
Yes, it is.

355
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,570
The real Jung Won...

356
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,280
Jo Jung Won.

357
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,310
My child, Jung Won...

358
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,780
How do you know about her?

359
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,650
On that day, 25 years ago,
I was at the scene of the accident.

360
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,090
- What?
- I was on Chairman Jin's orders.

361
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,330
I was ordered to drive
the car toward Cha Su A.

362
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,730
I couldn't bring myself to do it,

363
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,640
so I stopped the car
at the last second.

364
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,500
Suddenly, the car behind me swerved,

365
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,910
and a child ran out into the road.

366
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,110
She was a child
who ran to save Su A.

367
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,080
And that child was
my daughter, Jung Won?

368
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,790
I watched until she was taken away
by the ambulance.

369
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,560
She was still conscious,

370
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,860
and according to the paramedics
at the time,

371
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,230
her injuries weren't serious.

372
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,600
So...

373
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,670
you just thought she was
going to live?

374
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,940
That's what I chose to believe.

375
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,700
That fragile, little girl...

376
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,710
Do you have any idea how much
she suffered until the very end?

377
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,780
Then why have you kept
your mouth shut until now?

378
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,390
I've had to look the other way...

379
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,890
and pretend I knew nothing.
That's how I've survived.

380
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,730
Don't you ever appear
before me again!

381
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,140
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

382
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
Manager Hwang.

383
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,220
I need you to do something for me.

384
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,330
Jin Tae Seok.

385
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,530
I have to take him down myself.

386
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,300
Bring him to the address I send you
by 8 p.m. tomorrow,

387
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,710
no matter what.

388
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,560
I found where Ms. Cha Jung Won
hid the slush fund ledger.

389
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,900
Go get it immediately.

390
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,300
To be precise,

391
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,940
it's not a place. It's a person.

392
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,870
A person? Who?

393
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,040
They'll only give it to you
if you come in person.

394
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,460
Hey, get the car ready!

395
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,890
- You're going to drive yourself?
- Am I your chauffeur? Hurry along!

396
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:15,930
Right.

397
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,980
Joo Ha Neul.

398
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,580
How dare you order me around?

399
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,920
Look at you. You've grown bold.

400
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,380
You're here.

401
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,720
You're going to hand over
the slush fund ledger?

402
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,560
Don't you remember...

403
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,460
this place?

404
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,430
Of course. I knew as soon as
I heard the address.

405
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,510
It's where your pathetic excuse
for a father took his last breath.

406
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,770
He was still alive.

407
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,880
You took his last breath.

408
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,450
- You did, Jin Tae Seok.
- How could I ever forget?

409
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,150
The sight of this floor
stained with his blood...

410
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,020
is still fresh in my mind.

411
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,820
Do you not...

412
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,090
feel any regret?

413
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,160
Regret? What for?

414
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,270
All I did was kick a little stone
out of my path.

415
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,170
You piece of scum!

416
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,640
A monster like you deserves to die.

417
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,740
And I'll kill you with my own hands.

418
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,250
- You little jerk!
- You think I can't do it?

419
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,890
A piece of trash like you...

420
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,890
deserves to die by my hand.

421
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,820
That's the only way to make
everything right again!

422
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,710
(A Graceful Liar)

423
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,000
How dare you pull a stunt like this
on the chairman of Kunhyang?

424
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,570
If my Ha Neul wanted you dead,
then you deserve a thousand deaths.

425
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,840
Go ahead. I'll take it
until your anger subsides.

426
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,040
- We're married, so no more secrets.
- Married?

427
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,840
Jung Won, your real father
was my father, Jin Tae Seok?

428
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,650
I must ask you why, of all people,
Jin Tae Seok had to be my father.

429
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,680
But what am I supposed to do
if you lie there saying nothing?

430
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,050
Gong Nan Sook has my father?
I have to save him, don't I?

431
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,220
Make me the next chairman.

432
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,690
I want to climb to the very top
of Kunhyang Group.

433
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,890
