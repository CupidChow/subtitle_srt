1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,270
(All characters, locations,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,510
(in this drama are fictional.)

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,080
(This production followed
all guidelines for young actors.)

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,280
Did you see the article?

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,290
(CEO Joo Ha Neul)

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,690
It's a ploy to change
everyone's attention.

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,390
I expected something was coming,
but I didn't expect an actual photo.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,130
They counterattacked.
We need to strike back.

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,900
I've prepared a deadlier arrow,
one they can't escape.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,740
What about you, Ha Neul?

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,070
I've secured 22 percent
of The Crown Capital's stock.

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,180
I'm still three percent
behind Chairman Gong Nan Sook.

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,040
I'm rooting for you.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,850
They're an official couple now.

15
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,920
Vice President Jin was married
to Young Chae from the start,

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,820
and now, they're expecting a child.

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,230
So drill that into your heads.

18
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,460
What a transparent lie.

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,730
Director Jin, this is something
the Chairman is handling.

20
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,400
The future of Kunhyang Group
is at stake.

21
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,570
Still, how can you act like
it never happened?

22
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,140
What exactly are you referring to?

23
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,050
Se Hoon and I were married
from the start, weren't we?

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,790
Aren't you the one who created
this whole situation...

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,360
that threatens Kunhyang's future,
Vice Chairman?

26
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,290
- Jin Se Hoon.
- Your seven-year-old daughter.

27
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,200
If you hadn't abandoned your ex-husband
in prison for murder...

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,500
and chosen your first love,

29
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,130
she would have never married
into this family for mere revenge.

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Shut your mouth!

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,600
Am I wrong?

32
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,970
You think I'm going
to let you disrespect my woman...

33
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,440
right in front of me?

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Stop it.

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,650
He's right. This is all my fault.

36
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,350
I wronged Se Hoon terribly.

37
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,750
Don't say that, Mother.

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,620
It was just a tangled mess...

39
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,330
that's finally been
straightened out.

40
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,200
Mom, don't blame yourself.

41
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,300
And you, stop being so harsh
with Mom.

42
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,840
I have a lot to do.

43
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,480
That brat...

44
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,650
Time to bury one scandal
with another.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,450
Han Hye Ra will be brought down too.

46
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,960
Oh, my! You scared me.

47
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,590
You don't even tell me
you're coming anymore, Grandma?

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,960
I only come because you keep
summoning me, you witch.

49
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,030
You think I like it?

50
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,500
It's like
we're on the same wavelength.

51
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,970
What do you think?

52
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,710
Doesn't this look like
a proper family photo now?

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,680
She really is
a scarier witch than you.

54
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,350
Who? Han Hye Ra?

55
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,450
Why? Is she more powerful than me?

56
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,680
Does she do more evil things
than I do?

57
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,020
Or is she going to swallow
Kunhyang whole?

58
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,420
Good grief.

59
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,420
Is being powerful
and good at being evil...

60
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,530
what makes someone scary?

61
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,200
She does things that...

62
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,300
even you would never dare to do.

63
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,730
Like what?

64
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,940
Why are you asking me?

65
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,500
Not Chef Hong again.

66
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,240
Honestly, Grandma,
you always disappear...

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,080
at the most crucial moments.

68
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,210
There's no real family here.

69
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
I'll go prepare your meal.

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,720
A real family?

71
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,100
I wonder what you are here for.

72
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,560
I have a question for you.

73
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, so precious.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,810
My goodness.

75
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,410
When was this? Oh, my.

76
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,010
Was this
when my Ha Neul was about three?

77
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,620
His eyes were
just so bright and sparkly.

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,950
They were so beautiful
and unforgettable...

79
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,460
that I just impulsively said
I'd raise him myself.

80
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,760
If only I had said no,

81
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,960
I never would've gotten tangled up
with that jerk Joo Sang Cheol.

82
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,430
He wants to get revenge...

83
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,000
on that man who doesn't even
deserve to be a father.

84
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,300
My poor boy.

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,810
Oh, my.

86
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,580
Oh, my. I must be going crazy.

87
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,140
Gong Nan Sook,
are you going through menopause?

88
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,780
Gosh, I need to take my medicine.

89
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,520
Oh, goodness. Manager Gu!

90
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,850
Darn it!

91
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,790
Do you think Jung Won...

92
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,090
is getting in your way,
Vice Chairman?

93
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,330
Enough that after
one little article,

94
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,660
you'd post
a fake marriage story about...

95
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,630
Se Hoon and Young Chae,
complete with photos?

96
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,140
My Su A... I mean...

97
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,610
You care for Jung Won a great deal,
don't you?

98
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,510
Yes, I do.

99
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,180
Are you scared...

100
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,620
- that I'll hurt Jung Won?
- I can't say that I'm not.

101
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,850
I'm scared of myself too.

102
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,990
That in my struggle to protect
everything I've worked for,

103
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,030
I'll hurt Jung Won even more.

104
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,430
And that I won't even know
I'm doing something wrong.

105
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,640
("VP Jin Se Hoon's Surprise Marriage
to Joo Young Chae...")

106
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,680
You came looking for me?

107
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,460
I came to give this back.

108
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,610
Stay for some tea.

109
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,190
Congratulations, Vice President,

110
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,320
on your marriage
to Designer Joo Young Chae...

111
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,390
and the pregnancy.

112
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,430
Stop.

113
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,960
I get so angry
that I feel like I'm going crazy...

114
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,900
- whenever I think of you.
- Then hate me.

115
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,530
Despise me, Se Hoon.

116
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,400
- What?
- No matter the reason,

117
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,140
I'm a bad woman to you.

118
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,780
When I found out you were
the son of my birth mother,

119
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,980
I used you thoroughly.

120
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,820
- Don't forgive me.
- You just used me?

121
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,120
Was that all it was to you?

122
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,820
Well, what more did you expect?

123
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,160
- That I actually loved you?
- Yes.

124
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,860
In some corner of your heart,
you must've cared for me as a man...

125
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,270
and as my woman.
If you cared for me even a little...

126
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,370
There was nothing.

127
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,470
- Not one bit.
- Jung Won.

128
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,270
What about you, Se Hoon?

129
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,370
Can you say you only loved me?

130
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,410
That you'd still love me if I weren't
Chairman Gong Nan Sook's daughter?

131
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,180
But you couldn't resist Young Chae
and got her pregnant.

132
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,180
You proved...

133
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,020
that thing called love
is as light as a feather.

134
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,890
I was furious with you.

135
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,990
No.

136
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,130
When I saw you and Ha Neul together,

137
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,630
I was so angry I couldn't even...

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,260
It's in the past.

139
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,700
We can't turn back time,
so don't even think about it.

140
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,710
We're over.

141
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,680
You're Joo Young Chae's man now.

142
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,150
Do you love Ha Neul?

143
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,850
Answer me.

144
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,720
Ha Neul...

145
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,560
feels like the one person
who would stand by me,

146
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,830
even if the whole world
turned against me.

147
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,500
That's more terrifying...

148
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,100
than you saying you love him.

149
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,340
It's a comfort to have Ha Neul.

150
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,100
He's like a great, sturdy tree.

151
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,510
He's been like that
since we were in high school.

152
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,940
So, Ha Neul...

153
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,010
was your first love?

154
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,680
I worry that he'll get hurt
because of me.

155
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,550
So much so that it's hard
to fully accept his feelings for me.

156
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,390
Whatever is between Ha Neul and me,

157
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,360
whatever our feelings are
for each other,

158
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,230
it has nothing to do with you,
Se Hoon.

159
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,670
Any feelings I had for you
and our relationship...

160
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,100
don't exist any longer.

161
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,090
Is your place as the lady
of the Kunhyang family...

162
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,190
or your seat as Vice Chairman
of Kunhyang Group...

163
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,990
really more important...

164
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,400
than comforting the daughter
you've just found...

165
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,770
and calming her anger?

166
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,330
And what if they are?

167
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,170
What could you possibly do, CEO Joo?

168
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,780
For Jung Won,

169
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,310
can you fight for her
to the very end?

170
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,650
The battle has already begun.
Jung Won...

171
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,290
has provoked Chairman Jin,
Chairman Gong, and me.

172
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,960
She needs to be tougher...

173
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,830
and stronger.

174
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't understand what you're
truly thinking, Vice Chairman.

175
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,930
You won't give up
a single thing you have,

176
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,370
yet you still have a mother's love.

177
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,670
I was just playing the part
of a loving mother.

178
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,270
I've only ever lived
for my position, my name,

179
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,110
and my own happiness.

180
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,780
And I always will.

181
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,780
It's just that...

182
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,050
I wish the child I gave birth to...

183
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,490
had someone like you, CEO Joo,

184
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,560
who'd protect her
through anything. No.

185
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,160
Someone who'd even be willing
to lay down their life for her.

186
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,830
- I'm so selfish, aren't I?
- That's a contradiction.

187
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Life is a contradiction.

188
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,540
The more Jung Won comes after me,

189
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,640
the harder I'll fight back
to protect myself.

190
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,750
Even if that means plunging a knife
into Jung Won's heart.

191
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,620
When that time comes,

192
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,850
please protect Jung Won.

193
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,720
Even if protecting Jung Won...

194
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,690
means I have to take you down,
Vice Chairman?

195
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,000
It means we'll each be protecting
what's most important to us.

196
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,840
You can do that, right?

(Damga Charcoal Grill)

198
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,020
Why is she rushing around like that?

199
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,050
Something must be up.

200
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,600
This is so delicious.

201
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,170
My sweet girl. Are things hard?

202
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,510
What's making it so hard? Tell me.

203
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,280
I...

204
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,050
wanted to be acknowledged
for my own abilities.

205
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,780
That's why I tried
to steal Young Chae's life.

206
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,090
But for whatever reason,

207
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,590
it was the wrong choice.

208
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
But...

209
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,360
when I see Han Hye Ra turning
her back on her own daughter,

210
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
and refusing to give up
her fake life,

211
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,340
I just can't forgive her.

212
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,840
You were ready to quit
because Ki Beom told you to.

213
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,610
If you hadn't found out
Young Sun was Han Hye Ra,

214
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,510
you would've made things right.

215
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,580
You would've lived as Cha Jung Won,
as Ki Beom's and my daughter.

216
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,420
Do you really think so?

217
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,090
Of course you would have.

218
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,690
I raised you for 25 years.

219
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,160
If there's anyone out there
who knows you better than me,

220
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,190
just tell them to step forward.

221
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,070
I feel like what happened to Dad
is my fault,

222
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,770
- and it breaks my heart.
- What are you talking about?

223
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,400
This whole mess started
because Young Sun called him out.

224
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,570
It was Young Sun's greed
that got Ki Beom killed.

225
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,010
If I could stop, I would.

226
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,950
But I just can't.

227
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,620
I have to rip the mask off
that woman, Han Hye Ra.

228
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,920
It's the only way I'll learn
the truth about Dad's death.

229
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,730
Then you have to see it through.

230
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,090
I'll help you.

231
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,100
We have to find out
if it was really Han Young Sun...

232
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,760
who did that to Ki Beom,

233
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,900
and if Gong Nan Sook
and Jin Tae Seok are behind it.

234
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,540
We absolutely have to know.

235
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,640
Even though Dad is gone,

236
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,940
I'm going to prove his innocence.

237
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,880

Congratulations.

Thank you.

Ms. Cha Jung Won gone?

246
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, I sent her on an errand...

Ouch!

256

Oh, sorry. My mistake.

257
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,060
Was it really a mistake?

258

There's no way
she'd poke you on purpose.

00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,970
what about the initial screening
of the files I gave you?

264
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,800
I need a little more time.

265

Have it done by tomorrow morning.

266
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,980
Jung Won did?

267
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,320
Yes, she seems really down.

268
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,120

to lay down their life for her.

272

I'm so selfish, aren't I?

273
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,410
Besides just being there
for Jung Won,

274
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,310
what else should I do for her?

275
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,520
Did you confess your feelings?

276
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,850
My feelings?

277
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,990
- Not yet...
- See?

278
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,250
You haven't even done
the most important part.

279
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,860
You think just being there
is all it takes?

280
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,190
Then what should I do?

281
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,690
Haven't you seen it in the movies?

282
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,360
You open the car trunk,

283
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,730
and the balloons that say
"I love you" come flying out.

284
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,730
Do you think Jung Won
would like that?

285
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,740
How about this? I saw it in a movie.

286
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,870
I'll write how I feel
in a sketchbook,

287
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,440
and then surprise her with it.

288
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,540
What about this?

289
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,850
You pull up in front of her work...

290
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,850
in a big, long car
and call her outside.

291
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,220
When Jung Won comes out,
the convertible top goes down,

292
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,150
and you hand her
a bouquet of flowers.

293

Ms. Jo, you're quite the romantic.

294
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,360
Perfect timing.
Give CEO Joo here some pointers.

297
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,570
What's he been doing all this time
without getting married?

298
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,910
He's got such broad shoulders
and a handsome, manly face.

299
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,240
Get a grip, Mi Hyang.

300
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,780
What about winning her
a stuffed animal from a claw machine?

301
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,520
Oh, that's a great idea.

302
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,720
It's the same advice I gave
to Vice President Jin Se Hoon.

303

Then absolutely not.

304
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,860
CEO Joo, just do what you do best.

305
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,920
What's important is that
it's from the heart, right?

306
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
From the heart.

307
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,500

00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,840
The position you have now
used to be hers.

356
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,910
Isn't being a daughter-in-law
to the Kunhyang family enough?

357
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,710
What does it matter
who wore the ring before?

358
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,050
You have a point.

359
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,020
There's nothing wrong
with what you're saying.

360
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,850
But...

361
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,320
I'm a woman too.

362
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,820
One with pride.

363
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,960
I don't need this pathetic ring.

364
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,170
You scum.

365
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,340
What?

366
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,980
Joo Ha Neul asked Cha Jung Won out?

367
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,360
I know you have feelings
for Joo Ha Neul.

368
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,020
But I told you.

369
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,690
He's family by marriage...

370
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,400
and close with your brother.
He can't be anything more than that.

371
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,560
Do you feel more sorry...

372
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,100
for Cha Jung Won than me?

373
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,170
I'm your daughter too.

374
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,310
- Don't you care about how I feel?
- Goodness.

375
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,080
Se Mi.

376
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,710
That's not what I meant.

377
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,850
My dear Se Mi, why are you crying?

378
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,950
Talk to your dad. What's wrong?

379
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,760
A man...

380
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,760
doesn't easily change his mind
once he's set his heart on a woman.

381
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,960
What about my feelings?

382
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,970
What about your daughter's feelings?

383
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,700
The only man who made me
reconsider never marrying...

384
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,010
was Ha Neul.

385
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,910
What do you want me to do,
my dear Se Mi?

386
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,950
Break apart...

387
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,380
Cha Jung Won and Ha Neul for me.

388
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,920
Oh, come on.

389
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,660
Good grief.
I told you not to even bother...

390
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,130
with Jin Se Hoon's feelings.

391
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,400
Why are you so obsessed
with winning him over?

392
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,100
What does Cha Jung Won have
that I don't?

393
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,200
What? Nothing!

394
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,670
My Young Chae is much prettier,
smarter, and dazzling.

395
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,680
It's just that you have
such a terrible temper.

396
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,440
Mom!

397
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,580
Hey, look here.
You have this solid proof,

398
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,020
all official-looking and everything.

399
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,350
Why let that tramp Cha Jung Won
get to you?

400
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,390
Why should I have to wear a ring
Cha Jung Won used to wear?

401
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,420
Doesn't it hurt your pride?

402
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,830
This isn't just about me.

403
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,500
He's disrespecting you,
Chairman Gong Nan Sook!

404
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,060
Now that I think about it,
you're right.

405
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,400
You're particularly sharp today.

406
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,940
How dare they do this
to my daughter,

407
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,870
shove a second-hand ring at her?

408
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,580
Even if he gave you a new one... No.

409
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,710
Even one many times bigger
might not be good enough!

410
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,520
(Reporter Ma Sang Ki)

411
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,350
You head home for now.
Later, you and I...

412
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,220
are going to barge
into the Kunhyang house in style.

413
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,090
Really?

414
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,940
Are you leaving already?

415
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,340
Did you finish the work I gave you?

416
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,880
I was going to come in
early tomorrow to do it.

417
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,510
Finish it today before you go.

418
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,760
What do you think you're doing,
Director Jin?

419
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,130
Gosh, you scared me.

420
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,730
Are you trying
to keep Cha Jung Won...

421
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,530
from getting calls
from CEO Joo Ha Neul?

422
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,370
This is just too low, even though...

423
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,510
Ji Na.

424
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,750
You have to get your hands dirty
to win the one you love.

425
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,260
What? Se Mi did that?

426
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,530
Yes, I'm sorry.

427
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,900
I should have stopped her,
but instead, I encouraged her.

428
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,140
I should just tell
Cha Jung Won the truth...

429
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,270
and buy her a new phone...

430
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,340
Just go home.

431
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,350
- Sorry?
- Just keep telling me the truth...

432
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,250
like you are now, Ms. Ahn Ji Na.

433
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:39,880
Okay.

434
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,690
(Vice Chairman Han Hye Ra)

435
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,200
What can I do for you?

436
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,310
Jung Won?

437
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,340
What are you, a goldfish?

438
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,250
Do you forget everything
in three seconds?

439
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,950
Did I or did I not tell you...

440
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,020
to show me any article
on Kunhyang first?

441
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,090
- You did.
- Then?

442
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,420
Why didn't you show me
the article Cha Jung Won broke first?

443
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,460
I didn't think my editor
would okay it.

444
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,190
My editor is usually so cautious
when it comes to Kunhyang.

445
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,030
I was so sure it would get killed,

446
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,830
- but suddenly...
- Look at you,

447
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,500
trying to weasel your way out
of this.

448
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,900
You're so good at squirming out
of things.

449
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,170
You'd better give back every cent
of that advance I paid you!

450
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,780
- What is this?
- Please calm down.

451
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,390
A much bigger storm is about to hit
the Kunhyang family this time.

452
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,020
I'm telling you, so you know first.

453
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:01,360
That brat Cha Jung Won is dead set
on taking down Han Hye Ra.

454
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,530
Gosh, if this story breaks,
it's going to be something else.

455
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,840
Do we run it or not?

456
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,770
Are you the editor? Run it now!

457
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,350
Who would do this?

458
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,620
Jung Won!

459
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,890
Oh, there you are.

460
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,060
Ha Neul?
What brings you to the office?

461
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,340
They're doing
a first-round screening...

462
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,570
for a blind submission?

463
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,610
That must be annoying.

464
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,640
You don't think it's right, do you?

465
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,750
But you can't ignore an order
from your boss.

466
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,590
Let's just finish up quickly
and get out of here.

467
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:13,640
You two must have thought that I,
Gong Nan Sook, am a total pushover.

468
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,910
How could you
give my Young Chae the ring...

469
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,270
that tramp Cha Jung Won
used to wear?

470
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Is that true?

471
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,620
I didn't realize
it would be such a big deal.

472
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,690
Se Hoon, you have no idea
why I'm hurt, do you?

473
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,490
Our A Reum would be sad too.

474
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,860
- A Reum?
- It's a nickname for the baby.

475
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,060
A Reum, as in "beautiful?"

476
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,670
What a lovely nickname.
Wouldn't you agree?

477
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,800
I can just see
our grandson's face now.

478
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,940
Right, honey?

479
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,940
That was thoughtless of me.

480
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,910
Now that we've accepted Young Chae
as our daughter-in-law,

481
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,710
I should have been more thoughtful
in our preparations.

482
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,120
Why don't you pick out the rings
for Se Hoon and Young Chae?

483
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,290
Thank you, Mother.

484
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,970
A text?

485
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,800
My phone got wet,

486
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,700
so I couldn't check it
while it was drying.

487
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,700
I'm sorry.

488
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,840
Well, things didn't go exactly
as planned,

489
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,810
but just being here with you
is more than enough.

490
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,430
I love this song.

491
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,330
It's beautiful.

492
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,800
Should we sit for a bit?

493
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,100
Wait here a minute.

494
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,470
I'll get us something warm to drink
from the convenience store.

495
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,630
Thank you.

496
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,500
Is the convenience store that far?

497
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,040
I was just going to watch
from the sidelines,

498
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,750
but I can't hide my feelings
any longer.

499
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,350
I hope
she won't have to suffer anymore,

500
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,490
and that the ones
she loves won't get hurt.

501
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,360
With a prayer in my heart,
I dedicate this song.

502
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,910
<i>The long, tiring day ends</i>

503
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,840
<i>Under the moonlight, we're two</i>

504
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,150
<i>But one single shadow</i>

505
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,680
<i>When I close my eyes</i>

506
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,060
<i>I can almost grasp</i>
<i>that faint, sweet happiness</i>

507
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,660
<i>It's still lingering over there</i>

508
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,900
<i>Though your wounded heart</i>

509
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,340
<i>May cast a shadow</i>

510
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,570
<i>Even on your dreams</i>

511
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,280
<i>Please remember this</i>

512
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:20,980
<i>Someone who loves you</i>
<i>so much it hurts</i>

513
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,260
<i>Is right here beside you</i>

514
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,690
<i>Though at times this road</i>

515
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,960
<i>May seem endlessly long</i>

516
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,730
<i>And though your sorrowful heart</i>

517
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,200
<i>May bring you to tears</i>

518
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:46,140
<i>Until all these moments</i>
<i>become memories</i>

519
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,910
<i>The two of us</i>

520
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,580
<i>Will be each other's sanctuary</i>

521
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,720
<i>I may be clumsy</i>

522
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,890
<i>And full of flaws</i>

523
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:06,600
<i>But I will always</i>
<i>be right here with you</i>

524
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,030
<i>Even if the harsh winds</i>

525
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,870
<i>Should start to blow again</i>

526
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:17,010
<i>The two of us</i>

527
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,380
<i>Will get through these rough times</i>

528
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,620
<i>Together</i>

00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,650
Were you really the one...

531
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,190
who tried to frame
Jung Won's father as a murderer,

532
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,320
Vice Chairman Han?

533
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,660
It was all Jin Tae Seok's doing.

534
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,990
But I don't have any proof.

535
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,190
I'm sure Chairman Gong Nan Sook
has a video.

536
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,190
What if I decide to make
Joo Ha Neul pay?

537
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,900
Are you saying you're going
to hurt Ha Neul?

538
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,030
Why aren't you doing anything?

539
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,870
I am. You just won't notice...

540
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,230
as I shake them
to their very foundation.

541
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,640
