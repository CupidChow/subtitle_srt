since childhood,

185
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,710
closer than real brothers.

186
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,820
I never thought it'd turn out this way.

187
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,570
How did you find out?

188
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,930
I've been around long enough

189
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,770
to know how to read people.

190
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,580
What's the plan with Mom and Dad?

191
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,460
I haven't figured it out yet.

192
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,150
Coming back this time,

193
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,740
I realized they've gotten old.

194
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,870
If you keep your relationship a secret,

195
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,620
they'll think you're alone,

196
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,420
and start worrying about you.

197
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,730
One day you won't be able to hide it.

198
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,350
When that day comes,

199
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,050
if they can't accept it...

200
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,840
what will you do?

201
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,870
Would you still insist on being with Tuo?

202
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,990
Are you leaving already?

203
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,410
We're about to eat
once your dad finishes his shower.

204
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,340
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

205
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,830
Next time, Mom.

206
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,250
I'll bring Tuo back for a meal next time.

207
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:17,940
Okay.

208
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,060
Bye.

209
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,210
Don't cry now.

210
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,470
I'm not forcing you to break up.

211
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,120
I'm sorry.

212
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,390
I'm sorry.

213
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,590
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,120
Even if my parents are against it,

215
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,420
I still want to be with Tuo.

216
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,940
I really like him.

217
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,730
I didn't realize I loved him this much.

218
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,300
Yushu, I'm going home.

219
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,090
If you've made up your mind, go for it.
I've got your back.

220
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,020
Thanks.

221
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,580
Do you have to rush off like that?

222
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,530
Do you remember that tree?

223
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,880
The first time I met you,

224
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,670
you were hiding beside that tree,

225
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,700
looking so scared.

226
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,440
We used to play wedding games here
with Xiaoyang.

227
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,080
Every time we played rock-paper-scissors
to decide who'd be the groom,

228
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,020
I always lost.

229
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,700
What I told you that day
at the hospital...

230
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,020
We can't go back.

231
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,480
We can't go back to just being friends.

232
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,470
I can't just be friends with you.

233
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,790
Junxi...

234
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,340
I know,

235
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,630
I'm often a step behind,

236
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,910
and that makes you anxious.

237
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,890
But actually,

238
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,090
I never wanted to keep us a secret.

239
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,180
I just didn't know what to do.

240
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,160
Han Tuo, I won't break up with you.

241
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,800
Even if you win rock-paper-scissors
100 times, 1,000 times,

242
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,200
I still won't agree to it.

243
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,290
Junxi.

244
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,250
Han Tuo, I like you.

245
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,520
It's not just like,

246
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,680
I love you.

247
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,840
I'm sorry.

248
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,390
I always thought

249
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,470
I was forcing you into this relationship,

250
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,870
and that's why you wanted
to keep it secret.

251
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,280
I thought you didn't like me that much.

252
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,950
I was scared...

253
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,460
that you were only with me out of habit.

254
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,350
I was anxious...

255
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,650
I thought you would give up on me one day.

256
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,510
If I broke up with you first,

257
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,520
I wouldn't be abandoned.

258
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,560
Once I hold your hand, I'll never let go.

259
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,340
I won't leave you behind.

260
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,590
I'm sorry...

261
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,510
for making you feel so insecure.

262
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,580
I'm the one who should apologize.

263
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,380
We promised to be family,

264
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,520
but when you needed me most,
I said break up.

265
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,220
I'm sorry.

266
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,040
We're even now.

267
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,870
Let's stay together.

268
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,720
Forever.

269
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,050
Let's always be together.

270
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,190
Forever.

271
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,500
Let's go home.

272
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,670
Okay.

273
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,470
No.

274
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,620
I just got out of the hospital,

275
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,080
and he won't even

276
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,200
stay for lunch with us.

277
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,450
Such an ungrateful son.

278
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,250
That's enough.

279
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,240
You've been nagging
since before lunch.

280
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,900
Doesn't your mouth get tired?

281
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,340
I told you he has his own things to do.

282
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,620
Don't you understand?

283
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,130
I'm just saying it at home.

284
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,360
I didn't say anything in front of Junxi.

285
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,230
Stop nagging.

286
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,950
Look, Yushu can't even eat.

287
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,020
Why are you back?

288
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,510
Lunch's already over.

289
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,640
Why are you back?

290
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,410
Why did you suddenly come back?

291
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,340
Dad,

292
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,130
Mom.

293
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,880
I have something to tell you.

294
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,670
[In the Next Episode]

295
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,170
Han Tuo.

296
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,110
Let's have a relationship
that feels light and easy.

297
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,150
Are you...

298
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,120
serious about Junxi, right?

299
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,950
Let go.

300
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,380
No.

301
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,370
Wherever he is,

302
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,960
that's my home.

303
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,340
Tuo.
