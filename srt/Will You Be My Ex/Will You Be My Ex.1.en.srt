1
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,000
What's taking so long?

2
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,891
<i>Let me go first!</i>
<i>We’re family friends, right?</i>

3
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,975
<i>They haven't come out yet?</i>

4
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,810
<i>They're taking forever.</i>

5
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,828
<i>For real? A quickie in the bathroom?</i>

6
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,622
Can you hurry it up?

7
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,625
<i>Come, girl! Come out!</i>

8
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,920
Aww jeez.

9
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,881
<i>You don't care, do you?</i>

10
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,972
<i>Joey?!</i>

11
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,223
<i>Chris?!</i>

12
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,392
<i>You're back together?</i>

13
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,455
<i>- How are you? Congratulations!</i>
<i>- You too!</i>

14
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,257
<i>Excuse me! Move! Move!</i>

15
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,389
<i>Congrats, love!</i>

16
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,186
<i>Congratulations, my cum laude.</i>

17
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,647
<i>Where should we celebrate?</i>

18
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,407
<i>Sorry, I just got excited.</i>

19
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:29,287
<i>Obviously, because this is such</i>
<i> an exciting event.</i>

20
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,127
<i>Sandra, I don't think smoking</i>
<i> is allowed here.</i>

21
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,548
<i>So, </i>hija,<i> tell me.</i>

22
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,009
<i>Where are you gonna celebrate later?</i>

23
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,927
<i>Chris! Chris!</i>

24
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,888
<i>Congratulations, honey!</i>

25
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,890
<i>I finished it!</i>

26
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,933
<i>It's your turn next!</i>

27
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,190
<i>Now, honey, you've graduated.</i>

28
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,691
<i>Are you ready to be…</i>

29
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,109
<i>jobless?</i>

30
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,070
<i>I know, right.</i>

31
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,863
<i>Anyway--</i>

32
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,200
<i>Hang on, are they my future in-laws?</i>

33
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,868
<i>Ah! Oh my goodness!</i>

34
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,787
<i>You know what, don't worry.</i>

35
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,163
<i>I already talked to Chris.</i>

36
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,414
<i>And I told her, of course,</i>

37
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,167
<i>to prioritize work and her art.</i>

38
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,877
<i>Am I right?</i>

39
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,504
<i>As for you two,</i>

40
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,339
<i>safe s*x!</i>

41
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,799
<i>You know what I mean!</i>

42
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,299
<i>Sorry.</i>

43
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,258
<i>It's true, right?</i>

44
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,219
<i>I'm just being prac-- It's true, yes?</i>

45
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,599
<i>It's okay, love.</i>

46
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,683
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

47
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,477
Hijo<i>, congratulations.</i>

48
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,543
Adulting. Here we go.

49
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,462
Thank you of course
to Mom and Dad for this gift.

50
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,215
Finally, I've got my own place.

51
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,677
Okay. This is it.

52
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,762
Wow! This is so nice.

53
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,764
I wish I had one for myself.

54
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,499
My sweetheart.

55
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,669
I want you to be the queen of this place.

56
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,423
Queen of your heart.

57
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,924
Love.

58
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,525
<i>Why?</i>

59
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,777
<i>Because.</i>

60
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,072
<i>Because...why?</i>
<i>What's this?</i>

61
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,283
<i>Because it's cute!</i>

62
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,368
<i>It suits your personality!</i>

63
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,539
<i>Serious but with a cute side.</i>

64
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,499
<i>Mm…</i>

65
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,795
<i>For me, Chris, everything in life</i>
<i> has to have a purpose.</i>

66
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,465
<i>From the things you put in your house</i>

67
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,801
<i>to the people you keep in your life.</i>

68
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,387
<i>Because if there's no purpose,</i>
<i>what's the point?</i>

69
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,889
<i>Beauty…</i>

70
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,766
<i>is the point.</i>

71
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,519
<i>And besides, it reminds me of something.</i>

72
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,022
<i>What?</i>

73
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,024
<i>You don't remember?</i>

74
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,235
<i>This.</i>

75
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,486
<i>Your umbrella.</i>

76
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,239
<i>Right?</i>

77
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,240
<i>It's cute!</i>

78
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,241
<i>Okay.</i>

79
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:53,866
<i>Fine.</i>

80
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,157
<i>My baby smells so good. Damn!</i>

81
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,827
<i>Wait..</i>

82
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,453
<i>Did you brush your teeth already?</i>

83
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,913
<i>No?</i>

84
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,623
<i>Was my breath ever stinky?</i>

85
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,542
<i>Jeez. I was just kidding.</i>

86
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,335
<i>It's too early to be grumpy.</i>

87
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,379
<i>I'm a Leo, remember?</i>

88
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,174
<i>What time is it anyway?</i>

89
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,634
<i>6:30 a.m?</i>

90
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,511
<i>Huh?</i>

91
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,972
<i>It's already 6:30?</i>

92
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:59,181
<i>I’m gonna be late!</i>

93
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,308
<i>You can still make it!</i>

94
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,059
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

95
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,359
<i>How's my hair?</i>

96
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:11,736
<i>Deodorant!</i>

97
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,570
<i>Okay! Okay!</i>

98
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,363
<i>Here-- Oh my god!</i>

99
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,948
<i>There we go.</i>

100
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:16,449
<i>Quickly!</i>

101
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:16,991
<i>Sorry! Sorry!</i>

102
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,284
<i>- Cute!</i>
<i>- Sure?</i>

103
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:18,868
<i>Yes!</i>

104
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,620
<i>- Shoot!</i>
<i>- Okay!</i>

105
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,747
<i>Go! Go!</i>

106
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,082
<i>How do I smell?</i>

107
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,042
<i>Good!</i>

108
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,001
<i>Socks! Don't forget.</i>

109
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,336
<i>I'll put them on the way.</i>
<i>On the way.</i>

110
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,087
<i>Sorry, sorry! Uhm…</i>

111
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:30,838
<i>What is it?</i>

112
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,380
<i>Glasses.</i>

113
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,465
<i>Oh, right.</i>

114
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,466
<i>Okay.</i>

115
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,009
<i>Wait, oh my god. Your hair.</i>

116
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:35,718
<i>Okay.</i>

117
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,427
<i>How am I?</i>

118
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,219
<i>I love you.</i>

119
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:37,762
<i>Goodbye.</i>

120
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,721
<i>- Bye.</i>
<i>- Okay. I'm late.</i>

121
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,138
<i>Bye!</i>

122
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:39,513
<i>Late.</i>

123
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,264
<i>Bye!</i>

124
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,267
<i>- Watch.</i>
<i>- Yes! Go!</i>

125
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,562
<i>Oh my god.</i>

126
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:13,589
<i>Love, I might come home late.</i>
<i>They need me on the show tonight.</i>

127
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,053
<i>I thought you'll be backstage?</i>

128
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,680
<i>Sorry, there were changes.</i>

129
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,893
<i>But I'll try to come home early,</i>
<i>okay? I love you!</i>

130
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,197
<i>Okay guys before we eat,</i>

131
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:43,577
<i>let's give it up for this gal</i>
<i>who saved our show!</i>

132
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,579
<i>Go, Chris!</i>

133
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,416
<i>Thank you! Bravo! Bravo!</i>

134
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,419
<i>Thank you, </i>Direk.
<i>Thank you for the opportunity!</i>

135
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,962
<i>For our lady of the evening.</i>

136
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,505
<i>Flowers?</i>

137
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,433
Speech!

138
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,518
<i>- What am I gonna say?</i>
<i>- Speech!</i>

139
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,688
<i>- Speech!</i>
<i>- Speech!</i>

140
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,991
To Sarah, I'm thankful you're unavailable.

141
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,701
<i>If you were here,</i>

142
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,912
<i>I wouldn't have had this chance</i>
<i> to play the lead.</i>

143
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,583
<i>Congratulations on making it to Canada and…</i>

144
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,959
<i>I'll make you proud.</i>

145
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,296
<i>Thank you, </i>Direk.
<i>Thank you so much!</i>

146
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,839
<i>Go on, have your dinner!</i>

147
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,675
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

148
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,662
<i>Love?</i>

149
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,081
<i>Love, I'm sorry.</i>

150
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:15,169
<i>I thought I could leave after the chorus</i>
<i>but the lead had an emergency.</i>

151
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:20,090
<i>And as the understudy, I've memorized</i>
<i>all the lines so I stepped up.</i>

152
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,176
<i>Sorry. Did you cook this?</i>

153
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,637
<i>Come, let's eat.</i>

154
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,600
<i>You could have at least called.</i>

155
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,894
<i>I got really busy.</i>

156
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,437
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

157
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,773
<i>Let's eat.</i>
<i>The food's been waiting.</i>

158
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,531
<i>It's so good!</i>

159
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,699
<i>Did you make this?</i>

160
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,784
<i>Wow!</i>

161
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,828
<i>Wow!</i>

162
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,913
<i>- Try some!</i>
<i>- I'm going to bed.</i>

163
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,499
<i>- I'm going to bed.</i>
<i>- Wait.</i>

164
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,084
<i>Aren't you gonna join me?</i>

165
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,294
<i>It won't take long.</i>
<i>Eat with me.</i>

166
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:02,132
<i>Christina. I need to be up early</i>
<i>for my fieldwork, remember?</i>

167
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,176
<i>Just enjoy the food.</i>

168
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,386
<i>All right, fine.</i>
<i>I'll put these away.</i>

169
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,096
<i>No! Don't. I cooked it for you.</i>

170
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,430
<i>No, I'm good. I'll put these--</i>

171
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,557
<i>Oh, love!</i>

172
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:12,810
<i>I'll do it.</i>

173
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,978
<i>No. Let me.</i>

174
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,188
<i>- Let me do it.</i>
<i>- It's okay, love. I'll do it.</i>

175
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,481
<i>- I'll take care of it.</i>
<i>- You should rest.</i>

176
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,400
<i>You should get some rest.</i>

177
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,193
<i>Leave it to me.</i>

178
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,820
<i>Please.</i>

179
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,241
<i>Go on.</i>

180
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,467
<i>I thought we agreed.</i>
<i>No shoes in the bedroom.</i>

181
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,442
<i>And why is the light </i>
<i>in the bathroom still on?</i>

182
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,084
<i>Chris.</i>

183
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,421
<i>I'm just trying to tell you something.</i>

184
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,426
<i>You shoudn't agree to last minute arrangements</i>
<i>because look what happens.</i>

185
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,178
<i>You end up getting short-changed.</i>

186
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,055
<i>You'll get stressed and tired</i>

187
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,140
<i>and in the end,</i>
<i>you'll be the one complaining.</i>

188
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,227
<i>Love, I said I was sorry.</i>

189
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:44,026
<i>But you know how important it is for me</i>
<i>to be the lead in a big production.</i>

190
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,654
<i>It's my dream.</i>

191
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,447
<i>And this might be my only chance.</i>

192
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,241
<i>Hey.</i>

193
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,243
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

194
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,371
<i>I'm happy you got lead.</i>

195
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,081
<i>I am.</i>

196
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:02,336
<i>But it's our anniversary, you know?</i>

197
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,339
<i>I know.</i>

198
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,091
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

199
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,760
<i>It's okay. I'm sorry, too.</i>

200
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,387
<i>Friends?</i>

201
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,304
<i>We're good?</i>

202
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,180
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

203
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,141
<i>Sure?</i>

204
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,351
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

205
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,102
<i>Kiss me first.</i>

206
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,191
<i>Sorry.</i>

207
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:25,859
<i>Sorry.</i>

208
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,195
<i>I want a sweeter one.</i>

209
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,489
<i>- Huh?</i>
<i>- No!</i>

210
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,666
<i>Germany?</i>

211
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,170
<i>You're leaving?</i>

212
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,382
<i>For how long?</i>
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

213
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,260
<i>I bet you are gonna make </i>
<i>us all proud in Germany.</i>

214
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,763
<i>Boss was asking you a question.</i>

215
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,973
<i>He was talking to you.</i>

216
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:59,768
<i>Yes, of course.</i>
<i>I will confirm as soon as I can.</i>

217
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,145
<i>Make it fast.</i>

218
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,272
<i>This opportunity comes once</i>
<i> in a blue moon.</i>

219
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,774
<i>Not everyone is afforded </i>
<i>this kind of a chance.</i>

220
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,777
<i>Yes, sir. I understand.</i>

221
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,404
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

222
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,948
<i>Sir, excuse me.</i>
<i>I have to show you something.</i>

223
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,908
<i>Excuse me.</i>

224
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,871
<i>What?</i>

225
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,666
<i>And here I was,</i>
<i>about to tell you I'm jealous.</i>

226
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,877
<i>You, jealous? Since when?</i>

227
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,962
<i>I thought you were gonna tease me.</i>

228
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,631
<i>I mean, Yanz!</i>

229
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,676
<i>How will I explain this to Chris?</i>

230
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,597
<i>If she really loves you,</i>
<i>I'm sure she will understand.</i>

231
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,099
<i>Doesn't she know how important this is?</i>

232
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,186
<i>She will. She has to.</i>

233
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:42,936
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

234
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:46,482
<i>Just remember what a big opportunity</i>
<i> this is for you.</i>

235
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,275
<i>And one more thing.</i>

236
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,068
<i>What?</i>

237
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,069
<i>What is it?</i>

238
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,781
<i>Because you're so tense at the meeting,</i>

239
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,824
<i>your coffee was spilling all over you.</i>

240
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,660
<i>I was literally shaking.</i>

241
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,371
<i>You didn't finish your soda water.</i>

242
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,831
<i>Thank you.</i>

243
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,378
<i>Relax.</i>

244
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,963
<i>I need to use the bathroom.</i>

245
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,131
<i>I gotta check this.</i>

246
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,299
<i>Wipes? You need wipes for that?</i>

247
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,133
<i>Wipes.</i>

248
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,760
<i>Thank you.</i>

249
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,928
Bigger diaphragm!

250
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,179
<i>Inhale!</i>

251
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,389
<i>Exhale!</i>

252
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,725
Now, exhale. Give me five.

253
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,603
And exhale!

254
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,443
<i>Our premiere night will be…</i>

255
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,028
<i>in Dumaguete!</i>

256
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,949
<i>Cheers!</i>

257
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,618
Dumaguete, here we come!

258
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,538
Eight counts, from there...

259
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,540
<i>You okay?</i>

260
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,709
One, two, three!

261
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,295
Jump! Ha!

262
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,048
Keep wiggling!

263
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,049
Shake it off.

264
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,759
<i>Shake it off, guys!</i>

265
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,512
Cheers!

266
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,100
And flex.

267
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,726
Point!

268
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,019
And flex.

269
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,896
Hands up!

270
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,982
In three counts, reach the floor.

271
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,985
One, two, three, reach it!

272
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,820
Find your core, everybody.

273
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,904
<i>Find your core.</i>

274
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:17,906
<i>Stretch.</i>

275
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,617
<i>What's going on?</i>

276
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,287
<i>Girl, please.</i>

277
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,372
<i>Don't give me the bull.</i>

278
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,665
<i>Are you pregnant?</i>

279
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,541
<i>What?</i>

280
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,544
<i>We shall look upon the glorious dawn!</i>

281
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,297
<i>We shall look upon the glorious dawn!</i>

282
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,383
<i>We shall look upon the glorious dawn!</i>

283
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,846
<i>There's a big future ahead of me, Jonj.</i>

284
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,306
<i>It shouldn't be this way.</i>

285
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,557
<i>It's not part of the plan.</i>

286
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,142
Does Joey know about this yet?

287
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,103
Oh, he knows that's why he's not going to Germany?

288
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,771
Noel mentioned it to me.

289
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,024
<i>I thought he wasn't going because</i>

290
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,234
<i>he found out you're pregnant.</i>

291
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,903
<i>Joey doesn't know yet.</i>

292
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,655
<i>Besides, he shouldn't make decisions like that.</i>

293
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:02,075
<i>Hang on. It might work even more in your favor</i>

294
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,411
<i>since you're pregnant, right?</i>

295
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,287
Wait!

296
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,747
<i>We're not even sure yet.</i>

297
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,165
<i>That's why we're doing this, remember?</i>

298
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,084
<i>We shall look upon the glorious dawn!</i>

299
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,837
<i>We shall look upon the glorious dawn!</i>

300
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,508
<i>We shall look upon the glorious dawn!</i>

301
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,385
So what if you're pregnant.

302
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,304
<i>So you'll stop for a year</i>

303
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,014
and you won't perform at the Dumaguete leg.

304
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,807
Fine, I'll fill in for you!

305
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,934
<i>I know all the lines anyway!</i>

306
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,352
<i>I'll be the lead!</i>

307
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,020
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

308
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,773
<i>On a serious note, Chris,</i>

309
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,317
<i>I think Joey's gonna be a good father.</i>

310
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,779
<i>Oh, sh*t!</i>

311
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,615
<i>Here it is.</i>

312
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,866
<i>Where? Let me see!</i>

313
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,617
<i>Let me see!</i>

314
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,409
<i>Let me see it.</i>

315
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,371
<i>Love, eat up.</i>

316
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,879
<i>Something you want to say?</i>

317
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,095
<i>Oh, sh*t!</i>

318
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,681
<i>I forgot I have a 9:00 a.m.</i>

319
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,266
<i>I'll go ahead, okay?</i>

320
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,810
<i>I'm sorry. Just eat.</i>

321
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,480
<i>Bye.</i>

322
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,655
That's right, stay on your phone!

323
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,491
<i>We'll finish all this on time if</i>
<i>you just stay on your phone!</i>

324
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,327
<i>Don't you see that humungous hole over there?</i>

325
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,870
<i>I told you, it's going to sink!</i>

326
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,540
<i>How many times do I have to tell you?</i>

327
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,085
<i>And you! What did I say? Project!</i>

328
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,003
<i>Yes, </i>Direk.

329
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,672
<i>Yeah, scratch your heads!</i>

330
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,008
<i>You all look sick!</i>

331
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,718
<i>Look at Chris.</i>

332
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,094
<i>Follow her!</i>

333
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,139
<i>Guys, I think something's wrong.</i>

334
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,225
What's happening? Are you okay?

335
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,309
We need help!

336
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,857
What's wrong Chris?

337
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,530
Sorry for your loss.

338
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,355
Chris?!

339
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,733
<i>Wake up.</i>

340
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,154
<i>Have some coffee.</i>

341
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,373
<i>Are you okay?</i>

342
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,084
<i>I'm okay. Thank you.</i>

343
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,779
<i>Love.</i>

344
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,740
<i>How are you?</i>

345
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,826
<i>All good.</i>

346
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,162
<i>Chris.</i>

347
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,397
<i>Love!</i>

348
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,199
<i>Love?</i>

349
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,789
<i>Love?</i>

350
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,151
<i>Are you saying it's all my fault?</i>

351
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:55,947
<i>One thing's for sure:</i>
<i>I didn't do anything wrong!</i>

352
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:01,202
<i>Jon! Jon!</i>

353
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:07,083
<i>Jon!</i>

354
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,180
<i>Brilliant!</i>

355
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,932
<i>Brilliant! You show off!</i>

356
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,476
<i>You monster!</i>

357
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,770
<i>Amazing.</i>

358
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,730
<i>That was a good one, Chris.</i>

359
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,856
<i>Not at all.</i>

360
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,149
<i>Alrighty. Take five!</i>

361
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,275
<i>Let's take five.</i>

362
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,276
- Direk
<i>- - Wait.</i>

363
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,612
<i>Great work, Cristina.</i>

364
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,198
<i>How was it?</i>

365
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,535
<i>I think he likes you.</i>

366
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,164
<i>Jed's a hottie,</i>
<i>I know you know it. He likes you.</i>

367
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,249
<i>Oh, please. I'm married to me!</i>

368
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,627
<i>Boring! Don't you get sick of it?</i>
<i>No fingerprints?</i>

369
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,254
<i>- Let me see. Let me see. Where?</i>
<i>- Here it is.</i>

370
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:54,839
<i>Here it is.</i>

371
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,341
<i>Eww!</i>

372
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,847
<i>Hi, sir Joey!</i>

373
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,681
<i>Good morning.</i>

374
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,892
<i>Did you manage to close the account</i>
<i>with the Austrians?</i>

375
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:06,684
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

376
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,727
<i>Very good.</i>

377
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,145
<i>Good morning, sir.</i>

378
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,480
<i>Good morning.</i>

379
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,565
<i>My meeting with the Go’s, all set?</i>

380
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,650
<i>Done and done.</i>

381
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,776
<i>Very good!</i>

382
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,902
<i>Anything else?</i>

383
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:16,778
<i>One more thing.</i>

384
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,281
<i>Welcome back!</i>

385
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,991
<i>And welcome to your matches, too.</i>

386
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,618
<i>Matches. Yeah.</i>

387
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,079
<i>Should I set a dinner date?</i>

388
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,123
<i>I-- I don't think so.</i>

389
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,291
<i>I mean, they're all the same.</i>

390
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,876
<i>Boring!</i>

391
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,044
<i>Just try.</i>

392
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,880
<i>You never know, your next match</i>
<i>might end up being your soulmate.</i>

393
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,049
<i>Let's see…</i>

394
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,555
<i>We're a match?</i>

395
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,148
<i>Did I hear it right?</i>

396
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,609
<i>You matched with your secretary</i>
<i> on the dating app?</i>

397
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,487
<i>Yana, I have to do something about these walls</i>

398
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:03,366
<i>because the whole floor seem to know</i>
<i>everything that goes on in my office.</i>

399
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,618
<i>I'm surprised you didn't swipe right on her.</i>

400
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,787
<i>You're not supposed to mix</i>
<i> business with pleasure.</i>

401
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,331
<i>But you know, it's weird that…</i>

402
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,458
<i>We--</i>

403
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,001
<i>We never--</i>

404
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,627
<i>We didn't match.</i>

405
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,760
<i>I'm not the type of person</i>
<i>who uses a dating app.</i>

406
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,387
<i>Hmm?</i>

407
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,892
<i>Welcome back.</i>

408
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,644
<i>Thank you.</i>

409
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,922
<i>You'll definitely love this play.</i>

410
00:29:58,922 --> 00:29:59,589
<i>You think so?</i>

411
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:05,678
<i>Two college sweethearts who</i>
<i>meet each other periodically</i>

412
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,764
<i>every year. I think.</i>

413
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,349
<i>Something like that!</i>

414
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:13,186
<i>It's supposed to be modern and minimalist.</i>

415
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,939
<i>And apparently,</i>
<i> it's gotten great reviews!</i>

416
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,774
<i>- Oh, thank you!</i>
<i>- This way please.</i>

417
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,526
<i>Wow! Nice!</i>

418
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,909
They say,

419
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:33,373
<i>that when you ever get the chance</i>
<i> to dance in the rain,</i>

420
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,708
<i>don't let it pass you by.</i>

421
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,254
<i>Once, I let the rain pass.</i>

422
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,340
<i>I was afraid to walk into it.</i>

423
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,969
I only saw a perilous storm
that would devour me.

424
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,595
<i>I've forgotten how beautiful,</i>

425
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:51,099
<i>the way it makes all things</i>
<i>bloom and open up to it.</i>

426
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:55,395
<i>The flowers, my heart.</i>

427
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,411
<i>If I could turn back time,</i>

428
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,540
I would dance in the rain with you.

429
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:22,005
<i>I'll let you take my hand.</i>

430
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:28,052
<i>And cherish the moment in every droplet.</i>

431
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:32,390
<i>With it, the downpour of our love.</i>

432
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:39,689
<i>Our hearts dancing in an eternal rain.</i>

433
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,529
<i>Thank you.</i>

434
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,906
<i>You're really famous now.</i>

435
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,116
<i>You've got fans now!</i>

436
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,784
<i>Please give it to her.</i>
<i> Thank you.</i>

437
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,078
<i>Phenomenal.</i>
<i> Who knew you were so good at this?</i>

438
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,288
<i>It was okay.</i>

439
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,831
<i>But did you see what I saw?</i>

440
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:57,915
<i>An apparition.</i>

441
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:00,001
<i>They're still there! Look!</i>

442
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,379
But here I am.

443
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:04,922
Standing in the shade.

444
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,509
Holding this love tightly inside my arms.

445
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,473
Pleading the clouds for the softest of rain.

446
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,767
A sliver of chance,

447
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,980
to let it all pour out again.

448
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,816
<i>Congrats, Chris.</i>

449
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,652
<i>- Well?</i>
<i>- Thanks.</i>

450
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,581
Bridge, wait.

451
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,625
They're still there! Look!

452
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,794
I really don't think it's a good idea.

453
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,421
Just one photo, I promise.

454
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,589
Bridge!

455
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,132
It'll be quick!

456
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,176
You guys were really incredible.

457
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,055
I could watch it over and over
and not get tired.

458
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,556
It was beautiful.

459
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,641
Let's go guys!

460
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,727
Look at our photos.

461
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,896
She's so pretty. It's unreal.

462
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:03,481
Look at her.

463
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,320
<i>Hey.</i>

464
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:11,447
<i>You wanna have dinner?</i>

465
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,658
<i>Hi.</i>

466
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:17,286
<i>I'm still writing, I'm sorry.</i>

467
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,831
<i>Come on.</i>

468
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,791
<i>Do you wanna be left here alone?</i>

469
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,794
<i>That's exactly what I'm going for.</i>

470
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,714
<i>Anyway, I'll go straight home in a bit.</i>

471
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,590
<i>I'll drive you.</i>

472
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,428
<i>Jed, it's okay. I'm good.</i>

473
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,637
<i>Okay.</i>

474
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,555
<i>All right.</i>

475
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,140
<i>Okay.</i>

476
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,751
<i>Morning!</i>

477
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,801
<i>Like clockwork?</i>

478
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,678
<i>Like clockwork.</i>

479
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,314
<i>Don't bother saving that.</i>
<i>Throw it out.</i>

480
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,843
<i>There he goes again.</i>

481
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,845
<i>Online shopping.</i>

482
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,181
<i>What on earth are you talking about, Vivian?</i>

483
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,935
<i>Gorgeous, hot, sexy…</i>

484
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,144
<i>Add to cart!</i>

485
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,940
<i>Ugly, boring… delete.</i>

486
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,151
<i>Wow. Coming from you?</i>
<i>Like you're not a hustler yourself.</i>

487
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,444
<i>But sir,</i>

488
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:17,573
<i>us girls, all we're looking for is true love.</i>

489
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,117
<i>What about you?</i>
<i> What's your goal?</i>

490
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,036
<i>Nothing. To have fun.</i>

491
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,287
<i>I guess the rumours are true, then.</i>

492
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:27,875
<i>They say since you broke up</i>
<i>with your ex and you left for Germany,</i>

493
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,710
<i>you turned into an "F" boy.</i>

494
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,005
<i>From soft boy to f**k boy.</i>

495
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,886
<i>Excuse me. Where are you even</i>
<i>coming up with this basis of yours?</i>

496
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:42,056
<i>In case you forgot, I'm the one</i>
<i>setting up your dates every night.</i>

497
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,809
<i>Oh, right.</i>

498
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,187
<i>What happened to the last one</i>
<i> I set you up with?</i>

499
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:49,856
<i>Which one?</i>

500
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,693
<i>Okay, yeah, we went out a few times.</i>

501
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,486
<i>But she wasn't feeling it, I think.</i>

502
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:04,537
<i>But if ma'am Yana's your destiny,</i>
<i>I think I can get on board.</i>

503
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,170
<i>I knew it.</i>

504
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,302
<i>Vivian. Remind me to fire you.</i>

505
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,182
<i>Bro, it's Jonjie's birthday.</i>
<i> Let's drink!</i>

506
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,633
<i>Joey?!</i>

507
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,259
<i>Chris?!</i>

508
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,845
<i>You're back together?!</i>

509
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,512
I'm sorry.

510
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,680
No. Don't say sorry.

511
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,932
It's okay.

512
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,308
<i>Did you miss me?</i>

513
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,770
<i>I don't know why I did that.</i>

514
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,272
<i>And I'm not even drunk yet.</i>

515
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,983
<i>It's-- It's very you.</i>

516
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,026
<i>It's very Chris.</i>

517
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,154
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

518
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,114
<i>Impulsive.</i>

519
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,491
<i>Emotional.</i>

520
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,201
<i>So you.</i>

521
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,747
<i>Yeah, well, three years ago,</i>
<i>it would have been cute.</i>

522
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,666
<i>But now,</i>

523
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,335
<i>it's just a little bit immature.</i>

524
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,839
<i>I think everyone's immature.</i>

525
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,842
<i>You just get better at hiding it.</i>

526
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:44,595
<i>Yeah.</i>

527
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,182
<i>That's it?</i>

528
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,602
<i>Just because your dad told you</i>
<i> to break up with me?</i>

529
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,105
<i>I already told you this before.</i>

530
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:57,984
<i>How many drinks have you had?</i>

531
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,818
<i>I'm stressed.</i>

532
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,362
<i>You know how I am with my beer</i>
<i> when I'm stressed.</i>

533
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,699
<i>What we have,</i>
<i> we have for the mean time.</i>

534
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,200
<i>We can't drag this out.</i>

535
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,412
<i>What do you think I am, a**hole?</i>
<i>A computer shop?</i>

536
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,579
<i>Pay per hour?</i>

537
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,456
<i>You had the right idea.</i>

538
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,375
<i>Break up with me. Go on!</i>

539
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,044
<i>Oi!</i>

540
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,380
<i>Carlo.</i>

541
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:20,756
<i>Carlo!</i>

542
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:21,841
<i>Hey!</i>

543
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,676
<i>This isn't over!</i>

544
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,927
<i>Where are you going? Hey! Hey!</i>

545
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,471
<i>We're not done talking, Carlo!</i>

546
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,056
<i>Hey! Carlo!</i>

547
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,391
<i>F**k you!</i>

548
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:31,726
<i>F**k you!</i>

549
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,103
<i>You f**king a**hole!</i>

550
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:35,438
<i>F**k!</i>

551
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,814
<i>S**t!</i>

552
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,447
<i>Carlo!</i>

553
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,408
<i>I was only joking.</i>

554
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,956
<i>Fantastic timing.</i>

555
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:02,882
<i>Who are you?</i>

556
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:03,966
<i>Come up.</i>

557
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:19,815
<i>You poor thing.</i>

558
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:20,608
<i>Thank you.</i>

559
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,069
What is up with men, huh?

560
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,529
The second they get what they want,

561
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,991
they simply discard you like…

562
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,326
like trash.

563
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,619
<i>Men are trash.</i>

564
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,244
<i>Do you agree?</i>

565
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:37,833
<i>I don't think that's true for all men.</i>

566
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:41,295
<i>You've probably never been hurt before.</i>

567
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,964
Why so you have a Pikachu umbrella?

568
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,008
Is it emasculating to own one?

569
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,344
I don't think so.

570
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,263
Everything is a matter of perspective.

571
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,307
Oh? So you're a life coach?

572
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,935
I'm not a life coach,

573
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:58,729
but I'm pretty sure you're gonna move on.

574
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:02,399
<i>Before you act like a damn expert</i>
<i> and give out advice,</i>

575
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,400
<i>who the hell are you?</i>

576
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,111
<i>I don't even know your name.</i>

577
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,487
<i>Ah, right.</i>

578
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:08,989
<i>Joey.</i>

579
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,034
<i>Christina.</i>

580
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,410
<i>Chris.</i>

581
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,551
<i>You still remember that?</i>

582
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,803
<i>Of course. Don't tell me </i>
<i>you don't remember?</i>

583
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:31,929
<i>Want me to remind you?</i>

584
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,263
<i>Yeah, how?</i>

585
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:32,888
<i>I could act it out.</i>

586
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:33,514
<i>Sure, yes.</i>

587
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:34,598
<i>Carlo?</i>

588
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,394
<i>Carlo, wait! Please! </i>
<i>Wait for me! This isn't over!</i>

589
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,353
<i>We're not done yet!</i>

590
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,187
<i>Come back!</i>

591
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:40,604
<i>You know,</i>

592
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,731
<i>You f**king a**hole!</i>

593
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:46,360
<i>You know, there's a reason</i>
<i>I'm the actor between us.</i>

594
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,695
<i>Why, of course! That's why</i>
<i>I'm a big fan of yours!</i>

595
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,863
<i>Idol!</i>

596
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,573
<i>I like it.</i>

597
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:51,949
<i>Like what?</i>

598
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,326
<i>My acting?</i>

599
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,245
<i>No, you've loosened up!</i>

600
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,795
<i>Thanks for</i>

601
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,549
<i>…for whatever this is.</i>

602
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,217
<i>Reunion?</i>

603
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,553
<i>Wow, reunion?</i>

604
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,096
<i>Fine. For the kiss, okay?</i>

605
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:14,889
<i>Thanks for the kiss.</i>

606
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,598
<i>Thank you also.</i>

607
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:19,351
<i>But I have a 6:00 a.m.
tomorrow in Baguio.</i>

608
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,145
<i>Rehearsals. Super early.</i>

609
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,731
<i>You're an early bird now? 6:00 a.m.?</i>

610
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,733
<i>That used to be your bedtime!</i>

611
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:31,155
<i>Yep. Well, we grow older,</i>
<i>but not necessarily wiser.</i>

612
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,281
<i>That's life.</i>

613
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:33,824
<i>Mm. Yeah.</i>

614
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,455
<i>I have a 6:00 a.m.</i>

615
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,123
<i>Okay, nevermind.</i>

616
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,918
<i>- Bro, you all right?
- We're great bro.</i>

617
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,502
<i>Girl!</i>

618
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:47,588
<i>Happy birthday, girl!</i>

619
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,173
<i>Chris, one for the road.</i>

620
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,466
<i>You mean a photo?</i>

621
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,343
<i>- Of you two.
- Us two?</i>

622
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,511
<i>Come on, let's have a look.</i>

623
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,140
<i>Say "Jonjie!"</i>

624
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,642
<i> Jonjie!</i>

625
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,105
<i>Guys, sorry. I have to go.</i>

626
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,607
<i>My carpool's here.</i>

627
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,317
<i>Jonj, happy birthday.</i>

628
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:09,902
<i>Bye.</i>

629
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,362
<i>Should I walk you?</i>

630
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,906
<i>I unblocked you.</i>

631
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,578
<i>Friends?</i>

632
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:21,956
<i>Friends.</i>

633
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:22,873
<i>Bye.</i>

634
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:23,540
<i>Take care.</i>

635
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,043
<i>Sleep early.</i>

636
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,422
<i>Hi there!</i>

637
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,424
<i>Ah, hi!</i>

638
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,759
<i>Nice to see you!</i>

639
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:35,678
Say cheese!

640
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,889
<i>No photos please.</i>

641
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,848
<i>Alright, bro!</i>

642
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,101
<i>Let's drink!</i>

643
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:42,977
<i>Sure?</i>

644
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:43,644
<i>Yes.</i>

645
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,312
<i>Aren't you driving?</i>

646
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,737
<i>I can't believe you still have that.</i>

647
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,452
<i>You're still using it.</i>

648
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:04,081
<i>Irreplaceable like me? Hahaha</i>

649
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,712
<i>Chris!</i>

650
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,797
<i>Did you get to that audition?</i>

651
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,715
<i>What's it to you?</i>

652
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,967
<i>Hmmmm...</i>

653
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,428
<i>A little hot-headed, are we?</i>

654
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,054
<i>Lighten up a bit.</i>

655
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,600
<i>Huh?</i>

656
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,152
<i>I'll pick you up later.</i>

657
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:37,197
<i>Why? What's up?</i>

658
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,994
<i>Yes!</i>

659
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,412
<i>I've got it.</i>

660
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:47,291
<i>Okay, uh, sir Don? You're up.</i>

661
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,375
<i>Sorry.</i>

662
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,336
<i>You just got in?</i>

663
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:50,878
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

664
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,921
<i>Here's your number. </i>
<i>Please wait for your cue.</i>

665
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,131
<i>Go ahead, sir.</i>

666
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,931
<i>See you!</i>

667
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,569
<i>Next one. Christina Roxas.</i>

668
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,196
<i>All right. Okay.</i>

669
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,614
<i>Miss Chris it's your turn.</i>

670
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,157
<i>Good afternoon!</i>

671
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:21,742
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

672
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,329
<i>If anyone here has any objections</i>

673
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,414
<i>before the wedding,</i>

674
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,041
<i>this is your chance.</i>

675
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,504
<i>I object!</i>

676
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,172
<i>Stop this wedding!</i>

677
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,926
<i>Stop this wedding at once!</i>

678
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,304
<i>Stop this wedding!</i>

679
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:48,394
<i>In fairness.</i>

680
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,562
<i>Not bad. I'm impressed.</i>

681
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,898
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

682
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,400
However…

683
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,403
Chris wait.

684
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,448
We're really looking for someone…

685
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,617
…relatable.

686
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:09,998
<i>No pressure.</i>

687
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,501
<i>Kiss me.</i>

688
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,588
<i>But don't you dare fall in love with me.</i>

689
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:18,757
<i>So there.</i>

690
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,843
<i>From a noon time show, upscale</i>

691
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,469
<i>... and very popular.</i>

692
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:26,432
<i>We're actually looking</i>
<i>for someone who's a bit more…</i>

693
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,185
<i> …reachable!</i>

694
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,980
<i>Can I borrow this?</i>

695
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,774
<i>Didn't you put that in your mouth?</i>

696
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:37,067
<i>Give me a sec.</i>

697
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:40,237
<i>Hello! How's it going you guys?</i>

698
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,030
<i>Hang in there!</i>

699
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,199
<i>Keep going!</i>

700
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,452
<i>Why did it turn into a comedy?</i>

701
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,162
<i>Keep it serious.</i>

702
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,290
<i>You have a pretty face!</i>

703
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,084
<i>Unbelievably so, </i>
<i>but you're still giving mestiza.</i>

704
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,795
<i>All right, I'll give you Morena.</i>

705
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,213
<i>National artist!</i>

706
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,345
<i>There's no--</i>

707
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,513
<i>Chance!</i>

708
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,056
<i>Not a chance!</i>

709
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,100
<i>So can you shut it? Enough!</i>

710
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,226
<i>Okay?</i>

711
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,230
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

712
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,024
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

713
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,402
Next! Erwin, bring in the next one.

714
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,907
She's making my blood rise. Jesus.

715
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,756
<i>What?</i>

716
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,633
<i>My Pikachu's gotten bigger.</i>

717
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,123
<i>Your steamed siomai.</i>

718
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,375
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

719
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,292
<i>The sauce.</i>

720
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,710
<i>- Thanks.</i>
<i>- You still remember?</i>

721
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,962
<i>Of course.</i>

722
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,088
<i>It's your favorite.</i>

723
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,966
<i>Okay. Let's see.</i>

724
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:25,634
<i>- What does it say?</i>
<i>- It says…</i>

725
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:30,639
<i>"The best things in life are free,</i>
<i>but you can't have it all."</i>

726
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,143
Isn't that weird?

727
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,938
The best things in life are free

728
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,983
<i>but the one thing you desire most</i>

729
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,901
<i>will never be yours.</i>

730
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,445
<i>You could say that "best thing"</i>

731
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,906
<i>was never meant for you.</i>

732
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,451
<i>Or that you've had it once</i>

733
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,413
<i>but you let it slip away.</i>

734
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,833
Or you thought it was the best thing,

735
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,252
turns out he's an a**hole.

736
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,880
<i>You've been attracting a**holes?</i>

737
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,135
<i>I don't know, but I've met a few.</i>

738
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,137
<i>Different exes.</i>

739
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:10,887
<i>Yes.</i>

740
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,598
<i>Like Mark.</i>

741
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,057
My co-actor.

742
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,642
I thought we would get along

743
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,394
because we had the same passions.

744
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,314
But he suffered from insecurity.

745
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,649
What about you?

746
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:23,692
<i>Me?</i>

747
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,526
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

748
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,402
<i>Marga.</i>

749
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:26,695
<i>Marga?</i>

750
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,779
She was perfect.

751
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,282
She wasn't fussy or dramatic,

752
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,700
not clingy.

753
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,410
She knew how to cook,

754
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,412
she's smart.

755
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:35,913
Wow.

756
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,623
There's just a small problem.

757
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,123
No big deal.

758
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:38,999
What?

759
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,835
Three-timer. With my friends, too.

760
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,462
<i>Three?</i>

761
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,171
<i>Three.</i>

762
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,464
<i>Not, two--</i>

763
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,090
<i>But three?!</i>

764
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:47,883
<i>Yeah.</i>

765
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,176
<i>Wow.</i>

766
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,469
<i>- That's life.
- Amazing!</i>

767
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,849
Isn't that what you wanted?

768
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,725
Just go on dates,

769
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,018
... no commitment.

770
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,688
<i>I thought so, too.</i>

771
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,858
<i>But eventually, I realized that</i>

772
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:08,820
<i>I want a meaningful relationship.</i>

773
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:14,576
Whereas she just wanted to mess around.

774
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,164
She runs away from her responsibilities.

775
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:36,890
<i>Man, all we talked about</i>
<i>were our exes all day.</i>

776
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,726
<i>I think we should stop. Move on.</i>

777
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,479
<i>Sounds like a collection of bloopers, huh?</i>

778
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:46,566
<i>But at the time,</i>
<i> we were pretty banged up.</i>

779
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,070
<i>We were pretty silly.</i>

780
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:59,413
<i>Do you think it's true</i>
<i>what they say about exes</i>

781
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,873
<i>who stay friends--</i>

782
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:09,673
<i>That it's either they still love each other</i>

783
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,508
<i>... or</i>

784
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:20,183
<i>they never really loved</i>
<i>each other in the first place.</i>

785
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,187
<i>I think…</i>

786
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,525
<i>You first.</i>

787
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,361
<i>What do you think?</i>

788
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,281
<i>I believe…</i>

789
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:41,246
<i>I believe there's still love</i>
<i> somewhere there.</i>

790
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,126
<i>Because after a relationship ends,</i>

791
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,087
<i>where does it all go?</i>

792
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:53,133
<i>All the love that you poured</i>
<i> into one person?</i>

793
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,802
<i>It's not like a faucet</i>

794
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,388
<i>you can turn off when you're done.</i>

795
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,356
<i>Even though it's been so long?</i>

796
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,986
<i>Even though it's still painful.</i>

797
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,697
<i>Do you want to talk about something?</i>

798
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,285
<i>No. Nothing.</i>

799
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:21,703
<i>Nothing?</i>

800
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:26,333
<i>Nothing.</i>

801
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:29,711
<i>Come on, Joey.</i>

802
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,340
<i>Let's talk.</i>
<i> Isn't that what you want?</i>

803
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:34,716
<i>I said no.</i>

804
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:38,887
<i>F**k this.</i>

805
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,308
<i>Yes, f**k this!</i>

806
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:44,810
<i>F**k this!</i>

807
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,605
<i>You want to get mad at me, right?</i>

808
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,357
<i>You want to swear at me?</i>

809
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,819
<i>Go ahead. Let it out. </i>
<i>Blame it on me!</i>

810
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,005
<i>Why?</i>

811
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:17,843
<i>Why?</i>

812
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,178
<i>Why?</i>

813
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,596
<i>Because I can't!</i>

814
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,726
<i>Because I'm not ready!</i>

815
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,897
<i>Because I'm scared!</i>

816
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:33,984
<i>I’m scared!</i>

817
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,154
<i>You got scared?</i>

818
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,156
<i>That's it?</i>

819
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,033
<i>What about me?</i>

820
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,287
<i>I had a right to know!</i>

821
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,414
<i>That was my baby, too!</i>

822
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,252
<i>You know I wanted to have a family, right?</i>

823
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:57,966
<i>You told me you wanted a complete family</i>
<i>because you came from a broken one.</i>

824
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,093
<i>We were on the way there, Chris!</i>

825
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,386
<i>Why?</i>

826
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:08,727
<i>Don't I have the right to think about</i>
<i>what I want for my f**king life first?</i>

827
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,477
<i>We're back to what you want.</i>

828
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:10,979
<i>You're so f**king selfish.</i>

829
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,023
<i>- It's always you!</i>
<i>- I didn't want this.</i>

830
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,526
<i>I didn't want to lose the baby!</i>

831
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,031
<i>It's always you.</i>

832
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,365
<i>It's always about you.</i>

833
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,992
<i>Always-- Selfish.</i>

834
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,285
<i>Always? Always about me?</i>

835
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,245
<i>Weren't you leaving for Germany?</i>

836
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,081
<i>You made plans without telling me.</i>

837
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:31,458
<i>So what is this?</i>

838
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,542
<i>Who's selfish now?</i>

839
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,253
<i>So you didn't tell me for what?</i>

840
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,338
<i>You were getting back at me?</i>

841
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,175
<i>This isn't going anywhere.</i>

842
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,844
<i>There we go! </i>
<i>This is what you do.</i>

843
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,054
<i>Dismissive!</i>

844
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,098
<i>You don't want to have </i>
<i>the hard conversations!</i>

845
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:49,392
<i>We shouldn't have lived together.</i>

846
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,563
<i>We get this false idea</i>
<i>that we're ready to have a family.</i>

847
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,524
<i>This is not even f**king official.</i>

848
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,739
<i>Yeah.</i>

849
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,909
<i>Yeah, this isn't official.</i>

850
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,161
<i>F**k.</i>

851
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,335
<i>We're not on stage, Chris.</i>

852
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,631
<i>This is real life.</i>

853
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:03,758
Where is this going?

854
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:09,472
I'm not sure what's going on

855
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:16,521
I'm looking for answers

856
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:19,858
<i>Oops. Joey!</i>

857
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,151
<i>Sorry.</i>

858
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,737
<i>- Easy.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

859
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,155
<i>Let me get that.</i>

860
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:29,743
<i>Hold on to me.</i>

861
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,493
<i>Lean over.</i>

862
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,957
<i>- Thank you, Chris.</i>
<i>- Hold on to me.</i>

863
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,589
<i>Hang on.</i>

864
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,012
<i>Come on, lie down.</i>

865
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,263
<i>Okay.</i>

866
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,477
<i>- Chris, thank you.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

867
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:56,853
<i>Sorry.</i>

868
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,272
<i>Chris!</i>

869
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,072
<i>Is it stinky?</i>

870
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:10,825
<i>Joey.</i>

871
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:11,826
<i>Thank you.</i>

872
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,827
<i>I'm going home.</i>

873
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,120
<i>Huh?</i>

874
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,080
<i>I'll go ahead.</i>

875
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:16,790
<i>No.</i>

876
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,582
<i>It's all good.</i>

877
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:18,875
<i>No, wait.</i>

878
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,126
<i>Wait!</i>

879
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,920
<i>I need to go.</i>

880
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,380
<i>Hang on. Wait.</i>

881
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,298
<i>Wait.</i>

882
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,593
<i>Wait.</i>

883
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:50,907
your arms wrapped around me

884
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:57,247
Even if none of this is real anymore

885
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:03,002
I can understand

886
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:08,758
if you're fed up,
if you want something else

887
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:14,389
Don't worry

888
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,101
I'm fine

889
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:23,481
to wrap your arms around me

890
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:30,029
Even if none of this is real anymore

891
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:35,994
I understand,

892
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:41,499
I know you're fed up,
go where you're happy

893
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:46,462
Don't worry about me

894
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:52,343
I'm ready to forget you

895
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:57,599
I'm fine

896
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:03,813
I'll be fine

897
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,819
I'll stay right here

898
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:15,116
I'll be fine

899
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:07,353
<i>Chris?</i>

900
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:09,522
<i>Chris?!</i>

901
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,275
<i>Chris!</i>

902
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,278
<i>Chris!</i>

903
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:19,824
<i>Chris!</i>

904
01:00:20,616 --> 01:00:22,076
<i>Chris! What's wrong?</i>

905
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:23,953
<i>Chris!</i>

906
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,371
<i>Where are you going?</i>

907
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,039
<i>Home.</i>

908
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,167
<i>Why? Just like that? </i>
<i>What about last night?</i>

909
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,753
<i>Chris!</i>

910
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:34,630
<i>Last night?</i>

911
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,132
<i>F**k!</i>

912
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:38,676
<i>Last night?</i>

913
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:40,094
<i>Yes!</i>

914
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,054
<i>Just s*x.</i>

915
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,139
<i>F**k.</i>

916
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,019
<i>Tell me what's going on, Chris!</i>

917
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:51,814
<i>Chris!</i>

918
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,470
<i>Hey, Chris, where are you?
Please. Talk to me.</i>

919
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,680
<i>Let's meet. Where are you?
Let's talk.</i>

920
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,145
<i>Chris Roxas.</i>
<i>Answer me please. Let's talk.</i>

921
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:37,944
<i>Let's meet at the cafe.
Please talk to me.</i>

922
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,200
<i>I'm begging you.
Please pick up the phone.</i>

923
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,499
<i>Am I an idiot?</i>

924
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,750
<i>Yes.</i>

925
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,171
<i>Really? You know it for a fact?</i>

926
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,382
<i>I just answered your question.</i>

927
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,429
<i>Am I a mistress?</i>

928
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,182
<i>Mm… Well, yes.</i>

929
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,393
<i>And no.</i>

930
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:20,027
<i>No? And yes?</i>

931
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:28,744
<i>No, because he didn't tell you.</i>

932
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:29,871
Yes

933
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,709
<i>because he is committed</i>
<i>to Y and you are his ex.</i>

934
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:40,840
<i>F**k.</i>

935
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,552
<i>I'm such a s**t.</i>

936
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,512
<i>Hell, yeah. That's why we're friends.</i>

937
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:50,558
<i>Oh, s**t!</i>

938
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,436
<i>Wrong! Wrong move!</i>

939
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:59,358
<i>I knew it was a bad idea</i>
<i>from the start. That was it!</i>

940
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,402
<i>What? The s*x?</i>

941
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:03,070
<i>Yes!</i>

942
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:07,617
<i>Then I unblocked him</i>

943
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,786
<i>and we became friends again.</i>

944
01:03:10,786 --> 01:03:12,121
<i>Because it's--</i>

945
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:15,917
<i>It's supposed to be a closed book.</i>

946
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,878
<i>I should have left it that way.</i>

947
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:23,466
<i>Then this wouldn't have happened.</i>

948
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:29,639
<i>Maybe there's a reason why you guys reconnected.</i>

949
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:34,185
<i>So we can get back together?</i>

950
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,562
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

951
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,023
<i>The dude's got a girlfriend now.</i>

952
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:42,568
<i>Or do you want me to push you</i>
<i>just because you're my bestfriend?</i>

953
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,987
Don't be like that?

954
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:49,784
<i>Why are you sulking?</i>
<i>Is he yours? He's not yours.</i>

955
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:52,620
<i>You're gonna get jealous?</i>
<i>Get depressed?</i>

956
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,580
<i>You'll lock yourself up in your room,</i>
<i> you won't eat?</i>

957
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,624
<i>Your mom's gonna ask for you</i>
<i> and you won't answer?</i>

958
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,001
<i>Then we'll panic,</i>
<i> and you'll unalive yourself?</i>

959
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,294
<i>Then we'll bury you?</i>

960
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:06,175
<i>Bury me?</i>
<i> Can't you say a eulogy first?</i>

961
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,222
<i>We're out of budget.</i>

962
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,099
<i>Wake's one day, that's it.</i>

963
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:34,495
<i>Someone's at the door.</i>

964
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,914
<i>Chris is in here!</i>

965
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,541
Chris, I know you're there.

966
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:42,545
Chris.

967
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:50,094
Chris.

968
01:04:50,886 --> 01:04:53,889
<i>What's the matter?</i>
<i> Get out there.</i>

969
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:56,851
Let's talk, please.

970
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,185
<i>Go, talk to him!</i>

971
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,983
<i>Chris, please.</i>
<i> I know you're there.</i>

972
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,110
But seriously,

973
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:12,867
<i>have you ever thought about…</i>

974
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,493
<i>What is this all about?</i>

975
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,496
<i>Meaning?</i>

976
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:23,252
<i>Maybe you like how comfortable</i>
<i>you are around him.</i>

977
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,587
<i>Or you're freeling guilty.</i>

978
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:29,133
<i>Or maybe you have unfinished</i>
<i>business with each other.</i>

979
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,595
<i>Unfinished business?</i>

980
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:33,971
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

981
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:36,849
<i>Like a ghost?</i>

982
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,227
<i>You're not making any sense.</i>

983
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,982
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

984
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,778
<i>You do. Right?</i>

985
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:55,910
<i>Let's drink. Take a shot-- Our shot.</i>

986
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,622
<i>Let's drink some more.</i>

987
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:03,167
<i>One for the booking!</i>

988
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:07,505
<i>Chris, please. Let's talk.</i>

989
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,442
<i>Ha-ha-ha-Ha! Ha! Happy Birthday!</i>

990
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:15,156
<i>Happy Birthday!</i>

991
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:18,534
<i>- Happy Birthday!</i>
<i>- Happy bithday, honey!</i>

992
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,370
<i>Blow your candle!</i>

993
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,664
<i>Make a wish!</i>

994
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,756
<i>Thank you, Ma.</i>

995
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,174
<i>- Thank you!</i>
<i>- Of course!</i>

996
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,341
<i>My goodness.</i>

997
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:37,052
<i>Don't you have school later?</i>

998
01:07:37,052 --> 01:07:38,554
<i>How can I not worry?</i>

999
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,848
<i>You haven't been on social media for days.</i>

1000
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:43,726
<i>And we all know that without proof of life online,</i>

1001
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,603
<i>you might as well be dead!</i>

1002
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:46,228
<i>Yeah.</i>

1003
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:49,815
<i>Ah! Sis, can I do a livestream?</i>

1004
01:07:49,815 --> 01:07:53,486
<i>I've got followers requesting me</i>
<i> to introduce my family.</i>

1005
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,361
<i>Really now?</i>

1006
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,530
<i>Your sister looks like a wet rag</i>
<i> and you want to film?</i>

1007
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,907
What? You totally don't!

1008
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,492
Never!

1009
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,244
<i>Hey, guys! Welcome to my mini vlog.</i>

1010
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,872
and for today,
we're here at my sister's condo.

1011
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:05,331
<i>Yeah!</i>

1012
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,749
<i>To do an intervention!</i>

1013
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,959
<i>Because she hasn't left her room in two weeks!</i>

1014
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:13,547
<i>- Hey! Why do you have to tell them that?</i>
<i>- Isn't that awful? Sulking in her room for two weeks!</i>

1015
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:14,924
<i>And it's her birthday, too!</i>

1016
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,509
<i>Oh! By the way,</i>

1017
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:22,681
<i>I got her this Juicy Lushy bath and foot scrub</i>
<i>so when she gets in the shower later--</i>

1018
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,809
<i>If she gets in the shower,</i>

1019
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:26,602
<i>she'll be squeaky clean!</i>

1020
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,312
<i>Influencer?</i>

1021
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:29,897
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

1022
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:32,608
<i>The script.</i>

1023
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:35,361
<i>- This is yours.</i>
<i>- I'll help you.</i>

1024
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,696
<i>Here.</i>

1025
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:44,328
<i>Your girl's going through something.</i>

1026
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,873
<i>But she said she's coming today.</i>

1027
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,376
<i>Let's talk later.</i>

1028
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,900
<i>Facebook official.</i>

1029
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:20,948
<i>Go be happy then.</i>

1030
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,368
Hi!

1031
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:26,453
Guys, let's welcome Chris back to the show!

1032
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:28,664
<i>Welcome back, Chris!</i>

1033
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,748
<i>Hello!</i>

1034
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:31,333
<i>Give her a script.</i>

1035
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,001
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>

1036
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,253
<i>As I was saying...</i>

1037
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:54,940
Happy birthday to you!

1038
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,360
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

1039
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:06,285
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

1040
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:10,873
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

1041
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,666
<i>Thank you.</i>

1042
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:13,626
<i>Thank you, </i>Direk.

1043
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:14,627
<i>Make a wish.</i>

1044
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:17,379
<i>A wish?</i>

1045
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:24,511
<i>Thank you.</i>

1046
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,472
<i>Thank you. Wow!</i>

1047
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,140
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

1048
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,559
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

1049
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,019
<i>Thank you, Jed.</i>

1050
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:33,562
<i>- You're in a good mood.</i>
<i>- I guess.</i>

1051
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:35,773
<i>Wait, hang on.</i>

1052
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,483
<i>Can you zip it?</i>

1053
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,944
Easy on the chatter.

1054
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:41,737
<i>We still have read-through later.</i>

1055
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,405
<i>Save your energy!</i>

1056
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:45,783
<i>Babe.</i>

1057
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,910
<i>Save your energy babe!</i>

1058
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:54,291
<i>Rich coming from someone</i>
<i>who flirts on their phone all day.</i>

1059
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,522
<i>What, no way. I'm the true queen.</i>

1060
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:17,982
<i>Noel and I are going strong for four years.</i>

1061
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:21,485
<i>For four years,</i>
<i> he's been pumping me full of love.</i>

1062
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:22,569
<i>Hey...</i>

1063
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:26,240
I've got a photo exhibit this Friday.

1064
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,075
<i>You two come, please.</i>

1065
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:29,243
<i>Please.</i>

1066
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,706
<i>Yes!</i>

1067
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,751
<i>Help yourself.</i>

1068
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:38,669
<i>Okay.</i>

1069
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:49,304
<i>Go on, be like that.</i>
<i> You don't want to?</i>

1070
01:11:49,304 --> 01:11:51,640
<i>It's not that I don't want to.</i>

1071
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:56,770
<i>Chris, support me for once.</i>

1072
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,648
<i>Support your local artist, bestfriend.</i>

1073
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:02,526
<i>Classic emotional blackmail.</i>

1074
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:04,987
<i>Hold up, I'm not blackmailing anyone.</i>

1075
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,447
<i>I thought you were fine?</i>

1076
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,365
<i>I thought you've moved on?</i>

1077
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:10,034
<i>You're even wearing boho today.</i>

1078
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:13,037
<i>Is it all for show, then?</i>

1079
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:19,084
<i>I just haven't figured out how to explain</i>
<i>to him everything that's happened.</i>

1080
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:19,960
<i>How?</i>

1081
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,211
<i>Why do you need to explain?</i>

1082
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:25,257
<i>You don't need to justify why</i>
<i>after having a very good s*x,</i>

1083
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:27,342
<i>you just vanished.</i>

1084
01:12:27,342 --> 01:12:29,720
<i>Maybe you just need to be there for him</i>

1085
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,805
<i>and show him that you're not into him.</i>

1086
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:35,225
<i>Show him that you have moved on.</i>

1087
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:57,372
We were laughing because the whole
conversation... It was so...

1088
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,125
Wait, wait. Sorry.

1089
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,503
<i>But girls, you have to meet Alex.</i>

1090
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,462
<i>Yeah.</i>

1091
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:06,340
<i>Speaking. Alex!</i>

1092
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,425
<i>Jonj!</i>

1093
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,844
<i>Oh, thank you. Thank you.</i>

1094
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:12,304
<i>Damn, Alex.</i>

1095
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:13,972
<i>Your photos are so fantastic.</i>

1096
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:15,265
<i>So moving.</i>

1097
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:18,852
<i>Wait, let's take a selfie </i>
<i>before you get famous.</i>

1098
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:23,649
<i>Love it.</i>

1099
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:24,274
<i>Finally.</i>

1100
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:25,609
<i>I believe in your talent.</i>

1101
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:26,985
<i>I wore a parachute for you today.</i>

1102
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:27,945
<i>For your exhibit.</i>

1103
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:31,031
<i>And I made sure </i>
<i>I invited all my friends.</i>

1104
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:32,032
<i>Yes!</i>

1105
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:33,117
<i>Who did you say were coming?</i>

1106
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,910
<i>Big people.</i>

1107
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,286
<i>- Alex.</i>
<i>- Oh, hey.</i>

1108
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:37,454
<i>Congratulations, brother.</i>

1109
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:38,705
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

1110
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:39,957
<i>It's nice to see you.</i>

1111
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:40,958
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

1112
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,626
<i>Jonjie.</i>

1113
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:43,961
<i>Hello.</i>

1114
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,546
<i>You two know each other?</i>

1115
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,464
<i>Yeah.</i>

1116
01:13:47,464 --> 01:13:48,632
<i>We go a long way back.</i>

1117
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:49,591
<i>Yeah?</i>

1118
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,844
<i>He's the one who invited me here tonight.</i>

1119
01:13:52,427 --> 01:13:54,012
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hello!</i>

1120
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:55,514
<i>Babe, let me just get us drinks.</i>

1121
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,641
<i>- Yes, please. Get one for me, too.</i>
<i>- Yes, yes.</i>

1122
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,519
<i>- Jonjie!</i>
<i>- Yes?</i>

1123
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,438
<i>We have a problem?</i>

1124
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:02,938
<i>What?!</i>

1125
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:04,273
<i>How you feeling?</i>

1126
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,107
<i>Here's the thing…</i>

1127
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:10,696
<i>I'm having second thoughts.</i>
<i>I don't know if this is the right time?</i>

1128
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:12,865
<i>Maybe it's too early.</i>

1129
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:15,367
<i>Maybe I should wait </i>
<i>for a better time?</i>

1130
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:18,579
<i>This isn't my night.</i>
<i>It's your night, not mine.</i>

1131
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,497
<i>Is it for them?</i>

1132
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:22,166
<i>It's for you.</i>

1133
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:26,211
<i>Besides, everything's in place.</i>
<i>You can't back out now.</i>

1134
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:27,921
<i>- It's now or never, bro.</i>
<i>- Jonj.</i>

1135
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,549
<i>Oh!</i>

1136
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,096
<i>Here comes the woman who'll</i>
<i>get our show sold out.</i>

1137
01:14:36,096 --> 01:14:37,055
Alex, this is Chris.

1138
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:38,348
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Oh, thank you.</i>

1139
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:40,350
<i>Chris, this is Alex.</i>

1140
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,685
<i>That's my bestfriend right there.</i>

1141
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:43,061
<i>Hi. Nice to meet you.</i>

1142
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,271
<i>- Hi, Chris.</i>
<i>- Hi!</i>

1143
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:46,398
<i>How are you?</i>

1144
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,025
<i>All good.</i>

1145
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,485
<i>Babe.</i>

1146
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,070
<i>Thank you.</i>

1147
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,363
<i>Chris!</i>

1148
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:55,157
<i>- Hi!</i>
<i>- How are you?</i>

1149
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:56,909
<i>Nice to see you!</i>

1150
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:57,951
<i>Long time, huh?</i>

1151
01:14:57,951 --> 01:15:00,329
<i>- We haven't seen each other in ages!</i>
<i>- I know!</i>

1152
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,206
<i>- You look great!</i>
<i>- Oh, you too.</i>

1153
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,332
<i>Super!</i>

1154
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,542
<i>Cute!</i>

1155
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,878
<i>Hi, guys. I'm Jed.</i>

1156
01:15:09,463 --> 01:15:12,132
<i>By the way, guys. Jed, uh--</i>

1157
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:13,675
<i>Joey.</i>

1158
01:15:14,509 --> 01:15:15,844
<i>- Yana. Hello.</i>
<i>- Yana.</i>

1159
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:18,472
<i>Nice meeting you, bro.</i>

1160
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:20,557
<i>Pleasure's all mine.</i>

1161
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:22,518
<i>I'll go get a refill.</i>

1162
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,393
<i>Yes!</i>

1163
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:25,187
<i>It's over there, Chris. The bar.</i>

1164
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:26,563
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

1165
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,065
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1166
01:15:28,523 --> 01:15:32,110
Jed, I have to show you
this masterpiece by Alex.

1167
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:34,613
Let's look around?

1168
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:39,660
This is nice.

1169
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:41,912
This one's from Madrid.

1170
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:42,913
<i>Babe, wait I'll be right back.</i>

1171
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:43,872
<i>I'll just go there.</i>

1172
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,624
<i>Oh, go. Enjoy.</i>

1173
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:46,917
<i>I'll just be here.</i>

1174
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:02,474
<i>Chris.</i>

1175
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,726
<i>Chris!</i>

1176
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,187
<i>Christina.</i>

1177
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:09,439
<i>Hey.</i>

1178
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,150
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

1179
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,194
<i>Christina, talk to me.</i>

1180
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:15,320
<i>Joey.</i>

1181
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,031
<i>Why are you avoiding me?</i>

1182
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:19,199
<i>Me?</i>

1183
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,784
<i>Of course not.</i>

1184
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:23,328
<i>Can you be real </i>
<i>for a second, please?</i>

1185
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:25,539
<i>Sure, how can I help?</i>

1186
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:28,709
<i>Oh my-- Please! </i>
<i>Can you be real for a second.</i>

1187
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,295
<i>Chris!</i>

1188
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:33,297
<i>What?</i>

1189
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:34,881
<i>What happened?</i>

1190
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:35,841
<i>To what?</i>

1191
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,176
<i>G***d**nit, can we stop </i>
<i>going round in circles?</i>

1192
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:40,762
<i>Why did you disappear on me?</i>
<i>You just stopped talking to me.</i>

1193
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:42,848
<i>Why are you hiding from me?</i>

1194
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,559
<i>Why, is there a reason for me to stay?</i>

1195
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,978
<i>What's there to talk about?</i>

1196
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:50,272
<i>That you're with Yana </i>
<i>while we were having s*x?</i>

1197
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,648
<i>We were going on dates?</i>

1198
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:53,400
<i>What am I, your side chick?</i>

1199
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:55,736
<i>I'm sorry I didn't tell you.</i>

1200
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:58,989
<i>Then you announced on social media</i>
<i> that you're official.</i>

1201
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,407
<i>What's this for?</i>

1202
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,534
<i>What are we even talking about?</i>

1203
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,330
<i>And don't you dare tell me</i>
<i>that we're just being friends.</i>

1204
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,706
<i>That's bulls**t.</i>

1205
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,874
<i>It meant something.</i>

1206
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,000
<i>At least to me.</i>

1207
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,168
<i>It meant something for me!</i>

1208
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:13,003
<i>It meant everything to me!</i>

1209
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,297
<i>I missed you, Chris. I love you!</i>

1210
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:16,882
<i>No! I hate you.</i>

1211
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:20,385
<i>I hated waiting for you </i>
<i>because I still love you.</i>

1212
01:17:20,385 --> 01:17:22,596
<i>And I still love you, too.</i>
<i>We can still do this.</i>

1213
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:23,972
<i>- We can fix this.</i>
<i>- Stop it, Joey.</i>

1214
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:25,932
<i>We tried. It didn't work.</i>

1215
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,060
<i>It didn't.</i>

1216
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:31,146
<i>We can try.</i>

1217
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:34,691
<i>Babe?</i>

1218
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:37,152
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1219
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,324
<i>Yeah, babe.</i>

1220
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:44,951
<i>Just checking if she's drunk.</i>

1221
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:45,744
<i>She's fine.</i>

1222
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:46,953
<i>I'm good.</i>

1223
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:48,663
<i>Are you okay, Chris?</i>

1224
01:17:48,663 --> 01:17:50,082
<i>Yes! I'm okay.</i>

1225
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:50,957
<i>Thanks.</i>

1226
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:54,378
<i>Yeah. Go.</i>

1227
01:17:57,672 --> 01:17:59,216
<i>Sorry, babe.</i>

1228
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:16,149
<i>Not too long ago,</i>
<i>you were just a pipsqueak.</i>

1229
01:18:16,149 --> 01:18:19,486
<i>But look at you now.</i>
<i>You are a genius and I'm so proud of you!</i>

1230
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:23,073
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Romulo!</i>

1231
01:18:25,325 --> 01:18:26,576
<i>Yes!</i>

1232
01:18:30,747 --> 01:18:32,124
Thank you very much.

1233
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:36,169
<i>But before anything else,</i>
<i>I'd love it if you purchased some photos</i>

1234
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:39,005
<i>so Jonj and I have something </i>
<i>to take home, yes?</i>

1235
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:40,507
Right, of course.

1236
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:46,596
<i>Well, actually, this night is special</i>
<i> for another reason.</i>

1237
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:50,892
<i>Because long before I made it this far,</i>

1238
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:54,479
he's been a patron of my work
from the start.

1239
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:56,356
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1240
01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:58,233
<i>my friend,</i>

1241
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,235
<i>my dude, my buddy,</i>

1242
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:01,987
<i>my brodi,</i>

1243
01:19:02,737 --> 01:19:04,614
<i>Joey Martinez.</i>

1244
01:19:05,365 --> 01:19:10,203
<i>He has a special announcement tonight.</i>

1245
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:17,961
<i>Uh, good evening everyone.</i>

1246
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,214
<i>As unexpected as this is,</i>

1247
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:22,424
<i>they also say it--</i>

1248
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,926
<i>Love comes in unexpected ways, right?</i>

1249
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,224
<i>That's why…</i>

1250
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:37,022
<i>I'm sure you didn't expect this.</i>

1251
01:19:40,817 --> 01:19:42,903
<i>Yana,</i>

1252
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,198
<i>will you be my wife?</i>

1253
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:51,244
<i>Yes, Joey.</i>

1254
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:54,122
<i>I will marry you.</i>

1255
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:57,375
<i>Congrats!</i>

1256
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,060
<i>Alex, what was that?</i>

1257
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,019
<i>That wasn't in the plan.</i>

1258
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:18,063
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>What was that about?</i>

1259
01:20:18,438 --> 01:20:20,065
<i>My friend made a request.</i>

1260
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:24,110
<i>Your friend is my friend Chris' ex.</i>

1261
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:28,949
<i>- I didn't know that.</i>
<i>- Yeah, fine. Just shut it.</i>

1262
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:32,244
<i>- You should have told me.</i>
<i>- I said shut it, okay?</i>

1263
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:37,791
<i>Chris.</i>

1264
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:40,919
<i>You okay?</i>

1265
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:54,307
<i>You want me, don't you?</i>

1266
01:20:55,934 --> 01:21:00,313
<i>You can have me.</i>
<i>Just for tonight.</i>

1267
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,832
<i>You took everything from me.</i>

1268
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:21,209
<i>I have nothing left for myself.</i>

1269
01:21:21,876 --> 01:21:24,713
<i>Give me another chance.</i>

1270
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:28,383
<i>If this is the only way you can love me,</i>

1271
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:30,635
<i>I'd rather you didn't at all.</i>

1272
01:21:32,762 --> 01:21:35,557
<i>I would do anything to make you stay.</i>

1273
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,602
<i>Yes, anything.</i>

1274
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:40,312
<i>Anything but be faithful.</i>

1275
01:21:43,898 --> 01:21:46,860
Wait. Stop! Stop!

1276
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:49,571
Chris! We've been over this.

1277
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,990
<i>You're not heeding my instructions.</i>
<i>There's no improvement.</i>

1278
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:52,949
<i>Nothing changed.</i>

1279
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:54,868
<i>You're doing the same thing over and over.</i>

1280
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,911
<i>You're not in the moment.</i>

1281
01:21:56,911 --> 01:21:58,079
<i>You're not here, actually.</i>

1282
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,706
<i>You're not with us.</i>

1283
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,250
<i>What now?</i>

1284
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,710
<i>Should we waste each other's time?</i>

1285
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:06,546
<i>You're wasting everybody's time.</i>

1286
01:22:06,546 --> 01:22:09,049
<i>If you don't want to rehearse,</i>
<i> just say so.</i>

1287
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:11,217
<i>You'd better be here when I come back.</i>

1288
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:13,219
<i>Take five!</i>

1289
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,847
<i>Take five!</i>

1290
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,516
<i>Jed!</i>

1291
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:27,025
<i>F**k!</i>

1292
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:28,443
<i>F**k.</i>

1293
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:34,991
<i>F**k.</i>

1294
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:46,836
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1295
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:50,840
<i>F**k this s**t.</i>

1296
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,592
<i>I think I'm pregnant.</i>

1297
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,178
<i>S**t!</i>

1298
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:57,472
<i>S**t!</i>

1299
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:01,434
<i>Is it Joey's?</i>

1300
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:08,858
<i>Thank you.</i>

1301
01:23:08,858 --> 01:23:10,026
<i>Your mango shake.</i>

1302
01:23:10,026 --> 01:23:11,236
<i>Thank you.</i>

1303
01:23:17,575 --> 01:23:19,077
<i>So…</i>

1304
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:23,623
<i>I think you should know…</i>

1305
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,210
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

1306
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:30,422
<i>F**k.</i>

1307
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:32,507
<i>F**k.</i>

1308
01:23:34,926 --> 01:23:37,053
<i>I wasn't gonna tell you.</i>

1309
01:23:37,762 --> 01:23:41,266
<i>I don't expect you to take</i>
<i>responsibility for it or anything.</i>

1310
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:43,810
<i>We're not even together, right?</i>

1311
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,937
<i>I just thought you should know.</i>

1312
01:23:46,312 --> 01:23:47,772
<i>So what now?</i>

1313
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:50,066
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1314
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:55,071
<i>I mean, look at me.</i>

1315
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:57,115
<i>I'm not ready for this.</i>

1316
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:11,921
<i>Ma'am, the doctor will see you now.</i>

1317
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:57,926
<i>Hey, honey.</i>

1318
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:58,968
<i>What brings you here?</i>

1319
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:07,811
<i>Okay, food is ready!</i>

1320
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:08,937
<i>Start eating.</i>

1321
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,939
<i>You can have as much as you want.</i>

1322
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,859
<i>Yeah? It's hot and perfect.</i>

1323
01:25:14,859 --> 01:25:15,652
<i>Hey, honey,</i>

1324
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:17,362
<i>eat up, okay?</i>

1325
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:20,824
<i>Hot soup with lots of vegetables.</i>

1326
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,201
<i>Go on and eat, honey.</i>

1327
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:27,080
<i>Ma, can I do this?</i>

1328
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:31,501
<i>What?</i>

1329
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,212
<i>This.</i>

1330
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,798
<i>Why not?</i>

1331
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:38,800
<i>You can do it.</i>

1332
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:41,594
<i>Please, it's you!</i>

1333
01:25:41,594 --> 01:25:43,471
<i>Whose daughter are you now?</i>

1334
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:46,808
<i>Yours.</i>

1335
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:49,686
<i>Then there's your answer.</i>

1336
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:53,606
<i>But honey, I know how you're feeling.</i>

1337
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:56,276
<i>Because I went through the same thing.</i>

1338
01:25:57,026 --> 01:25:59,237
<i>But look at the both of you.</i>

1339
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:03,241
<i>I managed to raise you.</i>

1340
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:08,329
<i>We can survive with or without</i>
<i>a man in our household.</i>

1341
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:17,589
<i>I'm scared, Ma.</i>

1342
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,802
<i>Don't be scared, honey.</i>

1343
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:26,764
<i>Look, you have me and your sister.</i>

1344
01:26:27,473 --> 01:26:29,142
<i>You can do this.</i>

1345
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:30,226
<i>Okay?</i>

1346
01:26:30,226 --> 01:26:32,270
<i>You know, sis, I look up to you.</i>

1347
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:35,231
<i>Because you're badass.</i>

1348
01:26:35,231 --> 01:26:36,858
<i>You know what you want.</i>

1349
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,860
<i>You're above the trends.</i>

1350
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,614
<i>Even though I know things do get</i>
<i> difficult for you sometimes,</i>

1351
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:45,241
<i>you never let it show.</i>

1352
01:26:45,241 --> 01:26:47,660
<i>You sister is right.</i>

1353
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:50,121
<i>You know,</i>

1354
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:54,834
<i>when your father and I separated,</i>

1355
01:26:54,834 --> 01:26:56,961
<i>can you believe what </i>
<i>he wanted from me?</i>

1356
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:58,880
<i>To leave you with him!</i>

1357
01:26:59,213 --> 01:27:02,425
<i>Saying things like I couldn't </i>
<i>possibly raise you</i>

1358
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:04,719
<i>while I was struggling </i>
<i>as a theater actress.</i>

1359
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:11,184
<i>But of course, I stood my ground.</i>

1360
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,020
<i>I gave birth to you.</i>

1361
01:27:14,854 --> 01:27:18,399
<i>I told myself that I can do it.</i>

1362
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:23,738
<i>I will raise my daughters on my own.</i>

1363
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:26,449
<i>And I'll raise them to be good people.</i>

1364
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:31,579
<i>I think I succeeded, didn't I?</i>

1365
01:27:32,455 --> 01:27:36,000
<i>Jeez, Ma! Why are you making us cry?</i>

1366
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,545
<i>But I agree, but because not only that, Ma.</i>

1367
01:27:40,254 --> 01:27:43,007
<i>We're nice, and pretty!</i>

1368
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:44,592
<i>Why, of course!</i>

1369
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:47,971
<i>Hey, you. You'd better not be</i>
<i>like your idiotic sister.</i>

1370
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:48,513
<i>Don't--</i>

1371
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:53,101
<i>You know, sis, whatever you do,</i>
<i>I stan you no matter what.</i>

1372
01:28:03,903 --> 01:28:06,239
It's gonna be okay, all right?

1373
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:08,700
Dig in. It's your favorite dish.

1374
01:28:09,325 --> 01:28:10,410
<i>Have some adobo, sweetie.</i>

1375
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:11,536
<i>Yes, Ma.</i>

1376
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:16,582
<i>Enjoy, guys.</i>

1377
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:20,128
<i>Jonjie. Thanks for coming.</i>

1378
01:28:21,587 --> 01:28:23,256
<i>Where's Chris?</i>

1379
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:26,217
<i>Well, she's on break.</i>

1380
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,512
<i>I think I broke her heart.</i>

1381
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:31,139
<i>Oh, did you? No way!</i>

1382
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,432
<i>She didn't mind at all.</i>

1383
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:34,934
<i>She hurried home to check on the stove!</i>

1384
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:38,438
<i>Joey, are you for real?</i>

1385
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:40,064
<i>Who wouldn't get hurt by what you did?</i>

1386
01:28:40,064 --> 01:28:41,315
<i>Even I was surprised.</i>

1387
01:28:41,315 --> 01:28:43,317
<i>Which by the way,</i>
<i>I haven’t forgiven you yet.</i>

1388
01:28:43,317 --> 01:28:44,777
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1389
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:48,573
<i>You know, I did tell Alex</i>
<i>I was having second thoughts.</i>

1390
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,117
<i>Didn't he tell you?</i>

1391
01:28:51,367 --> 01:28:52,577
<i>Listen, Joey.</i>

1392
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,871
<i>It’s not me who needs your apology.</i>

1393
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:56,539
<i>Apologize to Chris.</i>

1394
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:57,415
<i>I know.</i>

1395
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:01,627
<i>How is she?</i>

1396
01:29:01,627 --> 01:29:03,087
<i>She's pregnant!</i>

1397
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:05,798
<i>Huh?</i>

1398
01:29:08,801 --> 01:29:09,886
<i>How?</i>

1399
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:12,055
<i>She had s*x, what else!</i>

1400
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:20,730
<i>Isn't this great, honey?</i>
<i>We get to hang out again.</i>

1401
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,648
<i>I know.</i>

1402
01:29:22,648 --> 01:29:24,442
<i>It feels nice to have company.</i>

1403
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:25,610
Isn't it?

1404
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:27,445
<i>I'll bring these upstairs.</i>

1405
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:28,071
<i>Okay, Ma.</i>

1406
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:28,988
<i>Will you be okay down here?</i>

1407
01:29:28,988 --> 01:29:30,281
<i>Yes, I'll just be here.</i>

1408
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,824
<i>All right then.</i>

1409
01:29:48,674 --> 01:29:50,051
<i>You don't need to know.</i>

1410
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,095
Since when did you find out?

1411
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,437
<i>Three months.</i>

1412
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:06,984
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

1413
01:30:06,984 --> 01:30:08,569
<i>Why would I tell you?</i>

1414
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:10,321
<i>Not this again.</i>

1415
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:12,365
<i>It's my child, too.</i>

1416
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:18,162
<i>It's Jed's.</i>

1417
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,249
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1418
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:24,127
<i>I'm sure. I know my cycle.</i>

1419
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:26,087
<i>You're sure or you're denying it?</i>

1420
01:30:26,796 --> 01:30:28,548
<i>Joey, stop that.</i>

1421
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:31,134
This isn't yours.

1422
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:34,178
<i>Fine, if it's Jed's, where is he?</i>

1423
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:36,264
<i>Where is he? Why isn't he here?</i>

1424
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,974
<i>We have different priorities and it's okay.</i>

1425
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:39,392
<i>Then let me be the father!</i>

1426
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:40,810
<i>Do you hear yourself?</i>

1427
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,645
<i>I'll take responsibility for you, Chris.</i>

1428
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:44,438
<i>Stop being ridiculous!</i>

1429
01:30:44,438 --> 01:30:45,148
<i>Chris!</i>

1430
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:46,190
<i>What?!</i>

1431
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:50,611
<i>I'd do anything to have you back.</i>

1432
01:30:53,322 --> 01:30:54,824
<i>It's always been you.</i>

1433
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:57,285
<i>When we first met,</i>
<i>when we fell in love,</i>

1434
01:30:57,285 --> 01:30:59,412
<i>when we broke up,</i>
<i>when we saw each other again,</i>

1435
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:03,124
<i>even though Yana was there,</i>
<i>it's always still been you.</i>

1436
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,751
<i>You're the one who keeps slipping away.</i>

1437
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:07,712
<i>I wasn't trying to slip away.</i>

1438
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:10,089
<i>Then what?</i>

1439
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:12,633
<i>I'm pulling away.</i>

1440
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:18,890
<i>Is it because you feel guilty</i>
<i>for what happened between us?</i>

1441
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,349
<i>This. This is why.</i>

1442
01:31:20,349 --> 01:31:22,768
<i>This is why I left.</i>

1443
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:26,439
<i>You make things difficult for me.</i>

1444
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:28,441
<i>Difficult?</i>

1445
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:35,948
<i>I have been dying an entire</i>
<i>lifetime without you, Chris.</i>

1446
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:38,868
<i>Every meaningless affair--</i>

1447
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:44,665
<i>And for what? I feel like I'm just slipping</i>
<i>further and further away from you.</i>

1448
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,918
<i>I didn't feel anything until finally--</i>

1449
01:31:48,294 --> 01:31:50,129
<i>Yana came along.</i>

1450
01:31:54,383 --> 01:31:57,220
<i>If that's the case then you</i>
<i>should be with Yana.</i>

1451
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:02,141
<i>We're damaged, Joey.</i>
<i>We're so toxic towards each other.</i>

1452
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:05,019
<i>No, no…</i>

1453
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:09,273
<i>Just say the word, Chris.</i>

1454
01:32:09,273 --> 01:32:10,441
<i>And I'll choose you.</i>

1455
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:14,737
<i>Any day, everyday I'll choose you.</i>

1456
01:32:14,737 --> 01:32:16,113
<i>That's the difference between you and Yana.</i>

1457
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:17,573
<i>It's too late, Joey!</i>

1458
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:19,033
<i>G**d*mnit, Chris!</i>

1459
01:32:20,534 --> 01:32:22,161
<i>Listen to me!</i>

1460
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:25,248
<i>Choose me for once.</i>
<i>Choose us this time.</i>

1461
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,499
<i>When will you fight for us?</i>

1462
01:32:29,543 --> 01:32:30,628
<i>When will you finally face this?</i>

1463
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:31,837
<i>I want to.</i>

1464
01:32:33,547 --> 01:32:35,299
<i>There's nothing that I want more</i>

1465
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,970
<i>than to be with you, to embrace you,</i>

1466
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:40,805
<i>to wake up next to you.</i>

1467
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:45,351
<i>But loving you is exhausting!</i>

1468
01:32:49,188 --> 01:32:51,274
<i>I get tired, too, Chris.</i>

1469
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:54,610
<i>I get tired, too.</i>

1470
01:32:55,486 --> 01:32:57,405
<i>But I never give up.</i>

1471
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,616
<i>I won't give up.</i>

1472
01:33:03,744 --> 01:33:05,121
<i>You have Yana.</i>

1473
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:09,375
<i>She's good for you.</i>

1474
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:13,337
<i>Just don’t let her go.</i>

1475
01:33:13,337 --> 01:33:15,715
<i>Just choose her.</i>

1476
01:33:16,507 --> 01:33:17,466
<i>No…</i>

1477
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:22,680
<i>I love you.</i>

1478
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:27,226
<i>You're the one I love.</i>

1479
01:33:33,899 --> 01:33:34,817
<i>Chris.</i>

1480
01:33:38,237 --> 01:33:41,407
<i>I love you, too, Joey.</i>

1481
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:47,204
<i>But it's too painful being with you.</i>

1482
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:52,043
<i>It's so painful</i>

1483
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:55,254
<i>to be with you.</i>

1484
01:34:05,848 --> 01:34:11,937
<i>I can't.</i>

1485
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,172
Hija.

1486
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:40,466
<i>Hi, auntie.</i>

1487
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:43,260
<i>I'm so proud of you and Joey.</i>

1488
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:47,932
<i>Even when you were kids,</i>
<i>I already envisioned you as my daughter-in-law.</i>

1489
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:49,350
<i>Thank you, Auntie.</i>

1490
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:51,852
<i>But how's Joey?</i>

1491
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,274
<i>I'm sure he's just tired.</i>

1492
01:34:57,274 --> 01:34:58,442
<i>Overwhelmed by all this.</i>

1493
01:35:00,694 --> 01:35:05,533
<i>Greg's mother used to tell me that</i>
<i>I'm the kind of woman that men settle for.</i>

1494
01:35:06,283 --> 01:35:09,203
<i>When the excitement is gone</i>
<i> from the outside,</i>

1495
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:12,373
he comes home to me for comfort,

1496
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:15,042
for love, for wisdom.

1497
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:17,753
<i>I used to resent it.</i>

1498
01:35:17,753 --> 01:35:21,882
<i>Because I know in my heart that</i>
<i>I'm exciting, fun, and unpredictable.</i>

1499
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:26,846
<i>But as I grew older, I realized</i>

1500
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:31,934
<i>how blessed I am to have</i>
<i>been that kind of woman.</i>

1501
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:39,108
<i>Men settle for women who</i>
<i>make them feel safe and secure.</i>

1502
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:46,240
<i>Don't worry, Auntie. I know Joey</i>
<i>knows better than to screw this up.</i>

1503
01:35:50,369 --> 01:35:51,245
<i>I appreciate this so much.</i>

1504
01:36:21,817 --> 01:36:22,902
<i>Hello?</i>

1505
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:25,070
Girl, where you at?

1506
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:32,870
<i>Girl, I'm at home. But later I have</i>
<i>a meeting with some producers.</i>

1507
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:33,871
<i>Why?</i>

1508
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:37,625
You don't need me today, right?
You're busy. You've got a lot going on.

1509
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:40,586
<i>You are a strong, independent,</i>
<i>courageous woman.</i>

1510
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:44,715
<i>If I needed you I would have</i>
<i>had your schedule blocked off.</i>

1511
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:51,388
<i>Wait.</i>

1512
01:36:52,806 --> 01:36:54,016
<i>Is it today?</i>

1513
01:36:54,558 --> 01:36:56,852
<i>Mm-hm, girl. It's today.</i>

1514
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:00,648
<i>S**t!</i>

1515
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:03,817
<i>F**k!</i>

1516
01:37:03,817 --> 01:37:06,695
<i>F**k! Do you know I planned for this day?</i>

1517
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:11,200
<i>I wondered if I should glam up, stuff my face,</i>

1518
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,202
<i>go on a date…</i>

1519
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:19,500
<i>F**k! But I'm at home working?</i>

1520
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:21,794
<i>I don't even feel a thing.</i>

1521
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:23,462
<i>What?</i>

1522
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:25,172
<i>Are you for real?</i>

1523
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:28,717
It's fine, you can be honest. It's just
you and me, no one's watching.

1524
01:37:28,717 --> 01:37:30,844
<i>Tell me, want me to blow up the venue</i>
<i>and stop the wedding?</i>

1525
01:37:30,844 --> 01:37:33,430
Then we'll laugh our heads off
while it burns.

1526
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:34,390
<i>Would you like that?</i>

1527
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:36,892
<i>Don't be silly.</i>

1528
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:39,353
No, I'm serious.
Just say the word.

1529
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:40,980
I got some friends down here.
What's the plan?

1530
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:41,730
<i>Chill out.</i>

1531
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:44,191
<i>I'm just stirring it.</i>

1532
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:47,111
<i>I know you have a flair</i>
<i>for the dramatic but the whole</i>

1533
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:50,656
<i>"Stop the wedding!" gig is overdone.</i>
<i>Oh my god, so cheap. You don't like that.</i>

1534
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:52,491
Just stay fabulous, gorgeous,

1535
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:54,702
<i>then post a thirst trap on IG.</i>

1536
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:56,787
<i>"It's your loss, Joey Martinez."</i>

1537
01:37:56,787 --> 01:37:58,622
<i>Can I get an amen up in here?</i>

1538
01:37:59,832 --> 01:38:02,209
Christina?

1539
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:04,003
<i>Hello, girl?</i>

1540
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:05,045
<i>Girl?</i>

1541
01:38:06,088 --> 01:38:07,506
Christina. Girl!

1542
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:10,801
<i>Hey, what are you doing here?</i>

1543
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:12,803
<i>You can't be here.</i>

1544
01:38:12,803 --> 01:38:16,265
<i>Why? 'Cause it will jinx the wedding?</i>

1545
01:38:19,643 --> 01:38:22,104
<i>Are you just settling with me?</i>

1546
01:38:27,818 --> 01:38:29,945
<i>Forget I asked.</i>

1547
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:35,618
<i>But know this, Joey.</i>

1548
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:38,162
<i>If you choose me,</i>

1549
01:38:39,705 --> 01:38:42,041
<i>you're not just settling with me.</i>

1550
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:49,173
<i>Because, Joey, I'm the right choice.</i>

1551
01:38:50,132 --> 01:38:52,509
<i>I know you can't love me</i>
<i>the way you love her.</i>

1552
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:58,057
<i>Hell, I can't even get close.</i>

1553
01:39:00,851 --> 01:39:03,312
<i>But I will wait, Joey.</i>

1554
01:39:03,312 --> 01:39:08,942
<i>Even though I know being with me</i>
<i>won't erase her from your mind.</i>

1555
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:15,741
<i>I will wait for you.</i>

1556
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:21,205
<i>I will be with you until you move on.</i>

1557
01:39:46,271 --> 01:39:50,567
Should we bring these in?

1558
01:39:50,567 --> 01:39:52,277
Go.

1559
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:55,698
Wait, did you get the right one?

1560
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:57,491
All right, bring them in.

1561
01:39:58,242 --> 01:40:00,703
Unload the flowers, please.

1562
01:40:04,581 --> 01:40:06,208
Are we missing anything else?

1563
01:40:06,208 --> 01:40:08,585
<i>Unload and bring everything in.</i>

1564
01:40:08,585 --> 01:40:10,170
<i>Double time, please.</i>

1565
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:11,505
<i>Mister!</i>

1566
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:14,508
<i>Is this the Martinez and Santillan nuptials?</i>

1567
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:16,885
<i>No, ma'am. They're over at South Gardens.</i>

1568
01:40:16,885 --> 01:40:17,845
<i>Bring those in.</i>

1569
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:19,430
<i>Are you sure?</i>

1570
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:20,180
<i>Yes.</i>

1571
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:21,640
<i>Thanks.</i>

1572
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:24,226
<i>Hurry up. Double time.</i>

1573
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:28,021
<i>Sir, let's try the chair.</i>

1574
01:40:28,021 --> 01:40:30,107
<i>Sit down? Okay.</i>

1575
01:40:31,608 --> 01:40:32,693
<i>Okay.</i>

1576
01:40:42,077 --> 01:40:43,996
<i>Ah, five minutes. </i>

1577
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:45,664
<i>I just need to take a break.</i>

1578
01:40:45,664 --> 01:40:46,331
<i>Bro, could you hold it for me?</i>

1579
01:40:46,331 --> 01:40:47,166
<i>Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.</i>

1580
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:50,794
<i>I just need to breathe. </i>
<i>Is that okay?</i>

1581
01:40:50,794 --> 01:40:53,005
<i>- You okay?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm good. Just need to breathe.</i>

1582
01:41:36,465 --> 01:41:37,800
<i>Move.</i>

1583
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:53,690
<i>Joey!</i>

1584
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:54,900
Chris!

1585
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:55,818
<i>Joey!</i>

1586
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:57,861
What are you doing here?

1587
01:41:57,861 --> 01:41:58,403
<i>Is it over?</i>

1588
01:41:58,403 --> 01:41:59,571
<i>Is it done?</i>

1589
01:42:00,989 --> 01:42:03,450
<i>Oh, okay. Good. Good.</i>

1590
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:05,744
<i>Why 'good'?</i>

1591
01:42:06,411 --> 01:42:07,371
<i>Did you come to stop the wedding?</i>

1592
01:42:07,371 --> 01:42:07,955
<i>Yes.</i>

1593
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:10,207
<i>No! I mean no.</i>

1594
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:13,460
<i>I can't let the wedding happen</i>

1595
01:42:15,546 --> 01:42:17,840
<i>before we've had this talk.</i>

1596
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:22,135
<i>Okay…</i>

1597
01:42:25,305 --> 01:42:27,724
<i>I guess I came here for closure.</i>

1598
01:42:30,269 --> 01:42:31,812
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1599
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:34,356
<i>I want you to go through the wedding…</i>

1600
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:36,775
<i>with only Yana on your mind.</i>

1601
01:42:39,027 --> 01:42:41,405
<i>Even though I know</i>

1602
01:42:43,949 --> 01:42:46,660
<i>I'm still the one in there.</i>

1603
01:42:54,042 --> 01:42:57,588
<i>I came to say goodbye.</i>

1604
01:43:02,885 --> 01:43:04,386
<i>But I love you, Chris.</i>

1605
01:43:04,386 --> 01:43:07,890
<i>I love you, too. Joey, I do.</i>

1606
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:11,560
<i>Then let's risk it. F**k it.</i>

1607
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:13,645
<i>- Let's leave! Let's get away from here.</i>
<i>- That's enough, Joey. Stop.</i>

1608
01:43:13,645 --> 01:43:15,731
<i>We tried. We both did.</i>

1609
01:43:16,773 --> 01:43:19,735
<i>We're not meant to be together.</i>

1610
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:20,819
<i>Chris…</i>

1611
01:43:20,819 --> 01:43:23,113
<i>We're not meant for each other, Joey.</i>

1612
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:27,075
<i>I know you don't see it now, but</i>

1613
01:43:27,951 --> 01:43:32,164
<i>I know, and I hope one day you will realize</i>

1614
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:36,793
<i>That it's Yana.</i>

1615
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:40,380
<i>Yana's the one for you.</i>

1616
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:42,215
<i>Enough about Yana.</i>
<i>What about you?</i>

1617
01:43:42,215 --> 01:43:43,800
<i>- What of you?</i>
<i>- I'll be fine, Joey.</i>

1618
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:44,968
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

1619
01:43:46,219 --> 01:43:50,265
<i>Trust me, I've been battling with myself</i>
<i> whether or not to come here.</i>

1620
01:43:51,141 --> 01:43:52,768
<i>And...</i>

1621
01:43:52,768 --> 01:43:56,146
<i>it's easy to just slip out of your life.</i>

1622
01:43:57,856 --> 01:44:00,025
<i>But I'm here.</i>

1623
01:44:02,945 --> 01:44:05,656
<i>I'm here because we loved each other.</i>

1624
01:44:07,866 --> 01:44:13,372
<i>I used to be somebody</i>
<i>who loved all parts of you.</i>

1625
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:15,040
<i>All of you.</i>

1626
01:44:17,042 --> 01:44:21,171
<i>So I want to propose something.</i>

1627
01:44:21,171 --> 01:44:22,923
<i>Okay.</i>

1628
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:36,061
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1629
01:44:36,812 --> 01:44:38,313
<i>Joey Martinez,</i>

1630
01:44:40,232 --> 01:44:41,566
<i>will you…</i>

1631
01:44:44,903 --> 01:44:47,030
<i>Will you be my ex?</i>

1632
01:44:52,119 --> 01:44:53,912
<i>Get up.</i>

1633
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:58,750
<i>Christina Roxas…</i>

1634
01:45:01,211 --> 01:45:03,171
<i>Yes,</i>

1635
01:45:05,924 --> 01:45:08,093
<i>yes, I will be your ex.</i>

1636
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:29,614
<i>Okay.</i>

1637
01:45:29,614 --> 01:45:30,949
<i>Go.</i>
