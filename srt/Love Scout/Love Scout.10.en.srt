1
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,587
THE CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS
COMPANIES, AND PLACES

2
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,006
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,260
The child

4
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,971
your father saved.

5
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,102
That was me.

6
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,422
What

7
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,425
are you talking about?

8
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,055
In the apartment I lived in,

9
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,809
there was a big fire.

10
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,063
The door to my room was blocked,
so I couldn't escape.

11
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,649
Someone came to save me.

12
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,736
Before the building collapsed,

13
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,657
he handed me over to the firefighters…

14
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,999
He saved my life.

15
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:10,004
So I had been searching for his family.

16
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,174
I recently found out his name.

17
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,348
Mr. Kang Kyung-tae.

18
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,865
Are you sure?

19
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,620
Did you really verify it?

20
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,957
It doesn't make sense.

21
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,837
How could you…

22
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,006
How…

23
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,594
That's impossible.

24
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,270
I need some time alone.

25
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,232
You should go.

26
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,054
Why is it you of all people?

27
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:41,971
Why?

28
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,098
I resented my dad so much.

29
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,685
I hated him so much.

30
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,646
I wish

31
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,774
you hadn't told me.

32
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,569
You should've kept me in the dark.

33
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,083
How will I…

34
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,461
I…

35
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,262
How am I supposed to
look at you from now on?

36
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,878
<i>I will wait</i>

37
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,130
<i>until you had enough time to think.</i>

38
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,478
I WILL WAIT UNTIL YOU HAD
ENOUGH TIME TO THINK.

39
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,244
Why are you wearing sunglasses
all of a sudden?

40
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,913
Did you get a stye?

41
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,206
The sun is strong today.

42
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,835
What? It's awfully cloudy.

43
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,837
Eun-ho.

44
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:20,755
Eun-ho?

45
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,215
Can I have a minute with you?

46
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,925
Okay.

47
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,891
A month?

48
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,435
I knew you wouldn't be worried about it.

49
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,271
You've been too busy dating
that you lost track of time.

50
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,316
We agreed on six months at the beginning.

51
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,527
So you have a little more than a month.

52
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,113
You might need
some time to think about it.

53
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,823
That's why I brought it up early.

54
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,077
I see. Thank you.

55
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,997
We also agreed that
you could look for another job.

56
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,626
Don't hesitate to let me know
if you want to change jobs.

57
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,919
Of course,

58
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:03,005
I'd love to make you stay
and keep working with you.

59
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,423
That's only what I want.

60
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,385
Discuss it with Ji-yun before deciding.

61
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,431
Okay.

62
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,600
I'll think about it and let you know.

63
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,103
Gosh.

64
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,856
Ji-yun might not want
to stay away from you.

65
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,607
She might keep you working here.

66
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,485
Let me know when you're ready.

67
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,829
This is Jang Seo-young
with a background in law.

68
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,998
After working at Seoul
Central District Prosecutors' Office,

69
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,833
she was on the legal team
at Haeseon Electronics.

70
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,335
Currently, she's the CEO at an IT company.

71
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,005
She's known for her expertise
in risk management.

72
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,049
The last candidate is Oh Min-seok.

73
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,885
After studying law,

74
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,929
he was certified as a lawyer
at Herald Law School.

75
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,349
After working in mergers and acquisitions
at a major law firm in Korea,

76
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,519
he became the youngest CEO
at a game company three years ago.

77
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,772
All of them
fit the requirements we wanted.

78
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,609
Let's meet them individually.

79
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,153
Mr. Yu, please arrange the meetings.

80
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,825
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,368
Meeting's over.

82
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,786
Meeting's over.

83
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,079
Good job, everyone.

84
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,459
KANG JI-YUN, CEO

85
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,163
Jeong-nam.

86
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,248
Oh, Mr. Kim!

87
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,249
Over here.

88
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,042
You got much younger than before.

89
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,837
From afar, I thought
you were a college student.

90
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,839
That must be why
people were staring at me.

91
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,757
- Sit down.
- Please have a seat.

92
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,761
- You grilled the meat so well.
- Thank you.

93
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,513
How have you been?

94
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,891
When you left the company like that,
I felt terrible.

95
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:02,852
Actually,

96
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,896
I'm in a different field now.

97
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,442
It wasn't the right fit for me.

98
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,029
I'm being trained at a small company
someone referred me to.

99
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,322
Really?

100
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,574
Where you work isn't important.

101
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,701
What matters is that you're working.

102
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,453
Have a drink.

103
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,705
- Let me serve you first.
- Okay.

104
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,748
It's been so long.

105
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,207
Thank you for your time.

106
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,667
I'm the one who's thankful.

107
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,127
- Let me pour you one.
- Okay.

108
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,047
How about you?

109
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,757
Are you still busy these days?

110
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,510
I read that Peoplez is in charge
of finding a CEO for NEXT.

111
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,553
Well, yes.

112
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,514
Things are still going well at Peoplez.

113
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,850
Have you started searching for candidates?

114
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,519
We wouldn't be Peoplez
if we were still searching.

115
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,521
- We started contacting our candidates.
- Already?

116
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,439
Yeah.

117
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,817
Ms. Kang works insanely fast.

118
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,818
She isn't just fast.

119
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,030
She's one step ahead of anyone else.

120
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,657
- It's surprising.
- Really?

121
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,075
Even this time,

122
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,868
instead of those formerly in management,

123
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,870
people like lawyers and journalists

124
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:03,871
Such candidates…

125
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,835
No, I can't. It's a trade secret.

126
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,214
A trade secret?

127
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,799
Sure, that's important!

128
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,137
Hello, Ms. Kim.

129
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,181
Peoplez is contacting those

130
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,017
with a legal or journalist background
instead of managers.

131
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,311
- Are you sure this time?
- <i>Yes, I'm sure.</i>

132
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,897
I heard it directly
from a Peoplez employee.

133
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,111
From Peoplez's database that you have,

134
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,988
bring me a list of lawyers and journalists

135
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,615
that Kang Ji-yun would contact.

136
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,742
Don't forget that this is
your last chance.

137
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:50,626
I would be so scared to be your enemy.

138
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,588
You must dislike Ms. Kang so much
for you to attack her

139
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,757
from all directions.

140
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:01,137
I mean, is what we're doing not enough?

141
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,721
If I'm taking it away from her,

142
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,640
I shouldn't leave her a single crumb.

143
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,268
Is everything going smoothly?

144
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,602
Of course.

145
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,439
There can't be any problem.
A lot of money is at stake.

146
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,871
Please come in.

147
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,748
Hello, I'm from Ikonic Biotechnology.

148
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,709
I'm CEO Park Young-min.

149
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,170
- Nice to meet you. I'm Kang Ji-yun.
- Yes.

150
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,629
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

151
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,760
Wow, I like your office.

152
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,138
You're impressive.

153
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,475
Everyone talked about Peoplez
when they recommended me search firms.

154
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,478
I heard that you're also in charge
of finding a CEO for NEXT.

155
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,854
Rumors spread fast.

156
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,441
You must be busy,
but please help us out too.

157
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,151
We're nowhere near NEXT,

158
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,612
but many want to invest in us
for our technology development.

159
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,530
Things are going well for us now.

160
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,158
We worked hard for several years
after getting our new drug patented.

161
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,535
It's finally happening.

162
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,788
I heard that you'll sign a contract
with a German pharmaceutical company.

163
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,416
Yes, since then,
we've been getting investment offers.

164
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,876
We've been very busy.

165
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,544
Our investment consultant told us

166
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,547
that stabilizing the company is important
at a time like this.

167
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,299
Before our new drug gets commercialized,

168
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,551
we plan to focus on development.

169
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,137
Please recommend us competent researchers.

170
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,139
Sure.

171
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,573
Why aren't you going in?

172
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,784
Oh, go ahead.

173
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,582
What? Are you alone?

174
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,667
Yes, why?

175
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,253
Eun-ho left without going in.

176
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,255
Oh, really?

177
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,590
You two are so careful.

178
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,677
In case people get suspicious from
seeing you together in the break room?

179
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,722
Have you discussed about his contract?

180
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,057
What did you decide?

181
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,768
- Contract?
- Yes. Didn't he bring it up?

182
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,938
His contract period is almost over,
so I told him to discuss it with you.

183
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,899
Oh, is it up already?

184
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,029
Did you fight or something?

185
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,156
Is something wrong?

186
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,118
Mi-ae.

187
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,621
How about some soju with me?

188
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,008
How could he

189
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,802
be Eun-ho, of all people?

190
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,723
Is this meant to be
or an ill-fated relationship?

191
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,686
Isn't my dad nasty?

192
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,398
What he's done to me was enough.

193
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,444
I was trying to live without being lonely.

194
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,823
It's about him all over again.

195
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,121
So what are you going to do?

196
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,715
Stay with him.

197
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,009
What's the problem with staying with him?

198
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,803
To be brutally honest, it isn't
Eun-ho's fault that your dad died.

199
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,184
Aren't you glad that
your dad saved Eun-ho?

200
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,733
I've been resenting Dad all my life.

201
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,322
I still can't understand his choice.

202
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,658
Stop resenting him.

203
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,535
Stop hating him.

204
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,709
Seo Mi-ae, how could she?

205
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,020
When you told me…

206
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,316
there were two people
who brought you where you are now,

207
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,194
is one of them

208
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,739
my dad?

209
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,413
He told me not to give up

210
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,791
and survive no matter what.

211
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,712
What your father told me that day

212
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,548
has stayed with me, even now.

213
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,386
Whenever I feel like collapsing,

214
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,638
I think of his voice and endure.

215
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,017
So that's why I'm here

216
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,394
as well as Byeol.

217
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,356
All thanks to him.

218
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,707
<i>Ji-yun.</i>

219
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:49,878
Ji-yun.

220
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,174
<i>You're number one in my life.</i>

221
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,310
<i>Not this one.</i>

222
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,939
Not this one.

223
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,067
Not this one either.

224
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,071
Byeol, which outfit are you looking for?

225
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,948
What you're wearing is pretty too.

226
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,659
No, this isn't good enough.

227
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,703
What do you mean?

228
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,413
You look like a princess to me.

229
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,248
Princesses don't dress like this.

230
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,044
Byeol, clothes aren't important.

231
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,504
You're so beautiful.

232
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,131
Let's just go in this outfit.

233
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,216
We're both late.

234
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,177
You only care about work.

235
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,928
- What?
- You have no idea.

236
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,680
I hate you!

237
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,598
But…

238
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,310
Byeol.

239
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,395
Seol, I love your outfit today.

240
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,688
You look like a princess.

241
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,898
Thanks.

242
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,108
Byeol.

243
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,652
Is that how you're dressed today?

244
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,905
You don't look like a princess.

245
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,156
Aren't you going to the party today?

246
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,460
Ji-young is having
her birthday party today.

247
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,712
It's a princess party.

248
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,297
I know.

249
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,548
Are you going?

250
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,635
- No, I'm not going.
- Why not?

251
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,428
All the girls are going.

252
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,352
That sounds boring.

253
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm going to go read at Uncle's bookstore.

254
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,564
I see.

255
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,747
- Kang-seok.
- Hey, Ji-yun.

256
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,168
Sis!

257
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,170
Hi, Byeol.

258
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,130
She must be excited to see you at least.

259
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,550
I don't know what happened,
but she's feeling down today.

260
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,094
It's not what you think.

261
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,721
Is that why you've been sighing

262
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,515
without reading your favorite books?

263
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,393
What's wrong? Did something bad happen?

264
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,522
Let's talk over there.

265
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,066
What? Are you keeping it a secret from me?

266
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,319
You're a man, so you won't understand.

267
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,531
Gosh, that's making me feel disappointed.

268
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,367
Okay, you girls have a deep conversation.

269
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,968
- Really?
- Yes.

270
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,970
Byeol.

271
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,680
Let's go.

272
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,590
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

273
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,760
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

274
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,430
<i>- Happy birthday, dear Ji-young…</i>
<i>- Happy birthday, dear Ji-young…</i>

275
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:30,974
Byeol…

276
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,350
Sorry for being late.

277
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,727
Happy birthday, Ji-young.

278
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,645
Oh, thanks.

279
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,397
Who…

280
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,648
Oh, hello.

281
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,400
I'm a close friend of Byeol's.

282
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,741
Shall we give her the gift?

283
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,041
It's so big.

284
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,713
Here's your present.

285
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,257
Thank you for being born, Ji-young.

286
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,884
BABY TWINS TWO-STORY HOUSE

287
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,180
Thank you, Byeol.

288
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,690
Going down!

289
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,248
Sis, thank you so much for today.

290
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,707
You're the best.

291
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,710
There's no need to thank me.
We're friends.

292
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,255
Friends are supposed to help each other.

293
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,465
Feel free to tell me when
something like this happens again.

294
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,758
Can I really?

295
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,304
Dad doesn't understand this stuff.

296
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,557
That's how dads are.

297
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,100
Was your dad like that too?

298
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,102
Yes.

299
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,937
My dad was worse.

300
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,106
He was bad at tying my hair too.

301
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,607
- Really?
- Yes.

302
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,984
He tied my hair so tight

303
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,527
that he pulled out my hair.

304
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,822
He could only tie it up. He didn't know
how to braid my hair like yours.

305
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,324
My dad is really good at tying my hair.

306
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,535
Disco, crisscross, and centipede hair.

307
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,579
He's even good at braiding.

308
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,293
Sis,

309
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,836
can I borrow your phone?

310
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,006
- My phone?
- I want to call my dad.

311
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,009
I think he might be upset.

312
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,761
I told him this morning that I hated him.

313
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,347
I want to say sorry.

314
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,799
Dad!

315
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,650
- Did you eat something delicious?
- Yes.

316
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,526
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

317
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,824
- Dad.
- Yes?

318
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,535
- I missed you.
- You said you hated me this morning.

319
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:40,580
That's because I like you that much.

320
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,249
Because you like me?

321
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,667
Sis told me

322
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,169
that you hate them
as much as you like them.

323
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,389
MINT CHOCOLATE MILK

324
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,839
KANG KYUNG-TAE

325
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,590
Dad, I'm here.

326
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,053
It took me a long time

327
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,515
getting here.

328
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,160
Dad.

329
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,247
It's been really difficult for me.

330
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,629
After you passed away,

331
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,716
I didn't know what to do.

332
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,513
I hated you so much.

333
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,687
I thought it would help me live.

334
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,983
I think I wanted to resent someone.

335
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,034
I'm sorry, Dad.

336
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,871
Until now,

337
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,708
I never smiled at you.

338
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,597
I miss you.

339
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,936
I miss you, Dad.

340
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,717
- Hello.
- Hello.

341
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,593
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

342
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,595
Could you hold…

343
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,307
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

344
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,444
Why aren't you getting in?

345
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,870
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

346
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,765
Thank you, Eun-ho.

347
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,979
For growing up…

348
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,400
to be such a good person.

349
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,337
Aren't you going to hold it?

350
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,684
I will never

351
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,771
let go of this hand.

352
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,817
So,

353
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,528
you don't let go either.

354
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,576
Thank you.

355
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,670
Let's go, Ms. Kang.

356
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,522
Let me check. Hello…

357
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,545
Good morning.

358
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,770
There's no turning back now.

359
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,023
Yes.

360
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,066
That's why I did it.

361
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,802
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

362
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,387
A bug might get into your mouth.

363
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,848
I never imagined it.

364
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,142
Why? How could they?

365
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,936
Am I the only one who's in shock?

366
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,270
I already knew about it.

367
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,814
Really? I had no idea.

368
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,982
The two of them

369
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,693
were pretty bad at hiding it.

370
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,904
Yes, I'm back in the office.

371
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,323
I'll call you back after looking it up.

372
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,407
Okay.

373
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:30,800
Gyu-rim,

374
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:34,595
you should've reported to me first
after seeing that.

375
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,598
- How could you keep it to yourself?
- Should I have spread a rumor?

376
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,225
- Give me your hand.
- No.

377
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,104
- All of a sudden,
- No.

378
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,231
- Peoplez is full of love.
- No way.

379
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,816
- It's not the right time.
- I mean…

380
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,026
- No.
- It's okay.

381
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,152
No way.

382
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,361
I said it's okay.

383
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,451
Is there someone else dating at work?

384
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,663
Don't report things like this.

385
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,882
Kyung-hwa, it was a good time
to tell them.

386
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,592
Are you out of your mind?

387
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,093
It's driving me nuts.

388
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,887
May I get closer?

389
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,431
Yes, hold my hand too.

390
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,519
Kids must not feel hot.

391
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,397
Is Seo-jun's mom not here yet?

392
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,066
She must be busy.

393
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,484
His grandma comes more often.

394
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,861
Speaking of Seo-jun,

395
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,614
he doesn't seem to take
after his mom, does he?

396
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,657
Does he take after his dad?

397
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,826
You didn't know?

398
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,829
She isn't Seo-jun's mom by blood.

399
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,373
Really? No wonder…

400
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,666
That's why the child is…

401
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,293
What about him?

402
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,255
What's wrong with Seo-jun?

403
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,966
It just seems like

404
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,511
there's a certain shadow about him.

405
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,553
Shadow, my foot!

406
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,639
There's no child as cheerful as him.

407
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:04,310
Seo-jun has been loved by his mom
as much as any other kid.

408
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,897
Yes, of course. You're right.

409
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:23,621
Isn't it your son the one
who called us half a family last time?

410
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,124
What would he learn from a mom like you?

411
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,001
Kids can say such things.

412
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,378
He apologized enough.

413
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,255
There are things that we shouldn't say.

414
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,674
It's a parents' duty to teach their kids.

415
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,677
Are you saying that
I didn't educate my child?

416
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,054
Giving birth doesn't make
someone a good mom.

417
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:44,058
Do you even know what my daughter
went through to raise Seo-jun?

418
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,479
Compared to you who talks
about others behind their backs,

419
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,857
my daughter is a much better mother.

420
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,025
Ma'am, how could you say--

421
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,735
That's enough.

422
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,280
The children might hear you.

423
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,032
Do you want them to find out?

424
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,188
Mom.

425
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,648
Did you have a bad day today?

426
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,527
Why would I have a bad day?

427
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,324
I'm just thinking of Seo-jun.

428
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,624
If he hears that
he doesn't take after his mom,

429
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,376
how terrible would he feel?

430
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,003
You said that Seo-jun didn't hear them.

431
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,506
He didn't hear them today,

432
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,051
but he could hear them in the future.

433
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,558
Su-hyeon.

434
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,685
Let's tell Seo-jun the truth.

435
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,103
Mom--

436
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,148
Don't let him find out from someone else.
You tell him first.

437
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,692
No matter how much I think about it,
it's for the best.

438
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,902
Either way,

439
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,238
he will find out one day.

440
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,220
Why isn't there a picture book today?

441
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:45,972
Aren't you going to read?

442
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,141
Instead of reading a book,

443
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,686
I have something to tell you today.

444
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,895
A story?

445
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,939
What is it?

446
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,195
Seo-jun, I had

447
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,989
one sister.

448
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,201
She was amazing, pretty, and kind.

449
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,037
She was a cheerful person.

450
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,331
She married a wonderful person,

451
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,333
and even had a beautiful baby.

452
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,836
Where is she now?

453
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,593
She's in heaven,
where only good people go.

454
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,429
From there,

455
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,557
she's watching over us.

456
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,691
The two of them left me a present

457
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,818
so that I wouldn't be lonely.

458
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,071
That present was you.

459
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,411
I have a video.

460
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,246
Do you want to watch it?

461
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,416
Okay.

462
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,973
<i>He's so adorable.</i>

463
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,808
- Is that me?
<i>- He's so cute.</i>

464
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,977
<i>He's so beautiful.</i>

465
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,021
<i>- He's so tiny.</i>
- Yes, and

466
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,857
- this is your mom and dad.
<i>- Come and join us.</i>

467
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,442
<i>- Say hello to your aunt.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

468
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,526
<i>Aunt.</i>

469
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,904
- Hello, Seo-jun.
- How cute.

470
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,489
Welcome to our family.

471
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,074
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

472
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,409
- Seo-jun.
- What's that?

473
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,620
- He's going to grow a lot.
- Is it tasty?

474
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,372
He can even stand up.

475
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,666
Good job.

476
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,044
- Walk, walk.
- Do you want to go there?

477
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,587
Walk, walk.

478
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,927
Let's go to your dad.

479
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,844
- Go to your dad.
- Here.

480
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,429
<i>Good boy!</i>

481
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,098
<i>How adorable.</i>

482
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,230
It's been a long time
since I saw you as a baby.

483
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,399
What do you think?

484
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,776
Don't the three of you look similar?

485
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,860
Yeah.

486
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:08,989
Seo-jun.

487
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,409
Your mom and dad

488
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,870
loved you very much.

489
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,248
By the way,

490
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:21,794
why did Mom and Dad go to heaven?

491
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,548
There was an accident.

492
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,717
Your parents got hurt a lot.

493
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,638
They went somewhere
where they won't be hurt anymore.

494
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,227
- Mom.
- Yes?

495
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,980
Does it mean that I have two moms?

496
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,531
Right.

497
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,575
You have two moms.

498
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,160
You also have a dad.

499
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,621
They may not be with you,

500
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,832
but if you remember them,

501
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,667
they'll be with you.

502
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,961
Okay.

503
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,130
Mom.

504
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,882
Thank you for raising me.

505
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,142
Seo-jun.

506
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,858
I love you very much.

507
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,611
I love you too, Mom.

508
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,456
Why are you still at work?

509
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:23,874
Hey.

510
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,251
Why didn't you go home?

511
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,752
Is something wrong?

512
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,255
I don't come here
only when something's wrong.

513
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,882
I had a meeting nearby,
and I thought of you.

514
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,342
Is everything really okay?

515
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,927
Are things okay with Chairman Woo?

516
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,845
Of course, same as always.

517
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,181
He still doesn't like me.

518
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,060
Got a lot to do?

519
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,190
A lot happened during the day.
I needed some time to think.

520
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,984
What is it about?

521
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,571
It's <i>Rainbow Bingsu</i>.

522
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,239
It's Ms. Jung's book.

523
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,490
It's by Seo-jun's mother.

524
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:00,160
Wait, do you know Seo-jun's mother?

525
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,707
Oh, well…

526
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,626
I've met her a few times.

527
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,213
Why?

528
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,507
Did something happen to Seo-jun?

529
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,599
She must have a lot on her mind.

530
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,940
WRITER JUNG SU-HYEON

531
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,282
<i>What are you doing right now?</i>

532
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,366
What?

533
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,009
Are you okay?

534
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,302
You came.

535
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,764
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly.

536
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,141
It's just that

537
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,935
I had no one else to talk to.

538
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,233
How did you know that was my expertise?

539
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,444
Say everything you want to say.

540
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,905
I'm a good listener.

541
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,532
I'm a pro-listener, you know?

542
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,119
I miss my sister.

543
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,667
I just miss my sister a lot today.

544
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,006
Su-jin.

545
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,259
Am I doing a good job?

546
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,766
Didn't you just hear it?

547
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,018
She said you're doing very well.

548
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,278
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.

549
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,364
Don't be sorry.

550
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,140
It's okay.

551
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,115
HEADHUNTING WORK CONTRACT

552
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,326
I'm sorry for making you wait.

553
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,579
Don't be. I prefer to make it clear.

554
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,330
You accepted my request.

555
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,459
It shows that my company can be trusted.

556
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,544
You must be quite busy.

557
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,921
I saw many articles
about Ikonic Biotechnology.

558
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,173
Yes, it's hard to keep up.

559
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,216
With the sudden increase in size,

560
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,553
I feel anxious and puzzled
at the same time.

561
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:08,223
You're being rewarded for your
long commitment to develop the new drug.

562
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,143
Speaking of which,

563
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,938
could Peoplez exclusively take charge
of hiring our personnel?

564
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,065
The company will keep getting bigger.

565
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:21,069
I'm a researcher stuck in the lab all day,
so I'm hopeless in this field.

566
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:25,324
It's hard to estimate how many more
employees I need to hire.

567
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:29,036
If Peoplez takes charge
of searching for our future employees,

568
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,787
I'll give you a share in my company.

569
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:34,166
As you know, the value could grow
exponentially if we go public.

570
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:37,711
Think of it as growing
with a company with potential.

571
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,588
Please accept my offer.

572
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,299
Thank you for the offer.

573
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,550
I'll think about it.

574
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,676
Sure.

575
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,269
Mr. Kim.

576
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,729
Hey, Mr. Yu.

577
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,272
Is something wrong?

578
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,984
I'm not sure about it,

579
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,111
but I can't get it off my mind.

580
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,240
Changing the direction

581
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,658
- might be okay.
- It's good.

582
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,201
This coffee…

583
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,744
My friend is working at NEXT.

584
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,205
That's why I'm very interested…

585
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:16,041
Why is Jeong-nam with Sung-woong?

586
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,668
It could work.

587
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,838
- Mr. Kim, what are you doing?
- It's nothing. I'm coming.

588
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,424
Now that we met up, I wanted to ask…

589
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,886
Were Jeong-nam and Sung-woong close?

590
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,012
I'm not sure. Why?

591
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,056
Oh, it's nothing.

592
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,683
Let's go.

593
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,851
He used to work here?

594
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,895
Yes, his name is Go Jeong-nam.

595
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,524
After our project with NEXT became public,
he contacted me and we met up.

596
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,985
Since then, he kept asking questions.

597
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,071
It made me uncomfortable,
so I ignored his calls.

598
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:49,032
He definitely told me
that he left this field.

599
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,828
If he keeps seeing employees from Peoplez,

600
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,413
he must have an ulterior motive.

601
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,914
- Right?
- Yes.

602
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,875
Did he contact you right after
the article about NEXT got published?

603
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,878
The one who needs information
related to that the most…

604
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,881
Career Way.

605
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:09,136
Could it be why their candidates
overlapped with ours?

606
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,889
I'll find out.

607
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,392
- Did you say anything else?
- No.

608
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,685
I'm not that stupid.

609
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:20,439
I read that Peoplez is in charge
of finding a CEO for NEXT.

610
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:24,526
Instead of those formerly in management,
people like lawyers and journalists…

611
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,820
No, I can't.

612
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,280
It's a trade secret.

613
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:32,909
Mr. Yu.

614
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,332
I think I made a mistake.

615
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,462
Dong-gi, it's me. Can you do me a favor?

616
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,465
Can you make a request to Career Way?
Like it's from Hansu Electronics.

617
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,009
You're amazing. Thanks.

618
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:56,642
Ms. Kang, I verified that
Go Jeong-nam works at Career Way.

619
00:48:56,725 --> 00:49:00,604
Does it mean Jeong-nam has been
stealing information on our candidates?

620
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:05,651
And he approached Mr.
Kim to steal information?

621
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:10,989
I'm sorry, Ms. Kang.

622
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,533
I know people can't be trusted,

623
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,327
but I didn't expect this.

624
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,704
I treated Jeong-nam so well.

625
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,955
How could he betray me?

626
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,959
Did he take our database
when he left Peoplez?

627
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,880
Ms. Kang, we shouldn't let him
get away with this.

628
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,008
We need to come up with a new plan.

629
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,141
- Jeong-nam.
- Mr. Kim.

630
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,935
I'm sorry for being so late.

631
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,269
It's okay.

632
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,979
- Sit down.
- Okay.

633
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,399
The meeting took longer than I thought.

634
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,984
As it's an important project,

635
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,530
it's not easy to decide on the candidates.

636
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,492
So have the candidates been decided?

637
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,495
Yes, they've been decided.

638
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,748
Mr. Kim, would you like
something cool to drink?

639
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,791
If it's on you.

640
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,084
- I'll buy you a drink.
- Wait.

641
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,044
Before that, I need to go to the restroom.

642
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,046
Actually, I'll take my time.

643
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,508
I was worried about being late to see you,
I didn't have a chance to go.

644
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,926
I'll be right back.

645
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,858
Way to go, Mr. Kim.

646
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:31,319
Information on our candidates
was handed over to Career Way.

647
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:35,323
So they think that
it's our final list of candidates?

648
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,784
Serves them right for cheating.

649
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:38,952
This feels satisfying.

650
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:41,997
Shall we start discussing
our real list of candidates?

651
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,373
Yes, ma'am.

652
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,168
We'll start searching for candidates
from the beginning today.

653
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,425
"Resignation rate at NEXT?"

654
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,011
People often change jobs and resign
in this field.

655
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,138
While taking that into consideration,

656
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,141
it'd be worthwhile to take a look
at the resignation rate graph.

657
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,935
At NEXT, people with
the highest resignation rate are

658
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,730
managers and senior managers
of five and ten years.

659
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,608
The most important middle tier at NEXT.

660
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,360
The essential workers left the company,

661
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,737
and only old-timers remain?

662
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,947
Yes, centered around a CEO
with a programming background,

663
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:19,075
there came about a discrimination
against nonprogrammers.

664
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:22,162
The executives are only interested
in keeping their positions.

665
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,165
Hey,

666
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,458
who do you think will be our new CEO?

667
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,793
Will they do it right this time?

668
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,169
That has nothing to do with it.

669
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:32,214
I just hope our workplace politics
won't scare him away.

670
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,883
- Do you know who I pity the most?
- Who?

671
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,052
You and me who get ignored
for not being programmers.

672
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,221
But we can't even resign.

673
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,139
Hey, hey.

674
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,227
- Let's go.
- Come on.

675
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,105
<i>When employees are saying that,</i>

676
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,566
it means that things are rotten
at the workplace.

677
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,444
The real crisis at NEXT
may not be external,

678
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:55,987
but internal.

679
00:51:56,071 --> 00:52:00,575
It might be better to search candidates
from the employees' perspective.

680
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,828
What eventually changes the company

681
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,205
is its employees.

682
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,833
That's all I have.

683
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,546
From now on, we'll be focusing

684
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,339
on NEXT's internal crisis.

685
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,132
We'll start from the beginning

686
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,469
and find the real problem at NEXT
from the employees' perspective.

687
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,428
SEARCHING REVIEWS ON COMPANY

688
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:21,429
NEXT

689
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,515
"COMPARED TO THE SIZE,
LACK OF SOLIDARITY AT WORK"

690
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,433
"AT NEXT,
ONLY BROWNNOSERS GET PROMOTED"

691
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,186
"PROGRAMMERS
GET SPECIAL TREATMENT"

692
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,861
They lost everyone who's competent.

693
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,195
Talkers.

694
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:40,490
Only those who know how to talk
remain in high positions.

695
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,410
Darn it.
Could you find me a new job instead?

696
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,996
Cooperation? Ha!

697
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,123
I can't even talk with programmers.

698
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,208
I only do what I get paid for.

699
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,460
Not like I get paid more for working hard.

700
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:56,590
Won't it be better with a new CEO?

701
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:02,387
Wouldn't it be great
to get rid of all the old-timers?

702
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,264
Look how naive he is.

703
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,266
Want in on a secret?

704
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,686
A new CEO has already been decided.

705
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,813
Again, it's someone to their liking.

706
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,274
Management at NEXT is so predictable.

707
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,442
Just drink.

708
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,986
If you don't mind me asking,
could you tell me

709
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:21,656
what you consider
as the most important in management?

710
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,117
That's a hard question.

711
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,911
I don't know if it answers your question,

712
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:29,831
but on my first day at work,
there's something that I always do.

713
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:37,005
Ms. Kang,
what do you think of this candidate?

714
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,466
He has enough experience
in human resources.

715
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,719
He doesn't have much field experience.

716
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,471
What about this candidate?

717
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,891
He had the highest score from
his co-workers during reference checks.

718
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:51,269
He leads his team
with flexibility and gentle leadership.

719
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,772
Gyu-rim's candidate is known
to be very competent.

720
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:56,441
But, if I can suggest one more person,

721
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,777
NEXT needs to pull out rotten weeds.

722
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,237
It should be someone who's determined.

723
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,111
I feel much better now.

724
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,616
Shall we get some fresh air?

725
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,093
I want to stay like this for ten minutes.

726
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,097
It's almost over, isn't it?

727
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,140
Yes.

728
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,350
You worked really hard.

729
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,477
You too, Ji-yun.

730
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,815
If the project is successful,
shall we go on a trip?

731
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,817
A trip?

732
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,069
Where?

733
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,864
Anywhere.
Is there somewhere you want to go?

734
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:28,867
The sea.

735
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,244
I haven't been to the sea in a long time.

736
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,912
The sea sounds great.

737
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,873
Is there anywhere else you want to go?

738
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:39,461
Tell me. Be it the mountains,
or even outer space.

739
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,588
- Outer space?
- Yes.

740
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,632
Ms. Kang, are you here?

741
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,679
Gyu-rim, what is it?

742
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,681
There you are.

743
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,308
Is Mr. Yu with you?

744
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,310
No, I'm here alone.

745
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,645
He isn't with you?

746
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,982
What? Isn't he at his desk?

747
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,234
No, he isn't. Did he go somewhere?

748
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,111
Maybe he went to the restroom.

749
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:06,780
That's strange.

750
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,240
I thought I heard his voice here.

751
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:12,077
People are quite noisy
on the street tonight.

752
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,495
Goodness.

753
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,497
I see.

754
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,999
I'll go.

755
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,795
Work hard, Gyu-rim.

756
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:26,216
Seriously,

757
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,635
she's so bad at hiding it.

758
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,643
Why did you say that I wasn't here?

759
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,314
I can't tell her
that we were dating at work.

760
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,191
I'll be leaving first.

761
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,026
Come out in five minutes, okay?

762
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,444
What if I get caught?

763
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,905
I'll distract them in the meeting room.

764
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,075
Come out without getting caught.

765
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,037
Okay…

766
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:11,553
During the last month,
both of you worked very hard

767
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,596
searching for the next CEO at NEXT.

768
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,890
I look forward to seeing what candidates

769
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,392
you will recommend.

770
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,978
Among the candidates you recommend today,

771
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:24,399
those who pass the application process
will be interviewed.

772
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,614
This is the final list
of candidates from Peoplez.

773
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,495
All of them are CEOs
with legal or journalist backgrounds.

774
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,414
They'd be most efficient in resolving

775
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:42,250
the crisis for NEXT
in the shortest period of time.

776
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,294
And this is…

777
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,503
APPOINTMENT OF CEO AT NEXT

778
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,754
The risks of those candidates.

779
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:51,050
We will use this to argue
against Kang Ji-yun's suggestions.

780
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,512
Once the candidates are announced,
with this information,

781
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,682
you can eliminate her candidates
during the application process.

782
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,103
APPOINTMENT OF CEO AT NEXT

783
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,230
PEOPLEZ FINAL LIST OF CANDIDATES

784
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,569
Let's start with Peoplez.

785
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:14,324
Please tell us about your candidates
and why you recommend them.

786
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,375
Here's the final list of candidates
that we recommend.

787
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,379
All three of them are experts
in human resources.

788
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,756
They're the best CEOs.

789
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,799
While everyone is focusing
on external matters,

790
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:35,178
they'll bring stability to the company
for the future of NEXT.

791
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,682
I believe

792
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,685
we told you that we needed a CEO

793
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,063
to put our crisis to rest.

794
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:47,148
Since your former CEO, there has been

795
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:50,693
division and discrimination
between programmers and nonprogrammers,

796
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:54,113
managers prioritizing their position
over doing actual work,

797
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,951
and a lack of trust and loyalty
from the employees.

798
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,161
The real crisis at NEXT is…

799
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,412
COMPANY REVIEW ON NEXT

800
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,748
…internal, not external.

801
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,834
I'm sure none of you can deny it.

802
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,092
<i>What eventually changes the company</i>

803
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,094
is its employees.

804
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,223
What leads NEXT
with a sense of responsibility

805
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,683
isn't external assessments.

806
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:25,812
It's those who currently work at NEXT.

807
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,022
To truly benefit NEXT,

808
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,024
please select carefully

809
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,901
the most appropriate CEO.

810
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:57,302
<i>The new CEO at the web portal NEXT</i>
<i>has been decided.</i>

811
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,095
<i>Newly appointed CEO Jung Su-hwan stated</i>

812
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:02,265
<i>bringing stability to the company</i>
<i>as the number one priority.</i>

813
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,725
<i>He added what leads NEXT's future</i>

814
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:07,729
<i>will be supportive company culture</i>
<i>and employee growth.</i>

815
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:11,983
"Also, the new CEO at NEXT was appointed

816
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:15,695
through a search firm called Peoplez!"

817
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,824
Eun-ho!

818
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:20,950
Good job.

819
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,744
Well done!

820
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:25,204
Now, we're the exclusive headhunter
for NEXT, right?

821
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,750
The total number of employees
at NEXT is about 4,000.

822
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,376
It's 4,000 people!

823
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,712
Is it just me? I can't believe it.

824
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:33,838
- You can't believe it?
- No.

825
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,840
I can't believe it either.
What should we do?

826
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,468
We must go out on a company dinner
to believe it!

827
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:39,636
A company dinner.

828
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:40,803
Mr. Kim.

829
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,805
He brought it up so naturally.

830
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,682
What's wrong? A company dinner.

831
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,602
A company dinner!

832
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:51,981
Goodness.

833
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,907
Let's go.

834
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,701
She gave us the corporate card!

835
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,329
- Ms. Kang!
- I made this happen, guys!

836
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,623
- Is everyone in?
- What should we eat?

837
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:11,584
We can get something big
with the black card.

838
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,378
I'd love some dakgalbi!

839
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:16,172
Enjoy your food.

840
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,132
It's on us, so enjoy.

841
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,304
Gosh, it looks delicious.

842
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,765
- Come on, Mr. Kim.
- What?

843
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:29,143
At times like these, you should be QSPN
and move out the way.

844
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,728
QSPN? What's that?

845
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,398
Have you stopped updating your notes?

846
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,233
Am I the only one who doesn't know?

847
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:36,401
At times like these,

848
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:40,154
be quick, smart, and polite to notice.

849
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,614
What do you want me to do?

850
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,033
Please get up and change seats.

851
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,702
Mr. Yu, come this way.

852
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,079
- Goodness.
- This way, please.

853
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:50,039
- Mr. Yu, over here.
- Come this way.

854
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:51,958
Hurry over here.

855
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,585
- That's good.
- You're being so slow.

856
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,129
And here's my bestie.

857
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,173
They didn't tell us about it,
but I'm still jealous.

858
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,717
- Who wants soju?
- Me!

859
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,719
- Cheers.
- Mr. Kim.

860
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,808
Have you tried this?

861
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,184
It looks delicious.

862
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:12,603
Why is this so tender?

863
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,939
- Kyung-hwa.
- When it's this tender,

864
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,149
I need a drink.

865
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,277
We should drink at a time like this.

866
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,867
Drinking never felt so easy.

867
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,453
Kwang-hee, let's liven up the mood.

868
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:30,204
Okay, I'll make us drinks.

869
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,372
Give me your glasses.

870
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,082
- Hand them over.
- Sit back down.

871
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,041
What?

872
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,127
Sit back down.

873
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,378
Sit? Okay.

874
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,342
She must be showing us a new trick.

875
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,238
She's a pro.

876
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:07,742
What was that about?

877
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,661
I don't like the drinks you make.

878
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:11,871
You should've told me before.

879
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,831
Gyu-rim, who exactly are you?

880
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,250
All right!

881
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,085
Attention, everyone.

882
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:22,256
This is a special event to celebrate
the success of our project

883
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,551
and also to promote companionship

884
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,137
among all the employees.

885
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,222
Today…

886
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,350
- One more time!
- Don't do that.

887
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,101
- Drink until the end!
- Stop it.

888
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,436
Oh, please!

889
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,396
Also, Ms. Kang.

890
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:41,943
To commemorate your joining
the company dinner voluntarily,

891
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,569
- a speech, please.
- A speech? No way.

892
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,238
- I don't want to.
- Come on, Ms. Kang.

893
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,281
- No way. Please.
- Ms. Kang!

894
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,034
Quiet down. As you all know,

895
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:52,703
this makes her embarrassed.

896
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:54,997
CEO Kang!

897
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,250
- CEO Kang!
- CEO Kang!

898
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,668
- CEO Kang!
- CEO Kang!

899
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,002
- CEO Kang!
- CEO Kang!

900
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:01,921
Enough!

901
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,301
Let's work hard again starting tomorrow.

902
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,556
- Gosh.
- I don't think I can.

903
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:12,765
What's wrong with her?

904
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,980
The project was successful

905
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,356
thanks to all of you.

906
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,191
Thank you.

907
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,404
What's going on?

908
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,618
Enjoy the food tonight.

909
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,995
Let's have fun.

910
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:35,079
Cheers.

911
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:38,040
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

912
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,376
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

913
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:41,419
You grew up well.

914
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:42,753
Shut up and eat.

915
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,675
Have you thought about
what to do about your job?

916
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,845
Has that been troubling you?

917
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,097
Of course.

918
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,057
It's something that concerns you.

919
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:03,816
I'd like you to work
where your competence can shine more.

920
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,653
Don't I shine at this company?

921
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,363
I'm starting to feel disappointed.

922
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,824
You know that's not what I mean.

923
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:17,163
I realized it once again
during our project on NEXT.

924
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:21,250
It'd be greedy of me to keep
a talented person like you

925
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:22,543
all to myself.

926
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,464
Wow, you finally acknowledge me, Ms. Kang.

927
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:28,674
You're getting arrogant already.

928
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,595
Anyway,

929
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:34,847
don't worry about me.

930
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,184
Make the best decision for yourself.

931
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,233
Okay.

932
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:47,568
I'll think about it.

933
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:51,489
It feels warm.

934
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:53,866
Your hand fits right in.

935
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,618
You just have big hands.

936
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,932
YOU HAVE NEW MESSAGES

937
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,532
<i>Ms. Kang, there are many articles</i>
<i>assuming that it's Peoplez.</i>

938
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:35,866
<i>Is it true?</i>

939
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:39,954
IKONIC BIOTECHNOLOGY, FRAUD
OF 20 BILLION WON… CEO VANISHED

940
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,321
Ms. Kang, is it true
that Peoplez was involved?

941
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,081
Ms. Kang, is it true
that Peoplez was involved?

942
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,541
Were you not aware of it?

943
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,376
Did you recommend the candidate
while knowing?

944
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,253
What will happen to those
hired by the company?

945
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:31,172
Were you not aware at all?

946
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:33,466
- I changed jobs because I trusted you.
- What do I do?

947
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:34,675
- Ms. Kang!
- How could you?

948
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:35,926
<i>She came here?</i>

949
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,636
<i>- The CEO…</i>
<i>- How dare she show up here?</i>

950
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,013
<i>She's a murderer.</i>

951
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:41,557
- Don't you know his whereabouts?
- Since when did this happen?

952
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,100
Anything to say to the victims?

953
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,436
Do you have anything to say?

954
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,714
We'll be conducting a search and seizure
of the office.

955
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,341
Why are you lowering the blinds?

956
01:08:57,424 --> 01:08:58,342
Ms. Kang isn't a criminal!

957
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:00,219
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

958
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,137
<i>Because I hate you.</i>

959
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,931
<i>Career Way will take over Peoplez.</i>

960
01:09:04,014 --> 01:09:04,849
Was it you, Father?

961
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,142
I'm figuring out what to do.

962
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:08,894
If I expect it to be a loss,
I'd need to make a decision.

963
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:09,854
Are you okay?

964
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,438
You won't have to worry about Mr. Yu.

965
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:12,439
I mean, you.

966
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:13,566
Are you okay, Jeong-hoon?

967
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:15,109
Ji-yun, you aren't alone.

968
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:17,486
You weren't and won't be going forth.

969
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,321
<i>I hated my life.</i>

970
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:20,906
- Good morning.
- You came to work early.

971
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,284
<i>- Ever since I met you,</i>
- Hello!

972
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:24,994
<i>I started to like myself.</i>

973
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:30,082
