THE CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS,
COMPANIES, AND PLACES

00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,964
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,925
- Oh no, there seems to be a fire.
- Oh my goodness!

4
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,282
Kids!

5
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,328
Hurry and get out of there!

6
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,250
Please help!

7
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,418
Help!

8
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,421
I'm over here!

9
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,839
Please help!

10
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,571
Sir! Can you take my child?

11
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,243
Ji-yun, wait for me here.

12
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,411
No!

13
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,789
Dad, don't go. Please don't.

14
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,541
Don't go.

15
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,500
I'll bring her right away.

16
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,253
No! Don't go!

17
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,510
My daughter… Daddy'll be right back.

18
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,685
Dad.

19
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,811
Dad!

20
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,521
Dad!

21
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:29,941
Dad!

22
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,571
Dad!

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,413
Dad…

24
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,124
<i>There are still people inside!</i>
<i>We need to use the ladder truck.</i>

25
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,042
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
<i>- They're stuck in the building.</i>

26
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,850
You promised you'd come back.

27
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,519
You promised me!

28
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,396
You told me to wait!

29
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:16,946
No…

30
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,660
No…

31
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,809
- What's going on?
- What?

32
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,644
- What the heck?
- What do you mean?

33
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,272
- The sun is up.
- What?

34
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,274
- What time is it?
- What time is it now?

35
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,486
What's going on here?
What am I doing here?

36
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,322
<i>Dad, get yourself a girlfriend</i>

37
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,699
<i>and go on dates.</i>

38
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,200
<i>It's TGIF.</i>

39
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,910
- You have to go now.
- Where?

40
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,412
- She's on her way.
- Who?

41
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,955
- My daughter!
- Your daughter.

42
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,665
What? Your daughter?

43
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,382
Why did you sleep in?

44
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,758
You didn't set an alarm?

45
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,176
I did, but…

46
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,392
By the way, did we do anything?

47
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,310
Pardon?

48
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,061
We didn't even hold hands.

49
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,730
All we did was eat and sleep--

50
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,856
Is it good, Byeol?

51
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,861
Dad.

52
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,073
Byeol.

53
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,915
- Let's get on.
- Okay.

54
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,375
Ouch.

55
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,960
I'm getting off.

56
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,588
<i>Going up.</i>

57
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,465
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

58
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,399
That person just now…

59
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,943
She seems familiar.

60
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,945
Where did I see her?

61
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,239
- Dad.
- Yes?

62
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,991
- Did you lie to me at all?
- No.

63
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,915
He must have lied.

64
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,751
I didn't.

65
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,844
Feeling better?

66
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,348
Yes, I think it stopped.

67
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,020
- Did she make a fuss?
- Don't get me started.

68
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,730
She cried because her dad wasn't there.

69
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,023
I could barely comfort her with candy.

70
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,025
Thank you so much for today.

71
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,610
I really slept in.

72
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,778
Did you get home late last night?

73
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,780
No…

74
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,827
Did you sleep on the sofa?

75
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,287
No, I mean…

76
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,207
I cleaned,
but this must have slipped my mind.

77
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,546
I'll babysit Seo-jun today.

78
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,299
I'd be so grateful.

79
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,974
Was someone else here yesterday?

80
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,529
PEOPLEZ CEO KANG JI-YUN

81
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,613
<i>Did you get home…</i>

82
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,619
<i>I'm sorry about…</i>

83
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,461
Jeez.

84
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,529
EPISODE 6

85
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,869
That kiddo is Mr. Yu's daughter?

86
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,247
No wonder.

87
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,167
They felt oddly similar.

88
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,929
YOU DID AN EXCELLENT JOB

89
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,933
<i>You did an excellent job.</i>

90
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,941
A compliment should be done properly.

91
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,467
- Hello.
- Hello.

92
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,469
Hello.

93
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,054
Please wait.

94
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,309
<i>- The doors are opening.</i>
- Thank you.

95
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,943
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

96
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,199
Good morning.

97
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,327
Good morning.

98
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,039
Did you have a good weekend?

99
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,125
Well…

100
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,502
Did you also have a good weekend?

101
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,130
Yes, I had a good weekend.

102
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,299
Except for being kicked out.

103
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,678
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,971
Did you get home safely?

105
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,849
That's why I came to work.

106
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,727
Took long enough for you to ask.

107
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,023
Your daughter…

108
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,609
Did she say anything in particular?

109
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,485
Daughter?

110
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,864
Never mind. Forget it.

111
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,909
Let me ask you one thing.

112
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,038
- Why did you kick me out?
- Why did you run away?

113
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,789
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

114
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:29,629
- Let's go.
- Let's…

115
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,767
- Mom.
- Hi, Ju-hee.

116
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,686
- Did you get pricked? Let me see.
- It's okay.

117
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,147
- Are you bleeding?
- No, I'm not.

118
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,275
I feel terrible. Look at your hands.

119
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,819
It isn't unusual for a seamstress.

120
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,322
Was there traffic on your way here?

121
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,657
No, it was fine.

122
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,244
Do you have a lot of work these days?

123
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,831
Of course.
You know how amazing my skills are.

124
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,459
Ju-hee,

125
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,254
some people called headhunters--

126
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,840
Mom, can't you just quit your job?

127
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,468
What?

128
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:21,097
You sew every day sitting here
in this dingy little place.

129
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,100
Your hands are covered with blisters
from working with leather.

130
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,935
Just for a few bucks.

131
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,152
Now, both my husband and I earn money.

132
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,613
Stop working so hard and close up shop.

133
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,992
Whenever I look at your hands,

134
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,953
I feel terrible.

135
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,734
Are these so horrible to look at?

136
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,489
<i>Your hands that have worked</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

137
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,074
They must find it unfair.

138
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,619
Ma'am, your hands are very special.

139
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,165
Don't underestimate

140
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,833
the value of your time spent.

141
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,433
Excuse me.

142
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,437
I'm here to meet CEO Kang Ji-yun.

143
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,981
Well, Ms. Kang is…

144
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,441
Oh, Ms. Cho!

145
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,281
Ms. Cho, have you made up your mind?

146
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,618
If someone needs my help, I'll do it.

147
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,244
I mean,

148
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,370
I'd like to try.

149
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,206
Gosh, Ms. Cho!

150
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,500
Goodness, I…

151
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,751
Gosh.

152
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,421
Ms. Cho, you saved me.

153
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,466
CHICKEN GALBI
PALGAKDO

154
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,260
It looks so delicious.

155
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,637
Try this.

156
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,347
I'm gonna have a bigger piece.

157
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:31,268
It's so tender. Try it. Go on.

158
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,234
What do you think? Isn't it tender?

159
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,653
It's okay.

160
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,613
How about some fried rice? I'll order it.

161
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,573
Ma'am, one fried rice, please!

162
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:54,166
I'm so glad that we found a candidate
for Deluxe Line before the deadline.

163
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,502
I'm so relieved.

164
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,004
Ms. Cho made up her mind
faster than I expected.

165
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:03,884
This is all thanks to Mr. Yu
and Kwang-hee's hard work.

166
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,553
Did you give them compliments?

167
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,096
Doesn't everyone work hard?

168
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,100
I told you not to judge people
based on your standards.

169
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,270
Then again, Eun-ho is just as bad.

170
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,938
He must have gotten it from you.

171
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:20,359
Last time, when Byeol went camping,
he insisted on working…

172
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,280
Wouldn't it be nice not to bring that up?

173
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,658
After working everyone up,
you canceled it last minute, Ms. Seo.

174
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,953
I couldn't help it.
I had a prior commitment.

175
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,163
I'm the one who's sad about not going.

176
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,832
You had good food thanks to me.

177
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,835
Isn't Eun-ho an amazing cook?

178
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,463
That, I agree.

179
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,301
The kiddo who comes often
to the bookstore.

180
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,177
- Her?
- Is that Mr. Yu's daughter?

181
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,470
Yeah, Byeol.

182
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,098
Kang-seok told me
that the two of you have met often.

183
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,851
Didn't he raise her well
as a single parent?

184
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,147
She's clever and cute.

185
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,275
By the way,

186
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,777
since when did he raise her by himself?

187
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,697
I heard that they got divorced
before Byeol's first birthday.

188
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,865
- Divorced?
- Yes.

189
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,159
I heard that they were
a famous couple at college.

190
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,953
They got married right after graduation,
so everyone expected them to be happy.

191
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,290
Even Kang-seok was surprised
when they divorced so soon.

192
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,375
They got separated with an infant.

193
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,004
Why did they break up?

194
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,715
Kang-seok doesn't know why exactly.

195
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,509
Eun-ho isn't the type to talk about it.

196
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,597
I think he raised Byeol
with a lot of determination.

197
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,432
Being a single parent can't be easy.

198
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,726
He completely dedicated himself to Byeol.

199
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,436
For paternity leave…

200
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,608
What? Why did you stop mid-sentence?

201
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,445
Aren't I talking about him recklessly?

202
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,280
- He's not just anyone.
- Right… What?

203
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,824
He's not just anyone?

204
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,620
What? You think…

205
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,663
He's my secretary.

206
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,166
I should know about my secretary's past.

207
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,295
Didn't you tell me to be more interested
in my employees?

208
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,213
Right.

209
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:07,257
Being interested in your employees
without ulterior motives is good.

210
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,428
Byeol used to be a sickly child,

211
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,056
so he gave up everything,
including his career.

212
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,101
He took a leave of absence
to stay with Byeol.

213
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,104
That's why people at work
disapproved of him.

214
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,023
Eun-ho is an amazing dad.

215
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,071
Why did you go on paternal leave?

216
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,531
You were in your heyday
to progress your career.

217
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,825
I wanted to see her smile.

218
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,535
My daughter has the sweetest smile.

219
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,206
She wanted it.

220
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,375
And I promised her
that I'd be by her side.

221
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,835
I was keeping that promise.

222
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,796
Because I'm all that she has.

223
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,884
You're right.

224
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,137
He's a good dad.

225
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,933
That tickles.

226
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,727
If you move, it'll get everywhere.

227
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,895
Okay, I'll try to hold my breath.

228
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,984
Why are you into nail polish
all of a sudden?

229
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,527
You weren't interested a while ago.

230
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,154
To show it to an amazing woman.

231
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,740
The one you met at the bookstore?

232
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,784
I don't know who it is,
but you must like her.

233
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,661
I'll introduce you next time.

234
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,247
Stay still. It's going to smudge.

235
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,753
Are you looking at me with adoring eyes?

236
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,007
You look super ugly
because you're concentrating.

237
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,135
No, Daddy always looks very handsome
when he's concentrating.

238
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,222
All done.

239
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,016
What do you think? You like it?

240
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,976
Well, not too bad.

241
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,479
Wait five minutes until it dries
before you go to sleep.

242
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,356
Dad, you put it on, too.

243
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,025
No, I don't have to.

244
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,903
- Do I really have to?
- Yeah.

245
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,163
- Stay still.
- That tickles.

246
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,571
Ms. Kang, I'll be honest.

247
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,949
I was offended when I got this document.

248
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,784
I didn't lose my number one candidate

249
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,745
and waited this long to get someone
like her as a recommendation.

250
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,288
Did you want to hire someone

251
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,624
with an impressive background
instead of real competence?

252
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,793
You haven't seen anything yet.

253
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,339
Please test her skills.

254
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,509
Any method of your choice will work.

255
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,219
Are you that certain?

256
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,680
I don't recommend candidates
without certainty.

257
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,351
Mr. Jin.

258
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:10,274
- What is it? This is rude.
- I apologize, but you should look at this.

259
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,991
LUXURY BAG BOUGHT FROM
DELUXE LINE, ACTUALLY A FAKE?

260
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,785
LUXURY BRAND BAGS
SOLD ON DELUXE LINE

261
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,703
SUSPECTED TO BE COUNTERFEIT…

262
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,329
"KNOCKOFF CONTROVERSY"

263
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,498
What's this?

264
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,918
A bag bought from us
was appraised by Luxury Seller.

265
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,753
It was revealed to be a counterfeit.

266
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,965
Luxury Seller?
The one that took our candidate?

267
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,178
Let's talk about recruitment next time.
I need to solve this first.

268
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,726
So what are they saying?

269
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,768
Why do they think it's fake?

270
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,938
The spacing in the logo is
minutely different from the genuine.

271
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,442
Call the customer to confirm the facts.
Then contact the distributor…

272
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,236
What's the matter?
Is it something serious?

273
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,405
The company must be facing a problem.

274
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,995
Gosh, what's this? Knockoff controversy?

275
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,124
Of all the companies,
Luxury Seller is involved.

276
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,001
This problem can only get worse.

277
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,336
Let's see what happens.

278
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,796
But it looks genuine.

279
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,423
It looks genuine?

280
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:21,220
I can't be 100% sure
without looking at it myself.

281
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,097
If you do, can you make a
definitive judgment?

282
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,024
Here's the bag
that we got from the customer.

283
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,568
What do you think? Is it fake or real?

284
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,237
It is…

285
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,365
real.

286
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,244
The number of stitches, their angle,
direction, thickness,

287
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,079
and spacing are even and accurate.

288
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:16,168
The lined backstitches are different
from curved backstitches.

289
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,544
Those are also accurate.

290
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:22,174
Aren't they easy to copy
by manufacturers who customize bags?

291
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,217
That's possible.

292
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,305
That's frustrating.

293
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,432
- If that's possible--
- Mr. Jin.

294
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,101
Please let her finish.

295
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:38,982
However, it's impossible to copy
the leather coating.

296
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,611
Each brand has their own standard
on the coating of leather.

297
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,822
A tiny difference can change its texture.

298
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,407
That can't be expressed in numbers.

299
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,286
You can tell the difference in coating
when you touch it.

300
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,414
I don't know the exact measurement,

301
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,208
but I recognize it…

302
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,836
with my fingertips.

303
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,590
Mr. Jin,
please publish a rebuttal article.

304
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,970
Can I really trust her words
and take the risk?

305
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,933
Whether you trust her or not is up to you.

306
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,644
Right, but if you hadn't lost
that candidate,

307
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,646
this wouldn't have happened!

308
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,981
Do you still trust him more?

309
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,817
Then agree that it's fake.

310
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,069
Ms. Kang, are you saying
that we sold an imitation?

311
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,823
My company boasts transparency in
importing, clearing customs, and delivery!

312
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,826
We confirmed that there was
no problem during delivery.

313
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,286
Then it's settled.

314
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,914
You say that it's real,
and our candidate confirms it.

315
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,041
There's no reason for hesitation.

316
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,586
Mr. Jin, you should make
your statement first

317
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,714
and send the bag to the manufacturer
for accurate appraisal.

318
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,813
Say you're sorry!

319
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,189
I said, apologize!

320
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,030
Jung-tae.

321
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,658
Jung-tae, are you okay?

322
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,036
Seo-jun, you shouldn't push him.

323
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,502
I'm sorry, Director.

324
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,212
I'm very sorry.

325
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,256
How is he? Is he okay?

326
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,009
Yes. Luckily, he wasn't hurt.

327
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,803
I explained that
to Jung-tae's mother as well.

328
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,181
That's a relief.

329
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,934
Seo-jun isn't one to do that.

330
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,187
So why did he?

331
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,107
I think Jung-tae teased Seo-jun.

332
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,651
It hurt his sense of pride,
so he won't tell me.

333
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,285
Jung Seo-jun, are you
really not going to say why

334
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,579
even to me, your grandma?

335
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,583
Then tell me, Byeol.

336
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,628
Byeol, why did Seo-jun fight
with his friend?

337
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,379
Well--

338
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,298
Don't ask Byeol about it.

339
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,137
Then will you tell me?

340
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:23,146
Byeol, could you give us some privacy?

341
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,191
Grandma, I want to go
to uncle's bookstore.

342
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,943
Over there.

343
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,946
That's a good idea.

344
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,322
I'll walk you there.

345
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,327
DODAM BOOK STORE

346
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,891
What are you doing here?

347
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,809
Oh, sis.

348
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,936
Aren't you here to read?
Why aren't you inside?

349
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,031
Isn't it adorable?

350
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,491
It's a baby.

351
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,745
But it's been alone for a while.

352
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,666
Do you want to find its mom?

353
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:33,925
Maybe it was also abandoned by its mom.

354
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,856
Then we can find its dad.

355
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,692
A mom may not be necessary.

356
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,529
Its dad might be
looking for it desperately.

357
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,200
This is a secret.

358
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,912
My mom passed away when I was young,

359
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,122
so I only had my dad.

360
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:05,999
Really?

361
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,835
Didn't the other kids tease you?

362
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,255
I didn't play with such lowly kids.

363
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,385
I don't know if you'll understand this,

364
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,056
but love is about quality, not quantity.

365
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,559
Having two parents doesn't mean
that you get loved twice as much.

366
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,104
One person who loves you
unconditionally is enough.

367
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,327
Kitty!

368
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:46,873
Byeol!

369
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:52,045
Jung-tae teased us
for not having a mom and a dad.

370
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,004
What?

371
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,132
He said that Byeol and I
have half families.

372
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,136
How…

373
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,764
Where did he learn to talk like that?

374
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,851
- Seo-jun--
- Grandma.

375
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,852
I'm okay.

376
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,896
We aren't half a family.

377
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,982
I have Mom and Grandma.

378
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,609
There's everyone.

379
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,153
Exactly, we aren't half a family.

380
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,906
There are so many who love you.

381
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,159
You should have just ignored him.

382
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,911
Why did you push him?

383
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:30,291
I'm okay, but I did it
in case Byeol felt bad.

384
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,919
Did Byeol also hear him say that?

385
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:35,964
Yes. Byeol is very upset about it.

386
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,096
You did well.

387
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,267
Gosh, my baby is all grown up.

388
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,440
Still, you should never hit anyone.

389
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,483
That's a terrible thing to do.

390
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,110
Okay.

391
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,738
But one thing,

392
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,614
aren't I my mom's baby?

393
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,494
Byeol isn't here?

394
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,205
No, Byeol hasn't been here today.

395
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,126
I walked her all the way to the door
a moment ago.

396
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,586
You did?

397
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,380
I'll go outside and look for her.

398
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,134
Where did she go?

399
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,221
Where could she have gone?

400
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,598
BYEOL'S DAD

401
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,229
SEO-JUN'S GRANDMA

402
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:39,402
Dang. Luxury Seller published
another article for rebuttal.

403
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,489
They still insist that it's a counterfeit.

404
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,950
Don't most companies usually stay quiet?

405
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,870
It feels like they're blowing things out
of proportion on purpose.

406
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,747
They're creating a competition
between two companies.

407
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,833
The result will determine
whose appraisal system is more accurate.

408
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,129
Are they that confident or what?

409
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,549
Ms. Cho… Do you think she'll be okay?

410
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,384
I'll call her.

411
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,648
MISSED CALL

412
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,024
WRITER JUNG

413
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,695
Su-hyeon, is something the matter?

414
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,159
Byeol?

415
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,203
Okay, I'm on my way.

416
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,540
Eun-ho, did something happen to Byeol?

417
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,583
Ms. Seo, I have to go now.

418
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,627
Go. You can explain later.

419
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,088
What's wrong?

420
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,881
Eun-ho!

421
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,259
<i>There are people who saw Byeol</i>
<i>in front of the bookstore.</i>

422
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,387
<i>After reporting it to the police,</i>
<i>they began searching for her.</i>

423
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,639
<i>I'm also on my way to the bookstore.</i>

424
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,891
<i>Don't worry, Daddy Yu.</i>

425
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,476
<i>She must be somewhere nearby.</i>

426
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,649
PEOPLEZ CEO KANG JI-YUN

427
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,989
Ms. Kang, I'm on my way somewhere.

428
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,241
- <i>Byeol is with me.</i>
- Pardon?

429
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:11,327
Byeol crashed into a bicycle
in front of the bookstore.

430
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,537
She isn't seriously injured.

431
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,330
- Just a slight--
- Where are you?

432
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,221
Excuse me.

433
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,472
Have you seen Byeol?

434
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,183
She's went out for a moment.
She'll be right back.

435
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,897
- Dad.
- Byeol!

436
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,484
Let me see. Are you okay?

437
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,153
Dad, I'm sorry.

438
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,947
A kitten suddenly ran away.

439
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,199
It doesn't hurt at all.

440
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,492
Really.

441
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,622
Her wound was treated.

442
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,790
Just in case, they ran a few more tests.

443
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,375
The results aren't out yet.

444
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,547
I'm sorry.

445
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,676
How come you were with Byeol?

446
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,764
I told you. She's the amazing woman
from the bookstore.

447
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,065
Well, I…

448
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,317
Thank you for everything.

449
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:25,944
By the way,

450
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,281
I didn't expect you
to be the person Byeol mentioned.

451
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,034
I also found out recently.

452
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,912
Go in. She's alone.

453
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,539
Okay, I have some work
I haven't finished--

454
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,167
Think only about your child today.

455
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,922
See you later.

456
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,392
Yes, Ms. Seo?

457
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,852
Right, today's meeting.

458
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,231
I'll be there in about an hour.

459
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,026
Okay, let's have it tomorrow morning then.

460
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,653
Yeah.

461
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,613
Today, Eun-ho…

462
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,366
You met him? Where?

463
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,159
How did you meet him?

464
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,037
Oh, okay.

465
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,414
Talk to you later.

466
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,668
What is it? Has Ms. Kang met with Mr. Yu?

467
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,005
Yes, he went to search for Byeol
because she disappeared.

468
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,091
But I wonder how Ms. Kang met Eun-ho.

469
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,095
That's strange.

470
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,763
Gosh.

471
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,976
Those two seem to
keep getting involved with each other,

472
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,061
or am I just imagining it?

473
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,480
Who am I supposed to blame?

474
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,942
You, since you brought Mr. Yu here,

475
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,569
or the heavens?

476
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,404
What are you talking about?

477
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,575
So our meeting is canceled, right?

478
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,826
I'm getting off work.

479
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,081
What's wrong with him?

480
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,042
What is he…

481
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,460
What is he talking about?

482
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,857
Is Seo-jun okay?

483
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,109
He fell asleep.
He must be tired after today.

484
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,695
It must've been shocking for him.

485
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,531
Byeol isn't seriously injured, is she?

486
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,408
No. I'm going to the hospital now.

487
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,160
I'll call you after I see her.

488
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,661
Okay, you should go.

489
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,790
I feel embarrassed to see Byeol's dad.

490
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,335
- How could I have left her…
- Mom.

491
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,212
Don't say that.

492
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,255
Stop worrying and get some rest.

493
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,257
You were shocked the most today.

494
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,512
Su-hyeon.

495
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,389
I realized today

496
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,934
that Seo-jun isn't just a baby.

497
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,937
How long will you keep it a secret?

498
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,022
It's about time Seo-jun should find out.

499
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,361
Yes, I'll think about it.

500
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,154
Okay.

501
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,698
You know what to do with him.

502
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,119
- You'd better go.
- Okay. I'll be back.

503
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,620
I'll call you.

504
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,088
<i>Something happened at kindergarten today.</i>

505
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,925
<i>One of their friends teased them</i>
<i>for both having single parents.</i>

506
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,345
<i>According to Seo-jun,</i>
<i>it made Byeol very upset.</i>

507
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,598
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>it's the first time this has happened.</i>

508
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,030
Ms. Kang?

509
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,206
In case you haven't eaten.

510
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,584
PORRIDGE

511
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,692
Are you okay?

512
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,571
Oh, yes.

513
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,911
Actually,

514
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,121
I'm not sure.

515
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,127
I think I'm trying my best…

516
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,464
but sometimes,

517
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,300
I feel like I'm hitting a wall.

518
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,311
You're doing well.

519
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,605
At least,

520
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,485
you're always by Byeol's side
when she needs you.

521
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,117
I'm sure that Byeol knows

522
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,287
that her dad is making an effort.

523
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,416
So,

524
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,003
just like now,

525
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,924
always be by your daughter's side.

526
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,632
Excuse me, where is the emergency room?

527
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,801
- It's that way.
- Thank you.

528
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,307
Eun-ho, how's Byeol?

529
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,725
Hi, Su-hyeon.

530
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,229
Say hello. She's the CEO at my work.

531
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,274
Hello.

532
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,903
This is Jung Su-hyeon, a writer.

533
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,240
I'm a friend of Eun-ho's.
I've heard a lot about you.

534
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,660
I see. Hello.

535
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,454
I'll get going.

536
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,415
- Wait a moment.
- Okay.

537
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,125
I'll be fine.
You don't have to walk me out.

538
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,844
How's Byeol?

539
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,097
Oh, she just fell asleep.

540
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,140
Let's go in.

541
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,109
- Su-hyeon.
- Yeah?

542
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:23,944
Right.

543
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,075
I hope that everything goes well today.

544
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,327
I'm a little scared to read the news.

545
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,496
- Hello, Kyung-hwa.
- Hello.

546
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,373
- Hello, Gyu-rim.
- Good morning.

547
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,209
Mr. Yu, is your daughter okay?

548
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,627
Yes, she's fine now.

549
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,755
I'm so glad. Everyone was really worried.

550
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,006
Thank you.

551
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,843
Go ahead.

552
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,472
Gyu-rim?

553
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,351
Both of you should look at this.

554
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,774
DELUXE LINE FAILS
TO RECRUIT APPRAISER

555
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:02,691
WILL THEY GET THEIR REVENGE?

556
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,863
It must be an article from Career Way.

557
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,949
How so very sneaky.

558
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,827
Their argument is solely based
on the appraiser's background.

559
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,495
Isn't this a big slap in the face?

560
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,249
This makes it unfavorable for Deluxe Line.

561
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,585
The press was divided equally,
but after these articles got published…

562
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,295
Who's this person?

563
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,338
- What?
- What is it?

564
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,673
Is it another article?

565
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,426
Those famous for
their online content on luxury brands.

566
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,262
They're having a party taking a stab
at this war since yesterday.

567
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,431
They've been running their own appraisals.

568
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,767
Experts from everywhere have taken action.

569
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,102
So what are they saying?

570
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,647
All of them are saying that it's fake.

571
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,029
DELUXE LINE BAG IS FAKE

572
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,079
DELUXE LINE GONNA GO BANKRUPT
IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE FAKE

573
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,747
LUXURY SELLER IS RIGHT,
WHAT HAS DELUXE LINE EVER DONE…

574
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,833
IS IT TRUE DELUXE LINE HIRED
A SEAMSTRESS AS THEIR APPRAISER?

575
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:01,917
YUP, IT'S TRUE

576
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,169
Mr. Yu.

577
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,462
Let's go visit her workshop.

578
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,088
Yes, ma'am.

579
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,147
GAEMI TAILORING

580
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,357
One moment.

581
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,569
Ms. Cho?

582
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,030
Ms. Cho.

583
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,242
She's not here.

584
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,373
Is Ms. Cho here?

585
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,960
Hello, you must be looking for my mom.

586
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,090
Yes.

587
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,637
DELUXE LINE FAILS
TO RECRUIT APPRAISER

588
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,554
WILL THEY GET THEIR REVENGE?

589
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,770
I had no idea
that the problem got so serious.

590
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,149
What happens if her appraisal is wrong?

591
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,026
Would she be responsible for it?

592
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,612
As a candidate that we recommended,

593
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,322
Ms. Cho only appraised the item.

594
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:16,283
The appraisal result won't put her
at any disadvantage.

595
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,662
But the job offer might be canceled.

596
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:22,790
What if my mom doesn't want to work there?

597
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,291
Can she refuse?

598
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,584
That is up to Ms. Cho.

599
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,753
She hasn't been hired yet.

600
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,383
What do the two of you think?

601
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:36,053
Do you think my mom's judgment
on the bag is correct?

602
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:41,058
What about you? What do you think?

603
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,565
A few days ago,
I told my mom to quit working.

604
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,692
I didn't want to see her suffer anymore.

605
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,820
I don't know how it got to this point.

606
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,034
Have you ever asked Ms. Cho
why she continues to do this work?

607
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,330
She only took a break of two years
during her 37-year career.

608
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,375
To raise you until you turned two.

609
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:08,502
She told me.

610
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,756
That's why I'd like her to quit her job
and take a break.

611
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:17,761
She told me that she was happy to work.

612
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,056
When she smelled the leather at this shop
after that two-year break,

613
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,933
she loved it.

614
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:27,271
I don't think she's working
just to make money.

615
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,648
She's very proud of her work.

616
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,735
Just like how proud you are of your work.

617
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,739
Stop working so hard and close up shop.

618
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,366
Just for a few bucks.

619
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,042
Mom.

620
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:50,878
Ju-hee.

621
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,922
Ju-hee.

622
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,009
Don't you worry. I won't take the job.

623
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,803
Ms. Kang and Eun-ho,
I don't want to do it.

624
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,221
I don't think I can.

625
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,265
Let's just pretend that nothing happened.

626
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,643
Do you really want to quit?

627
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,729
Everyone says that I'm wrong.

628
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,648
I thought you were the smart ones.

629
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,067
I didn't think that it was this serious,

630
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,527
and I don't want to be responsible for it.

631
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:20,532
We should stop here before
the damage gets worse.

632
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:24,370
Ms. Cho, do you think that they're right?

633
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:28,165
Who would even believe me?

634
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,755
Mom.

635
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:38,967
I believe you.

636
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,096
If you say that it's real,

637
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,682
then it's real.

638
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:50,062
My mom doesn't know how to pull tricks.

639
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,399
To protect people's memories,

640
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,443
she delves into it and studies every day,

641
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,736
coming up with new material.

642
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,071
LEATHER RESEARCH
NATURAL LEATHER

643
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,407
All her life,

644
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:03,909
that's how she's lived.

645
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,663
I'm not saying this because she's my mom.

646
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,624
In whatever field it may be,
you can trust…

647
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,044
someone like her.

648
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,171
I guarantee it.

649
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,386
Ju-hee.

650
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,389
Mom.

651
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,768
How can you not believe in yourself?

652
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,229
You're an amazing person.

653
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,398
I know that.

654
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,317
Do what you want.

655
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,663
What would you like to do?

656
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,332
Please make your choice, Ms. Cho.

657
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,505
THE REAL FIGHT BEHIND
THE IMITATION CONTROVERSY

658
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,090
WHO WILL
THE MANUFACTURER SIDE WITH?

659
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,450
Mr. Jin, the result
of the official appraisal has arrived.

660
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,316
The bag is genuine.

661
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,992
APPRAISAL SHOWS THAT
THE PRODUCT IS GENUINE

662
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,078
I told you that it was genuine.

663
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,671
- Ms. Cho.
- Gosh.

664
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:22,965
You saved me.

665
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,927
I look forward to working with you.

666
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,638
The pleasure is all mine.

667
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,306
Please get up, Mr. Jin.

668
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,108
<i>Regarding the controversial product,</i>
<i>the manufacturer stated</i>

669
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:45,612
<i>that the logo's arrangement was changed</i>
<i>due to their new production line.</i>

670
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,781
<i>To prevent counterfeits,</i>

671
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:51,368
<i>the brand changes the production line</i>
<i>once every few years…</i>

672
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:52,828
I apologize, Ms. Kim.

673
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,539
Regarding the charges
on breach of contract with Luxury Seller,

674
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,957
I'll take care of it.

675
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,710
Peoplez found a better candidate.

676
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:04,673
Thanks to you, Career Way
lost its position in online shopping.

677
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:14,600
If I could, I'd make it impossible
for you to work in this field again.

678
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,144
For now, I'll see what happens.

679
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,395
One more time.

680
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,690
You better show something
that exceeds my expectation.

681
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,984
You're dismissed.

682
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,328
- I need to change my schedule today.
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

683
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,382
Is it to your taste?

684
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,761
Thank you making time
out of your busy schedule.

685
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,601
Ms. Kim.

686
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,686
You don't have to walk on eggshells.

687
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,772
You have so many projects.

688
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:05,400
There's no need to report to me
every time you fail.

689
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,694
I didn't invest to oversee your company.

690
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,448
Let's not meet over such trivial matters.
We're both busy people.

691
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,700
I'll call you when necessary.

692
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,702
Thank you for
putting your trust in us, sir.

693
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,749
You haven't shown me anything
that deserves my trust yet.

694
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,251
You will from now on.

695
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:26,421
What happened today
won't be repeated again.

696
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,508
I'll prove that I was the right choice.

697
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,600
Ms. Kang!

698
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,442
Thank you for believing in me.

699
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,986
I haven't done a thing.

700
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,948
Mr. Yu told me all about it.

701
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:56,076
You said that you would
take responsibility for everything.

702
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:02,332
This is for you.

703
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:09,673
Ms. Cho's special business card holder
that's better than any luxury brand.

704
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,802
Also,

705
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,179
this is for you.

706
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,809
It's a performance organized
by my daughter.

707
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,394
She asked for you to come.

708
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,022
She also wanted me to tell you
that she's very grateful.

709
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,900
I'll be sure to attend.

710
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:34,197
Thank you so much for finding me.

711
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:39,244
Continue your good work for a long time.

712
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,037
I should head back in.

713
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,165
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

714
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,395
Do you want to come with me?

715
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,439
Why would I? They're for you.

716
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,150
There are two tickets,

717
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,778
and I'm grateful
that you believed in Ms. Cho.

718
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,112
I didn't believe in her.

719
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,490
- What?
- I knew the result.

720
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,283
What result?

721
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,285
I knew that it was genuine.

722
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,247
I asked Mr. Woo to get it appraised
by a few more people.

723
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,291
Then when you said…

724
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:29,419
Did you think I'd take responsibility
without having a backup plan?

725
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,838
I told you to stay objective.

726
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,133
Gosh, seriously…

727
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,187
It's not that car.

728
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,365
It's not even similar.

729
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:12,087
We should probably
put a sticker on the car.

730
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,340
I'm not a child. We don't need a sticker.

731
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,133
It's better than not finding your car.

732
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,803
What kind of stickers do you like?
Glow in the dark? Glitters?

733
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,097
I have all types. I can ask Byeol--

734
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,265
I don't want one.

735
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:26,852
Okay.

736
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,688
How about letter stickers?

737
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,442
Like one that says "rookie driver"
on the back of the car.

738
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,486
Except "Ms. Kang" in big font.

739
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,781
I'm sorry.

740
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,912
You two are rather close.
It's making me jealous.

741
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,205
Mr. Woo.

742
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,832
Does it look like we're close?

743
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,376
I said no. So don't even try.

744
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,921
What is it that you don't want?

745
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,009
Mr. Yu, she isn't harassing you, is she?

746
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:02,554
Please let me know if you need any help.

747
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:06,474
I know Ms. Kang very well.

748
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,607
Aren't you coming back from Deluxe Line?

749
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,442
I saw the article. Ms. Cho won.

750
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:21,698
She won because Ms. Kang
believed in her until the very end.

751
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,911
As I said, I didn't believe in her.

752
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:29,164
You would have believed in her anyway
without the appraisal result.

753
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:30,790
Amazingly.

754
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,925
I need to get this.
Please go upstairs first.

755
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:43,970
Yes.

756
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,182
About the interview? Yes.

757
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:48,642
<i>Going up.</i>

758
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,269
It'd be good to take it out.

759
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,314
Oh, yes.

760
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,695
Mr. Yu must think you're a good person.

761
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:05,700
What kind of person is Yu Eun-ho to you?

762
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,037
Mr. Yu?

763
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,461
What kind of question is that?

764
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,047
He's my secretary.

765
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,975
What was the appraisal result?

766
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,142
You haven't told me yet.

767
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,525
HK LUXURY BRAND

APPRAISAL REPORT

769
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,866
IMPOSSIBLE TO APPRAISE

770
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,535
Is he rubbing off on me?

771
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,872
I was a bit reckless this time.

772
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,671
I can't fall asleep. It's driving me mad.

773
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,603
How did I fall asleep that time?

774
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,162
SEARCH: SOFA

775
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,207
Is this it?

776
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,254
That's not it.

00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,307

778
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,082
YU EUN-HO

779
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,019
Hello?

780
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,189
Were you sleeping? You just called me.

781
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,193
Did I call you by mistake in my sleep?

782
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,611
I see. Please go back to sleep.

783
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,655
What's the model of your sofa?

784
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,949
- Pardon?
- I mean…

785
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:37,871
Actually, I have a hard time
falling asleep because I'm sensitive.

786
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,206
I don't think so.
You slept so well that day.

787
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,749
Exactly.

788
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,502
I think that it was because of your sofa.

789
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,837
Weren't you sleeping just now?

790
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,089
When I wake up, I can't fall asleep.

791
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,424
You woke me up.

792
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,676
So what's the model of your sofa?

793
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:52,969
Tell me now.

794
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:56,055
I'll take a look and let you know.

795
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:59,058
What about tonight? You're already awake.

796
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,938
Thanks to you,
I won't be sleeping tonight.

797
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,356
Because of me?

798
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,152
There's something that I do.

799
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:13,406
Drinking warm milk helps me fall asleep.

800
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,949
Why don't you try that?

801
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:20,830
Don't expect everyone
to have milk at home.

802
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,586
By any chance, do you have

803
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,421
any other solution?

804
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,591
Shall I read you a book?

805
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,343
It always works on Byeol.

806
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,429
Am I a child?

807
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,515
- You're not that different--
- What?

808
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:39,807
I'm sorry.

809
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,274
I'll take care of it.

810
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,818
I'll be hanging up now.

811
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,819
Okay.

812
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,365
Sleep well.

813
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,659
Okay.

814
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,078
Sleep well.

815
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,547
Don't have nightmares.

816
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,689
<i>Going up.</i>

817
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,609
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

818
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,111
Ms. Seo.

819
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,672
What? You look pretty.

820
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,841
Oh, thanks.

821
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:38,760
Are you going somewhere tonight?

822
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,678
- No.
- <i>Going up.</i>

823
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,681
That's odd. You're pretty.

824
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,313
Where are you going
so early in the morning?

825
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,065
I was about to call you.

826
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,024
Perfect timing.

827
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,567
I'm borrowing Mr. Yu for the day.

828
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,152
What is this about?

829
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,987
Heonjo Group is planning on reorganizing.

830
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:01,282
Mr. Yu has a lot of experience
since he worked in HR.

831
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,118
It'd be favorable for us
to bring an expert.

832
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,745
That's a good idea. Go with him.

833
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:07,747
Where's Mr. Yu?

834
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,582
He went downstairs to get ready.

835
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,460
Our meeting might end late today.

836
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,921
I'll let him get off work
right after the meeting.

837
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,801
Ms. Kang?

838
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:20,927
Yes?

839
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,387
Oh, okay.

840
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,263
- Go ahead and do that.
- Okay.

841
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,726
Why are you so dressed up today?

842
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,229
It's my usual outfit.

843
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,022
Good luck.

844
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,778
Something seems different about her.

845
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,445
MESSAGE FROM YU EUN-HO

846
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,822
<i>I'll be there on time.</i>

847
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,157
<i>See you at the recital.</i>

848
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,458
<i>Don't worry about useless things.</i>

849
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,751
<i>Focus on the meeting.</i>

850
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:13,664
Well, after that was in the clear,

851
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,583
he was interviewed by the executives

852
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,460
and passed through without a hitch.

853
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,879
I'll contact them
and confirm the interview dates.

854
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,714
Okay, that sounds good.

855
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:51,661
What's gotten into her?

856
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,081
Where is she going?

857
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,532
<i>What kind of person</i>

858
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,034
<i>is Yu Eun-ho to you?</i>

859
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,746
<i>If they keep seeing each other,</i>

860
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,414
<i>it means that they have feelings</i>
<i>for each other.</i>

861
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,292
<i>What's wrong with falling?</i>
<i>You can get back up.</i>

862
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,418
<i>I'll hold you.</i>

863
01:08:52,419 --> 01:08:56,465
<i>Ji-yun, did something happen to you?</i>
<i>Are you aware you aren't focused at work?</i>

864
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:59,760
<i>I have someone who's on my mind.</i>

865
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,303
<i>Have you checked</i>
<i>why she wants to change jobs?</i>

866
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,763
<i>Dating at work?</i>

867
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,348
<i>They broke up recently.</i>

868
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:06,475
<i>She's having a hard time working with him.</i>

869
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:09,186
<i>Get me a new secretary.</i>
<i>It interferes with my work.</i>

870
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,688
<i>He keeps going over the line.</i>

871
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:13,232
- <i>Ms. Kang, did I do something wrong?</i>
- I'm off.

872
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,484
Mr. Yu, you didn't do anything wrong.

873
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:16,443
I'm the problem.

874
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,738
I like you, Eun-ho.

875
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:24,827
