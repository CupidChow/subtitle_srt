00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,420
THE CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS
COMPANIES, AND PLACES

2
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,964
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL

3
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,648
Why didn't you go watch the movie?

4
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,194
EPISODE 8

5
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,820
I wanted to see you.

6
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,282
Are you the same Eun-ho that I know?

7
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:16,701
Why did you call me?

8
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,997
I resented working late alone.

9
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,006
I'm

10
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,926
used to being by myself.

11
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,346
I thought
that feeling lonely was a luxury.

12
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,433
I must have missed the warmth.

13
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,478
On the day I went to your house,

14
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,356
for the first time,

15
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,817
my house felt cold.

16
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,446
I was so used to it
that I didn't know it was cold.

17
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,615
I must have forgotten

18
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,785
that a home could be warm.

19
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,497
Isn't it strange?

20
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,876
The things I took for granted
before meeting you,

21
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,838
I can't take them for granted anymore.

22
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,881
But,

23
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,301
strangely enough, I liked that.

24
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,269
Dating at work without keeping
personal life and work separate.

25
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,937
It's not something I would do.

26
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,690
But I failed, which serves me right.

27
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,030
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

28
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,700
Ms. Kang.

29
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,870
You never seem to run away from anything.

30
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,954
Just like when

31
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,707
you confessed to me.

32
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,461
I'm not good at keeping things to myself
like a certain someone.

33
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,757
So, you didn't like it?

34
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,928
I liked it.

35
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:08,021
I never thought I'd be able
to like someone again.

36
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,566
I was completely preoccupied
with my child.

37
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,819
I didn't think
there was space for another.

38
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,781
But my heart fluttered a lot.

39
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,953
So I tried to fight against it,

40
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,414
but I failed, too.

41
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,750
I understand.

42
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,585
I'm full of charm.

43
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:36,925
Eun-ho.

44
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,594
Let's not overthink things.

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,348
Let's just consider our feelings
for each other.

46
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,066
I will treat you well.

47
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,778
I like you a lot.

48
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,788
Me too.

49
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,226
Why do you keep

50
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,895
looking at me like that?

51
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,814
Stop worrying and drive.

52
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,194
So this is what you look like
from the side.

53
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,072
Not bad.

54
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,464
Don't get out.

55
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,633
If you do, I might not let you leave.

56
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,847
I'm going.

57
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,825
Show me your forehead.

58
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,037
Close your eyes.

59
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,625
Done.

60
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,887
Byeol.

61
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,013
Yes?

62
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,848
Byeol…

63
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,102
How would you feel

64
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,315
if I had someone that I liked?

65
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,150
Dad, did you get a girlfriend?

66
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,446
I'm curious about your thoughts.

67
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,992
I'd be happy.

68
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,412
Dad, I'm already seven years old.

69
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,081
I'm not a kiddo.

70
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,085
I like it when you smile a lot.

71
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,384
Dad, I'm sleepy.

72
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:41,400
ONE FINE SPRING DAY

73
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,612
I'm sorry

74
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,365
about telling you
to muster up the courage.

75
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,408
Don't be sorry.

76
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,744
I can't stay heartbroken forever.

77
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,329
It's better that…

78
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,916
It can't be me, right?

79
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,211
No matter how urgent it is,
if you like a person,

80
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,381
you wouldn't cancel your date
with them, would you?

81
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,842
I mean,

82
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,762
that… depends on what happened.

83
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,515
Maybe something really urgent
came up at work.

84
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,475
Is that so?

85
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,394
Oh, man.

86
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,521
I'm getting my hopes again.

87
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,941
Look at you.

88
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,609
Your unrequited love is serious.

89
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,571
You say it like you're not the same.

90
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,699
Compared to you, I am…

91
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,577
not better.

92
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,328
We're pretty much the same.

93
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,416
The person I like

94
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,584
doesn't see me as a man.

95
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,545
She probably still sees me
as a high school student.

96
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,090
When he's with me,
he only talks about our children.

97
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,384
I shouldn't have suggested
being parenting friends.

98
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,763
I look at her every day at work,

99
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,973
but she looks at someone else.

100
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,975
You work together?

101
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,853
- Then you have to see her every day.
- Yes.

102
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,189
So? Did I win?

103
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,816
I'm the more unfortunate one.

104
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,110
I send the kids to school every morning.

105
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,487
Tomorrow as well.

106
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,113
- Really?
- Yes.

107
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,157
The day after he stood you up?

108
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,200
Yes.

109
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:13,910
That's intense.

110
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,590
I hate my father.

111
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,468
That's why she sees you as a kid.

112
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,970
Come on, you aren't going
through puberty anymore.

113
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,388
No, it's not like that.

114
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:36,891
Seriously,

115
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,268
I just don't understand.

116
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,020
Even after

117
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,439
the death of his own child,

118
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,191
how could he…

119
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,698
I must be drunk. What am I saying?

120
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,741
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,996
I won't remember anything since I'm drunk.

122
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,416
Say everything that you want to say.

123
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,713
You know what?

124
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,177
I miss my older brother.

125
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,223
My brother…

126
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,934
He really was

127
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,769
a good and kind person.

128
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,146
He was completely different from me.

129
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,065
But…

130
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,818
he died too young.

131
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,655
I don't know why

132
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,907
the good ones cross over so early.

133
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,245
Me neither.

134
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,831
I haven't found the answer yet.

135
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,877
My sister and her husband passed away
in an accident.

136
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,088
I asked the question many times

137
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,300
while holding the child
who was looking for his parents.

138
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,721
But I just couldn't find the answer.

139
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,146
Why are we similar this way too?

140
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,399
I know.

141
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,947
In that case,

142
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,158
is your son…

143
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,869
Yes, he's my sister's son.

144
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,206
However, no matter what others say,
he's my son now.

145
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,794
I'm always worried
about not being a good mom.

146
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,880
Since I'm not his mom by blood.

147
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,425
I started making picture books
thanks to Seo-jun.

148
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,803
I have stories
that I want to tell Seo-jun.

149
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,060
Honestly,

150
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,561
he must be an idiot.

151
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,314
Why doesn't he recognize
such a good person like you?

152
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,359
Right? That's exactly what I'm saying.

153
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,277
It's his loss for not being with me.

154
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,821
Agreed.

155
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,657
- Let's drink to that.
- Okay.

156
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,200
Cheers.

157
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,079
I'll pour you one.

158
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,914
Thank you.

159
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,125
You came racing in here earlier.

160
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,502
I thought you knew how to fly.

161
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,380
I have wings on my back.

162
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,048
Oh, really?

163
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,425
Yes, you haven't seen them?

164
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,635
They sure weren't visible.

165
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,179
If you're kind, you would see them.

166
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,641
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

167
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,356
Su-hyeon.

168
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,525
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

169
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,776
Did you get home safely?

170
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,277
Yes, you should be sorry.

171
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,072
Canceling our date. Wasting our tickets.

172
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,491
You were a bit cruel.

173
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,409
Right?

174
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,869
Yes, I was being cruel.

175
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,122
Curse at me all you want. I'll take it.

176
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,168
If you're really sorry,

177
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,046
buy the tickets next time.

178
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,006
Would that be enough?

179
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,758
I'd be more than happy to.

180
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,010
And Su-hyeon,

181
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,720
let's go to the movies
with our kids next time.

182
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,265
They like movies, too.

183
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,479
Right, they do.

184
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,023
Daddy Yu.

185
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,652
That urgent thing last night…

186
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,698
Did it have to do with Ms. Kang?

187
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,158
What?

188
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,665
Yes.

189
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,961
I see.

190
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,714
I had a feeling that it was.

191
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,801
Oh, Byeol.

192
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,637
That's dangerous. Don't… Gosh.

193
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,140
Wait.

194
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,113
- Hello.
- Hello.

195
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,448
- Hello.
- Have a good day.

196
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,202
- Hello.
- Oh, hello. Have a good day.

197
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,245
- Hello, Mr. Yu.
- Hello.

198
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,789
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

199
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,673
Can we keep our relationship
a secret at work?

200
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,220
- Yes.
- At work, be strict about it.

201
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,514
Keep personal life
and work separate, okay?

202
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,766
You have a meeting
with Lawyer Jang Sun-woo at 1 p.m.,

203
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,977
Jaein Pharmaceuticals at 4 p.m.,
and Gloss Apparel at 5 p.m.

204
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,488
Is there more to report?

205
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,448
No, but…

206
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,622
Shall I lower this?

207
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,544
Mr. Yu.

208
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,339
Do it right.

209
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,383
Don't make it obvious.

210
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,096
Okay.

211
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,685
Just go out.

212
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,704
Why would I lower the blinds?

213
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,331
That was a bit embarrassing.

214
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,208
Eun-ho,

215
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,544
did you do something wrong with Ms. Kang?

216
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,796
She looks particularly cold
with you today.

217
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,882
Times like these

218
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,427
call for some special caffeine.
That's right.

219
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,137
Eun-ho.

220
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,937
Ms. Kang is strict about keeping
her personal life and work separate.

221
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,106
Ha! That goes without saying.

222
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,403
Isn't it good?

223
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,622
All right. Keep it, Eun-ho.

224
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,249
It hurts to see you heartbroken.

225
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,504
Kyung-hwa.

226
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,387
Work hard today.

227
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,727
Oh my gosh.

228
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,064
The statute of limitations has passed,

229
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,150
so they're less likely to file
a lawsuit again.

230
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,151
Yes.

231
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:45,819
Yes.

232
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,238
Okay, I'll call you again. Thank you.

233
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,823
- Hello.
- Hello.

234
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,242
I don't have much time,
so I already ordered.

235
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,703
I don't have much time to eat.
Is that all right?

236
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,038
- Yes, I heard.
- Okay.

237
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,165
- We can talk while we eat.
- Sure.

238
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,754
Mikang Law Firm chose me?

239
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,341
I heard that they were deciding
between me and someone else.

240
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,635
Both of you are experts
in administrative litigation,

241
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,137
which is what
Mikang Law Firm is looking for.

242
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,098
They took a long time
to make their final decision.

243
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,017
In the end, what moved the firm was--

244
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,811
It must be my success rate.

245
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,480
Big law firms are also obsessed
with success rates.

246
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,441
No, it was your leading cases.

247
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:29,613
You've handled many cases that challenged
and interpreted the law in new ways.

248
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,783
Mikang Law Firm wouldn't overlook
someone like you.

249
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:36,537
Then that makes it easier
for what I'm about to say.

250
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:42,334
I'll be willing to change jobs
under a few conditions.

251
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,877
- Conditions?
- Yes.

252
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,796
Starting from 4 p.m.,
I will work from home.

253
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,548
Except when I have trials.

254
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,592
I'd like to reduce
the delegation work by half.

255
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,847
I'd also like a minimum
of two junior lawyers to myself.

256
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,516
May I ask why?

257
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,686
Work and life balance?

258
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,273
I'd like that in my life.

259
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:08,027
As you say, if I'm a candidate
that can't be overlooked,

260
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,486
such an investment
won't be too much to ask.

261
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,489
In return, I promise you
a high success rate.

262
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,036
I need to get this. Excuse me.

263
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,128
It won't be easy to negotiate.

264
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,882
Has Ms. Jang said anything else to you?

265
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,300
No.

266
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,053
There must be a reason behind
her sudden change of attitude.

267
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,514
Find out if she's in contact
with other search firms or employers.

268
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,807
Yes, ma'am.

269
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,436
When someone known to be a workaholic
suddenly wants work and life balance,

270
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,604
there must be a reason.

271
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,695
KIJIN NOODLES

272
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,280
I sent it all to your email.

273
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,990
Please take a look at it.

274
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,408
- Thank you.
- Bye.

275
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,202
If you can reply in time…

276
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,832
We should go too.

277
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,085
Shall we return to the office?

278
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,670
No, let's have some coffee first.

279
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,382
I'll look for a coffee shop nearby.

280
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,677
Aren't we going?

281
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,516
You shouldn't behave like this
during work hours.

282
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,186
- We're not at the office.
- It's still business hours.

283
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,813
It's because you're very strict--

284
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,939
Did I upset you?

285
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,190
Of course not.

286
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,817
You were absolutely right.

287
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,444
From now on, I'll be more strict
about keeping it a secret.

288
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,532
Why do you keep holding my hand
while saying that?

289
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,914
We're not at the office.

290
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,707
Exactly.

291
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,127
- Mocha salt bun?
- Great.

292
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,771
Why does she look so resolute?

293
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,742
Did it go well?

294
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,411
Gosh, what was that?

295
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,539
Why are you out here?

296
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,456
The meeting.

297
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,417
Weren't you at the meeting
with Lawyer Jang Sun-woo?

298
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,629
Yes.

299
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,716
Did it go well?

300
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,968
Yes, it went well.

301
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,267
Things went well.

302
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,895
Come on, Yu Eun-ho.

303
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,777
He's so adorable.

304
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,073
What are you doing?

305
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,366
What?

306
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,826
Who, me?

307
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,077
Didn't you just…

308
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,164
My head…

309
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,749
- You have a headache?
- Yes.

310
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,167
I'll bring you some medicine.

311
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,923
But…

312
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,800
I definitely saw her do this.

313
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,097
"So adorable?"

314
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,140
Wait…

315
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,434
Who?

316
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,249
I wonder if Ms. Jung is okay.

317
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,683
WRITER JUNG SU-HYEON

318
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,785
FREE SPIRIT

319
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,621
<i>The sky is spinning.</i>

320
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,415
<i>Are you okay, Ms. Jung?</i>

321
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,457
He's a light drinker.

322
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,349
WRITER JUNG SU-HYEON

323
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,393
<i>Thank you for yesterday.</i>

324
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,772
WAKE UP DRINK

325
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,734
I should be the one to thank.

326
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,902
For listening to my useless stories.

327
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,910
Why do we drink every time we meet?

328
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,912
He's a fascinating person.

329
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,415
He makes me spill my heart out.

330
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,462
Yes?

331
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,590
Is your work going well?

332
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,799
Yes, it's going well.

333
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,093
- Have some of this.
- Leave it there.

334
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,678
I'll eat while I work. Thanks, Mom.

335
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,310
What's with that curious look
on your face?

336
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,730
Ask away if you have questions.

337
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,982
Well, I'm just so frustrated.

338
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,151
I gave you time to go on a date,

339
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,986
but Eun-ho got back earlier than you.

340
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,572
You crawled back home extremely drunk.

341
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,450
What happened? Did it not go well?

342
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,327
Mom, breathe while you talk.

343
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,369
Exactly!

344
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,498
Answer me before I run out of breath.

345
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,999
Did it go well or not?

346
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,417
We didn't see the movie,

347
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,586
and we won't be seeing
each other in private.

348
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,922
So stop getting your hopes up.

349
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,098
It took place in 2021.

350
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,433
Blaming the authority's error
in the procedure,

351
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,186
it was decided
that it didn't violate the law.

352
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,187
Then we got it.

353
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,814
Good. Okay.

354
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,732
Then this will be our focus.

355
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,193
Ms. Jung, don't you need
to check your phone?

356
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,486
It's been ringing for a while.

357
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,571
- Can you give me the document?
- Here you go.

358
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,990
Gosh, I can't work. Excuse me.

359
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:33,870
I'm sorry,

360
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,748
but I need to go.

361
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,792
Find out if there are similar precedents.

362
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,794
I'll take a look in the evening.
I'm sorry!

363
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,295
Okay, see you later.

364
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,258
<i>The person you called isn't available…</i>

365
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,384
It's going to voicemail.

366
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,553
It's already been 30 minutes.

367
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,263
- Is she not picking up?
- No.

368
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,473
I sent her a message,
but she isn't responding.

369
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,477
She's so different from how I know her.

370
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,020
I can't tell what's real.

371
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,606
Have you contacted her office?

372
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,111
Thank you. One moment.

373
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,699
Ms. Jang.

374
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,369
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

375
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,580
One second.

376
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,539
Tae-yoon.

377
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,299
Let's talk upstairs.

378
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,968
There's an important trial this afternoon,
so no one's at the office.

379
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,599
I'm sorry for not showing up.

380
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,766
Something came up.

381
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,354
I think we should know what happened.

382
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,732
May I ask what happened?

383
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,693
We've filed for divorce,

384
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,486
and I'm fighting for custody.

385
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,781
He's attacking me
for neglecting our child due to work.

386
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,285
So I absolutely need time with my child.

387
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,581
Then the reason you asked
for those conditions…

388
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,874
Yes.

389
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,877
At my current job,
I'm in charge of many cases.

390
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,046
My husband is well aware of it.

391
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,590
I'll reduce work at a new firm.

392
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,966
I'm making an effort.

393
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,052
I need to show that to gain an advantage.

394
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,762
Their argument is…

395
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,059
he couldn't help having an affair
because I neglected family over work.

396
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,519
And in the process
our child wasn't properly cared for.

397
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,525
Today, the babysitter
suddenly called in sick.

398
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,487
But I have no one else
to take care of him,

399
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,073
so I decided to look after him today.

400
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,952
I'm back in the office
with my child again.

401
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,622
It's impossible not to work.

402
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,290
Yes, that's right.

403
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,375
But…

404
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,168
I could've reduced the amount.

405
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,214
After giving birth,
I didn't want to give up on my career.

406
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,257
I was overly ambitious.

407
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:51,883
But in the end,

408
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,344
neither work nor parenting.

409
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,180
I'm not doing anything properly.

410
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,684
As my husband says,

411
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,560
I may not have the right to be a mom.

412
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,273
There's no way to take care of my child.

413
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,234
Was it right to be ambitious?

414
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,112
Should I take custody of my child
to fulfill my ambition?

415
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,617
I always find solutions
for other people's cases,

416
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,161
but I'm lost when it comes to mine.

417
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,333
Of course you have the right.

418
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,088
Raising a child is not easy.

419
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,632
Enough that you want to abandon it all.

420
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,845
But you didn't.

421
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,097
You're trying your best

422
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,308
to keep your job and your child.

423
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,310
That's already impressive.

424
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,397
No parent starts off
with all the qualifications.

425
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,359
Even if it's lacking,
you try your best to do better.

426
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,194
It's the same for you…

427
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:55,989
as well as me.

428
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,744
You have the right.

429
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,983
Byeol, it's okay.

430
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,405
Eun-ho.

431
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,452
Let's get a divorce.

432
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,248
Seeing Byeol in your arms

433
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,127
suffocates me.

434
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,420
I guess it would be hard
for Ms. Jang to change jobs?

435
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,672
Even if I explain the situation,

436
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,091
the client won't accept it easily.

437
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,137
By the way,

438
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,099
why aren't you asking me?
You must be curious.

439
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,228
I am curious,

440
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,064
but it could hurt you.

441
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,942
You didn't ask me either.

442
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,739
She had a difficult time.

443
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,658
She said that she was suffocating,

444
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,202
so I couldn't stop her.

445
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,122
You don't resent her?

446
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,750
I did at first.

447
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,335
Now, I barely remember.

448
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,130
Do you keep in touch?

449
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,842
I've never contacted or heard from her.

450
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,137
Does Byeol know?

451
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,724
I was hoping that she wouldn't,

452
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,185
but she figured it out as she grew up.

453
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,104
However,

454
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,524
Byeol has never made it obvious.

455
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,613
After what happened, we were at a loss.

456
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,866
That oblivious, little child
grabbed my finger.

457
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,034
Very tightly.

458
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,579
Then I got a grip on myself.

459
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,874
I've been living since
with that sense of responsibility.

460
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,502
Instead of me raising Byeol,

461
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,337
she's the one who raised me.

462
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,467
I should be grateful to Byeol

463
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,719
for raising you to be so amazing.

464
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,515
One of the two people

465
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,559
who brought me where I am now is Byeol.

466
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,854
Who's the other person?

467
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,441
It's quite a long story.

468
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,943
I'll tell you next time.

469
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,782
So, you agree that you're amazing?

470
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,244
Well,

471
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,330
I'm not so bad, aren't I?

472
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:33,957
You don't know, do you?

473
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,500
"Not bad?"

474
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,752
You're incredibly amazing.

475
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,007
You're blushing.

476
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,133
All of a sudden…

477
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,677
You must be pleased.

478
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,145
- Hello, sir.
<i>- Hello, Eun-ho.</i>

479
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,649
I met someone who remembers
about the fire accident.

480
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,109
- Really?
<i>- Yes.</i>

481
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,111
I got the person's phone number.

482
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,655
<i>I'll send it in a text message.</i>
<i>You should give a call.</i>

483
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,323
Okay, sir. Thank you.

484
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,117
- Thank you, sir.
<i>- No problem.</i>

485
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,121
Eun-ho.

486
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,914
Come on.

487
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,680
Mikang Law Firm picked a new candidate.

488
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,223
Contact Lawyer Ahn Jong-min.

489
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,934
Got it.

490
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,811
What should we do with Ms. Jang?

491
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,064
It can't be helped.

492
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,775
It won't be easy to find a law firm
that can meet her conditions.

493
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,692
I'll call her.

494
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,697
Is there more you want to say?

495
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,990
About Ms. Jang.

496
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,952
What do you think of her
as an in-house lawyer

497
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,288
In-house lawyers come to work
at a regular time.

498
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,624
Compared to law firms,
there are fewer cases and trials,

499
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,125
so the work is easier as a parent.

500
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,585
When getting her a new job,

501
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,545
we can't take her entire
personal life into account

502
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,797
just to be thoughtful.

503
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,632
Right.

504
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,467
I understand.

505
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,388
There has to be an offer.

506
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,891
Is there an offer for an in-house lawyer?

507
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,769
She's competent.

508
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:03,106
Helping competent candidates
work at the right place.

509
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,233
That's our job.

510
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,276
Is that the list of search offers?

511
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,406
I'll search more to find a place
that fits Ms. Jang's expertise.

512
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,579
Aren't you glad that I said yes?

513
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,127
Let's narrow down the list
and meet the person in charge.

514
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,553
We can give high fives, can't we?

515
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:52,905
You may go.

516
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,942
DODAM BOOK STORE

517
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,240
Uncle,

518
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,410
I think Dad found someone that he likes.

519
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,000
- What?
- Why are you so surprised?

520
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:47,585
I'm not.

521
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,837
I'm not surprised.

522
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,300
How did you find out?

523
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,635
There's evidence.

524
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,886
Evidence?

525
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,513
How do you know that word?

526
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,932
First.

527
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,769
<i>He looks at the mirror a lot these days.</i>

528
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,420
Second.

529
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,005
He has his phone on him all day long.

530
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,743
What is it?

531
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,794
Is your hair getting in the way?

532
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,212
Yes.

533
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,760
Dad, this isn't my hair tie.

534
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,140
I bought a new one.

535
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,186
<i>Third.</i>

536
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,729
<i>He had another woman's hair tie.</i>

537
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,776
What kind of daughter is Eun-ho raising?

538
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,197
Byeol, I think

539
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,991
you're the smartest seven-year-old
I have ever seen.

540
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,534
This is no big deal.

541
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,579
Right, no big deal.

542
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,498
By the way,

543
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,875
what do you think?

544
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,876
About what?

545
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,086
That your dad likes someone.

546
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,297
Are you against that?

547
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,132
I told Dad that I'd be happy.

548
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,842
Oh, did you?

549
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,470
I'm so proud of you, Byeol.

550
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,807
Uncle, when you find out who it is,
you have to tell me.

551
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,352
- Promise?
- Okay.

552
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,561
I promise.

553
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,316
DODAM BOOK STORE

554
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,694
The weather sure is nice.

555
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,656
Wanna go for a beer?

556
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,908
Why are you in such a good mood?

557
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,576
Did you win the lottery?

558
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,996
Winning the lottery
isn't anything special.

559
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,416
When someone that I like is happy,
that's winning the lottery.

560
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,710
That's because
we've never won the lottery.

561
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,128
What's going on?

562
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,131
- It's about Eun-ho.
- Yeah?

563
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,759
- I think he has a girlfriend.
- Really?

564
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,887
That's amazing. What great news!

565
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,515
Eun-ho should be going on dates.

566
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:52,103
Few days ago, he was hesitating
and couldn't muster up the courage.

567
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,854
I'm proud of him.

568
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,190
It's about time that he's happy.

569
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,402
You're practically Eun-ho's mother,
aren't you?

570
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,946
When did he have time to meet someone?

571
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,323
He always seems to
be with Ji-yun these days.

572
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,076
You're right.

573
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,412
Could they be…

574
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,289
What? That's ridiculous.

575
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:15,084
Why do you keep bringing them together?

576
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,252
It's possible.

577
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,962
They make a nice couple.

578
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,214
You're being weird.

579
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,632
Why can't they be together?

580
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,342
Ji-yun is single,

581
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,594
- and Eun-ho…
- What about him?

582
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,432
Anyway, it couldn't be her.

583
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:33,019
Ji-yun has been asking me
to change her secretary…

584
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,399
What? What is it?

585
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,445
Darn it. Let's get some beer.

586
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,821
Wait, what?

587
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,734
Don't step over the line at work,
Mr. Yu Eun-ho.

588
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,988
I'm off work, Ji-yun.

589
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,910
He's getting more and more shameless.

590
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,761
I'll get off work too.

591
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:28,968
I'm hungry.

592
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,754
Goodness.

593
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,476
<i>Going up.</i>

594
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,686
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

595
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:38,871
Darn it.

596
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,040
Why are we here early in the morning?

597
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,416
You…

598
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,835
Let me cure my hangover first.

599
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,671
I drank because of you, so you buy.

600
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,428
Thank you.

601
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,561
Did you add pickles and olives?

602
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,772
You care about that even now? I did.

603
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,899
- Twice the sauce too?
- Yes.

604
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,410
Ji-yun, you know…

605
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,455
It's not true, right?

606
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,083
What's not true?

607
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,336
I don't get it.
You left out the subject and object.

608
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,587
Say it properly.

609
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,424
You and Eun-ho,

610
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,717
- are you--
- Yes.

611
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,177
I like Eun-ho.

612
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,640
What are you going to do?

613
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,308
Are you really seeing him?

614
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,518
Is that not allowed?

615
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,440
Hey, I know that Eun-ho is a good person.
Of course, I know that.

616
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,234
But still…

617
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,113
Why are you choosing
such a difficult path?

618
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,407
Because I like him.

619
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,784
Do I need another reason?

620
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,204
So why do you like Eun-ho, of all people?

621
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,707
You've been lonely for so long.

622
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,917
You finally found someone
to rely on, but why…

623
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,670
is it a man with a kid?

624
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,797
What?

625
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,049
Call me a snob if you want.

626
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,676
Hey.

627
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,429
I know what kind of life you had.

628
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,056
Without parents,
you moved from relative to…

629
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,519
Ji-yun.

630
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,522
I just want

631
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:33,152
you to meet someone without flaws
like other people

632
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,863
and have a normal relationship.

633
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,660
I know what you mean.

634
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,496
But Mi-ae,

635
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,749
why is that a flaw?

636
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,460
That's his life.

637
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,172
I like Eun-ho as he is now.

638
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:57,468
I like him for having the life he led.

639
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,472
So don't say that anymore.

640
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,933
Gosh, I really don't know what to do.

641
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,435
If you don't know, stay quiet.

642
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,770
I'll handle it.

643
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,814
For now, pretend you don't know
anything at work.

644
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,441
Don't say anything weird to Eun-ho.

645
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:16,362
You've really gone
over the deep end for him.

646
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,664
Welcome.

647
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,502
Are you alone?

648
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,672
Mister, please take me to this address.

649
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,556
What is this about?

650
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,642
I know that Mikang Law Firm's
offer has ended.

651
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,852
Is there a problem?

652
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,562
Am I responsible for something?

653
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,941
No, I want to recommend you
another job offer.

654
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,568
No, it's okay.

655
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,737
I'm preparing to leave my current job.

656
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,614
I won't be working for now

657
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,282
to fully take care of my child.

658
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,743
Are you quitting work entirely?

659
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,581
Is it because of the custody lawsuit?

660
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,877
You must know that quitting your job
won't help you win custody.

661
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,547
It could work against you.

662
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,840
Yes, I know.

663
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,593
He will attack me by saying
that I can't take care of my child

664
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,928
without financial means.

665
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,849
When I work, I don't have time
to care for my child.

666
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,685
When I don't work,
I have no financial means.

667
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,979
They say I have no right to be a mom.

668
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,860
I really did try my best,
trying to make both work.

669
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,073
All this to keep my child.

670
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,492
Tae-yoon said

671
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,036
he'll go with his dad.

672
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,123
He wants to live with him.

673
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,089
But I refuse to hand him over.

674
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,008
I'll keep him with me.

675
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,386
Excuse me.

676
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,683
Hello?

677
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,852
Tae-yoon isn't home yet?

678
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,230
He should be been back from his tutors.

679
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,900
Okay, I will call him.

680
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:30,120
Why isn't he picking up? Where did he go?

681
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,167
What should I do?

682
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,378
He must have gone to his dad.

683
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,843
Well…

684
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,304
Ms. Jang, please calm down.

685
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,918
Hello.

686
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:30,055
I'm here to see CEO Kang Ji-yun.

687
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,809
So you're Ms. Jang Sun-woo's son?

688
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:34,810
Yes.

689
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,688
Do you want this?

690
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,147
Thank you.

691
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,984
How did you find this address?

692
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:46,613
I got Ms. Kang's business card
from my mom's office.

693
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,784
- That's amazing.
- You're smart.

694
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,203
You deserve the yogurt drink.

695
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,080
- Wow.
- Tae-yoon.

696
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,584
What happened?

697
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,753
I was worried about you.

698
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,506
I have a favor to ask of Ms. Kang.

699
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,551
Me?

700
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,719
Yes.

701
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,688
What's the favor you want to ask me?

702
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,274
Please let my mom work.

703
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,361
Tae-yoon, what do you mean by that?

704
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,905
I heard last time in the office.

705
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:32,034
That you can't work because of me.

706
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,494
I don't want you to quit your job
because of me.

707
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,914
Today, the babysitter
suddenly called in sick.

708
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,959
But I have no one else
to take care of him,

709
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,003
so I decided to look after him today.

710
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,506
I'm back in the office
with my child again.

711
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,385
After giving birth,
I didn't want to give up on my career.

712
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,304
I was overly ambitious.

713
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:57,267
Neither work nor parenting,
i'm not doing anything properly.

714
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,353
As my husband says,

715
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,397
I may not have the right to be a mom.

716
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,815
<i>If I wasn't here,</i>

717
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,859
you can keep working.

718
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,988
Is that why you wanted to be with Dad?

719
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,495
I interfere with your life.

720
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,121
- That's why.
- Tae-yoon.

721
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,336
Tae-yoon, that's not true.

722
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,546
Why would you?

723
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,174
Tae-yoon's the best.

724
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,349
I live because of you.

725
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,060
You're the reason

726
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,938
why I live.

727
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,735
Don't I bother you?

728
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,696
Then can I live with you?

729
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,573
Of course.

730
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,576
I really want to live with you.

731
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,962
Tae-yoon, if that's your favor,

732
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,422
we will be able to help.

733
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:13,427
This mister found a great position
for your mom.

734
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,556
She can work and still spend
time with you, Tae-yoon.

735
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,277
HIRING IN-HOUSE LAWYER
AT TAESEON ELECTRONICS

736
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,696
Taeseon Electronics is looking
for an in-house lawyer.

737
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,364
In-house lawyer?

738
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,657
Yes.

739
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,159
The salary will be lower than now,

740
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,703
but the company is highly interested
in land development.

741
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,998
It will help you expand your expertise.

742
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,625
The working hours are short and regular.

743
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,880
You'll be able to spend
a lot of time with Tae-yoon.

744
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,972
Take your time to think about it
and call us.

745
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,870
Thank you for the nice offer.

746
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,873
I'll try to keep my work and my child,
both under my care.

747
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,958
I'll be cheering for you.

748
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,795
I'll be cheering for you too. Good luck.

749
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:31,922
Stay strong, Tae-yoon.

750
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,842
- Thank you. Bye.
- Please take care.

751
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,601
That's nice.

752
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:46,686
How cute.

753
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,572
Good job.

754
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,467
YU EUN-HO

755
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,221
<i>What are you doing? Did you get home safe?</i>

756
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,837
- Hello?
- You weren't asleep?

757
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,754
<i>No, not yet.</i>

758
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,506
What were you doing?

759
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,841
I just put Byeol to bed.

760
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,676
<i>Is she sleeping well?</i>

761
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,803
She falls asleep as soon
as her head touches the pillow.

762
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,097
She doesn't take after me in that way.

763
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,974
How does it make you feel?

764
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,226
Are you sad to find out
she's different from you?

765
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,604
<i>No, it's actually a good thing.</i>

766
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:14,065
It'd be heavy
if she takes after me completely.

767
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,359
<i>If she does something wrong,</i>
<i>I'd feel responsible.</i>

768
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,529
You don't need to worry about that.

769
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,699
<i>Byeol is much cleverer than you are.</i>

770
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,536
Parents worry over nothing.

771
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,371
Including Ms. Jang.

772
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,748
Children are growing up just fine.

773
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,125
<i>Right, we seem to worry too much.</i>

774
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,210
Do you still have a hard time
falling asleep?

775
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,004
See that? You're worrying again.

776
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,508
Since when did it become so hard?

777
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:46,097
It's been so long that I don't remember.

778
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:49,643
Do you have nightmares?

779
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,102
<i>Well,</i>

780
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:55,774
my late dad always appears in my dreams.

781
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,947
<i>You must miss him a lot.</i>

782
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:02,864
Not really.

783
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,700
I don't miss him that much.

784
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,165
To me, he wasn't a good dad.

785
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:20,840
<i>Shall I read you a book?</i>

786
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,261
Didn't I say that I'm not a child?

787
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,430
<i>This book is also for adults.</i>

788
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,807
A super boring one.

789
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,767
It works like a sleeping pill.

790
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,395
How boring is it?

791
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,730
Go ahead and read it.

792
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,691
<i>You won't be disappointed.</i>

793
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,235
But a little later.

794
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,569
- Later?
<i>- Yes.</i>

795
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,988
Isn't the book next to you?

796
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,197
That's not it.

797
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,783
I want to talk to you longer.

798
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,785
<i>Are you tired?</i>

799
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,829
No.

800
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,288
I'm not tired at all yet.

801
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,666
I can't believe
the boring book didn't work.

802
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,252
I'll read you a heartwarming story
this time.

803
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,129
Starting with a good line.

804
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,967
"Consolation may not be something
that comes to you."

805
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:50,096
"It could be something
that you search for."

806
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,975
<i>"I must get closer to consolation."</i>

807
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,395
<i>"I have to initiate the conversation</i>
<i>with consolation."</i>

808
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,398
"The thought came to me that

809
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,402
<i>maybe the people around me</i>
<i>were waiting for me."</i>

810
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,281
<i>"Waiting for me to be okay enough</i>
<i>to listen to their consoling words</i>

811
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:10,492
<i>that were well prepared in advance."</i>

812
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,036
<i>"That made me cry."</i>

813
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,811
Hello?

814
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,356
Oh, tomorrow?

815
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,109
I understand.

816
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,568
Okay.

817
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,740
Clear my entire afternoon tomorrow.

818
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,992
I will, but why all of a sudden?

819
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,496
I have to attend the event
organized by Chairman Woo.

820
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,959
An event? Tomorrow?

821
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,794
You know how my father is.

822
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,170
In front of his investees,

823
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,173
he wants to brag about
his performance and network.

824
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,675
I got the call today.

825
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,637
We'll go and show that we're clapping.

826
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,848
Depending on the atmosphere,
we'll leave early.

827
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:19,519
Still, notifying us of the event
a day before is a bit rude.

828
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,981
Jeez.
Is the investor pulling a power move?

829
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,526
KOREA INVESTMENT CORPORATION

RÉSUMÉ

833
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,751
I'll take care of the rest.

834
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,712
<i>Just make the recommendation.</i>

835
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,549
<i>Ms. Kang.</i>

836
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,595
You're growing well.

837
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,525
Ms. Kang looks very down today.

838
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,694
Is there something wrong?

839
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,446
I'm not sure.

840
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:14,741
The projects are going well
without problems.

841
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,285
There shouldn't be anything
to feel down about.

842
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,079
Lee Kwang-hee.

843
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,165
Did you do something wrong?

844
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,084
Why do you blame my darl…

845
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,840
Darl… ing?

846
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,134
Darling?

847
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,761
"Don't snarl at him."

848
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,012
Snarl, right?

849
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,306
You were gonna say, "Don't snarl at him."
Weren't you?

850
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,392
So, is that the slang these days?
Is that what you're saying?

851
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:42,727
Yes, yes.

852
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,562
Don't, don't snarl at him!

853
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,774
"Snarl," I see.
I thought I heard "darling." My ears--

854
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,692
I definitely heard a "D" in there.

855
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:53,655
I thought that Kyung-hwa
was calling Kwang-hee her darling.

856
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:54,656
Why would I?

857
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,907
No way.

858
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,326
- The door is open. It's open.
- Gosh.

859
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,912
Aren't you two getting in?

860
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:03,581
I forgot to bring some documents.

861
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,124
Gyu-rim, I need to check something.

862
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,584
- Wait a second.
- Okay.

863
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,502
Go ahead first.

864
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:08,545
See you tomorrow!

865
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,338
This whole "snarl" thing is fun.

866
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,383
Right? That was a total snarl, right?

867
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,475
Until when will they continue
acting like that?

868
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,476
Leave them be.

869
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,520
I'm having fun.

PERCENTAGE OF SHARE
45.6%

873
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,724
Is it because of tomorrow's event?

874
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,686
When Peoplez was founded,

875
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,355
Chairman Woo helped us a lot.

876
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,899
Without his help,

877
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,818
this company wouldn't even exist.

878
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,029
Now,

879
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,198
it feels like a burden.

880
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,201
Or am I being malicious?

881
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,456
Is his involvement excessive?

882
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,751
That's not it.

883
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:33,713
But at this rate,
if he puts his mind to it,

884
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,174
he could control Peoplez.

885
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,259
We can't let that happen.

886
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,929
I'm the one who started it,

887
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,307
and it's up to me to protect it.

888
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,935
I should do it.

889
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,566
Ms. Kang, look at me.

890
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,069
Just think about one thing.

891
01:00:57,278 --> 01:01:00,490
It's you who founded and brought
Peoplez where it is today.

892
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,700
If it wasn't you,

893
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,952
no one could have led Peoplez.

894
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,510
You're doing very well.

895
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,098
So stop worrying.

896
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,559
And let me get off work.

897
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:29,602
What?

898
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,188
Everyone left.

01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,800
Thank you. It's all thanks to you.

903
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,552
Hey, Ms. Kang.

904
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:03,678
Over here.

905
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,980
I'll work hard.
I won't forget your support.

906
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,773
Father, Ms. Kang is here.

907
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,405
Hello, sir.

908
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,532
You're here.

909
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,618
I must be quite late.

910
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,412
Hello, Ms. Kim!

911
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,709
I'm sure you know each other.

912
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,919
Have you met Mr. Woo?

913
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,546
I met him a few times.

914
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,173
Good to see you, Mr. Woo.

915
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,592
I didn't expect to see you here.

916
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:45,720
I'm getting a lot of help
from the Chairman these days.

917
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,015
All right!

918
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:53,936
I invited you here today
for a special celebration.

919
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,688
Vice President Lee Seok-jin.

920
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,777
Vice President Lee Seok-jin

921
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,822
has become the vice president
at Korea Investment Corporation.

922
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,450
- Are you starting next week?
- Yes, sir.

923
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:11,871
He'll be a big help to our members.

924
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,873
I'm Lee Seok-jin.
I look forward to working with you.

925
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,630
Wait!

926
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,257
And Ms. Kim.

927
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:26,844
CEO Kim Hye-jin has worked
very hard on this.

928
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,346
You flatter me.

929
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:32,141
After all, it's my job to recommend
a good candidate who fits the position.

930
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,353
Please feel free to recommend me
any good candidate.

931
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:36,979
Everyone, make recommendations!

932
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:42,985
Wishing tremendous success to all of you.

933
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:44,862
Cheers!

934
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,448
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

935
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:57,124
Wasn't Ms. Kang in charge of your work?

936
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,086
Is she not as good as she used to be?

937
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,506
If she wasn't competent,
she'd be gone already.

938
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,341
I wouldn't turn my back on her.

939
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,178
The only thing she can count on
is her brain.

940
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:13,307
If you're looking to hire, ask Ms. Kang.

941
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:15,935
Oh, Mr. Park

942
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,271
weren't you looking for a son-in-law?

943
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:22,817
Ms. Kang, find a man whom
Mr. Park would like as a son-in-law.

944
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,069
Does she find people like that too?

945
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:29,240
Can I ask you for a professional golfer
who gives private lessons?

946
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,325
Someone with a pretty face, if possible.

947
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,204
You'd better pay her a big commission.

948
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,707
- Father.
- Headhunters aren't anything special.

949
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:42,003
They just find people you need
for a commission.

950
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,255
Isn't that right, Ms. Kang?

951
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,267
It seems you still lack
an understanding of headhunters.

952
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:58,227
I should work harder.

953
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:08,195
I'm sorry, but that isn't my specialty.

954
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:12,325
Ms. Kang, why are you so serious?

955
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:14,744
Leave it to me.

956
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:18,623
I'll find someone that
you'd absolutely be delighted with.

957
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,962
Please excuse me.
I have another meeting to attend.

958
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:27,590
Yes, go ahead.

959
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:29,133
Stay until the end.

960
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,597
This is my event.

961
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,226
I think you're smart enough
to know your place,

962
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,645
Ms. Kang.

963
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,947
Over here!

964
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,617
Give her a drink.

965
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,146
Drink.

966
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:07,732
I'm Yu Eun-ho,
Ms. Kang Ji-yun's secretary.

967
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:11,444
I apologize.
I wasn't able to clear her schedule.

968
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:15,156
Ms. Kang needs to go to her next meeting.

969
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,453
Your loyalty is excessive.

970
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,623
You should know whether
it's your place to step in or not.

971
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:27,710
I apologize for being rude.

972
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:32,256
I learned that a secretary's priority is
the person he serves.

973
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:42,892
Let's go, Ms. Kang.

974
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,450
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM SHIN-ROCK

975
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:29,271
<i>You don't have to be perfect.</i>

976
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,648
<i>It's okay to look shabby.</i>

977
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:33,317
<i>However you are, I'll stay by your side.</i>

978
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,276
<i>CEO Min Jeong-hyuk.</i>

979
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,362
<i>He's the CEO of a successful</i>
<i>interior design company.</i>

980
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,697
Are you free for dinner tonight?

981
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,825
<i>Will Ms. Kang be interested in him?</i>

982
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,076
<i>Do you know each other?</i>

983
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,452
<i>We're comrades.</i>

984
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:45,871
- Unrequited--
- It's nothing.

985
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,706
What's your relationship with Su-hyeon?

986
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,583
<i>You have an eye for women.</i>

987
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,293
Do you even know what she's like?

988
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,379
<i>He texted to tell me</i>
<i>that he can't be at work today.</i>

989
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,089
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

990
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:57,174
Today,

991
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,426
I met your father.

992
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:05,224
