00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,420
THE CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS
COMPANIES, AND PLACES

2
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,964
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,767
Will you be okay?

4
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,935
I can sleep at my place now.

5
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,896
Please talk to Byeol for me.

6
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,899
Go inside.

7
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,025
Drive safely.

8
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,618
I'll go after you leave.

9
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,661
I'll call you when I get home.

10
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,723
FINAL EPISODE

11
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,398
<i>Everyone at Peoplez.</i>

12
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,111
<i>Please come to the office</i>
<i>tomorrow by 10 a.m.</i>

13
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,157
<i>Do you want to go to the sea?</i>

14
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,828
<i>What were you thinking about?</i>

15
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,371
<i>Ever since I met you,</i>

16
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,623
<i>so many things have changed.</i>

17
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,294
I always thought that I was responsible
for everything.

18
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,880
Helping Peoplez grow

19
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,966
and protecting it.

20
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,135
I thought that I was alone in it.

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,262
After seeing the employees
at the bookstore,

22
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,264
<i>I realized that I was wrong.</i>

23
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,571
Chairman Woo is right.

24
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,115
Even if I fight and keep my position,

25
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,034
things won't go back
to being normal at Peoplez.

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,079
The employees shouldn't
have to deal with that.

27
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:46,875
I told you.

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,378
Thanks to you,
I realize what's truly important.

29
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,590
My employees,

30
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,301
I want to protect them.

31
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,182
You're amazing.

32
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,020
I believe in your decision.

33
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,647
Thank you.

34
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,985
Then there's only one thing

35
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,863
I have to do.

36
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,658
Always stay by your side.

37
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,636
I called you all today

38
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,846
for an announcement.

39
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,402
Starting today,

40
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,616
I'll no longer be the CEO at Peoplez.

41
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,785
What?

42
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,917
Our company will be acquired
by Career Way.

43
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,712
All of you will be transferred.

44
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,465
You can keep coming to work like always.

45
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,261
I apologize for not working with you
until the end.

46
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,222
Instead of me,

47
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,557
it will be up to you

48
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,185
to protect Peoplez.

49
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,068
Wh… What?

50
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,362
What is she talking about?

51
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,828
What happened?

52
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,538
I don't understand what's going on.

53
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,748
- What you just said--
- Was it Chairman Woo?

54
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,333
Did my father do this?

55
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,751
It was my decision.

56
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,379
Both of you will also be transferred.
Give it some thought.

57
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,047
Kang Ji-yun, why you…

58
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,508
Making an announcement
doesn't make it final.

59
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,761
How could you make such a decision
without discussing it with us?

60
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,013
I can't agree with this.

61
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,764
I'll do anything to stop it,

62
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,807
so think it over.

63
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,059
Wait, Mr. Woo.

64
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,735
You knew, didn't you?

65
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,487
But you didn't stop her?

66
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,455
Mr. Wang, where's my father?

67
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,666
Mr. Yu,

68
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,210
is this really
the decision that's been made?

69
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,506
Eun-ho, this is wrong.
We got all the evidence.

70
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,717
You know why we worked so hard.

71
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,053
Is this really Ms. Kang's decision?

72
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,262
Do you agree with it?

73
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,938
You all know very well.

74
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,857
Once a search firm loses its credibility,

75
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,901
it's very difficult for the firm
to get back on its feet.

76
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,570
The case might not even be resolved.

77
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,655
Even if it does,

78
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,075
Peoplez may no longer have clients.

79
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,326
But…

80
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,453
Still…

81
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,873
Ms. Kang thinks

82
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,626
that this is the best choice

83
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,753
in order to protect you.

84
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,312
Who is he? Why is he in my office?

85
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,106
- Send him out.
- Chairman Woo.

86
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:42,985
I lost.

87
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,863
I'll join your company.

88
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,075
If you tell me to come back home,

89
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,410
I will.

90
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,416
Now that the company is going under,

91
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,044
you finally see reality, don't you?

92
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,755
In return, don't take Peoplez away

93
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,465
from Kang Ji-yun.

94
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,843
You want to sell yourself
to protect Peoplez?

95
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,013
Do you think you're worth that much?

96
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,348
Of course not.

97
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,725
I wouldn't.

98
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,354
If Sung-hoon couldn't satisfy you,
who would?

99
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,939
I mean,

100
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,942
is it possible for anyone
to meet your expectations?

101
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,778
Sung-hoon worked so hard.

102
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,615
Just to be accepted by you,
he worked so hard until the end…

103
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,959
I can't be like Sung-hoon.

104
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,044
But

105
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,880
I'll try.

106
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,383
If that's what you want,

107
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,676
I will do it.

108
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,521
So please,

109
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,816
leave Kang Ji-yun alone.

110
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,610
I beg you.

111
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,417
WOO JEONG-HOON

112
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,812
What are you still doing here?

113
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,858
After leaving, you didn't answer
your phone all day long.

114
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,693
I'm sorry. I wasn't aware of it.

115
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,822
Also, the company will be fine. So…

116
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,033
The only solution you came up with

117
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,535
is working for Chairman Woo?

118
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,539
What else can I do?

119
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,541
This is the only weapon I have.

120
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,547
- Mr. Woo--
- I was going to surrender anyway.

121
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,592
I realized that I can't survive
without Dad.

122
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,928
I'm tired of sleeping away from home.

123
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,138
If I'm going to surrender anyway,

124
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,975
I'd better get something out of it.

125
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,353
I want to be helpful in your life
at least once.

126
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,648
It's my decision.

127
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,442
If I wanted to fight,
no matter what the chairman did,

128
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,444
I would've persisted. You know that.

129
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,490
Jeong-hoon.

130
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,201
I understand you.

131
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,578
I really do,

132
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,121
but I'm fine.

133
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,914
So don't do this for me.

134
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,791
- Ji-yun--
- If you want to be considerate,

135
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,585
until you find your own answer,

136
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,169
don't give up the fight.

137
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,130
No matter the reason.

138
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,638
The contract for share transfer
has been signed.

139
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,017
Please sign the company
acquisition agreement.

140
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,729
KIM HYE-JIN

141
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,063
ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

142
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,652
KANG JI-YUN

143
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,418
The company acquisition contract
has been finalized.

144
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,420
Congratulations, Ms. Kim.

145
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,213
You got everything you wanted.

146
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,716
It's all thanks to you. Thank you.

147
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,176
Thanks to you, without incurring losses,

148
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,386
I disposed of these bothersome shares.

149
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,597
This is what you call a win-win situation.

150
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,892
Good job, Ms. Kang.

151
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,727
Thank you for everything.

152
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,746
How do you feel now that
I took away your company?

153
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,625
Please take good care of my employees.

154
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,126
Please transfer them as promised.

155
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,045
That's not for you to worry about.

156
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,089
Compared to a company
involved in an investment fraud,

157
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,883
the number one company
in the field is 100 times better.

158
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,511
Your employees will also be happy
about the acquisition.

159
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,806
Let's go.

160
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,477
Your judgment isn't as clear as I thought.

161
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,272
I didn't think you'd decide
to sink with her.

162
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,948
Kang Ji-yun.

163
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:43,661
Watch carefully

164
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,873
how fast Peoplez and your name disappear.

165
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,711
Five years of your life
will collapse in vain.

166
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,006
Is one week enough?

167
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,591
Your CEO office,

168
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,634
empty it completely.

169
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,469
Leave no trace of yourself.

170
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,734
Daddy Yu, are you okay?

171
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,611
Of course. Don't worry.

172
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,488
Let me know if you need any help.

173
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,115
You're helping me enough already.

174
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,241
Thank you.

175
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:26,704
Dad, let's go.

176
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,830
Let's go.

177
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,331
Bye, Byeol.

178
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,375
- Bye.
- See you.

179
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,668
See you.

180
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,594
Byeol.

181
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,096
I heard that you had
a watermelon party at school.

182
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,182
- Was it fun?
- Yes.

183
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,808
- Dad.
- Yes?

184
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,854
What is it?

185
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,357
Dad, stay strong.

186
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,737
Did my encouragement get through?

187
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,071
Yes.

188
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,033
Give Sis a hug for me just like that.

189
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,496
Okay, I will.

190
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,208
I'm so moved

191
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,127
that I feel absolutely charged!

192
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,031
AGENDA

193
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,035
Yes, we're still discussing it.

194
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,414
- Are you still considering it?
- Is that what you're looking for?

195
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,583
- I see what you mean.
- Yes.

196
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,207
You worked so hard for five years.

197
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,797
Let's go now.

198
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,195
We should take that off first.

199
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,656
Let's come up with a new name.

200
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,366
Yes, ma'am.

201
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,646
RESIGNATION LETTER

202
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,428
She probably saw the resignation letters
by now, right?

203
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,179
Did we do the right thing?

204
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,432
Kyung-hwa, you made your decision,

205
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,850
don't regret it.

206
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,732
Stop shaking your leg.

207
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,570
Are we going to be okay?

208
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,031
There are so many search firms out there.

209
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,659
Let's relax before thinking about it.

210
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,663
We won't still be here in a month.

211
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,248
We can't stay like this.

212
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,879
I thought I saw it somewhere.

213
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,131
Hey, Mr. Lee.

214
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,258
- The table of organization…
- We can find it.

215
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,468
Goodness.

216
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,594
I'm sure it's somewhere.

217
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,305
- Let's see.
- It says here…

218
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,267
Ms. Kim, many aren't happy
about the acquisition.

219
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,978
Once they find out that over 90 percent
of the employees resigned,

220
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,271
things could get messy.

221
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,398
We need to hurry and come up with a plan.

222
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,152
Are you CEO Kim Hye-jin?

223
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,697
Yes. Who are you?

224
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,157
We're the police.

225
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,743
CEO Park Young-min of Ikonic
turned himself in.

226
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,998
During his testimony, your name came up.

227
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,666
You need to come with us.

228
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,001
CEO Park Young-min?

229
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,544
Wasn't that the fraud case?

230
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:11,298
What? What's going on here?

231
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,884
<i>As CEO Park Young-min turned himself in,</i>

232
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,804
<i>Ikonic Biotechnology's investment fraud</i>
<i>turned over a new leaf.</i>

233
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,806
As professional investors,
they approached me first.

234
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,600
<i>Other than Park Young-min,</i>
<i>other people had also been involved.</i>

235
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,977
Didn't you collude with him
to approach Park Young-min?

236
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,521
<i>Kim, CEO of a famous search firm.</i>

237
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,022
I said no.

238
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,399
Other than Park Young-min's testimony,
do you have proof?

239
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,236
<i>Professional Investor Han is suspected</i>
<i>to be behind it. He's being investigated.</i>

240
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,862
- Have you changed your legal name?
- Yes.

241
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,989
Is that a problem?

242
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,033
You've been hiding
after changing your name.

243
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,119
<i>Han's previous criminal records</i>
<i>were found.</i>

244
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,996
<i>Han and Kim are suspected of colluding</i>

245
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,125
<i>in another investment fraud</i>
<i>five years ago, which is causing a shock.</i>

246
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,585
The company's employee who was involved

247
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,254
in the investment fraud five years ago,

248
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,463
was it Kim Hye-jin?

249
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,841
Yes, that's correct.

250
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,428
Thank you for your cooperation.

251
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,848
The result will be announced soon.

252
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,266
Thank you for your work.

253
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,935
THE CITIZENS' POLICE
WHO ARE RESPECTED AND LOVED

254
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,728
Kang Ji-yun!

255
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,277
Was it you?

256
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,654
I don't know what kind
of trick you pulled,

257
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,906
but this won't destroy me.

258
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,283
You think you've won?

259
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,160
Are you having fun?

260
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,787
No.

261
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,164
I pity you.

262
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,249
You're still lost in resentment.

263
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,127
I no longer live with hatred.

264
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,212
Pay for your sin,

265
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,840
and beg for forgiveness from CEO Lee
for the rest of your life.

266
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,555
Kang Ji-yun!

267
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,893
This is all because of you.

268
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,895
Kang Ji-yun!

269
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,689
If you hadn't been in my life…

270
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,483
Yong-hoon passed away because of you!

271
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,569
Hey! You…

272
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,530
DODAM BOOK STORE

273
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,827
Goodness.

274
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,038
The new CEO at Career Way took up office.

275
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,540
I wonder how many years
Kim Hye-jin will get?

276
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,084
Rot in prison for a long time.

277
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,378
What's going to happen to Peoplez?

278
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,255
Can't Ji-yun become the CEO again?

279
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,798
At no cost? No way.

280
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,927
Kim Hye-jin made a huge mess
for the acquisition,

281
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,137
so Career Way incurred a big loss.

282
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,766
- You need money for the acquisition.
- How about getting an investment?

283
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,061
She doesn't want to be swayed
by investors anymore.

284
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,605
What's Ji-yun planning to do now?

285
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,149
I don't know, which is driving me nuts.

286
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,693
Goodness. Has Eun-ho told you anything?

287
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,654
No.

288
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,447
What if you become

289
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,782
unemployed at this rate?

290
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,744
Should I look for another job?

291
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,123
That girl.
What could possibly be on her mind?

292
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,315
How much longer will you sleep?
It's time to get up.

293
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,317
Why are you here so early?

294
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,443
Early?

295
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,154
- It's past 10 a.m.
- Let me sleep a little longer.

296
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,489
I have nothing to do anyway.

297
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,283
Wow.

298
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,743
It looks like being unemployed suits you.

299
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,832
I had no idea not working felt so good.

300
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,543
It's been years
since the last time I slept in.

301
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,379
Are you going to sleep all day?

302
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,425
No, I'm going to play with Eun-ho.

303
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,759
Doing what?

304
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,973
Come here for a second.

305
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,811
This is great.

306
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,188
Let me sleep a little longer like this.

307
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,529
Let me sleep a little more.

308
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,536
Go ahead and sleep.

309
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,246
Come on, Yu Eun-ho.

310
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,665
What, Kang Ji-yun?

311
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,044
Kang Ji-yun?

312
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,087
Yes, you aren't a CEO anymore.

313
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,839
- But still…
- Ji-yun.

314
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,258
Ji-yun…

315
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,094
- Come on.
- Goodness.

316
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,221
I'll let it go since you're handsome.

317
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,474
I'll let it go since you're pretty.

318
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,270
The sun's in my eyes.

319
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,324
- I'll finish cleaning then.
- Okay.

320
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,755
Next, please.

321
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,348
Is this restaurant that amazing?

322
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,478
It's my favorite restaurant.

323
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,606
Give it a try. You'll find out.

324
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,858
That, I will.

325
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,451
What a good meal.

326
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,746
I give you credit for it.

327
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,956
Of course.

328
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,963
Rain? Let's run.

329
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,556
Let's get under here.

330
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,559
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

331
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,231
I haven't seen this type of rain
in a long time.

332
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,900
Do you like it when it rains?

333
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,402
Yes, it's nice to listen to the rain.

334
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,863
What kind of weather do you like?

335
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,910
I've never really thought about it.

336
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,121
What have I been doing all my life?

337
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,669
We can find things out together
from now on.

338
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,754
I'd love to.

339
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,381
It's refreshing.

340
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,401
I can't believe we're drinking
when it's still daytime.

341
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,445
I didn't expect to do this in my life.

342
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,656
You've never drank during the day?
Is it your first time?

343
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,783
Not even in college?

344
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,952
No, I haven't.

345
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,620
You had no dreams.

346
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,872
You need someone together
to have dreams with.

347
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,841
Booze in the day tastes sweet.

348
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,511
It's tasty.

349
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,015
Whenever I'm with you, I become impulsive.

350
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,142
Usually, I get nervous without plans.

351
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,770
- Isn't it fun?
- I'm in a bind.

352
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,483
Bottoms up. I'm getting drunk today.

353
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,581
It's so pretty.

354
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,380
TODAY'S FOUR SHOTS

355
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,760
I've never done it before.

356
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,971
- I haven't done it either.
- Really?

357
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,143
I'll be taller than Eun-ho.

358
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,823
LATE WOO SUNG-HOON

359
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,208
Have you been coming here?

360
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,462
Sung-hoon would be happy.

361
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,428
I found them while cleaning up
the room yesterday.

362
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,639
The photos have always been
in Sung-hoon's study,

363
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,516
but I could never find them.

364
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,143
Maybe it led me to meet you here.

365
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,988
Sung-hoon said that he had
vivid memories of that day.

366
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:26,621
I brought these photos for Sung-hoon,

367
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,291
but they must have been for you.

368
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,087
When Sung-hoon passed away,

369
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,755
I had many regrets.

370
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:39,175
When he was suffering,
I should've listened more.

371
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,219
I should've consoled him more.

372
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,055
But I couldn't do that.

373
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,559
I hated you so much

374
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,644
that I hated Sung-hoon as well.

375
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,605
I know that you resent me.

376
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,066
I won't ask you to stop hating me,

377
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,737
but don't repeat the same mistake
with Jeong-hoon.

378
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,657
Jeong-hoon has never hated you.

379
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,325
So please,

380
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,828
forgive yourself.

381
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,428
SPEECH ON EMPLOYMENT
PERSONALITY AND EMPLOYMENT

382
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,056
NOW HIRING

383
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,892
I can't find anything.

384
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,755
Wow, you're working hard.

385
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,925
Hey. Why do you look so pretty today?

386
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,805
I dressed up a little.

387
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,515
Do I look okay?

388
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,936
Did you dress up to meet me?

389
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,483
No, I had a meeting
with my publisher today.

390
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,029
A meeting with your publisher?

391
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,284
Ta-da!

392
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,661
My new book's finally out.

393
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,288
What? That's amazing.

394
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,290
<i>On Monday Morning.</i>

395
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,961
It already looks amazing.

396
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,379
At first glance,

397
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,631
it's bound to be a bestseller.

398
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,174
Congratulations, Ms. Jung.

399
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,343
This is great.

400
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,346
Now, I can live off you.

401
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,307
Okay, let's do that.

402
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,976
I'm going to be a best-selling author.

403
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,063
How could you agree so easily?

404
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,315
"What are you saying?
Why would I support you?"

405
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,525
That should be your response.

406
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,443
Ms. Jung,
you're getting yourself in trouble.

407
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,696
You just told me to support you.

408
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,409
You don't say that just to anyone, right?

409
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,412
- I'm not sure.
- What?

410
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,082
Hold that thought.

411
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,503
- Hello?
- <i>Woo Jeong-hoon, where are you?</i>

412
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,798
I didn't forget
about working part-time today.

413
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,425
I'll be there on time.

414
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,635
Okay, okay, okay.

415
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,554
I shouldn't talk back as a part-timer.

416
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,680
Okay.

417
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,392
I shouldn't have agreed to work part-time.

418
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,643
Why?

419
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,020
Seong-kyung harasses me too much.

420
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,734
Okay, let's get going.

421
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,695
We only have three hours of free time.

422
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:46,946
Okay.

423
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,240
I looked up where we're going today.

424
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,742
Just trust me and follow me.

425
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,827
Wow. Okay.

426
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,373
- What?
- What?

427
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,917
We're wearing the same shoes.

428
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,169
What on earth?

429
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,463
- Goodness.
- How could you?

430
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,131
Don't make it so obvious.

431
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,008
- But…
- My goodness!

432
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,219
Oh, my.

433
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,100
Jeong-hoon.

434
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,478
I heard that it's scarier
than you'd think.

435
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,229
Will you be okay?

436
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,440
- Me?
- Yes.

437
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,276
- Are you really asking me?
- Yes.

438
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,738
To be honest, I don't believe in ghosts.

439
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,283
I watch horror movies before going to bed.

440
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,787
If you're very scared,
don't worry and just follow me.

441
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,246
I'll protect you.

442
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,331
Okay.

443
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,959
Can I count on you?

444
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,251
Of course.

445
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,920
It's made by people.

446
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,380
It can't be that scary.

447
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,548
I think it's moving.

448
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,841
Where are we going?

449
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,929
My goodness!

450
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,764
Oh, my.

451
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,433
A foot. It was just a foot.

452
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,435
That startled me.

453
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,939
Shall I take the lead?

454
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,775
- No, I'll take the lead. Stay behind me.
- Okay.

455
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,026
It's dangerous.

456
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:14,951
Jeong-hoon?

457
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:15,910
Yes?

458
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,996
Oh, I mean,

459
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,915
there was something on your clothes.
I took it off for you.

460
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,000
- I see.
- I took it off.

461
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,293
- Was something on my clothes?
- Yes.

462
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,005
- I gave it some thought.
- Yes?

463
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,133
I think there's nothing
protecting our backs.

464
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,718
- Right.
- If you can lead the way,

465
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,137
I'll cover our backs.

466
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,097
- Me?
- Yes.

467
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,349
You lead the way.
It's more dangerous behind us.

468
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,976
- Me first?
- Yes.

469
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,310
Go ahead.

470
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,146
- I'll look behind us.
- Okay.

471
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,608
- Jeong-hoon.
- Yes?

472
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,319
Are you doing okay?

473
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,654
Yes, I'm fine.

474
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,781
I'm keeping an eye on what's behind us…

475
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,533
- Okay.
- …so don't worry.

476
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,914
Please leave. Leave.

477
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,041
Please.

478
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,043
Darn it.

479
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,640
- I'm sorry.
- I…

480
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,725
I'm sorry.

481
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,518
- I was startled.
- I know.

482
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,314
Shall we continue?

483
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,691
- Shall we?
- Yes.

484
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,027
Oh, goodness.

485
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,570
This is nothing.

486
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,363
Nothing to it.

487
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,656
I'm getting hungry.

488
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,784
Me too. How about some tteokbokki?

489
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,285
Tteokbokki sounds good.

490
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,456
Hello. Hi.

491
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,791
Hello.

492
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,459
You came together.

493
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,920
Did you go somewhere together?

494
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,047
Yes, with Ms. Jung…

495
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,926
Around the corner.

496
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,136
We just met around the corner.

497
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,554
By chance, right?

498
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,390
Yes, just around the corner by chance.

499
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,770
You should go in.
The director is waiting for you.

500
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,688
Then I'll get going.

501
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,232
Come to our house again.

502
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,858
I'll make you something good.

503
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,610
Ma'am, I'd be so grateful.

504
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,446
I still can't forget that deliciousness.

505
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,448
Please invite me.

506
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,783
- Sure.
- I'll be going.

507
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,118
Bye.

508
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,541
Hey, I'm for him. I like him.

509
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,335
Mom, it's not… It's not what you think.

510
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:31,254
Who are you kidding?

511
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,506
You tried on everything
you had in your room.

512
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,927
That's because I had a meeting
with the publisher.

513
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,221
Let's go, Byeol.

514
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,517
Seo-jun, did you notice
that her ears turned red?

515
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,936
Yes, she's embarrassed.

516
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,021
- Grandma.
- Yes?

517
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,523
Should we pretend not to know?

518
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,401
Goodness. All right then.

519
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,570
Seo-jun, you're better than me.

520
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,705
This is so tiring.

521
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,834
Where did she go after making me clean?

522
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,252
Why isn't she back yet?

523
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,379
Goodness.

524
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,131
HANEUL KINDERGARTEN

525
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,718
CHAIRMAN

526
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,305
Hello?

527
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,514
I unblocked your credit card.

528
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,642
- What?
<i>- Stop sleeping outside and come home.</i>

529
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,895
Father, are you unwell?

530
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,397
Crazy fool.

531
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,399
Make time for a meal together.

532
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,110
Darn it.

533
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,327
What? What did he just say?

534
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,329
What are you doing?

535
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,414
Why aren't you cleaning?

536
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,291
I mean…

537
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,502
Father told me to come back home.

538
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,215
He even unblocked my credit card.
What does that mean?

539
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,634
It looks like he wants to make up.

540
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,177
Make up?

541
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,929
Make up, my foot.

542
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,680
You still don't know my father.

543
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,599
It's you

544
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,684
who doesn't know him.

545
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,311
I'm off.

546
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,044
Why aren't you eating?

547
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:41,425
I can't eat without knowing your motive.

548
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,931
What do you want? Tell me now.

549
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,352
Just father and son just having a meal.

550
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,770
Do I need a motive?

551
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,856
What do you plan to do?

552
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,360
I'm still searching.

553
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,696
Being like this at my age,

554
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,281
I find myself quite pathetic.

555
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,574
I don't know

556
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,287
what it means to live well.

557
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,500
It's not something
you can figure out fast.

558
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,673
So how are you these days?
Are you all right?

559
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,592
What?

560
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,760
Are you all right?

561
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,973
Well, I guess so.

562
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,517
I'm working part-time.

563
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,690
Since when were you so interested in me?

564
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,192
I've never asked your brother

565
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,820
if he was all right.

566
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,157
I thought that he could handle it.

567
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,284
As his father,

568
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,536
I wasn't aware of it.

569
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,631
Live your life the way you want.

570
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:06,927
I don't want to lose you too.

571
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,558
Why don't we eat together sometimes?

572
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,181
Wow, Yu Eun-ho.

573
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,142
What?

574
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,353
You look much better. Why is that?

575
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,646
Why do you look better?

576
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,773
Is looking better a problem?

577
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,441
Thanks for the drink.

578
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,777
I heard that your company went under.

579
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,780
I thought you'd be idling about.

580
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,824
I wanted to appear as your savior.

581
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,243
What is it?
What could possibly make you my savior?

582
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,455
Director Lee told me to bring you back.

583
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,666
General Manager Song ended up
getting kicked out.

584
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,042
He wasn't competent.

585
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,378
He lasted a while,
just using his connections.

586
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,172
As soon as General Manager Song got fired,

587
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,049
he was looking for you.

588
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,343
The ace at Hansu Electronics' HR.

589
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,178
You're coming, right?

590
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,972
You'll be returning, right?

591
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,182
No, I'm not going.

592
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,184
But why? Why?

593
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,978
You got a job somewhere else?

594
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,355
No, not yet.

595
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,608
There's a place I need to be.

596
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,905
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Ji-yun, what are you doing?

597
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,491
The weather is nice.
How about going on a date?

598
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,285
I can't today.

599
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,828
They're already here.

600
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,289
- I'm busy right now. I've got to go.
- <i>Ji-yun--</i>

601
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,930
What's this?

602
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,766
I'm going to start working again.

603
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,020
This is my office.

604
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,272
I'm going to start again
from the beginning.

605
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,982
Without anyone's help.

606
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,734
Without being swayed by anyone.

607
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,776
On my own.

608
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,281
Then this must be my seat.

609
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,033
You got a nice, big table.

610
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,910
No, there's no place for you.

611
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,788
- What?
- Yu Eun-ho, you're fired.

612
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,626
You were supposed to work
only for six months.

613
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,420
Do you mean that? What do you mean?

614
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:51,634
The Selim Group is looking
for a team leader for human resources.

615
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,427
And I got commissioned.

HIRING HR TEAM LEADER
AT SELIM GROUP

617
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,980
Hello, Ms. Park.

618
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,399
It's been a while. How are you?

619
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,527
<i>Ms. Kang, are you working again?</i>

620
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,695
I have a project starting next month.

621
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,489
<i>This is all thanks to you.</i>

622
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:17,117
I'd like you to be in charge
of the hiring.

623
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,410
<i>Is it possible?</i>

624
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,622
Yes.

625
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,165
It's possible.

626
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,125
<i>Someone with a good understanding</i>
<i>of human resources,</i>

627
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,628
leadership, and communication skills.

628
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,296
No matter where I looked,

629
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,048
I couldn't find anyone as good as you.

630
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,800
- Ji-yun--
- Eun-ho.

631
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,762
You've given me so much up until now.

632
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,430
So now, I'd like you

633
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,058
to make a decision only for yourself.

634
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,062
Please be the first candidate

635
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,064
at my new company.

636

AT SELIM GROUP

639
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,359
Hello, Ms. Park.

640
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,447
Yes, thank you.

641
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:19,782
Okay.

642
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,716
Wow, what's all this?

643
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,511
We have good news for your dad.

644
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,596
Let's throw a surprise party for him.

645
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,108
Ji-yun?

646
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,069

WE SUPPORT
YU EUN-HO'S NEW BEGINNING

648
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,965
DAD, CONGRATULATIONS
ON GETTING ANOTHER JOB

649
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,930
Dad, congratulations.

650
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,348
Eun-ho, congratulations.

651
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,520
Did I get the job?

652
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:34,690
I told you that there wasn't anyone
as good as you.

653
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,567
Byeol.

654
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:37,734
Come on.

655
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,696
Ta-da.

656
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,115
- Dad, hurry and blow out the candle.
- Blow at the count of three.

657
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,075
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

658
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,831
Congratulations.

659
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:58,338
Byeol, what did I tell you?

660
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,132
Happiness is

661
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,842
something you share!

662
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,927
Don't get caught.

663
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,389
Byeol, turn around.

664
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,515
Run away.

665
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,274
You can't run away from me.

666
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,613
Run away, Byeol.

667
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,038
It was a success. Right, Byeol?

668
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,334
I'm so happy.

669
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,004
That looks pretty.

670
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,552
- We're happy.
- There.

671
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,600
That was fun. One more time.

672
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,686
One more time.

673
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,359
Gosh, who's this?

674
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,069
- Who's this?
- Goodness.

675
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,529
- Hello.
- Hello.

676
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,030
- Ms. Kang.
- What a nice house.

677
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,032
- Congratulations on opening your company.
- Thank you.

678
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,034
- Please come in.
- Okay.

679
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,036
- What a lovely apartment.
- It's nice.

680
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,496
- Hello.
- Hello!

681
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,167
Eun-ho.

682
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,670
Congratulations on getting a new job.

683
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,632
- Byeol is…
- How cute.

684
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,010
Don't get your hopes up. It's nothing big.

685
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,471
- Thank you.
- It looks expensive.

686
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,890
You prepared so much food.

687
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,101
You didn't have to do anything. Thank you.

688
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,520
That isn't a way to serve guests.

689
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,983
- Has everyone been doing well?
- Yes, sure.

690
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,484
I've been well.

691
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,321
You don't have any other employees?

692
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,283
- Did the two of you start the company?
- Yes.

693
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,076
We did.

694
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,328
Here I am being treated like dirt,

695
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,414
working by Ji-yun's side again.

696
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,832
I chose an arduous path.

697
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,250
- Aren't you sad for me?
- What?

698
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,043
You invited yourself in.

699
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,169
Should I leave?

700
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,797
You may join freely,
but you can't leave freely.

701
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,925
- Don't you dare!
- You two haven't changed at all.

702
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,636
Being together like this,
I feel like we're back at Peoplez.

703
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,013
This is great.

704
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,017
I'm not saying this to please you.

705
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,519
When we were working together,
those were the best times.

706
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,232
What's wrong?

707
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,192
Mr. Kim, you haven't changed at all.

708
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,777
Did I say something wrong?

709
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,988
Why would you bring up Peoplez?

710
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,073
That's fine. I also thought

711
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,200
about you a lot.

712
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,121
If you're okay with it,

713
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:39,875
would you like to work with me again?

714
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:45,339
I'd like to start anew.

715
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,965
And I need you.

716
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,304
Ms. Kang?

717
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,349
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

718
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,060
It's a proposal for a new job.

719
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,604
- She prepared it.
- Really?

720
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,523
Think about it carefully,
and let me know your decision.

721
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,068
Okay, I'll think carefully about it.

722
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:09,404
You'll come? You wouldn't leave me
suffering Ji-yun alone, would you?

723
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,324
If Ms. Kang needs me,
I'll definitely join!

724
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,076
Be quiet. I mean,

725
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,535
no need to be hasty.

726
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,954
We should read her proposal first.

727
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,956
- Aren't you going to join?
- I mean…

728
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,125
Ms. Kang?

729
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,461
May I ask for one more condition?

730
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,088
Would that be possible?

731
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:29,841
Sure, let me know
if there's something you want.

732
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,387
Every month,

733
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,847
two company dinners guaranteed.

734
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,975
Come on, Mr. Kim.
We should take this seriously!

735
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,520
Listen, this is very important to me.

736
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,606
Three times.

737
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,317
If there are two every month, I won't go.

738
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,069
- Let's do it once a month.
- Once?

739
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,823
Hello, everyone. Ciao, hi, aloha!

740
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,450
Ms. Kang, congrats on your new company!

741
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,788
I wanted to get you a bouquet,
but there were only vases.

742
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,459
I heard that you joined
Chairman Woo's company.

743
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,627
When you hire employees,

744
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:09,464
please use our service often
as our client.

745
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,258
Yes, I will.

746
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,718
How's work?

747
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:16,179
I'm doing it my own way.

748
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,264
I'm different from Sung-hoon.

749
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,728
Also, Mr. Yu. Congratulations
on getting a new job.

750
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,440
Congratulations to you too.

751
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:28,859
You're the same.

752
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,235
Be good.

753
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,570
Your face hasn't changed, either.

754
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,991
What's this?

755
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,034
Everyone,

756
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,162
don't get carried away by the mood

757
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,205
and agree to join.

758
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,499
Read the contract thoroughly.

759
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,586
When will we ever get to play
hard to get with Kang Ji-yun?

760
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,129
What?

761
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,549
Exactly. That's what I wanted to say.

762
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,509
Ms. Kang, can I ask for something?

763
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,969
Confiscate Mr. Kim's notebook.

764
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,429
Sis, this is for you.

765
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,473
Byeol, what's this?

766
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,934
I promised to name your company.

767
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,770
You're right.

768
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:06,897
"We"?

769
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,315
Yes.

770
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,443
Since it's us, We.

771
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,237
Since it's us?

772
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,616
We.

773
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,701
We?

774
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,411
Wait, Byeol.

775
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,881
What do you think?

776
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,758
We Company.

777
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,092
It sounds catchy.

778
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:37,803
It's nice.

779
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,972
Thank you, Byeol.

780
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,401
Did the meeting go well today?

781
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,778
You look very happy.

782
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,488
I have good news.

783
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,323
The reception of my picture book
was positive.

784
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:01,117
- It's likely to be printed again.
- Seriously?

785
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,247
Yes, I knew you'd make it.

786
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:08,875
Usually, I don't get ahead of myself,

787
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,044
but I'm excited about it this time.

788
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:13,004
It's only on the second edition,

789
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,924
but maybe it'll become a bestseller.

790
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,634
Only the second edition?

791
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,469
No one knows the future.

792
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,972
- Is that so?
- Of course not.

793
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,515
I PRAY FOR YOUR SUCCESS

794
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:27,686
You beautiful couple over there
who's curious about the future.

795
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:31,982
Us?

796
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,360
You wanted to know the future.

797
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,574
Jeong-hoon, let's just go.

798
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,534
Should we?

799
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,203
That's strange.

800
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,539
Why do I see a young boy

801
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,040
between the young couple?

802
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,919
FORTUNE-TELLING, TAROT CARDS

803
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,297
You're amazing.

804
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,008
All right.

805
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,259
Question?

806
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,137
Ms. Jung's book was published recently.

807
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,431
How many copies will it sell?

808
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,557
No, different question.

809
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:11,146
I'll be signing another contract.

810
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,606
Nothing like that.

811
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,275
Ask me something you really want to know.

812
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,818
Like what?

813
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,696
If things will go well between you.

814
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,115
Isn't that what you want to know?

815
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,786
After this fling, your time will be up.

816
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,040
- A fling? No way.
- A fling?

817
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,375
We're not having a fling.

818
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,501
Not at all.

819
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,503
Then what's your relationship?

820
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,588
Siblings? Friends?

821
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,466
Or a love affair?

822
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,009
A love affair? No way.

823
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,552
- A love affair?
- Don't say that.

824
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,262
- Of course not.
- That's ridiculous.

825
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,932
I need to know your relationship

826
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,892
before I can tell you anything.

827
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:52,228
Do you have to know
what kind of relationship we have…

828
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,611
Well…

829
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,614
What kind of relationship do we have?

830
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,910
Us?

831
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,995
We're just people

832
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:12,666
who meet occasionally and say hello?

833
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,921
Oh, Father.

834
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,172
You heard her.

835
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,091
We just come and go

836
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,551
and say hello.

837
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,805
Is that really our relationship?

838
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,100
We often drink together and talk a lot.

839
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,685
Last time, we went on a date…

840
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,479
Gosh, I can't believe this.

841
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,151
Instead, let's have
a different relationship.

842
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,493
Let's be interested in each other.

843
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,371
Starting from today.

844
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,431
You came to see a fortune teller,
but he's confessing his love instead.

845
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,186
- How much--
- Take her hand and get lost.

846
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:17,897
Thank you.

847
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,357
Goodbye.

848
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,947
Why are you holding my hand
all of a sudden?

849
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,128
I never had so many people
in my house at once.

850
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,590
I'm tired.

851
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,092
Maybe we should've taken tomorrow off.

852
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,221
Mr. Yu.

853
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,265
I'm CEO Kang Ji-yun at We Company.

854
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:54,851
Please send me many hiring requests.

855
00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,564
Are you promoting already?

856
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:04,152
I'll be hiring more personnel.

857
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,739
I'm glad to hear that.
I can leave without worrying.

858
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:11,701
It's all thanks to you.

859
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,955
Yu Eun-ho, you were my best secretary.

860
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,172
Kang Ji-yun, you were my best CEO.

861
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,352
<i>Good morning.</i>

862
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,604
Ms. Kang.

863
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:49,447
Please take good care of yourself.

864
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,213
You did an excellent job.

865
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:16,599
I get more scared as I grow older.

866
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,893
I feel like everything would end
at the slightest fall.

867
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,187
What's wrong with falling?
You can get back up.

868
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,231
I'll hold you.

869
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,778
All right, smile.

870
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:29,946
One, two, three.

871
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,704
<i>You don't have to be perfect.</i>

872
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,373
<i>It's okay to look shabby.</i>

873
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,709
However you are…

874
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,461
I'll stay by your side.

875
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,633
I will never

876
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,969
let go of this hand.

877
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,723
So, you don't let go either.

878
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,858
Wherever you are,

879
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,194
I'll never let go of your hand.

880
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,620
I love you.

881
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,458
I love you, too.

882
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,963
Are you awake?

883
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,550
How long have you been staring at me?

884
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,928
Oh, no.

885
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,264
I probably look swollen and ugly
since I just woke up.

886
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,226
Yes, that's true.

887
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,435
What?

888
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,354
Don't look.

889
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,357
I'm going to look.

890
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,780
Good morning.

891
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,952
Good morning.

892
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,801

893
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,992

BYEOL, CONGRATULATIONS

896
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,158
Dad, let's go.

897
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,078
What? You got ready faster than me?

898
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,162
Yes.

899
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:08,915
Let's go.

900
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,175
Go on.

901
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,885
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

902
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,473
Have a good day. Bye!

<i>Good morning.</i>

906
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,520
MY PERFECT SECRETARY

907
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:15,982
<i>Good morning.</i>

908
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,576
Can I get the last month's sales analysis…

909
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,202
Kwang-hee, you're an expert at this.

910
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,620
What do you think?

911
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,789
Instead of established brand designers,

912
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,250
streetwear brands would be more suitable.

913
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,669
I have a few brands in mind.

914
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,171
I can contact them right away.

915
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:39,422
- Could you?
- Yes.

916
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,975
Good morning, everyone.

917
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:52,435
- Hello.
- Hello, Ms. Kang.

918
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,561
Hello.

919
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,232
Hello, this is We Company.

920
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:00,067
Yes.

921
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,487
Not even one?

922
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,990
Okay, I understand.

923
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:08,201
What's the matter?

924
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:11,037
They want different candidates.

925
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,873
They couldn't find a suitable candidate
on our list.

926
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,668
- Is it them again?
- Yes.

927
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:22,757
I think you should discuss it with them
in person.

928
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,175
Okay, I'll meet with them.

929
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:33,601
You aren't happy with any
of the candidates that we recommended?

930
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,394
No.

931
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:38,397
We said that we're looking for people
specializing in this line of work.

932
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,735
Compared to their qualifications,
your candidates lack work experience.

933
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,071
We also told you
that the job scope was too narrow

934
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,280
in your job description.

935
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:49,909
For the position, there's a limit
to finding candidates

936
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,911
in the same field
with years of work experience.

937
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:54,622
Are you suggesting
we expand to other fields?

938
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:55,998
If you'll allow me,

939
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:59,460
I'll recommend candidates
with experience in various fields.

940
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:03,965
It could be a chance to provide
a new set of eyes to your company.

941
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,765
Sounds good. Please proceed.

942
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:16,727
Okay. I'll contact you again
once I make a new candidate list.

943
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,356
One moment, please.

944
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,233
Could you please check this as well?

JAEMIN SHIN PIANO RECITAL

948
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,974
ON MONDAY MORNING
CHAT WITH JUNG SU-HYEON

949
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,934
With your picture book
published last year,

950
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:59,812
you became a respectable writer
of a steady seller.

951
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,731
How do you feel?

952
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,443
I still can't believe it.

953
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:10,948
Could you tell us about the new book
that you're working on?

954
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,034
Please read it to find out.

955
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:15,328
It's coming out very soon.

956
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,039
You didn't fall for it.

957
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,792
Your family and friends must be
happy for you.

958
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,711
Who was the most excited about the news?

959
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:25,463
I'm not sure.

960
01:05:25,546 --> 01:05:27,924
It's very hard to pick just one person.

961
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:30,843
Right?

962
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,347
You have so many fans.

963
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,307
Picking only one must be hard.

964
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:41,020
- Let's get off work, everyone.
- Okay.

965
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,563
Well done today.

966
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:43,731
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

967
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,608
You got a date?

968
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:46,817
See you tomorrow.

969
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,947
Mr. Kim, how about a drink
with me tonight?

970
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,950
Who goes home late
after drinking these days?

971
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:55,952
I'm getting off work.

972
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,495
- See you.
- Bye.

973
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:58,913
- Bye.
- Bye.

974
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,374
How about you, Gyu-rim?

975
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,501
Just make up with Kyung-hwa already.

976
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:06,170
Make up for what? You've misunderstood.

977
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,339
I'm getting off work first!

978
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,092
That's enough.

979
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,301
See you tomorrow.

980
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:16,013
Ms. Seo, what are you doing tonight?
No, not with Ms. Seo.

981
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,809
- Please sit over there.
- Okay.

982
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,811
So you'll be joining us, right?

983
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,650
Why don't you call him?

984
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,318
- Shall I? Give it to me.
- No.

985
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,904
I won't forgive him so easily this time.

986
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,448
You two are such a handful

987
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,993
- Ma'am, can we get spicy hagfish?
- Hagfish?

988
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:40,830
- Can we also get spicy chicken feet?
- Okay.

989
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:49,463
Kyung-hwa doesn't like hagfish.
She likes chicken feet.

990
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,841
She's been working with you for years.

991
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:54,135
How could you not know that yet?

992
01:06:54,218 --> 01:06:55,511
Seriously?

993
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,724
I… I'm sorry.

994
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,183
Please don't be angry at me.

995
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,436
It wasn't easy for me to come here.

996
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,356
You can't eat spicy food.

997
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,816
Order something that isn't spicy.

998
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:12,111
No, honey. You like spicy food. I'm okay.

999
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:18,075
Then order steamed eggs.
You'll ruin your stomach.

1000
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,619
Instead of steamed eggs,
can I take a crack at you?

1001
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,704
Crack you.

1002
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,916
Gosh, come on! I can't bear watching you.

1003
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,044
If you're going to make up so soon,
why did you get angry?

1004
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,795
Why do you even fight?

1005
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,757
I'm sick of this. It's so annoying.

1006
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,759
How many times do I have to see this?

1007
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:36,010
Hello, this is Na Gyu-rim.

1008
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,220
Right now?

1009
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,597
No, it's okay.

1010
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,557
I'll go and send it to you now.

1011
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:43,642
Isn't it better that I'm not here?

1012
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,061
Are you returning to the office?

1013
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,146
Mr. Oh will regret it
if he misses this chance.

1014
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,148
I should help him make up his mind.

1015
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:51,400
The company dinner is over.

1016
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:57,364
Gyu-rim is becoming
more and more like Ms. Kang.

1017
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:10,336
- Dad!
- Hey, who's this?

1018
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,505
Why are you out here?

1019
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,924
On our way back from grocery shopping,
I thought we'd find you here.

1020
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,301
Really? Ye-rim,
now that you're well again,

1021
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:20,846
it's great to be with the entire family.

1022
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,223
I'm so happy.

1023
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:29,897
I'm here!

1024
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,149
You got back early today.

1025
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,359
What is it?

1026
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:35,402
Why are you so startled?

1027
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:36,737
It's nothing.

1028
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,948
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

1029
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,658
- What is it?
- What?

1030
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:41,992
What is it?

1031
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:45,412
<i>GAVE BIRTH AT AN OLD AGE</i>
<i>HANDBOOK TO PREGNANCY</i>

1032
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:48,290
I heard there's a lot to prepare
when giving birth at a later age.

1033
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:52,294
I wanted to look it up before telling you.

1034
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:55,589
Honey.

1035
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:58,342
Sorry.

1036
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,678
I made the decision too late.

1037
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:01,846
Right?

1038
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:06,809
Let's

1039
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:08,561
try our best.

1040
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:10,187
Okay.

Eun-ho.

1044
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:33,711
Which side?

1045
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:35,671
I'm almost there.

1046

1047
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,842

1048
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:43,679
There you are!

1049
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,432
Yes.

1050
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,851
Hi, hi.
