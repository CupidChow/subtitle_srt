EPISODE 11

00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,996
<i>Ms. Kang, there are many articles</i>
<i>assuming that it's Peoplez.</i>

6
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,456

00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,458
IKONIC BIOTECHNOLOGY, FRAUD OF
20 BILLION WON… CEO VANISHED

8
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,880
<i>The CEO of a pharmaceutical company</i>
<i>called Ikonic Biotechnology vanished</i>

9
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:33,259
<i>after taking billions of won in investment</i>
<i>while pretending to go public.</i>

10
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,137
<i>A famous search firm "P" is</i>
<i>under investigation</i>

11
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:40,308
<i>as it was found to be involved</i>
<i>in the investment fraud.</i>

12
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,227
<i>The prosecutors say</i>

13
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,605
<i>the search firm was in charge of hiring</i>
<i>employees at Ikonic Biotechnology…</i>

14
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,940
Kang Ji-yun.

15
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,193
I said that you won't get
to enjoy it much longer.

16
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,863
<i>The investigation will be conducted</i>
<i>while considering the possibility</i>

17
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,865
<i>of Search Firm "P"</i>
<i>being involved in the fraud.</i>

18
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,896
Ms. Kang, is it true
that Peoplez was involved?

19
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,981
Were you aware of the fraud?

20
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,233
Did you recommend the candidates
while knowing?

21
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,110
What will happen to those
hired by the company?

22
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,987
Were you not aware at all?

23
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,698
Is it true that you had
a close relationship with the CEO?

24
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,159
Ms. Kang, how long
have you known Mr. Park?

25
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,202
Do you know the whereabouts
of CEO Park Young-min?

26
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,121
What would you say to the victims?

27
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,206
Were you involved
in recruiting the investors?

28
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,349
- Ms. Kang.
- Please answer us.

29
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,528
- One last question.
- Ms. Kang!

30
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,325
Are you CEO Kang Ji-yun?

31
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,455
We're here to investigate

32
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,873
the Ikonic Biotechnology case.

33
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,667
This is a search warrant.

34
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,585
SEARCH WARRANT

35
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,170
We ask for your cooperation.

36
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,305
We'll proceed with the search and seizure
in the office.

37
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,015
Let's get started.

38
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,642
You guys should go over there.

39
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,022
Still, how could you do this?

40
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,191
You can't go through
our things so recklessly.

41
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,026
What are you doing?

42
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,612
There's nothing in there!

43
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,544
Ms. Kang, could we talk for a minute?

44
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,641
Please wait out here.

45
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,070
Why are you closing the blinds?

46
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,989
Ms. Kang isn't a criminal!

47
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,243
What's going on?

48
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,536
What investment fraud?

49
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,745
Search and seizure for what?

50
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,760
CEO Park Young-min
of Ikonic Biotechnology

51
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,513
embezzled the investment funds
and vanished.

52
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:09,058
The estimated damage is
over 20 billion won.

53
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,602
Have you been working
with CEO Park Young-min until recently?

54
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,065
Yes, we were in charge
of hiring his employees.

55
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,609
You also have shares
in Ikonic Biotechnology.

56
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,029
You must have been quite close.

57
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,740
I received shares as a down payment.

58
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,075
Is that common between
a search firm and its clients?

59
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,160
It's not common.

60
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,955
Ikonic Biotechnology had a lot
of potential, so I made that decision.

61
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,749
It was planning to go public,

62
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,709
and preparing to grow in size.

63
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,378
That was all a lie.

64
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,756
Going public and signing the contracts
for their new drug.

65
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,216
They were fabricated lies
to commit investment fraud.

66
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,010
You really had no idea?

67
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,470
I'm sure that you verified them.

68
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,347
It's hard to believe that you didn't know.

69
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,392
Are you aware that many made investments
based on their trust in you?

70
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,227
Pardon me? What do you mean?

71
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,647
The mention of you and Peoplez often
came up when these investments were made.

72
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,733
Were you not aware of that?

73
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,361
You didn't turn a blind eye
for monetary gains?

74
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,365
Are you implying that I colluded with him?

75
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,201
That's what the investigation is for.

76
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,911
That is not true.

77
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,497
Other than the shares,
I didn't gain any profit.

78
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,831
Go ahead and trace my bank accounts.

79
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,834
Who would receive such money
in bank accounts that are traceable?

80
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,669
This is enough for now.

81
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,588
After reviewing the documents we seized,

82
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,215
I will contact you again.

83
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,467
See you soon at the police station.

84
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,618
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,286
It's all because of me.

86
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,918
Kyung-hwa, are you done verifying
the information on Ikonic Biotechnology?

87
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,212
Yes, as you can see in my report,

88
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,465
their financial statements look stable,
and their business report is flawless.

89
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,051
I checked that their new drug
has been patented.

90
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,177
Everything looks good.

91
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,972
The company seems trustworthy enough
to recommend to our candidates.

92
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:15,101
I sent a request
to a global pharmaceutical company

93
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,645
that signed a contract
with Ikonic's technology.

94
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,772
But I didn't get a response.

95
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,651
All of their documents
seemed to be in order.

96
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:28,239
There were so many articles
on the export of their technology.

97
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,783
So I didn't think
there would be a problem.

98
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,618
I… I'm sorry.

99
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,330
I didn't expect things to get this bad.

100
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,584
You said all their documents seemed fine.

101
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,170
How else could you have known
it was a scam?

102
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,590
It's okay. Stop blaming yourself and go.

103
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,550
Okay.

104
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,763
How could they…

105
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,766
That's why they paid us in shares instead.

106
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,519
They were planning to disappear
after they became worthless.

107
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,022
They used us to hire decent folk
to look legit,

108
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,192
then scammed the investors
out of their money.

109
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,818
Killed two birds with one stone.

110
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:10,281
They could've run this scam on their own.
Why involve us in the first place?

111
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,826
Is someone praying
for Peoplez to go under?

112
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,497
Darn it.

113
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,550
Everything is fine, so come here and sit.

114
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,846
Once you leave the country,
after hiding here quietly,

115
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,557
your life will completely change.

116
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,892
Have all routes been secured?

117
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,101
Of course.

118
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,064
In ten days, the two of us will
completely vanish from Korea.

119
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,233
Don't worry. This isn't my first time.

120
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,905
All right.

121
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,156
Congratulations.

122
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,993
You finally got your wish granted.

123
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,954
Are you happy to see Peoplez go under?

124
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,580
That goes without saying.

125
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,832
How do you feel about stealing
from our investors?

126
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,084
I'm ecstatic!

127
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,046
Are we really going to be okay?

128
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,256
Of course.

129
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,174
Our money has been sent abroad safely.

130
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,884
Our escape route is secured.

131
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,219
What could possibly go wrong?

132
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,639
Mr. Park, what did I say
when I first met you?

133
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,976
You worked hard for a new drug
that would never sell.

134
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,436
Why not turn your life around instantly?

135
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,106
You played your role well,
and now you're so close

136
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,857
to turning your life around.

137
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,818
So enjoy it.

138
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,279
All the work has been done.

139
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,368
Let me ask you one thing.

140
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,453
Why did you do that to Peoplez?

141
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,668
The CEO at Peoplez annoys me.

142
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,129
Mr. Park.

143
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,132
People are all the same.

144
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,217
Looking sophisticated
doesn't make you any better.

145
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,638
We're all on the same boat,
so stop pretending to have a conscience.

146
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,391
The one who accepted our offer

147
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,767
was you.

148
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,276
No, thank you.

149
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,033
That doesn't make him
any different from us.

150
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,034
Will it be okay?

151
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,120
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him
and we'll disappear together.

152
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,336
Are the reporters still out there?

153
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,546
Yes, they might wait outside all day long.

154
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,008
How much are they trying to get from us?

155
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,220
There's an article
about the search and seizure

156
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,555
in our office.

157
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,557
What?

158
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,811
"SEARCH FIRM P, INVOLVED IN
20 BILLION WON INVESTMENT FRAUD"

159
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:50,191
Anyone would recognize that it's us.

160
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,568
Goodness.

161
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,071
Ji-yun.

162
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,615
Articles are getting published.

163
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,334
DIRECTOR HWANG MIN-SIK FROM NEXT

164
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,253
Hello, Mr. Hwang.

165
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,215
Pardon?

166
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,384
Cancel the contract?

167
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,095
But…

168
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,735
REQUEST TO CANCEL THE CONTRACT

169
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,070
REQUEST TO CANCEL THE CONTRACT

170
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,530
CANCELING THE CONTRACT
DUE TO BREACH OF CONTRACT

171
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,619
Hello?

172
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,127
Hello? Yes, sir.

173
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,087
The search and seizure?

174
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,630
We're under investigation.

175
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,549
No, that's not it.

176
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,509
We're the victims.
It's a misunderstanding…

177
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,470
You can't breach the contract
unilaterally.

178
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,557
You'd like to stop the hiring process?
But you should wait…

179
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,268
Of course.
There's no problem with the work.

180
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,937
Sir, you can count on me. Sir?

181
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,991
Should I send

182
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,579
the employees home?

183
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,665
Please tell them

184
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,168
to gather around.

185
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,594
First of all, I'd like to apologize
for this scandalous incident.

186
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,555
One thing I can clearly say is

187
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,766
that I didn't do anything humiliating
as CEO of Peoplez.

188
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,980
The truth will be revealed
after the investigation.

189
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,524
We will overcome this crisis.

190
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,443
I promise you.

191
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,863
For now, it will be difficult
to continue working as usual.

192
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,032
Until the investigation results come out,

193
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,700
you'll be working from home.

194
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,911
Until further notice,

195
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,497
please wait while working from home.

196
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,775
Was it you, Father?

197
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,486
How can I understand without context?

198
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,112
Is it you who did this?

199
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,410
You think I have nothing better to do?

200
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,746
That search firm is nothing to me.

201
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,293
It's fine if it wasn't you.

202
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,007
I'm keeping my eye on it.

203
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,469
If things start to go south,
I'll need to make a decision.

204
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,264
Leave Peoplez within a month,
and come work for me.

205
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,350
No.

206
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,019
I don't plan to do what you want.

207
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,480
I will never work for you.

208
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,232
Give it up.

209
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,868
If he doesn't plan to do what I want,

210
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,162
he won't be worth investing in.

211
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,514
CREDIT CARD NOTICE
YOUR CARD HAS BEEN CANCELED

212
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,895
SECRETARY WANG

213
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,105
<i>The door lock to your house</i>
<i>has been changed.</i>

214
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,107
<i>If you'd like to know the new passcode,</i>

215
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,942
<i>please contact the chairman.</i>

216
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,861
Did I get kicked out of my own house?

217
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,158
My old man is relentless.

218
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,328
Fine.

219
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,829
Bring it on.

220
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,660
Everyone's gone home.

221
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,453
We should go too.

222
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,595
Ji-yun.

223
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,014
Eun-ho.

224
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,605
I'm so afraid…

225
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,817
that this will be the end.

226
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,363
It's not the end.

227
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,867
You're not alone.

228
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,721
I'm okay, you can go now.

229
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,141
I'll leave after you've fallen asleep.

230
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,602
Really, I'm fine.

231
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,103
But I'm not.

232
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,522
I'll stay until you fall asleep.

233
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,983
Don't think about it and go to sleep.

234
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,093
Isn't this Kang Ji-yun's house?

235
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,179
Ms. Kang, I know everything, so come out!

236
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,722
Come out, Kang Ji-yun!

237
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,563
What's the problem?

238
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,650
We invested in Ikonic Biotechnology
and lost our money.

239
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,443
If Ms. Kang is inside, I want to see her.

240
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,528
According to the news,

241
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,030
Kang Ji-yun was involved in the fraud.

242
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,573
Stop hiding and come out!

243
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,242
Come out, Kang Ji-yun!

244
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,077
It's not true.

245
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,703
Stop the commotion and leave.

246
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,330
Isn't Ms. Kang inside?

247
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,958
Don't send someone else like a coward.
Come out yourself!

248
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,043
You were all in it together!

249
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,586
How much money did you steal?

250
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,587
Ms. Kang!

251
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,713
Move out of the way.

252
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,590
If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

253
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,925
Call the police.

254
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,927
You think they'll listen to you?

255
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,346
You want me to cause a real ruckus?

256
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,931
Get out of the way.

257
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,982
You'd better leave.

258
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,237
We'll be leaving today,

259
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,281
but we know where she works and lives.

260
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,950
Tell her not to even think
about running away.

261
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,952
Let's go.

262
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,829
Ms. Kang, did you hear me?

263
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,331
We'll be back, all right?

264
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,067
Let's go to my house.

265
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,913
Byeol, something came up
at Ms. Kang's office.

266
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,457
She'll have to stay with us tonight.

267
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,375
- Are you--
<i>- Great, I'd love that.</i>

268
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,794
<i>Bring her home soon.</i>

269
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,305
My amazing sis is coming
to my house today.

270
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,891
Really? But why is she coming?

271
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:29,061
I don't know.
Something bad happened at her work.

272
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,147
Then shouldn't you be happy?

273
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,107
Should I?

274
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,901
Maybe I made a mistake.

275
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,616
Jung Seo-jun, can I borrow
your colored pencils?

276
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,918
Slowly.

277
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,309
Sis, this is for you.

278
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,353
What's this?

279
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,363
SIS, STAY STRONG
SUPERPOWER VITAMIN

280
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,951
I give this to my dad
when he's having a hard time.

281
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,953
It's very effective.

282
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,121
Right, Dad?

283
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,248
What? Of course.

284
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,418
It's the most effective
and durable medicine I know.

285
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,337
Thank you, Byeol.

286
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,673
Thanks to you, I'll feel better.

287
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,266
You're sleeping here tonight, right?

288
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,977
Yes, I owe you one.

289
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,437
Thank you for understanding, Byeol.

290
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,024
I have a lot to thank you for today.

291
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,484
Then where will you sleep tonight?

292
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,486
What? Well…

293
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,280
I mean,

294
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,033
where should you…

295
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,410
Sis, sleep in my bed.

296
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,329
Dad, I want her to sleep in my bed
with me tonight.

297
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,583
Of course, you should.

298
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,461
Sounds good.

299
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,598
Byeol, aren't you uncomfortable?

300
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,558
How about you?

301
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,934
Isn't it too small?

302
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,103
No, I'm very comfortable.

303
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,149
What's wrong?

304
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,692
You can't fall asleep?

305
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,569
No.

306
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,321
When you have many thoughts,

307
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,114
you can't fall asleep easily.

308
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,575
So you have to clear your mind
to fall asleep.

309
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,120
How can we clear our mind?

310
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,498
- You don't know?
- Do you?

311
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,333
I don't know, either.

312
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,169
I thought that adults knew.

313
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,464
There are many things that
adults don't know.

314
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,426
Shall I sing you a song?

315
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,512
I'm a good singer.

316
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,098
Okay, sing for me.

317
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:16,812
<i>Sleep well, my baby</i>

318
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:22,526
<i>In the front yard and the hill in the back</i>

319
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:28,240
<i>The birds and baby sheep</i>

320
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:34,037
<i>Everyone is sleeping</i>

321
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:39,626
<i>Through the window, the moon</i>

322
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:45,382
<i>Sends silver and gold beads</i>

323
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:50,595
<i>This night</i>

324
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:56,852
<i>Sleep well, my baby</i>

325
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,607
<i>Sleep well</i>

326
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,576
- Are you sleeping?
- Shh.

327
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,994
She's sleeping.

328
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,537
Okay.

329
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,955
Go to sleep, Byeol.

330
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,795
That's a relief.

331
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,022
She has small hands, too.

332
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,066
Dad has huge hands.

333
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,488
She smells good.

334
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,606
Why did you get up already? It's early.

335
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,735
No reason. I just got up.

336
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,246
Is it too big?

337
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,629
Sis.

338
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,506
Don't cut it so ugly like that.

339
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,884
It says that the cucumber slices should be
small and round.

340
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,137
It all tastes the same,
once you bite into it.

341
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,432
Besides, you didn't make
the sauce right either.

342
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,434
That's not true. I got it right.

343
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,019
Six spoons of mayonnaise.

344
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,104
Two spoons of sugar.

345
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,064
And pepper powder.

346
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,984
Byeol, you already added that.

347
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,110
Oh, no.

348
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,031
It's okay. We can add
twice as much of everything.

349
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,240
Add more ketchup.

350
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,450
Wait, you two.

351
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,745
Why don't I just do it?

352
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,455
Gosh, we're doing it.

353
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,873
Dad, just watch us.

354
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,708
We need to add more mayonnaise.

355
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,586
You added more sugar and pepper powder.

356
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,964
What's wrong? Did it burn?

357
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,436
We can toast it again, right?

358
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,480
That's done. What's next?

359
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,062
It looks delicious.

360
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,898
I knew it. Cooking should be done
by someone with experience.

361
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,363
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

362
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,240
It looks delicious.

363
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,917
I'll take Byeol to kindergarten.

364
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,586
Have a good day at school.

365
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,088
I'll be back, Sis.

366
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,215
See you later. Don't leave, okay?

367
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,343
Okay, see you later.

368
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,137
Let's go.

369
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,763
Make yourself at home.

370
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:38,443
Kyung-hwa, now that we're here,
let's be courageous.

371
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,529
We can pretend like we're on a date.

372
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,698
Why don't they just make it official?

373
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,827
We're already here.
We can go in holding hands.

374
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,414
Let's go in. Good luck.

375
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,707
DODAM BOOKSTORE

376
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,250
Why are we here?

377
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,880
This is infuriating.

378
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,383
Please have some of this too.

379
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,261
Keep it up.

380
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,679
- Thank you.
- You can do it.

381
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,764
We can do it.

382
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,808
Gosh, this is…

383
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,817
Hello.

384
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,403
What? Is this everyone?

385
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,988
- What about the others?
- Well,

386
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,282
everyone is figuring out what to do
on their own.

387
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,744
When it comes to loyalty,

388
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,913
Team One is the best.

389
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,165
Everyone, thank you for coming.

390
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,250
Don't thank us.

391
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,252
We can't just sit back and watch.

392
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,879
What can we do to help?

393
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,549
There's something fishy about it
that I just can't shake.

394
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,093
- It stinks.
- I agree.

395
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,846
Why did they get a search firm
involved in an investment fraud?

396
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,015
If it was only about
scamming the investors,

397
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,017
they could've hired anyone at all.

398
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,019
They fabricated everything else,

399
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,105
why bother to hire people for real?

400
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:02,777
Was it to show that Peoplez was
somehow related to Ikonic Biotechnology?

401
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,447
In other words, they wanted us
to seem suspicious alongside them.

402
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,284
Could someone have
intentionally set a trap

403
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,829
to get Peoplez involved in the scam?

404
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,163
Who could it be and why?

405
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,750
That's what we're about to figure out.

406
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:23,131
Yes. Who is trying to
screw with us, and why?

407
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,053
What we have so far is
information on CEO Park Young-min.

408
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,763
Let's investigate the people around him.

409
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,973
We'll be able to find something.

410
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,184
Let's also look for people
with a grudge against Peoplez…

411
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,229
or anyone suspicious at work.

412
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,189
Go Jeong-nam?

413
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,942
No, it was about NEXT…

414
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,154
Career Way could be behind this.

415
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,989
Let's keep that open as a possibility.

416
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,867
I will meet with Go Jeong-nam.

417
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,120
There's been an exchange between us.

418
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:57,415
It'll be a chance to see him
and put an end to it.

419
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,710
Let's not let them get away with it.

420
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,546
It'd be unfair to let them
harass us like this.

421
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,174
- Split up!
- Okay.

422
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,176
- Right now?
- Yes.

423
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,427
- Are we starting now?
- Yes.

424
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,304
Right now and right here.

425
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,644
- Ms. Seo.
- Yes?

426
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,022
- Another article was published.
- What?

427
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,235
TRUTH BEHIND
THE INCIDENT 5 YEARS AGO

428
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,654
What's this about?

429
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,199
FALL OF THE FANCY CEO

430
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,575
20 BILLION INVESTMENT FRAUD,
FORESEEN FIVE YEARS AGO?

431
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,993
What… What's this?

432
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,495
My hands are trembling again.

433
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,330
Darn it.

434
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,961
Ji-yun?

435
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,755
Ji-yun?

436
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,216
Ji-yun.

437
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,723
Ji-yun?

438
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,358
Ji-yun, where are you?

439
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,694
I'm here to meet CEO Kim Hye-jin.

440
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,487
I'll call you after my meeting.

441
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:10,989
Okay.

442
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,247
Please, drink.
I'm sure you can't eat much these days.

443
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,376
You haven't changed.
You're still good at harassing people.

444
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,295
It doesn't seem like a coincidence

445
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,631
that the incident from five years ago
is repeating itself.

446
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,634
Exactly. You should've behaved better.

447
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,636
It comes back as bad karma.

448
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,141
How does it feel to personally experience
the likes of that incident now?

449
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,520
Why are you doing this to me?

450
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,064
Because I hate you.

451
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,442
I don't like you showing off either.

452
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,318
You think you're better than me.

453
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,362
It's annoying how you pretend
to be righteous.

454
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,782
Your record isn't that clean, either.

455
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,704
Are you that scared?

456
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:04,751
The employee who was saved by the
death of CEO Lee Yong-hoon five years ago.

457
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,462
Is it because I know that it was you?

458
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,839
What?

459
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,550
Do you think I would make you pay for it?

460
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,847
This is why I hate you.

461
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,432
You're pressed for time.

462
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,017
Your company is about to go under.

463
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,061
I want you to beg.

464
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,104
Or use that leverage of yours
to threaten me.

465
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,399
You can't do it
because it hurts your pride?

466
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,569
Why? Because you and I are so different?

467
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,242
Ji-yun, don't flatter yourself.

468
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,953
You and I are both in the same business.

469
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,665
We put a price on people's value
to get higher commissions.

470
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,042
That's what we do.

471
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,462
Do you think it's fine for you,
but dirty business when I do it?

472
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,757
You don't treat your employees
like people.

473
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,718
Don't be conceited
just because people recognize you.

474
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,470
Once Peoplez goes under,

475
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,430
will anyone stay by your side?

476
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,724
As you know,

477
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,311
you and I are the same.

478
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,630
<i>Once Peoplez goes under,</i>

479
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,841
<i>will anyone stay by your side?</i>

480
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,973
Hey, bro.

481
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,184
There was something I wanted to ask.

482
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:49,897
I'm looking for Park Young-min
among your alumni.

483
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,275
Starting class of 2004.
Yes, a chemistry major.

484
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,486
Do you know anyone who might know him?

485
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,239
Yes, send me a text message. Thank you.

486
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,868
Hello, this is Oh Kyung-hwa from Peoplez.

487
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:07,165
You've been working in pharmaceuticals
for a long time.

488
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:11,377
Are you in contact with anyone
at Ikonic Biotechnology?

489
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,421
The first few employees work, too.

490
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,132
Us? Yes, we're fine.

491
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,302
It's all a misunderstanding.

492
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,388
It'll be resolved
once the investigation concludes.

493
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,473
Bye.

494
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,978
Are you going somewhere?

495
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,939
I got in touch with a researcher
who worked at Ikonic until last year.

496
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:32,982
I'll be back.

497
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,233
Good luck!

498
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,820
By the way, where's Mr. Kim?

499
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,572
When will this be over?

500
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,990
- Goodness.
- You're right.

501
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,878
Go Jeong-nam!

502
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,423
You have nothing to say to me?

503
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,925
How could you?

504
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,718
How could you use me like that?

505
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,386
You're one to talk.

506
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,181
You gave me bad information,

507
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,516
and now I'm unemployed.

508
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,354
I'm not

509
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,648
sorry about that at all!

510
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,816
We need to talk, so follow me.

511
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,109
I have nothing to say.

512
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,491
Well, I do.

513
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,410
Jeez. Let go of me first.

514
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,544
Hello, Eun-ho.

515
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,256
Where are you? I'm at the bookstore.

516
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,133
- Eun-ho.
- Ji-yun.

517
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,981
I found Go Jeong-nam.

518
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,109
Why is Ms. Kang here?

519
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,235
Hello, Ji-yun.

520
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,575
What are you all doing here?

521
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,713
So you got together to investigate?

522
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,172
Yes.

523
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,758
You told us not to worry
and work from home,

524
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,510
but we couldn't just sit back.

525
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,304
Why not?

526
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,388
Well, it's our company too.

527
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,098
- That's right.
- Right.

528
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,558
Yes.

529
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,353
Ms. Kang, brace yourself.

530
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,189
I found out something unbelievable.

531
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,651
There's someone behind this incident.

532
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,570
Do you know who it is?

533
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,698
It's CEO Kim Hye-jin at Career Way.

534
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,950
Dang! I knew it.

535
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:48,993
You must be shocked.

536
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,370
I was very shocked and angry.

537
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,789
I got the hint when I met Go Jeong-nam.

538
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,790
Even before the incident,

539
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:58,753
it appears Park Young-min
had been frequenting Career Way.

540
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,755
I even got my hands
on surveillance footage.

541
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,924
- You know how hard that is, right?
- Oh, extremely difficult.

542
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,135
We're also looking into his acquaintances.

543
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,762
According to his coworkers,

544
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,889
his personality had changed drastically.

545
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,893
He'd been a hard worker
until the new drug got patented.

546
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,728
At some point,
investments stopped coming in.

547
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,480
He couldn't pay his employees.

548
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,899
He became irritable and stingy.

549
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,692
Considering the circumstances,
he must've been

550
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,278
persuaded to commit investment fraud
due to financial difficulties.

551
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,655
I'm still looking into Park Young-min.

552
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,408
We'll probably find
more significant information.

553
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,495
I'm investigating
to help you clear your name.

554
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,080
Please don't worry.

555
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,456
Peoplez?

556
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,291
We will protect it.

557
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,058
Thank you.

558
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,607
Are you thanking us?

559
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,526
There's no need.

560
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,738
Getting information is part of our job.

561
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,367
As long as we take the initiative,
we can do anything, right?

562
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,286
Ms. Kang, will you join us
in the investigation tomorrow?

563
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,789
You'd complete this group of Avengers.

564
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,666
- Hey, Kwang-hee.
- No?

565
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,043
We need to figure it out
on our own without Ms. Kang.

566
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,795
You were doing so well, but now…

567
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,756
We could become like the Avengers.

568
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,174
Ms. Kang.

569
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,761
I'm sorry.

570
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,597
What are you sorry about?

571
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,974
I made the final decision.

572
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,184
I'm the one who's responsible.

573
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,396
Kyung-hwa, you did the best you could.

574
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,566
It's okay,
so don't worry about it anymore.

575
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,404
Ms. Kang!

576
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,822
Excuse us. Kyung-hwa, Kyung-hwa.

577
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:50,948
Give her a tissue.

578
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,033
Kyung-hwa, here's a tissue.

579
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,119
Kyung-hwa, stop crying.

580
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,662
You still have your eye boogers.

581
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:57,997
Stop crying. That's enough.

582
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,039
Stop crying.

583
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,207
Stop crying.

584
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,250
Kyung-hwa, stop crying.

585
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,549
It's okay. Keep going.

586
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,342
Everyone knows anyway.

587
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,136
- Everyone knows?
- Yes.

588
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,429
Who wouldn't?

589
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,561
Kwang-hee!

590
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,523
We're dating.

591
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,776
Please stop crying.

592
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,736
Stop.

593
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,070
Dad!

594
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,489
My goodness.

595
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,449
Say hello to my coworkers.

596
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,868
- Hello.
- Hi.

597
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,578
Oh, Sis.

598
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,872
Will you sleep at our house tonight, too?

599
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,458
What?

600
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,177
- Are you two already…
- What?

601
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,137
…living together?

602
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,973
- No, that's not it.
- Goodness.

603
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,016
Let's go.

604
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,309
- Let's go.
- Where are you going?

605
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,061
Hurry and go home.

606
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,354
What about tomorrow?

607
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,105
We should meet here again tomorrow.

608
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,483
Isn't it nice to have people over?

609
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,609
Right, Kang-seok?

610
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,319
Yes, of course.

611
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:12,238
Anyone from Peoplez is welcome here.

612
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,698
If we're getting together,
can't we meet at the office?

613
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,618
Come on. We're supposed
to be working from home.

614
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,536
Let's meet here tomorrow.

615
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,495
See you tomorrow.

616
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,080
- But I…
- Goodbye.

617
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,207
- See you.
- See you tomorrow.

618
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,500
See you here tomorrow.

619
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,709
I can't think straight.

620
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,921
It's not true.

621
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:29,922
Why are you… No.

622
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,299
- It's not true. It's not!
- What's not true?

623
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,425
- It's not true.
- What is?

624
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,553
Dad and Sis, let's go home.

625
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,554
- Okay.
- Yes.

626
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,888
What?

627
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:38,973
Let's go, Byeol.

628
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,516
- Let's hurry home.
- What?

629
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,976
It's not true.

630
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,269
- It's not true.
- I guess it's not.

631
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,316
They're not saying the truth.

632
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,871
Hmm, this is the taste.

633
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,168
Sis, will you sleep at our place
for ten nights?

634
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,463
We can draw,

635
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,049
paint our nails, and play board games.

636
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,384
We should watch movies too.

637
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:18,012
We can also play with dolls.

638
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,556
Byeol, why don't we talk about it
after we eat?

639
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,517
Byeol, I'm not going anywhere.

640
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,643
Okay.

641
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,647
Both you and Dad.

642
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,399
Why aren't you at work?

643
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,404
Are you out of business?

644
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:39,867
Byeol, that's not it--

645
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,993
Byeol.

646
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,164
Do I look like someone
who would let my company go under?

647
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,749
- No.
- Correct.

648
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,085
Things are a little difficult now,

649
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,378
but I think I found a solution.

650
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,548
I thought that I was alone,
but I have so many on my side.

651
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,051
The one with more on her side wins.
You know that, right?

652
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,053
Yes, I'm on your side, too.

653
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,721
Sis, eat up.

654
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,306
You have to save your company.

655
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,516
Yes, I'll eat a lot and stay strong.

656
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,031
- Bye.
- Bye. Get home safe.

657
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,120
- Director.
- Oh, hello.

658
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,997
Seo-jun and Byeol will be out soon.

659
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,249
- Please wait.
- Okay.

660
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,002
Woo Jeong-hoon. What's up?

661
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,546
I'm busy sending children home.

662
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,964
Get to the point.

663
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,008
In my office?

664
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,427
Why would you sleep in my office
all of a sudden?

665
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,845
What about your apartment?

666
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,181
So you really got kicked out?

667
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,562
- Mom!
- Auntie!

668
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,648
My sweethearts, let's go.

669
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:57,277
Let's go. What should we eat?

670
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,655
Goodness, it collapsed.

671
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,991
Start from the beginning.

672
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,910
We have to start again.

673
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:10,582
What did he do wrong
to get kicked out of the house?

674
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,293
Things aren't going so well
at his company either.

675
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,341
Does he even have a place to sleep?

676
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,012
What is it? Are you having a hard time
with the drawing?

677
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,931
Isn't your deadline next week?

678
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,516
Oh,

679
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,351
it's not what you think.

680
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,477
The work is going well.

681
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,688
It's not what I think?

682
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,399
You've been mumbling to yourself
all evening.

683
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:39,445
Why don't you get some fresh air instead?

684
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:43,240
I heard that writers do that
when they're having writer's block.

685
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,868
Want to step out for a minute?

686
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,079
Should I?

687
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,185
Ms. Jung!

688
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,438
Gosh, Jeong-hoon!

689
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,773
What are you doing here?

690
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,484
All the children went home.

691
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,197
The water bottle.

692
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,574
Seo-jun left his water bottle again.

693
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,827
By the way, what about you?

694
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,579
Oh, me?

695
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,914
I'm just…

696
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,501
Seong-kyung.

697
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:36,960
I came to see her.

698
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,046
- The director?
- Yes.

699
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,968
Do you want to come in
to get the water bottle?

700
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,304
- Can I?
- I'll open it for you.

701
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,430
Where could it be?

702
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,642
I'm glad that I came here today.

703
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,602
I got to see you too.

704
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,272
Aren't you happy
to bump into each other like this?

705
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,861
By the way, is everything okay?

706
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,155
What do you mean?

707
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,157
I mean, your work these days…

708
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:12,663
Yes, it's okay.

709
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:17,334
Ms. Kang isn't a pushover.

710
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,586
She'll find a solution.

711
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,966
You don't have to worry
about Mr. Yu either.

712
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,301
I mean, you.

713
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,055
Are you okay?

714
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,559
What?

715
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,686
Are you worried about me?

716
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,856
I'm going to feel touched.

717
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,236
Me?

718
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,907
I'm doing a task with my father
that we've postponed until now.

719
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,953
It's time to come to a conclusion.

720
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,706
I don't want to live like my brother.

721
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,709
I'm not guaranteed to win,

722
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,128
but I should endure it
as long as possible.

723
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,798
I can't be running away all my life.

724
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,597
Didn't I sound amazing?

725
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,348
Be honest. Wasn't I amazing?

726
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,391
You agree?

727
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,685
A little.

728
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,230
To be amazing, I shouldn't ask. Right?

729
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,153
Mr. Yu doesn't say things like this,

730
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,530
does he?

731
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,873
Since you're my comrade

732
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:41,168
for unrequited love,
I'll share two secrets with you.

733
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,090
My unrequited love is over now.

734
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,967
I don't have feelings for him anymore.

735
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,011
Also,

736
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,598
I didn't come here for the water bottle.

737
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,392
Then why…

738
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,357
You should go in.
The director must be waiting.

739
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,860
There are mats for children,
so use them for sleeping.

740
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:09,279
Best of luck with the task.

741
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,241
Wait.

742
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,086
What? Does that mean

743
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,046
she came here

744
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,675
knowing that I was sleeping here?

745
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,385
She came here

746
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,929
to see me?

747
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,440
She should've told me the truth.

748
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,900
Why the water bottle?

749
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,113
I won't be sleeping tonight.

750
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,461
Chairman Woo is in your office.

751
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,398
Ms. Kang.

752
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,942
Hello, sir.

753
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:30,777
Your company is in a terrible situation.

754
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,195
What's going on?

755
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,073
The result of the investigation
will prove my innocence.

756
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,868
Then we'll be back on track.

757
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,161
I'll make it happen.

758
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,288
You don't run a business with facts.

759
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,998
It's done with credibility.

760
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,833
Once credibility is lost,

761
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,543
it doesn't recover fast.

762
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,297
Wasn't it you who told me

763
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,717
that if a headhunting firm
loses credibility and fairness,

764
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,678
it'd be no longer valuable
as a search firm?

765
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,307
No one wants to know the truth.

766
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,976
You shouldn't have let
the situation get this bad

767
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,687
as a CEO who's responsible
for the company.

768
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,403
Ms. Kang.

769
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,364
Take responsibility for the situation
and step down.

770
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,327
- Mr. Woo…
- If you refuse to leave,

771
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,788
I'll summon the board of directors
and propose your dismissal.

772
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,456
I refuse.

773
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:28,418
I've been managing Peoplez,
and it's my company.

774
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,545
I can't leave like this.

775
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:31,713
If you leave,

776
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,090
I'll promise to keep the employees.

777
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,093
A company wants to take over Peoplez.

778
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,638
Is that company

779
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,015
Career Way?

780
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,309
Under the condition that I leave?

781
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,106
I should also make up for my losses.

782
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,943
The market value of Peoplez
has been consistently high.

783
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:56,488
Instead of making your employees suffer
to keep your position,

784
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,407
leave after handing over
your shares and management rights.

785
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,117
Your employees need to survive.

786
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,539
Which decision is the best for Peoplez?

787
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,167
Think carefully.

788
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,307
That's it for the meeting.

789
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,312
I have an important announcement to make.

790
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,024
Peoplez.

791
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,486
We're going to acquire it.

792
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,493
Do you mean Peoplez that we know about?

793
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,786
Yes.

794
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,163
Soon, CEO Kang Ji-yun will be dismissed.

795
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,415
Once she's gone,

796
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,126
we'll go through a process
of taking over the company.

797
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,879
Ms. Kim, won't many shareholders
be opposed to it?

798
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,422
Even if we don't acquire it now,

799
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,675
the value of Peoplez will
hit the ground anyway.

800
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,969
No, we're going to take over it.

801
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,721
If the shareholders are against it,

802
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,764
tell them that I'll buy it
with my own money.

803
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:10,061
Peoplez will disappear completely
from this field.

804
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:14,232
Career Way will take over Peoplez.

805
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,607
Are you looking for this?

806
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,317
- There it is.
- Thank you.

807
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,861
Kwang-hee, take a look at this.

808
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,990
Before getting their new drug patented,

809
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,034
they wanted a joint development
with a pharmaceutical company.

810
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,620
There must be a reason why
they stopped the joint development.

811
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,747
They must know the internal situation
at Ikonic Biotechnology.

812
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,083
I'll find out right away.

813
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,139
We know a few people
at pharmaceutical companies.

814
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,516
Hello, Ji-yun.

815
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,019
The team and I are at the bookstore.

816
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,605
<i>I'll help Mr. Kim with the search.</i>

817
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,857
<i>I'll look up more articles from that time.</i>

818
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,526
<i>We might find some clue.</i>

819
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,403
<i>Kwang-hee will contact</i>
<i>the pharmaceutical company.</i>

820
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,697
<i>Yes, I left them a message.</i>

821
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,032
<i>Okay, then…</i>

822
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,243
Eun-ho.

823
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,123
Do you want to go to the sea?

824
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,103
Is it because of the nice background?

825
00:55:58,354 --> 00:55:59,939
It came out beautifully.

826
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,618
What were you thinking about?

827
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,371
I was thinking about you.

828
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:16,956
About me?

829
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,753
Ever since I met you,

830
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,880
so many things have changed.

831
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,424
I always thought

832
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:29,094
that I was responsible for everything.

833
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,555
Helping Peoplez grow

834
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,390
and protecting it.

835
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,392
I thought that I was alone in it.

836
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,938
After seeing the employees
at the bookstore,

837
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,315
I realized that I was wrong.

838
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,111
Thank you.

839
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:49,697
I wouldn't have known without you.

840
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,953
Ji-yun, you are not alone.

841
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,582
You never were and won't be going forth.

842
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,732
- It's beautiful.
- Yes.

843
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:37,162
Byeol, why didn't you go
to the sea with them?

844
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,163
You didn't want to go?

845
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,248
I promised to join them next time.

846
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:43,543
Today, Dad has a present for Ji-yun.

847
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:47,046
I wonder if it went well.

848
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,003
Eun-ho.

849
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,671
Just take it out.

850
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,175
Oh, I wanted to take it out secretly.

851
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,762
How could I not tell when it's so obvious?

852
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,263
What is it?

853
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:39,641
Hold on.

854
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,309
Here.

855
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,730
Ta-da.

856
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,441
Mint chocolate, your favorite.

857
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:52,487
Yes, I love it.

858
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,239
Thanks.

859
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,834
It's really beautiful.

860
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,044
Don't you think?

861
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,222
Which one do you like the most?

862
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:25,562
This one.

863
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,773
- Can we take a look?
- This one?

864
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:29,941
Yes.

865
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,115
What do you think?

866
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:38,283
It's pretty.

867
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,494
It'd look beautiful on her.

868
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,704
Really?

869
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,334
I'm glad that I can give it to you
at a nice place.

870
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,211
Luckily, I got it beforehand.

871
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,798
It's so pretty.

872
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,050
May I put it on you?

873
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,029
How does it look?

874
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,488
It's beautiful.

875
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,912
Thank you, Eun-ho.

876
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,834
Thanks to you, I became a better person.

877
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,714
Recommending people is what I do,

878
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,216
but I never took a look at myself.

879
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,472
I hated my life.

880
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,684
Ever since I met you,

881
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,854
I started to like myself.

882
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,325
Wherever you are,

883
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,245
I'll never let go of your hand.

884
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,402
Will you be okay?

885
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,570
I can sleep at my place now.

886
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,531
Please talk to Byeol for me.

887
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,409
Go inside.

888
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,743
Drive safely.

889
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,253
I'll go after you leave.

890
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,296
I'll contact you when I get home.

891
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:31,122
<i>Everyone at Peoplez.</i>

892
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:34,625
<i>Please come to the office</i>
<i>tomorrow at 10 a.m.</i>

893
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,059
- Wow.
- Seriously.

894
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:54,187
Gosh, this smell.

895
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,063
It's been a long time.

896
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,065
It's only been a week.

897
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,067
Actually, I missed coming here.

898
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,446
When I got a message from Ms. Kang
yesterday, my heart fluttered so much.

899
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,281
I never imagined coming to work
to be so exciting.

900
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,491
I know!

901
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,826
We get to work here again, right?

902
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,329
Ms. Kang, you're here early.

903
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:12,288
Good morning.

904
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:14,707
- Hello.
- Hello, Ms. Kang.

905
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,501
- Hello.
- It's been a long time.

906
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:18,586
- Hello.
- Hello.

907
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:19,921
Good morning.

908
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,300
- Hello, Ms. Kang.
- Good morning.

909
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:25,593
It's been a long time.

910
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,779
I have something to announce.

911
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,031
That's why I called you here today.

912
01:03:57,458 --> 01:03:58,835
Starting today,

913
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:03,798
I'll no longer be the CEO at Peoplez.

914
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,951
SIS, STAY STRONG
SUPERPOWER VITAMIN

915
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:59,562
<i>- It will be up to you to protect Peoplez.</i>
<i>- I believe in your decision.</i>

916
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,814
<i>Yu Eun-ho, you were my best secretary.</i>

917
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,358
<i>Kang Ji-yun. Watch carefully</i>

918
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,861
how fast Peoplez and your name disappear.

919
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:09,363
I pity you.
You're still lost in resentment.

920
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:12,116
<i>I no longer live with hatred.</i>

921
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:14,243
<i>It looks like being</i>
<i>unemployed suits you, Kang Ji-yun.</i>

922
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,244
Kang Ji-yun?

923
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,329
Ji-yun.

924
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,331
<i>What kind of relationship do we have?</i>

925
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,207
We're just people
who meet occasionally and say hello?

926
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,835
Instead, let's have
a different relationship.

927
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:25,755
<i>Whenever I'm with you, I become impulsive.</i>

928
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,798
<i>Usually, I get nervous without plans.</i>

929
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:29,133
<i>- Isn't it fun?</i>
<i>- I'm in a bind.</i>

930
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,344
<i>The ace at Hansu Electronics' HR.</i>
<i>You're coming, right?</i>

931
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,720
<i>You'll be returning, right?</i>

932
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:33,804
No, there's no place for you.

933
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:36,599
Yu Eun-ho, you're fired.

934
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:41,687
