00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,462
THE CHARACTERS, INSTITUTIONS,
COMPANIES, AND PLACES

2
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,964
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL

3
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,562
<i>What kind of person</i>

4
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,023
<i>is Yu Eun-ho to you?</i>

5
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,385
Can you help us find our seats?

6
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,891
EPISODE 7

7
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,522
Ms. Kang, Ju-hee is over there.

8
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,024
Get a grip on yourself.

9
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,182
Let's have dinner. I'll bring the car.

10
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,142
Is it far from here?

11
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,977
No, it's not that far.

12
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,687
Then let's walk there.

13
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,317
I sat down for too long.

14
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,736
The weather is nice too.

15
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,573
Sounds good. Let's go.

16
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:13,372
I'm doomed.

17
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,550
How did the Heonjo Group meeting
go with Mr. Woo?

18
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,053
It went well.

19
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,930
Is that all?

20
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,598
Yes.

21
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,392
Get the details from Mr. Woo
at work tomorrow.

22
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,064
Are you refusing to talk about work
after work hours?

23
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,232
That's correct.

24
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,028
When you get off work,

25
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,405
you should try your best
not to think about work.

26
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,533
Your brain needs some rest too.

27
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,035
It isn't easy to do.

28
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,080
Byeol says hello.

29
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,707
Oh, has her scar healed?

30
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,296
Byeol says that you're very amazing.

31
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,215
Just what exactly did you do?

32
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,262
Unlike someone,
Byeol has a good eye for people.

33
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,472
What do you mean?

34
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,771
I heard that you've been going
to the book store for a long time.

35
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,731
Even before Kang-seok was there.

36
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,191
Since when?

37
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,694
Since my first year of high school.

38
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,572
I went there for a reference book,
and I liked it.

39
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,992
To smell books after a long time
which felt familiar.

40
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,827
Since then, I went there every day.

41
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,204
I never had many friends.

42
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,125
Naturally, I became close to Mi-ae.

43
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,463
It was the only place where I could rest.

44
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,590
I'm trying to imagine it.

45
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:52,722
I bet you were a student
who wasn't easy to handle just like now.

46
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,854
What were you like, Mr. Yu?

47
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,149
Were you just as nosy when you were young?

48
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,485
No, I was extremely shy.

49
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,696
I was timid, didn't have friends,
and was easily scared.

50
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,866
That's hard to imagine.

51
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,370
As I grew up, I changed little by little.

52
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,372
In a positive way.

53
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,958
That's why

54
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,544
I like getting older.

55
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,047
It feels like I get stronger.

56
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,052
I get more scared as I grow older.

57
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,556
I feel like everything would end
at the slightest fall.

58
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,643
What's wrong with falling?
You can get back up.

59
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,731
I'll hold you.

60
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:49,904
Seriously.

61
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,865
I used to be in the rescue club.

62
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,327
What's that supposed to be?

63
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,537
I did climbing too.

64
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,914
I have a strong grip…

65
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,106
I'm sorry to bother you,

66
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,108
but could you take a photo of us?

67
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,988
- Sure.
- Thank you.

68
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,490
- One moment, please.
- Stand here.

69
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,659
- Thank you.
- Take a pretty photo of us.

70
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,660
I will.

71
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,287
- Here I go.
- Okay.

72
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,622
One, two, three.

73
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,374
- I'll take one more.
- Okay.

74
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,917
One, two, three.

75
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,627
Last one.

76
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,547
One, two, three.

77
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,631
This one came out well.

78
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,551
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

79
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,177
- No problem
- Thank you.

80
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,598
I'll take a photo of you.

81
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,516
No, it's okay.

82
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,059
I'm good at taking pictures.

83
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,478
You don't need to.

84
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:05,938
She says that she's good.

85
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,398
Would you take one for us?

86
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,696
Please go over there.

87
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,827
Shall we?

88
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,802
PHOTO

89
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,724
You have to get closer.

90
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,624
All right, smile.

91
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,334
One, two, three.

92
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,920
One more time.

93
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,422
Please smile.

94
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,674
One, two, three.

95
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,110
<i>I think she tricked us.</i>

96
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,260
PICTURE HAS BEEN SAVED

97
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,401
<i>I had fun today.</i>

98
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,610
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

99
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,451
<i>Again next time…</i>

100
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,630
<i>Me too. See you tomorrow.</i>

101
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,908
Did the composition change?

102
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,410
Yes, the concentration
was increased by two percent.

103
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,121
How is the moisturizing cream?

104
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,790
The water content has improved.

105
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,250
Last time,

106
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,920
all it did was drip.

107
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,512
It applies quite well.

108
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,764
The water content didn't make it heavier.

109
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,269
It gets absorbed quickly,

110
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,396
and it stays moist enough.

111
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,358
It's much better than the last sample.

112
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,695
The scent is nice too.

113
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,297
It's good.

114
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,882
- Of course.
- Right, I see.

115
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,014
PM Jeong Han-ah at Diane Cosmetics.

116
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,309
While the candidate strongly hoped
to change jobs,

117
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,396
a suitable position opened up,
so her application is in review.

118
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,147
Did you check the reason
for changing jobs?

119
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,941
When most people change jobs in a hurry--

120
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,234
Dating at work.

121
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,362
They broke up recently
after dating at work.

122
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,114
She's having a hard time working with him.

123
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,325
Did you confirm with the candidate?

124
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,871
After making a decision emotionally,
she might change her mind or regret it.

125
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,914
When you break up with your coworker,

126
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,084
the more competent one
should quit and change jobs.

127
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,502
It's the best for everyone.

128
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,588
I discussed it thoroughly
with the candidate.

129
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,340
Speaking from experience?

130
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,887
I won't make comments.

131
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,430
- You won't?
- No.

132
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,266
- If there's nothing else, let's wrap up.
- Yes, ma'am.

133
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,559
Meeting's over.

134
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,560
Meeting's over.

135
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,769
Experience?

136
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,271
- You won't comment?
- Meeting is over. Over.

137
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,566
What a small world.

138
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,611
Isn't Jeong Han-ah your senior?

139
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,406
When we transferred someone
from Diane Cosmetics last time,

140
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,284
she was our candidate's project manager.

141
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,535
Right.

142
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,704
Back then, she was determined
to work there all her life.

143
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,290
No one should ever date at work.

144
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,375
It never ends well.

145
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,002
- Right.
- I agree.

146
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,713
I'd like to do it at least once.

147
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,048
Dating in secret.

148
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,716
It's so romantic!

149
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,052
Kyung-hwa, you have no idea
how hard it is.

150
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:28,969
Listen carefully.

151
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,931
Dating at work is a disaster.

152
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,849
Stay vigilant and avoid it, okay?

153
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,434
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

154
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,811
- Promise me.
- Come on. At our company?

155
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,772
Such a thing would never,

156
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,899
never ever happen.

157
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,363
Why are the invoice dates all different?

158
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,823
Is work over
when the candidate gets hired?

159
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,368
Tell them to pay on time.

160
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,911
Should I do it?

161
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,872
Okay. I hear you.

162
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,958
I'll call the team members

163
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,419
and tell them to send out
the invoices on time.

164
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,256
What's wrong? Is something…

165
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,383
One moment, please.

166
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,343
- Hey,
- What?

167
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,555
- What is it?
- You just smiled.

168
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,601
When did I do that?
Don't change the subject.

169
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,604
What are you going to do about this?

170
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,151
I'll warn the team members about it again.

171
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,695
I'll get it out of your hair.

172
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,781
Didn't I just repeat myself?

173
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,158
- You didn't.
- I didn't?

174
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,410
Goodness.

175
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,412
Really?

176
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,332
Okay, let me write that down.

177
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,045
Oh, no.

178
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,505
I'm more tired this morning.

179
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,924
I need to wake up.

180
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,303
Hello.

181
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,305
- What is it?
- Mr. Yu is coming.

182
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,433
What do you mean?

183
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,518
Hello.

184
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,145
- How did you know? You saw him?
- Good morning.

185
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,813
- You're here early.
- How can I not know?

186
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,314
He makes so much noise.

187
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,109
How did you know?

188
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,902
- That's what I want to know.
- Thank you.

189
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,905
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

190
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,866
Good morning.

191
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,825
Hi.

192
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:15,784
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

193
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,415
I'm trying to reschedule your meeting
with Mr. Hwang.

194
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,333
I'll let you know as soon as it does.

195
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,461
Before you go out today,

196
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,921
you should have lunch near the office.

197
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,548
What would you like to eat?

198
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,674
How about you?

199
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,345
How about your favorite malatang
or the bakery nearby?

200
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,432
What do you like?

201
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,684
Me?

202
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,897
Spicy stir-fried pork in this weather.

203
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,483
You're pretty predictable.

204
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,443
Spicy stir-fried pork is perfect
for a day like this.

205
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,071
Let's get that for lunch then.

206
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,700
What is it?

207
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,077
Nothing.

208
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,178
Ji-yun, let's get lunch.

209
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,181
- With Mr. Yu today--
- Yes, I heard.

210
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,349
You're going for spicy stir-fried pork.

211
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,518
There's a good restaurant nearby.
Come out.

212
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,313
Hurry!

213
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,070
Ms. Seo, are you going to lunch?

214
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,114
Let's get <i>gukbap</i>.
I need to cure a hangover.

215
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,532
- Spicy stir-fried pork.
- Spicy stir-fried pork?

216
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,616
Are you coming too?

217
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,700
Yes, I need to eat.

218
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,120
Everyone, let's go and eat.

219
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,164
- Who wants spicy stir-fried pork?
- Me!

220
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,541
- Okay, Kyung-hwa.
- Spicy stir-fried pork sounds good.

221
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,876
- Good choice. Korean pork at its finest.
- Ms. Kang--

222
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,962
Let's go and eat, Mr. Yu.

223
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,130
Where we going?

224
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,548
Let's go eat.

225
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,091
- Ms. Kang--
- She's coming.

226
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,055
Wait.

227
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,724
You don't like spicy stir-fried pork.

228
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,101
Want something else with me?

229
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,396
Spicy stir-fried pork is perfect
for today.

230
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,151
What day is today?

231
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,528
I don't want spicy stir-fried pork.

232
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,322
So no one wants <i>gukbap</i>?

233
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,952
You can't stop having feelings
for someone.

234
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,705
I never wanted to date at work,

235
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,499
but I couldn't stop thinking about him.

236
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,168
I found myself next to him,

237
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,503
curious about what he likes…

238
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,006
When I came to my senses,

239
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,841
I was already dating at work.

240
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,801
You also broke up?

241
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,262
Yes, I just need to change jobs now.

242
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,308
You didn't tell him about it, did you?

243
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,311
Jin-guk can't find out about it.

244
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,521
Do you think that I'm that tactless?

245
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,192
Keeping the candidate's transfer
confidential is a given.

246
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,862
Gyu-rim, I don't need anything else.

247
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,614
Number one, changing jobs quickly.

248
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,073
Number two, changing jobs quickly.

249
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,367
Your conditions should be met.

250
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,870
Should a breakup dictate your career?
No way.

251
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,291
Is it that bad?

252
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,001
Weren't you dating in secret?

253
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,794
Who would know about your breakup?

254
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,929
Thank you.

255
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,807
Ms. Jeong, come this way.

256
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,892
Over here.

257
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,229
- Right here.
- Oh, please…

258
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,605
Why would you call her?

259
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,982
We can't leave a team member to eat alone.

260
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,989
Is that okay, Ms. Jeong?

261
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,200
What do you mean?

262
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,494
Enjoy your food. Thank you.

263
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,536
Enjoy.

264
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,038
Go ahead. Let's eat.

265
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,289
This is good.

266
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,546
Please excuse me. I'm done.

267
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,673
Enjoy your meal.

268
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,800
Yeah, okay. See you.

269
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,849
Mr. Kim Jin-guk.

270
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,977
Do you have to make it so obvious?

271
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,565
Can you eat like everything is fine?

272
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,859
Speak appropriately.

273
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,404
Or everyone will find out
that we broke up.

274
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,530
Ms. Jeong Han-ah.

275
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,448
Everyone who's aware already knows.

276
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,284
Did you tell them?

277
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,541
- Did you blab?
- Everyone already knew.

278
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,294
If you hadn't cried during our meeting--

279
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,336
We broke up anyway.

280
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,881
It doesn't matter now.

281
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,930
If anyone asks,

282
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,266
I'll deny it, okay?

283
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,809
Wait.

284
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,687
I'll go first.

285
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,231
Wait five minutes.

286
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,371
Hey, Han-ah.

287
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,165
Can I have a minute with you?

288
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,126
Nothing to look at. Go back to work.

289
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,755
Han-ah, you must be very tired.

290
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,089
No, I'm fine.

291
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,344
You have to work with Mr. Kim Jin-guk
in the next project.

292
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,055
Is that all right?

293
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,976
One of you can transfer to another team
if it's too uncomfortable.

294
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,187
No, it's okay…

295
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,526
Oh, I forgot.

296
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,613
It's actually that way.

297
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,575
Pain should be forgotten with work.

298
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,952
You can do it, Jeong Han-ah.

299
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,162
Right.

300
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,371
Go back to work, everyone.

301
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,625
Everyone does really know.

302
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,043
Everyone.

303
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,798
WOOMYUNG

304
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,633
WOOMYUNG INVESTMENT

305
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,096
- Hello, sir.
- Come in.

306
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,014
Have a seat.

307
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,519
You wanted a word with me?

308
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,603
Yes.

309
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,356
You're as impatient as I am.

310
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,482
Shall I cut to the chase?

311
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,483
Just getting to the point.

312
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,193
I learned it from you.

313
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,030
Right.

314
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,825
Soon,

315
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,161
Korean Investment Corporation
under the Ministry of Economy and Finance

316
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,704
will be hiring someone.

317
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,040
It's been hard to find someone,

318
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,876
so they want a recommendation
from a search firm.

319
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,921
I know someone competent for the job.

320
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,173
Recommend him if you like him too.

321
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,593
Vice President Lee Seok-jin
at Yuseong Finance.

322
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,848
I'll take care of the rest.

323
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,641
Just make the recommendation.

324
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,272
RÉSUMÉ

325
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,650
I'm sorry, sir.

326
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,904
Regarding this,
there's nothing I can do to help.

327
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,075
If there's one principle
that I follow at work,

328
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,953
it's that, under in any situation,

329
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,664
I shall not lose objectivity.

330
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,835
If a headhunting firm
loses credibility and fairness,

331
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,255
it'd be no longer valuable
as a search firm.

332
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,303
The company you invested in
can't be useless.

333
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,139
Peoplez.

334
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,186
I will grow it in my own way.

335
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,277
Ms. Kang.

336
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,160
You're growing well.

337
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,207
Thank you for understanding.

338
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,758
WOOMYUNG INVESTMENT

339
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,184
In her own way?

340
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:24,522
<i>Sir, Ms. Kim Hye-jin called to ask</i>
<i>if she could see you.</i>

341
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,784
Are you interested in the hiring
by Korea Investment Corporation?

342
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,206
There must have been someone
with a big mouth.

343
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:45,168
Making someone talk is also a skill.

344
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,504
If you must blame anyone,
please blame it on my competence.

345
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,217
If you leave it to me,
I'd handle it without a hitch.

346
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,719
You should use a search firm
at a time like this.

347
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,346
What do you want?

348
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,015
Peoplez.

349
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,476
I'm aware that Woomyung Investment is

350
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,854
the largest shareholder of Peoplez
with power of appointment.

351
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,107
And the one in charge of funds at Woomyung

352
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,359
is you, sir.

353
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,362
When you decide that
I'm better than Kang Ji-yun,

354
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,532
please hand Peoplez over to me.

355
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,787
You'll find out that
I'm more useful than Ms. Kang.

356
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,253
DIANE COSMETIC
KIM JIN-GUK

357
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,008
Gyu-rim.

358
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,346
Gyu-rim, aren't you going to pick up?

359
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,890
No, I shouldn't pick this one up.

360
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,392
Not this call.

361
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,358
Dating at work should be illegal.

362
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,611
That's a bit of a stretch, isn't it?

363
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,657
You must be for dating at work.
Is that right?

364
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,868
- Are you for it?
- It's because he hasn't done it.

365
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,120
If you've done it, you'd never say that.

366
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,999
Just what kind of experience do you have

367
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,960
that you hate the sound of dating at work?
At your previous job--

368
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,128
I won't comment.

369
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,338
As expected.

370
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,590
I don't really care to know.

371
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,968
Mr. Yu, you haven't answered me yet.

372
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,305
Are you for or against dating at work?

373
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,610
Gosh, you startled me!

374
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,280
Ms. Kang, why do you always stand there?

375
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,784
Oh, I found it!

376
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,121
Continue with your conversation.

377
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,665
That's for the shredder.

378
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,336
Ms. Kang, over here.

379
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,962
I was on my way.

380
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,132
This might traumatize me.

381
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,767
They want to improve the quality of
the planning team at their headquarters.

382
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,811
As the problems continue,

383
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,230
they decided that they needed an overhaul.

384
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,650
Isn't it their first time hiring people
from outside their office?

385
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,443
Dating outside of work…

386
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,405
Sir, this is Kim Young-soo from Peoplez.

387
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,198
You know that I'm competent.

388
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,117
Yes, trust me on this.

389
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,245
Come on, sir! Trust me and give it a try.

390
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,621
I tell you it's possible.

391
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:27,956
Oh, come on!

392
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,874
Wanna go visit the sauna together?

393
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,002
Please, trust me on this. Yes!

394
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,629
Exactly.

395
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,297
Would you like some coffee?

396
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,682
Darn it. I couldn't hear him.

397
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,144
Did you break it?

398
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,478
Are you that strong?

399
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,023
How could they make a pencil so weak?

400
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:55,984
Let's continue.

401
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,236
What are our sales this month?

402
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,405
Kang Ji-yun, you aren't concentrating.

403
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,198
We just talked about it.

404
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,950
Oh, we did.

405
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,788
Weren't we talking about Heonjo Group?

406
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,832
Their strategic planning office. Go on.

407
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,713
They'll bring personnel from outside
to their strategic planning office

408
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,632
to reorganize the entire company.

409
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,093
They're in contact
with experts on reorganization.

410
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,052
I see.

411
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,431
I haven't worked this hard in a while.
Can you pay more attention?

412
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,517
Ji-yun, did something happen to you?

413
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,520
Are you aware you aren't focused at work?

414
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,483
I am focused.

415
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,196
What's going on? Snap out of it.

416
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,117
- May I ask a few more things?
- Yes.

417
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,329
Feel free to ask anything
you want to know.

418
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:53,124
According to the company report
that you gave me,

419
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:57,003
the company's long-term plans…

420
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,381
Wait, I definitely had it somewhere.

421
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,593
You mean the analysis on the company
that I gave you last week?

422
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,428
One moment, please.

423
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,726
Bring me the analysis report
I sent to the managing director.

424
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,685
Thanks.

425
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,565
I realized for the first time

426
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,359
how indecisive I was.

427
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,402
I change my mind
more than ten times a day.

428
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,156
For my career, I should change my job.

429
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,201
But so many concerns make me hesitate.

430
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,454
Will I adapt myself well at a new company?

431
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,248
What will the company be like?

432
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,709
How about the work atmosphere?

433
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:41,005
As I feel nervous, I can't help but worry…

434
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,066
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

435
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,818
No more running.

436
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,820
…I find myself asking more and more.

437
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,363
Ms. Kang?

438
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:08,992
Ms. Kang.

439
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,578
I'm sorry.

440
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,872
Please continue.

441
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,879
Excuse me.

442
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,380
Ms. Kang.

443
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,841
Thank you.

444
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,515
COMPANY ANALYSIS REPORT

445
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,726
Take your time reviewing it.

446
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,279
Ms. Seo.

447
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,906
Get me a new secretary.

448
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,910
What? A secretary? You have Eun-ho.

449
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,787
I don't want Mr. Yu.

450
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,996
Get me a new person.

451
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,539
What are you talking about?

452
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,084
There's no one as good as Eun-ho.

453
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,627
He tolerates your short temper.

454
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,003
He changes the work atmosphere.

455
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,630
He deserves a big prize for that.

456
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,174
So give him a better position,

457
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,926
and get me a new secretary.

458
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,261
Why? What's this about?

459
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,554
I thought that you two got along.

460
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,598
Did Eun-ho do something wrong?

461
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,101
He interferes with my work.

462
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,187
- Isn't it you who interferes?
- He keeps crossing the line.

463
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,814
What? Help me understand.

464
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,315
He crosses what line, exactly?

465
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,487
What is it? What happened?

466
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,114
Tell me exactly.

467
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,740
Nothing happened.

468
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,785
I shouldn't have said anything.

469
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:16,786
Just forget it.

470
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,162
I need to understand what's going on--

471
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,915
I was just blowing hot and cold.
You know how I am.

472
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,792
Don't worry. Forget what I said.

473
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,256
She's so frustrating.

474
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,222
Eun-ho, can I have a word with you?

475
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,862
Ji-yun asked me to find her
a new secretary.

476
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,573
Did something happen between you two?

477
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,981
Good job today. See you.

478
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,033
Ms. Kang.

479
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,871
Did I do something wrong?

480
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,457
Ms. Seo told me.

481
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,418
Please let me know
if I'm lacking in any way.

482
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,135
Mr. Yu, you didn't do anything wrong.

483
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,348
I'm the problem.

484
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,645
I like you, Eun-ho.

485
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,899
I keep acting differently than usual.

486
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,484
It also affects my work.

487
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,656
So I was thinking of keeping a distance.

488
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,910
But this is my problem.

489
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,704
I should solve it myself.

490
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,335
I'm sorry for making you
feel uncomfortable.

491
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,838
Forget what I said today.

492
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,965
Keep doing what you've been doing.

493
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,261
I will take care

494
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,346
of my feelings.

495
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,141
Bye.

496
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,505
Dad, are you hot?

497
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,506
What?

498
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,467
No.

499
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,262
It slipped my mind.

500
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,764
Did something happen?

501
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,724
No.

502
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,684
Get changed. Let's eat.

503
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,364
I like you, Eun-ho.

504
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,297
Hello.

505
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,185
Good morning.

506
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,395
Good morning.

507
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,157
Hello, this is Kang Ji-yun.

508
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,619
Yes.

509
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,955
No.

510
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,666
Only the final interview remains.

511
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,545
Yes. About three final candidates…

512
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,767
Ms. Kang, about lunch…

513
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,394
I'm not hungry. You go ahead.

514
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,742
Who are you watching so intently?

515
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,790
Don't worry about it. Keep working.

516
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,922
Dating at work isn't allowed.
It's a social sin.

517
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,007
Out of the blue?

518
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,134
I was

519
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,887
just looking, that's all.

520
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,057
People tend to keep looking
when they like someone.

521
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,603
Right.

522
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,981
When they keep looking,

523
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,735
it means that
they have feelings for the other.

524
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,662
It's a social sin, indeed.

525
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,123
It doesn't feel good.

526
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,275
I'll do it for you.

527
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,651
I'll do it.

528
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,701
I'll go alone.

529
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,206
Amway Foods is entering the GMO market.

530
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,292
- Can you find out more?
- Sure.

531
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,712
Ms. Kang, you have a meeting
with Mikang Law Firm in five minutes.

532
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,005
I'll go with Ms. Seo.

533
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,548
I'll get off work from there.

534
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,508
Shall we go now?

535
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,759
Yes, ma'am.

536
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,887
Speaking of which, I want to go there.

537
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,722
Isn't the food there amazing?

538
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,599
The meat isn't fatty at all.

539
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:20,019
And when you try other things
at the restaurant…

540
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,187
It's to die for.

541
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,402
Yes, I'm on my way.

542
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,403
Yes.

543
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,159
I'll go alone.

544
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,285
Ms. Kang.

545
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,663
Please let me join you today.

546
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,583
No.

547
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,460
Get off work before me.

548
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,003
Ms. Kang!

549
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,130
Are you going somewhere?

550
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,757
The Yusang Group's head office.

551
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,801
Let me join you. I'll give you a ride.

552
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,513
I'll take good care of Ms. Kang today.

553
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,056
- Let's go.
- Please wait.

554
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,061
Documents for the meeting.

555
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,416
I could've gone alone.

556
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,503
Just treat me to something tasty
after the meeting.

557
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,547
Thanks.

558
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,012
Do you like Mr. Yu?

559
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,809
It looks like you're on your toes
around Mr. Yu.

560
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,567
No response, so I'll think however I want.

561
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,340
Hey.

562
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,676
Try paying attention to the person
in front of you.

563
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,013
Please concentrate on me.

564
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,225
Eating good meat
usually isn't so depressing.

565
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,103
Sorry.

566
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,563
If you're sorry, you should eat.

567
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,367
What do you think about me?

568
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,622
Wouldn't you say I'm good enough?

569
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm young, rich, and handsome.

570
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,127
Dating me would be a huge perk for you.

571
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,549
Young, rich, and handsome men?

572
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,551
I don't like them.

573
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,178
Then what's your type of guy?

574
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,781
Jeong-hoon.

575
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,576
I want our relationship to last.

576
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,622
I don't want things to get awkward.

577
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,721
I'm going on a blind date next week.

578
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:46,392
When I get a girlfriend,
you'd better not cry.

579
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,351
Okay?

580
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,648
Let's eat.

581
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,422
HANEUL KINDERGARTEN

582
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,133
Oh, Ms. Writer.

583
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,385
- Over here.
- Oh!

584
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,601
Are you here to see the director?

585
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,478
Yes,

586
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,272
but I must've missed her.

587
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:34,940
How about you?

588
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,860
I came to find this.

589
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,279
My son is clumsy
because he takes after me.

590
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,156
How old is he?

591
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,073
He's seven.

592
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,243
Seven years old?

593
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,624
Here. Take this and have it with your son.

594
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,752
It's extremely sweet

595
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:56,920
and delicious.

596
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,508
You should keep it.

597
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,263
I'd get more depressed
eating sweets alone on a day like today.

598
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,515
Did something happen?

599
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,442
I got rejected.

600
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,320
And I didn't even get to confess properly.

601
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:25,949
Unrequited love?

602
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,877
Want to go for some beer?

603
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,639
How long has this enterprise been?

604
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,806
Out of the blue?

605
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,853
Well, I joined the company back--

606
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,730
No, I mean your unrequited love.

607
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,235
Well,

608
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,112
I'm not sure when it started.

609
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,158
I saw her for the first time
when I was in high school.

610
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,868
Is it your first love?

611
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,412
I didn't like her from the start.

612
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:17,751
Is your husband your first love?

613
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,462
- I don't have a husband.
- What?

614
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,506
You said you had a son.

615
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,715
I do have a son.

616
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,885
You have preconceptions, don't you?

617
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,804
There are so many
different types of families.

618
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:33,892
My mistake.

619
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,060
I apologize.

620
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:38,438
Then, are you…

621
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,732
also in unrequited love?

622
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,069
That's why I recognized you.

623
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,031
My unrequited love comrade was here.

624
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,118
Let's clink glasses.

625
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,869
Let's stick together and stay strong.

626
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,497
- Sounds good. Cheers.
- Cheers.

627
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:05,966
My head hurts.

628
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,345
Oh, my head.

629
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,180
Nice going.

630
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:15,100
I'm glad that you didn't lose
your child's belongings, at least.

631
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,144
How much did you drink?

632
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,355
I don't know. I have a severe headache.

633
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,983
Just who did you drink with?

634
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:26,987
You didn't drink alone miserably, did you?

635
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,655
No,

636
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,491
I drank with an acquaintance.

637
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,286
You drank that much
with just an acquaintance?

638
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,997
It's just

639
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,415
a friend.

640
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,417
Is he an athlete?

641
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,793
When you came home last night,

642
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,963
you kept shouting, "Cheer up!"

643
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,214
Goodness.

644
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,299
Well, I <i>should </i>cheer up.

645
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,508
Sure.

646
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,344
Hurry and wake Seo-jun up.

647
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:51,887
Okay.

648
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,811
<i>Cheer up, yeah, cheer up, yeah</i>

649
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:02,731
<i>Don't give it up, be honest</i>

650
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:06,234
<i>Cheer up, yeah, cheer up</i>

651
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,660
ONE FINE SPRING DAY

652
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,335
What are you doing?

653
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,588
The guy I like likes this.

654
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,093
You mean, Yoo Ji-tae?

655
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:34,346
No, he likes this movie.

656
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,306
It's getting released again.

657
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,768
Oh, really?

658
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,563
That's great.
Ask him out to see it with you.

659
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,191
- With me?
- Yes!

660
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:49,569
<i>Cheer up, yeah, cheer up</i>

661
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,905
When else are you
going to take the chance?

662
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,573
Should I ask him out for you?

663
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,367
- Give me your phone.
- No.

664
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:57,577
I'll do it.

665
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,705
<i>Cheer up, yeah</i>

666
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,213
Oh, no.

667
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,006
My goodness.

668
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,049
No way.

669
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,512
WAT TO SEE MOVE WIT ME?

670
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,639
DADDY YU
WAT TO SEE MOVE WIT ME?

671
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,599
For goodness' sake.

672
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,644
What do I…

673
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,062
INCOMING CALL
DADDY YU

674
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,398
What should I do?

675
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,315
What do I do?

676
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:35,949
What to do…

677
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,872
Hi, Daddy Yu.

678
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,291
- Did you just wake up?
- Hi, Su-hyeon.

679
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:48,420
I got your message yesterday,
but with so many typos,

680
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,797
- I couldn't understand.
- Well…

681
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,760
Let's watch a movie.

682
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,678
<i>Daddy Yu, let's go out for a movie.</i>

683
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:57,929
Okay.

684
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,016
Let's go with our children
when Byeol is on vacation.

685
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,226
No, just the two of us.

686
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,812
What? The two of us?

687
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,232
<i>Yes, the movie you mentioned last time.</i>

688
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,234
<i>It got released again.</i>

689
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,069
<i>That movie isn't for children.</i>

690
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,072
The movie theater happened
to be near your work.

691
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:18,867
Yes.

692
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,828
Oh, okay.

693
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,705
See you then.

694
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,748
Bye.

695
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,929
- What?
- I'll look after the kids that day.

696
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,931
Since when were you eavesdropping?

697
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,726
I've been here for a while.

698
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,563
Gosh, that takes a weight off my chest.

699
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,441
Seo-jun, it's time to get up!

700
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,823
Dad, are you going to the movies
with Auntie?

701
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:58,949
Yes.

702
00:51:59,032 --> 00:51:59,991
Where?

703
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,159
Near my work.

704
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,452
Let us come with you.

705
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,373
You wouldn't like it.
It's a movie for adults.

706
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:07,958
Let me tie your hair.

707
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:13,380
I read your résumé and
you just need to add a few more details.

708
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:18,468
Write the projects you've done
in the employer's format.

709
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,514
Gyu-rim, someone is here to see you.

710
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,640
Who?

711
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,104
Oh my.

712
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,157
How did you know about this place?

713
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,160
It wasn't me. I didn't call him.

714
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,663
I'd really like to know how you came here.

715
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:50,834
She's never taken sick leave,
but she took time off on a weekday.

716
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:51,960
It's obvious.

717
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,003
I know you.

718
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,924
You said that you'd never change jobs.
Jeez.

719
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,134
You said you couldn't either.

720
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,219
The one who can't bear it must leave.

721
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,888
You stay. I'll leave.

722
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,682
Forget it. It's over.
Gyu-rim found me a good--

723
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:08,685
You said that you dedicated
your youth to our company!

724
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:09,728
You stay.

725
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,771
You want to throw all your hard work away?

726
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,941
What about you? You did half of it!

727
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,693
Gyu-rim, I'll change jobs.

728
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,194
As you know,

729
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,738
Jeong Han-ah has leadership
and she's smart.

730
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,490
She has love for the brand,
and she's good to her coworkers.

731
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,410
It'd be a loss if she changes jobs
because of me.

732
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,913
Gyu-rim, he's so foolishly kind

733
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,373
that he yields
and does all the supporting.

734
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,499
- What the…
- Instead of changing jobs

735
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,668
and getting used by people,
tell him to stay.

736
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,837
- Gyu-rim, I'll change jobs.
- Gyu-rim, I will.

737
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:36,838
- Gyu-rim!
- Gyu-rim!

738
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,174
What on earth are you two doing?

739
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,845
She's sensitive even when seasons change.
She should stay put.

740
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,307
Do they have a good cafeteria?
You're a picky eater.

741
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,351
I won't starve.

742
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,186
Can you live without seeing me?

743
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,650
I regret it.

744
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,193
I regret having let you go so much

745
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,320
that it drives me insane.

746
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,907
Don't leave, Han-ah.

747
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,201
Neither work nor me.

748
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,287
Don't leave, Jeong Han-ah.

749
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,462
Are you crying right now?

750
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,298
Are you crying?

751
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,807
That's so romantic.

752
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,439
Gyu-rim, I'm sorry.

753
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,108
I'll call you soon.

754
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,236
Gyu-rim, I'll pay you back for this.

755
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,946
- We should go.
- Sure.

756
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,280
Take care.

757
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,448
Bye.

758
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,124
They're even holding hands.

759
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,041
- Oh, boy.
- The heck?

760
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,631
Does that mean that they made up?

761
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,967
Yes, they're back together.

762
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,886
Will she be changing her job…

763
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:08,972
She won't be.

764
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,728
You worked hard to prepare it.

765
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,313
- Are you okay, Gyu-rim?
- Of course, I'm fine.

766
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,233
I have to be okay with it.

767
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,318
Not like I can help it.

768
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,405
You can't hold back love.

769
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,927
We're here.

770
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,805
It won't take long, so stay here.

771
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,895
I've updated the company's most
recent information.

772
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,814
You haven't met them in a while.
It could be a good reference.

773
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,525
I marked the changes

774
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,652
from last year.

775
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,324
RATES

776
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,080
It got scheduled at the last minute.
You must've worked overnight on it.

777
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,294
Thank you.

778
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,598
Gosh, when did you get back?

779
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,976
It's been about 30 minutes.

780
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,686
You should've woken me up. I apologize.

781
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,522
It was the last item on my schedule.

782
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,439
It's okay.

783
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:32,986
Let's go.

784
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:34,654
Yes, ma'am.

785
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:52,297
Kang-seok, I'm here.

786
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,048
I'm back here.

787
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,261
What's all this? Wow.

788
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,597
Did you prepare this by yourself?

789
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,808
Stop admiring it and have a seat.

790
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,560
It looks so delicious.

791
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,688
Did you have a fight with Mi-ae?

792
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,023
What are you saying?

793
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:13,318
I wanted to talk about life with you.
It's been a while.

794
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,360
You really didn't fight?

795
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,903
Of course not.

796
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,574
I got nervous for nothing
when you asked to drink together.

797
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:20,908
I thought something was up.

798
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:21,868
Let's clink glasses.

799
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,495
It's hard to believe you.

800
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,794
- Eun-ho.
- Yeah?

801
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,798
How did you feel when you found out
that she was pregnant with Byeol?

802
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:39,594
What?

803
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,263
Is Mi-ae pregnant?

804
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,932
Gosh, no.

805
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:49,270
I was just curious about
what it feels like to be a dad.

806
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,313
Oh, come on.

807
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,482
Mi-ae wants a child,

808
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,776
but I don't feel confident.

809
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,361
Taking care of myself is hard enough.

810
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:59,447
I don't know if I could
be responsible for the life of another.

811
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,533
By bringing a baby to a life
that's not all sunshine and rainbows,

812
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,244
I'm afraid I'd be making the baby suffer.

813
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:06,954
Am I a coward?

814
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,291
Kang-seok, being scared is normal.

815
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:11,834
It's about being responsible
for a human life.

816
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,545
Even if you contemplate for a long time,
it's still hard.

817
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,924
But you'll do a fine job.

818
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,927
Yeah? Thanks.

819
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,638
It's hard, but you're already doing it.

820
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:29,060
That's because everyone,
including you and Mi-ae, helps me.

821
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:32,397
When Byeol comes here,
she reads books on her own.

822
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:38,361
Speaking of which,
Byeol and Ms. Kang are very similar.

823
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:39,696
They both like books.

824
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:41,948
Are they similar?

825
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:42,949
Yes.

826
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,954
Why are you looking down?

827
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,288
Are you worried about something?

828
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,419
No, of course not.

829
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:55,795
Yu Eun-ho.

830
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:59,424
With me, you don't have to pretend
like everything is okay.

831
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,759
Go ahead and relax, man.

832
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,678
You don't have to be perfect
in front of me.

833
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:06,222
Also, you should show

834
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:08,516
your weak sides, too.

835
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:21,779
Kang-seok.

836
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,031
I…

837
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:28,202
have someone who's on my mind.

838
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:32,039
Isn't it funny?

839
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:33,791
It's not funny at all.

840
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,836
It's the best news I've heard recently.

841
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:38,755
Is it?

842
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,176
But you know I can't.

843
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,385
Can't what?

844
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,430
It's not the right time.

845
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,307
I have to take care of Byeol.

846
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,642
It hasn't been long since she got better.

847
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:54,854
Yu Eun-ho, it only sounds like an excuse.

848
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:57,190
That won't make you neglect Byeol.

849
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,358
Is it wrong to like someone?

850
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:01,861
Can't you be honest

851
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,614
about your feelings this once?

852
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:09,410
Is being honest about my feelings
good for that person?

853
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,498
I'm not in the best situation.

854
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,375
I don't want to give her a hard time.

855
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:19,337
Instead of losing her from
too much worrying and regretting it,

856
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,172
muster up the courage.

857
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,634
What she wants isn't your consideration.

858
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,011
Wouldn't it be your honest feelings?

859
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,322
Hey, hey.

860
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,032
The food here was amazing.

861
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,827
- It was great.
- Come out.

862
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,163
You worked hard, Gyu-rim.

863
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,332
You should forget about what happened.

864
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,919
Go home tonight and sleep
without thinking about a thing.

865
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,129
- Thank you.
- What do you mean?

866
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:05,174
Are you going home already?
We need round two tonight.

867
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,718
Round two will be on me.

868
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:10,179
There's a quiet place nearby.
Let's go to the convenience store.

869
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,806
Here we go. Let's go.

870
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,057
Goodbye.

871
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,726
Kwang-hee?

872
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,979
Gyu-rim? Mr. Kim?

873
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,605
- Gyu-rim?
- Stop calling us.

874
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,857
Oh, Kwang-hee.

875
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,149
Kyung-hwa, what do you like?

876
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:25,194
Kyung-hwa.

877
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:28,406
Why are you bad with timing every time?

878
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,576
I've always been on the slow side.

879
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,495
Yes, I can tell.

880
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,080
You've never dated anyone, have you?

881
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:38,165
Not true, you see. I have, you see.

882
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,876
See that?

883
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,168
It's obvious that you haven't.

884
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:42,712
That was two "you see"s.

885
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,839
- It means you're inexperienced.
- But--

886
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,966
Strong denial means strong confirmation.

887
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,234
You're quick.

888
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,364
Why is my heart pounding?

889
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:11,866
Do you hear that?

890
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,159
What am I…

891
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,327
I'm leaving.

892
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:25,004
DODAM BOOK STORE

893
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:53,658
Here.

894
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,704
DODAM BOOK STORE

895
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:58,180
Thank you.

896
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,849
Oh, sis!

897
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:02,059
It's been a long time. Have you been well?

898
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,478
I missed you,

899
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:05,896
but Dad said that you were busy.

900
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:07,648
Did he?

901
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,110
- Where's Dad?
- He's at work.

902
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,320
I stopped by
because I was in the neighborhood.

903
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:15,990
Will your dad be picking you up here?

904
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:18,075
He's going to the movies
with Aunt Su-hyeon today.

905
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,327
- At the movie theater near his work.
- What?

906
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,913
I'll be at Seo-jun's house.

907
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:26,876
Hello.

908
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:29,253
I'm Jung Seo-jun, Jung Su-hyeon's son.

909
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,047
Oh, hi.

910
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:33,174
It's a date.

911
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:35,801
My grandmother said
that they're going on a date.

912
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:36,761
What?

913
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:46,187
Seo-jun, Byeol.

914
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,688
Grandma!

915
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:49,857
Did you have fun?

916
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,983
Wait for me.

917
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,278
Oh, right.

918
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:55,738
It's for you.

919
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,698
See you next time.

920
01:07:58,991 --> 01:07:59,867
Let's go.

921
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:02,495
Let's take your bags.

922
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:03,954
Thank you, Kang-seok.

923
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,164
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

924
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,540
Bye.

925
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:07,500
Take care.

926
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,709
A date?

927
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,313
You're back.

928
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,441
You're still here.

929
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:58,068
I had to organize some material.

930
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,946
It isn't urgent, so do it tomorrow.

931
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,407
I'll just wrap up and leave.

932
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:06,452
It's okay. You may go.

933
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:08,370
You're busy anyway.

934
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:16,754
I'll finish before leaving.

935
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:20,132
All right.

936
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,669
WRITER JUNG

937
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:54,893
Hi, Su-hyeon.

938
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:56,812
Yes.

939
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,524
Okay, I got it.

940
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:02,234
Bye.

941
01:12:47,988 --> 01:12:49,823
ONE FINE SPRING DAY

942
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:53,619
<i>Instead of losing her from</i>
<i>too much worrying and regretting it,</i>

943
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,245
<i>muster up the courage.</i>

944
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:57,873
<i>What she wants isn't your consideration.</i>

945
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,459
<i>Wouldn't it be your honest feelings?</i>

946
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:03,295
I like you, Eun-ho.

947
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:15,682
<i>Su-hyeon, I'm sorry,</i>

948
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,685
<i>but I can't watch the movie with you.</i>

949
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,957
<i>So what kind of person do you think I am?</i>

950
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,625
<i>You worry about your candidate,</i>

951
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:43,377
<i>but you never take care of yourself.</i>

952
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:45,462
Your candidate isn't
the only one that is important.

953
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,965
please take good care of yourself.

954
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:50,217
<i>I don't want to pry.</i>

955
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,594
<i>Even being asked questions</i>
<i>could be hurtful.</i>

956
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,888
You don't owe me any explanation.

957
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:57,266
I'll only believe what I see.

958
01:13:58,142 --> 01:13:59,059
<i>You did an excellent job.</i>

959
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,728
A compliment should be done properly.

960
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,149
<i>What's wrong with falling?</i>
<i>You can get back up.</i>

961
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:06,733
I'll hold you.

962
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:28,672
ONE FINE SPRING DAY (RERELEASE)

963
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,542
Yu Eun-ho?

964
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:30,961
That movie.

965
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,213
Don't watch it.

966
01:16:38,885 --> 01:16:39,970
I'm watching.

967
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:05,120
I'll go to you.

968
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,605
<i>Can we keep it a secret at work?</i>

969
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:56,982
<i>At work, be strict about it.</i>

970
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:58,191
- <i>Keep personal life and work separate.</i>
- Shall I take it down?

971
01:18:58,275 --> 01:18:59,109
Just go out.

972
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,154
<i>I think Dad found someone that he likes.</i>

973
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,197
<i>He looks at the mirror a lot these days.</i>

974
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,074
- It can't be me, right?
- He must be an idiot.

975
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:07,659
<i>Why doesn't he recognize</i>
<i>such a good person like you?</i>

976
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,537
I'll be willing to change jobs
under a few conditions.

977
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,372
It won't be easy to negotiate.

978
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,000
I'm here to see CEO Kang Ji-yun.

979
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:15,959
Tae-yoon.

980
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:17,878
I have a favor to ask of Ms. Kang.

981
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:18,962
Me?

982
01:19:19,045 --> 01:19:24,050
