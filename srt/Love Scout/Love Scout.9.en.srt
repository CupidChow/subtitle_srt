and his hiring of those close to him in executive positions.

On top of that, the new business they invested in immediately upon his hiring

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,600
Stubborn.

178
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,780
Relentless?

179
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,980
You are relentless.

180
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,030
So cute.

181
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Sir, Next approached Peoplez and Career Way about the CEO hire today.

182
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,330
That will be fun to watch.

183
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,150
Watch what?

184
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,790
What are you up to now?

185
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:31,800
How did he get in here? Do we let anyone in, like a flea market?

186
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,840
I'm sorry. I'll have a word with them.

187
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,840
Is there anyone in this building who doesn't know the Chairman's son?

188
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,190
No need to have a word and torture innocent people.

189
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,730
And stop torturing Kang Ji Yun.

190
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,940
Don't you think about doing something weird to CEO Kang.

191
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,080
Don't do a thing.

192
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,740
You idiot.

193
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,200
Don't mess up Peoplez, either.

194
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,380
Now is not the time for you to worry about such useless things.

195
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,740
Soon, your course of action will be determined.

196
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,870
Start getting ready emotionally.

197
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,520
Why are you determining my course of action, Father?

198
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,210
I will do whatever I want.

199
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,600
Don't delude yourself.

200
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:20,060
I didn't send you to CEO Kang for your sake.

201
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,900
Sending you was an investment on my part.

202
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,960
The investment has failed, so it's time to retract it.

203
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,000
Father!

204
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,670
I'm not a philanthropist.

205
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,480
If she won't become my daughter-in-law, and if she's incompetent,

206
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,700
it's time to discard her.

207
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,430
Don't force my hand into discarding my only remaining child.

208
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,040
I don't expect you to respect me as a father.

209
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,760
Just be quiet and follow me.

210
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,030
I will never turn out like my brother.

211
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,500
What a pushover.

212
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,510
Director, what's wrong?

213
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,620
No. Nothing's wrong.

214
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,090
Director Yu, do you have dinner plans?

215
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,820
Nothing special.

216
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,600
Great.

217
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,090
Have dinner with me.

218
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,630
Do you like Kang Ji Yun?

219
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,140
I like her a lot.

220
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,360
You're not even hiding it anymore.

221
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,890
You knew the answer before you asked me.

222
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,300
Right.

223
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,800
Then...

224
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,870
I'd like you to protect Kang Ji Yun.

225
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,690
It's funny I'm saying this.

226
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,420
My father is a very scary person. As you've seen.

227
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,800
So, I tried to protect Kang Ji Yun.

228
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,640
But what can I do?

229
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,150
Kang Ji Yun like you, Director.

230
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,870
So...

231
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,930
I'm watching you.

232
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,520
Take another shot.

233
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,390
Thank you.

234
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,150
Director Yu.

235
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,200
Let me ask you one last favor.

236
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,620
Arm wrestle me.

237
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,780
Sounds good.

238
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,850
Your hand will hurt for a few days.

239
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,100
I'll finish you off without pain.

240
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,970
Start.

241
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,420
Everything is on me!

242
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,290
You're terrible at arm wrestling. This...

243
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,420
You're supposed to flip like this.

244
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,390
Look, look. Your muscles are huge but tender.

245
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,600
You've got no strength.

246
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,830
- Thank you!
- Thank you!
[Hogu* Restaurant]
(Pushover)

247
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,400
I won the arm wrestling match!

248
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,730
I win against anything!

249
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,340
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you!

250
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,690
Director.

251
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,790
Director?

252
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,200
Director.

253
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,630
Director.

254
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,850
- Yes?
- You can't sleep here.

255
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,850
I'm cold.

256
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,330
Where's your car, Director?

257
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,380
Director, I'll call a driver for you. Where do you live?

258
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,420
Live...

259
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,450
We're in trouble.

260
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,080
Director, we're here...

261
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,040
Writer! My comrade!

262
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,650
My comrade! My comrade!

263
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,040
Writer! Why are you here?

264
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,320
I live here...

265
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,940
You two know each other?

266
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,510
- This is top secret, but we're comrades.
- Comrades?

267
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,890
One-sided crush-

268
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:45,100
No, we just happen to know each other.

269
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,340
It's late. Let's go inside.

270
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,590
Let's hurry.

271
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,910
I bit my tongue...

272
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,280
Here? Here?

273
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,230
Hurry! Hurry!

274
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,120
Let's go.

275
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,980
Gosh, so...

276
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,830
how do you two know each other?

277
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,740
Forget it. That's not important.

278
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,860
Forget it, forget it. Forget it!

279
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,600
Director, go home now.

280
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,360
I'm going to keep drinking with my comrade.

281
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,750
- I'm going home.
- Bye.

282
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,550
I'm also going home.

283
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,700
Director, that's not it.

284
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,080
Why are you following me?

285
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,200
I can't believe I get to drink with you again! I'm so lucky!

286
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,400
- What's all this noise late at night?
- Mom...

287
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,570
- And who's this...
- Hello! I'm her friend. No, her comrade...

288
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,170
- Comrade...
- Oh, my gosh!

289
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,930
Excuse me!

290
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,610
You know him?

291
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:10,190
Well, I do know him, but...

292
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,240
I'm crazy...

293
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,830
I'm sorry.

294
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,110
You're just leaving?

295
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,040
You came in without permission, and you're leaving without permission?

296
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,010
I don't remember much.

297
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,270
How did I get here?

298
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,450
I can't believe the flavors.

299
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,400
I thought I was drinking the ocean.

300
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,970
The crunchy bean sprouts
(official website: www.kisskh.la www.kisskh.co and www.kisskh.id other than this are fake)

301
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,490
and the umami flavor of the pollack in the deep, rich broth

302
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:31,090
formed a fantastic harmony.

303
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:34,220
That was the best hangover soup I've ever had.

304
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,560
I just put it together.

305
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,730
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

306
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,120
So, how do you know Su Hyeon?

307
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,080
What do you do? How old are you?

308
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,240
What are your hobbies? What food do you like?

309
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,780
Mom.

310
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,570
You just met him. That's too many questions.

311
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,340
You're making him uncomfortable.

312
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,820
Not at all.

313
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,810
I'm not uncomfortable at all. I can answer everything.

314
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,060
Feel free to ask me anything you want.

315
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,740
Height, weight, ideal type, net worth...

316
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,270
To start, my height is...

317
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,570
He must be here. Just a moment.

318
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,900
He's here.

319
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,290
- Hello.
- Hello.

320
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,450
- What did you do yesterday?
- I watched TV.

321
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:26,230
- Really?
- Aigoo, they see each other every day, yet they love it.

322
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,250
- I know.
- Every day?

323
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:32,620
I walk the kids to school with him every day. Tomorrow, too.

324
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,630
- When did you go to bed last night?
- Me?

325
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,340
I don't know how to read the clock.

326
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,750
- Do you know how to read the clock?
- I don't know, either.

327
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,660
- What will you do at the kindergarten?
- Me?

328
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,710
Coloring, of course.

329
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:50,170
Coloring is so fun to me.

330
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,000
Byeol.

331
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,060
So...

332
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,870
her one-sided crush was

333
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,390
Director Yu...

334
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,310
That's it.

335
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,840
What Next needs the most right now

336
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,960
is a crisis management specialist with a clear solution.

337
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,710
Let's approach those with a legal or press background.

338
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,040
Pardon?

339
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,050
Not business management specialists?

340
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,500
Overturning the brand image is a top priority.

341
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,500
The new CEO's priority will be to quell the controversy the previous CEO caused.

342
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,930
They need someone who can deal with the press more than ever.

343
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,030
Focusing on crisis management,

344
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,750
candidates with legal backgrounds will bring great value.

345
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,880
Next is caught up in a number of legal battles.

346
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,370
A CEO with a legal background

347
00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:02,160
will strengthen their risk management strategies and reassure the stakeholders.

348
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,860
Leadership skills are a prerequisite, so let's look for

349
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,000
those who have led organizations with a legal or press background.

350
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,430
There are a lot of eyes on this project. Stay sharp.

351
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,700
Yes.

352
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,720
Gyeong Hwa, please make the candidate list.

353
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,200
Oh Gyeong Hwa.

354
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,770
Ma'am...

355
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:28,340
you just called me by the right name.

356

- I did?
- Yes, you did.

357
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,620
Of course, as the CEO, I call my employees

358
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,410
by the right name...

359
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,150
Meeting over.

360
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,380
Daebak. What in the world.

361
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:55,630
She called me by the right name the other day, too.

362
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,780
Me, too.

363
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,210
What? I thought none of you cared.

364

But you care a lot.

365

Don't you think

366
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,930
our CEO has changed a bit lately?

367
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,520
She's slightly gentler and warmer.

368

369

Yes, hello. This is Yu Eun Ho.

- He's really coming! Oh, my God!

You know how handsome he is, right?

383
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,470
What a fuss.

384
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,640
Rumor travels fast.

385
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:08,680
CEO Min Jeong Hyeok. He runs a very successful interior design firm.

386
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,530
He makes the furniture himself.

387
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,730
Skills, looks, personality... He has it all.

388
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,800
Women go crazy over him.

389
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,040
Wait a minute.

390
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,770
I wonder if our CEO would be interested in him.

391
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:25,860
It would be the makings of a handsome couple. I'm feeling it.

392
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,380
What's wrong, Hyungnim? Do I have something on my face?

393
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,380
Is it seaweed? Or am I just good-looking?

396
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,740
Gwang Hee, you have a tendency to be rash.

397
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,910
I guess I was rash to call myself handsome.

398
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,040
Hello.

399

Yes.

401
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,500
I'm Min Jeong Hyeok, and I do interior design.

I need someone who can get to work right away.

406

I have no time to train or wait for them to get used to the work.

Nor do I have the energy for that.

What's wrong? You can't find someone like that?

409
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:45,540
I will find someone. My job is to recommend the best candidate to my clients.

410
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,500
Just like your customers trust the quality of the furniture you make,

411
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,100
some clients wholeheartedly trust candidates I recommend.

412

Unfortunately, you have no special plans for tonight.

00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:11,030
Good job today.

535
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,510
Eun Ho, you did a good job, too.

536
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,880
What should we do tomorrow?

537
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,250
Should we go on a date? It's the weekend.

538
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,330
I have plans tomorrow.

539
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,460
What?

540
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,620
Fine, I'll yield for Byeol.

541
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,030
It's not Byeol.

542
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,760
I'll tell you after.

543
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,180
CEO Park Gi Hoon.

544
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,230
Hello.

545
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,600
You're the child that Mr. Kang rescued during the Gajin fire?

546
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,450
Yes.

547
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,940
So, his name is...

548
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,950
Mr. Kang Gyeong Tae.

549
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,000
He was an elementary school teacher nearby.

550
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,210
Everyone admired him for his exemplary character.

551
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,300
But when he passed away so tragically,

552
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,590
everyone said how characteristic of him.

553
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,880
I just feel bad for the daughter left behind.

554
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,260
She became an orphan overnight.

555
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,900
It was just him and his daughter.

556
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,810
She went from one relative's home to another after his passing.

557
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,190
Well...

558
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:54,290
Have you heard anything else?

559
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,620
I heard she became the CEO of some company.

560
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,450
Sounds like she grew up fine.

561
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:01,970
Do you have her contact info? Or the name of the company?

562
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,960
Not sure...

563
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,700
What was the name of the company? I heard it once.

564
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,570
Oh, they might know at the school Mr. Kang used to work at.

565
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,600
Go there.

566
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,610
Yes, thank you.

567
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,040
You're looking for Kang Gyeong Tae's daughter?

568
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,980
Yes, please. I heard his daughter attended this school.

569
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,150
We are not able to share personal information.

570
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,940
Just a second.

571
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:37,000
- Yes, sir.
- Eun Ho.

572
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,510
Mr. Kang's daughter's company.

573
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,380
Yes. You remembered?

574
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,450
It's Peoplez.

575
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,420
Excuse me?

576
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,140
I can't share anything other than her name.

577
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,130
It's Kang Ji Yun.

578
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,890
Hi!

579
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,220
How did you know I was here?

580
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,700
Who else but you comes here at this hour?

581
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,310
Don't you think so?

582
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,680
This time...

583
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,580
Of course, this time...

584
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:20,060
Save me!

585
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,200
I'm here!

586
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,940
Save me! Save me...

587
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,270
I'm here...

588
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,000
Save me...

589
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,230
Save me...

590
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,440
Please save me...

591
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,370
Save me...

592
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,220
Save me...

593
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,200
Hello!

594
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,400
Hey!

595
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,630
Someone is here!

596
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,550
Hey!

597
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,450
Are you okay?

598
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,620
Don't give up.

599
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,710
Save me...

600
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,270
- Give me your hand.
- Save me...

601
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,570
Hey, kid, wake up.

602
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,410
Don't give up.

603
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,120
You will live.

604
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,710
Got it?

605
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,650
Is anyone inside?

606
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,930
Over here! We're here!

607
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:10,710
There are survivors inside! Requesting rescue crew.

608
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:12,880
Hand him over. We got him.

609
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,600
We're on the third floor. Support is needed!

610
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,250
Third floor...

611
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,080
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

612
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,160
When can we have more support on the third floor? We have a survivor.

613
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,010
Go down first.

614
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:46,430
Step away from the door!

615
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,860
Eun Ho.

616
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,550
Eun Ho.

617
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,340
What are you thinking about so deeply that you didn't know I was here?

618
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,060
I'm sorry.

619
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,470
Is something wrong?

620
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:27,000
Your face looks pale. Why did you ask to see me privately?

621
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,740
I have something to ask you.

622
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,000
Is this about Ji Yun?

623
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,950
Ji Yun's father...

624
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,800
Did Ji Yun overreact or something?

625
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,940
I hope you can understand, Eun Ho.

626
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,010
That's Ji Yun's trauma.

627
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,870
I heard he died during a fire while rescuing a young child.

628
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:58,370
People would call him a hero and that he died a righteous death,

629
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,520
singing his praises.

630
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,380
Ji Yun said she hated hearing that.

631
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,960
After Ji Yun's mom died early,

632
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,300
she relied solely on her dad.

633
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,490
And she was left all alone in the world overnight.

634
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,520
It makes sense that she resents her dad.

635
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,230
Plus, Ji Yun's extended family is obsessed with money.

636
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,630
They kept dumping her on the other person,

637
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:26,270
but they want to take credit now that she's successful.

638
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:29,080
They come to her like clockwork and take money from her.

639
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,310
Gosh, I said too much. Didn't I? Gosh...

640
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:39,750
I'm sorry. I'll stop. It's nothing good to talk about.

Whenever I dream, I see my late father.

644
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,010
You must miss him a lot.

645
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:59,350
Not really. I don't really miss him that much.

646
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:02,880
He wasn't a good dad to me.

647
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,010
At least you're always there when Byeol's looking for you.

648
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:14,440
I'm sure Byeol knows how hard her dad tries.

649
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,680
So, just keep being

650
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:21,020

653
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,540
Yes, Ji Yun.

654
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,350
Daddy!

655
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,800
Hi. You're with Unni?

656
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,980
Daddy, guess where I am?

657
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,550
Weren't you at Uncle's bookstore?

658
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,300
Byeol's on a date with me. Come join us.

659
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,730
What if your dad's mad that we came out by ourselves?

660
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,490
Gosh, my daddy doesn't get mad about stuff like that.

661
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:14,720
What does he get mad about, then?

662
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:19,450
Sounds like your dad doesn't really get mad at you.

663
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,310
What an amazing dad.

664
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,820
But my daddy does have weaknesses.

665
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,350
Weaknesses? What are they?

666
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,880
My daddy is scared of a lot of things.

667
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,250
Really?

668
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,100
Yeah. He's scared of bugs

669
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,210
and blowing balloons.

670
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,740
Balloons?

671
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,850
What else?

672
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,880
He's scared of amusement park rides, too.

673
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,070
He'll only ride the merry-go-round with me.

674
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:46,450
I heard your dad was part of a rescue club.

675
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,380
That's different, he says.

676
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:53,660
He says a spinning plate is scarier than climbing a mountain.

677
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,290
- So cute.
- Huh?

678
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:02,050
Your dad is funny, Byeol.

679
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:05,540
- Right? My daddy's funny.
- Yes.

680
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:09,850
Cute.

681
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,360
Daddy!

682
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,170
Oh, Byeol.

683
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,260
What happened?

684
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:25,240
We ran into each other at the bookstore...

685
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,630
They have a new mint chocolate chip item. It was so good, right?

686
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,990
Wow, so many pretty things.

687
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:42,600
- There are.
- This is so pretty.

688
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,270
So pretty, Byeol. Let's try it on.

689
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:46,500
Let's see.

690
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,390
So cute. Look.

691
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:52,080
So pretty, right?

692
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,060
You too, Unni.

693
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,830
Me, too?

694
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,990
What do you think?

695
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,740
Do I look okay?

696
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,140
Daddy, too.

697
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,960
Daddy, you, too!

698
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:15,640
Okay. Shall I? Go ahead, Byeol.

699
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,850
- What do you think?
- Cute.

700
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:21,010
Let's take a photo of the three of us.

701
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,390
Say cheese.

702
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,810
One, two, three.

703
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,400
She's sound asleep.

704
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:44,100
♫ Aigoo, fell while climbing a tree ♫

705
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,790
Go slow so Byeol doesn't wake up.

706
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:54,680
I'm driving safely at 50 kilometers.

707
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,640
Also, not even an earthquake can wake her.

708
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:08,070
- Are you not feeling well?
- Huh?

709
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,560
No... Do I seem that way?

710
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,930
You just seem different than usual.

711
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,030
Aren't you tired, Ji Yun?

712
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:22,810
I think I'm good with kids. I'm not tired at all.

713
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:25,770
I love chatting with Byeol.

714
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,010
I hear you are secretly scared of a lot of things.

715
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,540
Byeol said that?

716
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,790
It wasn't just one or two things.

717
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:41,810
Why are you scared of blowing balloons?

718
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,310
I'm not scared of that. Why would I be scared of that...

719
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,600
Gosh, she said you're scared of it.

720
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:51,250
Sounds like Byeol had fun badmouthing her dad.

721
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:55,670
Byeol likes you a lot, Eun Ho.

722
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:57,920
She's so proud of you.

723
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,760
I'm jealous.

724
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:12,970
That Byeol has a dad like Yu Eun Ho.

725
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,750
Hello.

726
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,960
Hello.

727
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:42,850
CEO Kang.

728
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,380
Is something going on with Eun Ho?

729
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,170
He texted, saying he was not coming in today.

730
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:50,970
- He's not coming in?
- You didn't know?

731
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,400
The customer is not answering the phone.

732
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:15,520
Is something wrong? Call me when you see this.

733
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,360
Is something going on?

734
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:16,210
[Kang Gyeong Tae]

735
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,290
[Kang Gyeong Tae]

736
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,700
Thank you for saving me.

737
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,910
Thanks to you, I didn't give up.

738
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,530
And now,

739
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,810
about Ji Yun...

740
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,540
I want to protect Ji Yun now.

741
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,800
Will that be okay?

742
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,620
Hello?

743
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,190
I'm sorry I couldn't call.

744
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:03,230
Everything is okay, right?

745
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,550
Where are you?

746
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:07,510
I'm home.

747
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,720
I miss you.

748
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,520
Come quickly.

749
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:49,940
You're here.

750
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,630
Come in.

751
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:10,660
What happened? I couldn't get a hold of you all day.

752
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,520
What were you up to?

753
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,820
What's this?

754
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,600
I can't even get mad at you if you do this.

755
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:38,280
I'm sorry, Ji Yun.

756
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,820
For making you live all by yourself and be lonely.

757
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,710
Why are you sorry about that, Eun Ho?

758
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,450
Something's off today.

759
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:04,020
Did something happen?

760
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,870
Today...

761
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,020
I went to visit your father, Ji Yun.

762
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,360
What do you mean by that?

763
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,170
There's something...

764
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,660
I must tell you, Ji Yun.

765
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:36,720
The child that...

766
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,710
your father saved...

767
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:46,300
That was me.

768
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,230
[Love Scout]

769
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:31,270
[We thank Kwak Si Yang for his special appearance]

770
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:06,290
How am I supposed to be at ease with you anymore?

771
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:09,030
Did you two fight? Did something happen?

772
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,360
I'm sure about one thing.

773
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:12,950
I confirmed it with a current Peoplez employee.

774
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,620
If I'm taking it from her,

775
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,780
I better take everything and leave nothing.

776
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,360
Did something happen to Seo Jun?

777
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:22,060
Unni, I'm doing good, right?

778
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:23,130
It's okay.

779
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:26,740
I'm here, Dad. It took so long...

780
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:28,300
for me to get here.

781
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:33,800
Thank you, Eun Ho, for turning out to be such a great person.
