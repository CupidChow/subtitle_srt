- Yes.

- Oh, hey.
- Manager. Hello.

I'm doing my best.

You wanted to try it so badly.

Now that you had the chance,
it's not so much fun, is it?

00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:28,949
Shoot.

I must hurry.

26
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:53,479

- Yes?
- I changed the design.

Only two designs?

32
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,020
The best 2 out of the 10 best.

33
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,259

That's not like Jeremy.

37
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,099
Forget it. I'm asking Hyun Nam.

38
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:48,229
Wait.

39
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:50,599

Okay?

42
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,810
Try this first.
Why don't you lower the chroma a bit?

43
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,340
- The chroma?
- Yes.

44
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:00,080
- I'll try.
- Okay.

45
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,810
- Good luck.
- Yes.

46
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,219
You must be tired.

47
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,659

Discuss with Hyun Nam.)

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,240

53
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,050
- I lowered the chroma.
- But?

54
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,689
But I don't see any difference.
I'm not sure about what to do.

55
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:45,720
Still, with the chroma reduced,

56
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,459
it's more catchy.

57
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,629
- Do you think that's better?
- Yes.

Thanks to both of you,

60
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,100
I've never worked so hard
since I joined this company.

61
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,399
What?

62
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,399
Actually, thanks to you,

63
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,740
I got to enjoy what I really wanted to do.

64
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,680
By the way, I haven't been able to
visit Honggeumdang lately.

65

I'm craving their chocolate.

66
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,379
What about our chocolate?

67
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,750
Of course, our chocolate is the best.

68
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,720
This is good, but that is also good.

69
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,730
By the way, I always meant to ask you.

70
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,290
How did you get to know Mr. Hong?

71
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,060
Did you think it was a watch store
like me?

72
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,899
No.

73
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,480
Well, it's very popular
among chocolate fans.

74
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,949
- I see.
- Yes.

75
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,319
Were you an old customer?

76
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,459
Still, to see you
staying very close to Mr. Hong,

77
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,759
maybe we still have hope.

78
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,230
Hope?

79
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,769
No?

80
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,870
Then...

81
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,069
will we finally become close
after the pop-up store?

82
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,639
Then ask him
to join the next year's pop-up store.

83
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:12,879
- The next year's pop-up store?
- Yes.

84
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,310
Right. We have each other.

85
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,579
What's worrying you?

86
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,480
- I'm in. I need all of you.
- Yes. It's me, Jeremy.

87

We don't have much time.
Let's get back to work.

88
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,100
Tasting isn't easy.

89
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,339
You should try it too as you make it.

90
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,699
What for?

91
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,470
It's all on your checklist.

92
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,410
When you were on the team,

93
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,079
did you mostly study
the machine combinations?

94
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,420
- Yes.
- I see.

95
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,420
- Why do you ask?
- What?

96
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:55,790
No reason.

97
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,589
You expected me to be
a talented technician,

98
00:06:58,589 --> 00:06:59,819
but am I not meeting your expectations?

99
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:02,259
What?

100
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,629
No, why do you say that?

101
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,470
I boasted that I'd make my own chocolate,

102
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,000
but I kept messing up,

103
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,370
and I even tried to rely on Honggeumdang.

104
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,470
That's who I really am.

105
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,240
That's why you're crossing out everything
and getting on my nerves.

106
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,509
No.

107
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,949
I was only recording them
for a consistent recipe.

108
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,649
I'm still getting to know you.

109
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,120
That was the only reason I asked you.
Why are you talking like that?

110
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,019
Do you want to hear more
while you're at it?

111
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:36,389
I didn't join this because I was confident
about making chocolate.

112
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,800
But because I hated everyone.

113
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,069
There will be no seniors or managers
to interfere with my chocolate.

114
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,470
And no one to play
the lousy TF Team manager.

115
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:47,000
Play the manager?

116
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,610
I never evaluated your chocolate.

117
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,779
Well, I didn't...

118
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,910
know how stressed you were.

119
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,250
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:58,449 --> 00:07:59,819
Let's talk it over.

121
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,649
Pretending to be all nice
when I'm telling you straight up.

122
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,459
Are you doing that on purpose?

123
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,290
- What?
- Seul Gi.

124
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,660
That's enough.

125
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,360
Girls. Why don't we go home for now...

126
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,100
and go head-to-head big time tomorrow?

127
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:16,170
Even though the sampling event was
advanced,

128
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,500
and we had to start from scratch,
I thought we were doing just fine.

129
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,439
I was certain we'd make great chocolate.

130
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,779
No one evaluated you.

131
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,550
Yet you continued to doubt yourself.

132
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,920
But if making chocolate is too tough
and only stresses you,

133
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:33,649
why are you doing this?

134
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,120
Chocolate is reality.

135
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,389
Why do you talk like it's some fairy tale?

136
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,759
What...

137
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,399
Hey.

138
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,269
If you stopped someone from leaving,
face the reality.

139
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,269
Stop pretending to be kind.

140
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,080
Stopped you from leaving?

141
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,379
Pretending?

142
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,049
Well...

143
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,019
Hyun Nam!

144
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,919
Hyun Nam!

145
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:11,460
Hyun Nam.

146
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,519
Hyun Nam!

147
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,659
Hyun Nam, wait up.

148
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,230
Let's talk some more.

149
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:21,700
Wait.

150
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,500
Hey.

151
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,500
Am I seeing things?

152
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,710
What's he doing here?

153
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,009
Let's eat.

154
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,990
Kyung Sik. You sounded so serious
when you asked us to eat.

155
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,559
I thought you'd treat us to beef.

156
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,679
Shall we have some chocolate?

157
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,519
Chocolate is the best kind of dessert.

158
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,379
Chocolate tastes the best...

159
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:45,019
after witnessing a fight.

160
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,590
Wait. Why does this taste different?

161
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,929
The umami from the anchovy broth.

162
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,970
That accentuated
the sweetness of the chocolate.

163
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,799
Did my taste buds
just have a training session?

164
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,070
Nice one, Kyung Sik.

165
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,639
When cooking curry
with a rich, deep flavor,

166
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:13,879
you add meat and vegetables
to anchovy broth,

167
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,679
and at the very end,
you add a piece of dark chocolate.

168
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:18,950
It's the same principle.

169
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,190
They're so different,
but they go well together.

170
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,820
Two similar components...

171
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,360
often clash.

172
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:30,559
Like how two sour flavors
cancel each other out.

173
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,750
Is there still time?

174
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,460
What? Time for what?

175
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,929
I'd like to make it too.

176
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,669
Chocolate that'll be
unfamiliar and cumbersome to me.

177
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,940
What?

178
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,309
I'm not sure, but...

179
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,679
if we make it together,

180
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,179
I have a feeling...

181
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,889
the warmth in the chocolate
will bring the world together.

182
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,830
You want to work with us?

183
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:39,159
Seriously, Kyung Sik?

184
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,399
I knew this would happen.

185
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,500
I just love you so much.

186
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,000
I got squashed
between the two arguing whales.

187
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,870
But I'm Jeremy, you know.

188
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:51,809
Kyung Sik.

189
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,350
- That's enough.
- Okay.

190
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,220
My word.
It's the first tour of the workshop...

191
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,389
you never showed anyone.

192
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,789
To think that the amazing chocolate
was made here.

193
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,230
It's not that special.

194
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,669
This is fabulous.

195
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Mr. Hong.

196
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,289
Will you really collaborate with us?

197
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,259
Why? Should I not?

198
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,000
As you said,
it'll be unfamiliar and cumbersome.

199
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,100
Why did you change your mind?

200
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,080
Seul Gi came by a while ago...

201
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,909
with some chocolate she'd made.

202
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,779
- To ask you to work with us?
- No.

203
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:07,480
There was no intention behind the gift.

204
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:10,960
I see.

205
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,590
In this day and age,
to think someone...

206
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:17,799
was willing to spend time
and effort for someone else.

207
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,769
I found that uncomfortable
and flabbergasting.

208
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,870
I never thought that
I wanted to get one as a present.

209
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,169
How do you make chocolate...

210
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,379
that brings happiness to other people
with that attitude?

211
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,879
You don't know how to receive it yourself.

212
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,750
You won't even eat it...

213
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,720
or taste it to see
what kind of effort went into it.

214
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,259
She didn't accept
or understand how I felt.

215
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,460
Despite being rejected the first time,

216
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,299
she spent time and effort...

217
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:55,899
to make and give you chocolate,

218
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,240
and her heart moved you.

219
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,509
Seul Gi acts as if...

220
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,340
she never failed once in her life.

221
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,710
Even when she faces failure.

222
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,820
We're complete opposites.

223
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,570
(Honggeumdang,
Clock and watch repairs)

224
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,240
Watch carefully and see how it changes.

225
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,340
- Stay focused.
- Okay.

226
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,889
We must soon decide
what chocolate to make.

227
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:50,889
Yes.

228
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,889
My gosh.

229
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,600
Cut it evenly so it melts evenly.

230
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,299
Right.

231
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,279
It's just right.

232
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,100
Well done. We can get started.

233
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,299
We're here.

234
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:35,330
Welcome.

235
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,100
What shall we do?

236
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:49,450
Thanks.

237
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:36,130
I like this ordinary and odd chocolate.

238
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,759
I got paid on time,
but I felt bored every single day.

239
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,000
Time was slow,
so I bought and collected clothes.

240
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,470
But no one cared what I wore.

241
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:49,269
So I posted my outfit online
and people raved about it.

242
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,809
It felt great while it lasted,
but I felt empty when I was offline.

243
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:55,779
The day I tasted this chocolate,

244
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,549
I felt oddly solemn.

245
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,250
It was a small shock to my system.

246
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:04,759
Okay.

247
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,799
I like the salty chocolate.

248
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:18,970
When you share
a spoonful of salt with a friend,

249
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,640
that's when you see their true colors.

250
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,079
Now I have friends to eat chocolate with,

251
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,349
and that's the greatest gift to me.

252
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,509
The caramel chocolate?

253
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,680
There was this chocolate
that meant a great deal to me.

254
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:10,220
It was chocolate
I hoped would melt slowly.

255
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,440
There must be someone in this world...

256
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,269
who wishes for the chocolate
to melt slowly...

257
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,140
like me.

258
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,450
Hyun Nam.

259
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,549
"The real deal appears at the end."
Is that your strategy?

260
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,019
I...

261
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,589
don't have one yet.

262
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,849
The key is under the flower pot.

263
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:16,950
Goodnight.

264
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,730
What?

265
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,680
What?

266
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,490
Is this new?

267
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,720
Yes.

268
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,890
It tastes different.

269
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,559
It's savorier than before.

270
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,130
The savory flavors blend in.

271
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,160
The soy sauce stone.

272
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,859
It's also called the soy sauce salt.

273
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,240
You produced distinct salt chocolate.

274
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,309
- Yes.
- Do you like it?

275
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,839
- Yes.
- Yes.

276
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,910
This is so good.

277
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,880
You turned ordinary salt chocolate...

278
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,519
into wonderful chocolate.

279
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:58,019
You only changed the salt,

280
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:00,490
but the chocolate tastes richer.

281
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:04,390
It goes as well
as anchovy noodles and chocolate.

282
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,329
It's not just salty.

283
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:09,670
The balance between the salt
and chocolate is perfect.

284
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:12,569
That's all that matters.

285
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,809
It's our salt chocolate.

286
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,210
The meaning of salt chocolate
you told me about wasn't so bad.

287
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,720
Just say it was good.
Why do you have to say it wasn't so bad?

288
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,819
That's who I am.

289
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,359
I didn't mean what I said
about you holding me back.

290
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:40,559
To be honest, I was afraid
of coming up with my own chocolate.

291
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,829
For someone who showed off so much,
I didn't have much experience.

292
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,900
But when you said
I should give it a try without worries,

293
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,210
it was tempting.

294
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,910
I kept pushing you.

295
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:56,109
I didn't know you were in agony.

296
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,180
Sorry.

297
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,920
I put myself in agony.

298
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,619
And I like how you push me.

299
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,220
Your attitude toward the chocolate...

300
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
and people.

301
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:13,900
I think Mr. Hong is the same.

302
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,930
Why do you say that?

303
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,599
Actually, a few years ago,
I asked Mr. Hong to hire me.

304
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,599
But he turned me down immediately.

305
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,579
And he's not someone
who'd let anyone in his workshop.

306
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,009
But you opened that door.

307
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,880
Did I?

308
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:36,089
When he turned me down,
I only cared about my pride.

309
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,660
I didn't care to think
about what was on his mind.

310
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,359
But you...

311
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,799
always put others first,

312
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,829
and you approach them earnestly.

313
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,369
Should I say
it's the sweet person's courage?

314
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,880
Does that mean I can push you again?

315
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,809
What is it this time?

316
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,880
While making your own chocolate,

317
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,319
if you feel tired or lonely,

318
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,890
I'll be the first one to be there for you.

319
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,289
Sure. Do that for me.

320
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,390
Totally.

321
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:20,759
Should I bring more?

322
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,170
No, that will do.

323
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,279
It's new chocolate.

324
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,710
Yes.

325
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,609
Sir.

326
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,049
Do you not like the chocolate again?

327
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:22,789
It's been quite a long time...

328
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:26,400
since I visited here, right?

329
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:32,599
Did you...

330
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,809
visit here when this place was
a watch repair shop...

331
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,779
a long time ago?

332
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,619
To sit here...

333
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,690
and have a glass of soju...

334
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,190
with a piece of chocolate.

335
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,490
I liked those moments.

336
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,759
But...

337
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,960
even before I knew,

338
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,569
just like how the clocks here stopped,

339
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:05,900
your chocolate...

340
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,039
stopped as well.

341
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,740
Every time I opened the door,

342
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,009
I used to look forward to it.

343
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:30,730
Why are you crying here?

344
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:35,670
My mom and dad said...

345
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
they'd visit my grandma...

346
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,809
and come home soon.

347
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:55,519
(Mild Chocolate)

348
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:59,119
Melt it slowly in your mouth.

349
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,089
Then...

350
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,289
it will comfort your heart
sweetly and softly.

351
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,980
(Mild Chocolate)

352
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,480
Feeling better now?

353
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:26,880
When you miss your parents,

354
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,690
have this chocolate...

355
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,420
and recall the happy moments.

356
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,230
By the way,

357
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,200
who are you?

358
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,500
I make happiness.

359
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,339
Are you...

360
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,609
happy now?

361
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,430
When I struggled as a child,

362
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,900
someone gave me chocolate.

363
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,569
Every time I had a hard time,

364
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,309
I recalled the chocolate...

365
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:24,609
that comforted me.

366
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,609
To remember that taste,

367
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,549

00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,390
Perhaps,

369
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:43,690

370
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:47,160

Perhaps,

372
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,140

in your memory...

373
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,640
and missed what matters the most?

389
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:55,890
Hello.

390
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,960
The theme of the pop-up store menu is...

391
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,829
happiness you gift yourself.

392

I saw the proposal. I liked the idea.

393
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,640
Thank you.

394
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,299
We prepared chocolate we developed...

395
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:10,069
with Honggeumdang as per our contract.

396
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,380
I hope you enjoy it.

397
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:13,710
Thank you.

398
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,940
You must've been short on time
because the tasting was brought forward.

399
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,380
Good job preparing this assortment
in a short time.

400
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:49,809
- Thank you.
- You did well,

401
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,180
but we can't serve these
at the pop-up store.

402
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,819
Our chocolate's smoothness...

403
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:58,420
depends on a patented technique
that no other company can copy.

404
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:02,029
I liked the idea,
but your chocolate isn't smooth at all,

405
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:03,829
which is the strength of our product.

406
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,460
We wanted to express...

407
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,529
consolation and support
as a gift that brings happiness...

408
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:11,730
by using different flavors and textures.

409
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,200
We did our best.

- TF Team.
- Yes?

411
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,569
This isn't a contest.

412
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,240
Your efforts, the new idea,

413
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,410
and the meaning of chocolate...

414
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,809
should've been built upon the strength
of our company's products.

415
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,579
This is just Honggeumdang's chocolate.

416
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,450
You forgot the most important part
of a collaboration.

417
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,930
Excuse me, sir.

418
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:39,430
Could you give us another chance?

419
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,759
You skipped
what our products are known for...

420
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,369
and created unique flavors.

421
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:47,299
Who's to say these couldn't be sold
at a competitor's pop-up store?

422
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:49,440
This isn't good enough.

423
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,309
We don't have much time,

424
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:55,109
but we'll come up with a way
to solve the issue.

425
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,950
Thank you for your hard work.

426
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,259
I'd like us to talk a bit more.

427
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:10,259
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

428
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:19,900
I'd have told them to do better
if I'd known you'd come.

429
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,099
I apologize.

430
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,670
Realistically speaking,

431
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,210
the product doesn't have
a competitive edge.

432
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,279
The collaboration should've resulted in
a synergy to show for it.

433
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,079
If they resorted to
collaborating with someone,

434
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:36,390
it looks like
they really wanted to do well.

435
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:38,819
They're young and full of drive,

436
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,920
but they were rushed and they forgot
what was most important.

437
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:44,759
Drive.

438
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,329
They have what's needed the most.

439
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:50,430
It looks like our best bet
is to supply the pop-up store...

440
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,940
with our most popular products.

441
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:54,140
I apologize, sir.

442
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,609
This timeline is impossible.

443
00:33:59,609 --> 00:34:01,480
Other people
couldn't have made it this far.

444
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,150
Our chocolates were the best!

445
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:05,750
I wish I could go out and sell them.

446
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,819
We tried and that's good enough.

447
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,949
It's their loss if they can't handle it.

449
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,099
Yes.

450

I'm okay. I really am okay.

451
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,900
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

452

but because of me...

Isn't a pop-up store
a place to try new things?

457
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,789
Why am I thinking of rebuttals only now?

458
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:58,840
We got crushed.

459
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,170
You weren't there to see it.

460
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,480
Senior Executive Cha's comments
hurt like an intramuscular injection.

461
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,610
It aches even more now.

462
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:10,010

00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:23,710
Have you been well?

548
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,349
Kyung Sik.

549
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,190
All of you are here now.

550
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,059
Why did you make these chocolates again?

551
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:44,130
Try them again.

552
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,239
Is this really the chocolate we made?

553
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:24,510
The very chocolate that we made.

554
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:27,579
Just as it was.

555
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,449
What do you think?

556
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,119
I think it's similar to the previous one.

557
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,369
In order for our chocolate...

558
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:52,769
to meet a lot of people in the world,

559
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:56,840
it's also important that
we make delicious chocolate.

560
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,780
But shouldn't we try to understand
how people feel...

561
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,909
when they buy the chocolate?

562
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,320
Shouldn't we know...

563
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,389
how they feel?

564
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,119
Now I see that...

565
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,559
what Senior Executive Cha said was right.

566
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,829
I felt like the chocolate
we'd worked hard to make...

567
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,699
was belittled,

568
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,269
so I only resented him,
and I didn't even want to listen to him.

569
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:34,940
We felt wronged and angry that day,
thinking our intention was misunderstood.

570
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:36,610
Right.

571
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:40,820
I think I was the angriest one
among us that day.

572
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,190
But I was still happy.

573
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,360
I mean, it was a shame, and I was sad.

574
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,130
But I was happy that we were together.

575
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:53,960
I was happy too.

576
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:10,250
It's so good.

577
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:14,550
I feel like
I can solve all the questions now.

578
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,920
The faces that I imagined...

579
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,320
whenever I made chocolate.

580
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,159
That day, it was different.

581
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:44,480
Hello.

582
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,159
Was the tasting...

583
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,699
the end of our chocolate?

584
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,409
My resignation has been approved.

585
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:23,650
Good for you.

586
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,760
You won't have to worry about losing money
even if we fail.

587
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,260
You just have to...

588
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:33,760
make awesome chocolate
that you would approve of, once again.

589
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:37,329
And I still need you desperately.

590
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:43,239
You're persistent.

591
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:46,679
We've waited, but none of them said
we should keep trying...

592
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,309
to make perfect chocolate.

593
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:50,980
In this harsh world,
only complete output is accepted.

594
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,119
We can't just sit still
just because they haven't said anything.

595
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,320
We can't
since we know that it was incomplete.

596
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,789
Let's make it complete.

597
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,139
I've been waiting.

598
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:16,639
Oh, yes!

599
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:45,630
I told you, didn't I?

600
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,769
That she'd only act up and end up failing.

601
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,309
Is she pretending she's okay?
Or is she simply tactless?

602
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,340
She seems even more excited lately.

603
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:57,780
You don't like...

604
00:47:58,449 --> 00:47:59,579
Joo Seul Gi, do you?

605
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:06,960
She gets carried away and is clueless.

606
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:09,389
She's a nuisance.

607
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,030
She is.

608
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:13,699
You worked with her
and now you see what we see.

609
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,670
But she's the type
to get cluelessly involved...

610
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:22,199
and rush over to help when someone
needs the help,

611
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,710
even if they dislike her.

612
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,280
Enough to be a nuisance.

613
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,579
So they don't feel lonely.

614
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,420
I hope you can be nicer to her
from now on.

615
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:22,630
Gosh.

616
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:24,130
Gosh.

617
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,579
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

618
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,010
Sir.

619
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:49,079
Today I prepared a new chocolate
I made with some friends.

620
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,860
Is it just one piece?

621
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:56,730
Yes.

622
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:30,489
It's marvelous.

623
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:47,610
(Honggeumdang)

624
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,650
There's no limit or boundary to chocolate.

625
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:04,429
The chocolate I tasted today
will be the starting point.

626
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,900
Why are you out here crying?

627
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:18,670
Melt it slowly in your mouth.

628
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,610
Then...

629
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:24,550
it will comfort your heart
sweetly and softly.

630
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,659
(Honggeumdang)

631
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,670
Mister.

632
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:53,840
Thank you.

633
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,449
I wish you good health.

634
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:19,969
Hot chocolate.

635
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,809
How lovely.

636
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,909
You can't sleep again?

637
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:37,050
Mr. Hong. Guess what?

638
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,159
The thing you're least good at
is making chocolate.

639
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:46,030
What does that mean?

640
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:48,659
There's something you're even better at...

641
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,800
than making chocolate.

642
00:53:56,769 --> 00:54:00,980
You read exactly how someone feels.

643
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,809
Do I?

644
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,590
Happiness to me...

645
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:13,389
I thought it was...

646
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:17,389
to be positive and to work hard...

647
00:54:17,389 --> 00:54:21,230
at what I wanted to do each day.

648
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,300
I never wanted
or dreamed of anything big,

649
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,469
and I thought I was living a decent life.

650
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,170
But I realized through this...

651
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:37,980
how my one-sided positive mode...

652
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:42,019
can exhaust and trouble my coworkers.

653
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:45,090
No.

654
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:48,389
How it can ruin your peace and quiet.

655
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:53,699
How it can hurt my friends.

656
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,300
I think differently.

657
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,969
Because you kept showing up,

658
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,409
for the first time,
I ate noodles with others.

659
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,150
I saw the time and process
I used to spend and do on my own...

660
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,090
could become a fond memory
when shared with others.

661
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:21,559
And...

662
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,960
I found younger friends
who love chocolate.

663
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,400
Thanks to people
who came into my life like a gift,

664
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,639
I completed the happiness
I can gift myself.

665
00:55:36,269 --> 00:55:38,340
The happiness you gift yourself...

666
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,480
made my time that had halted...

667
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,190
for a long time move once again.

668
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:02,960
Thanks to you.

669
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,710
Assistant Manager Oh.

670
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:20,320
Assistant Manager Yoon.

671
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,449
My manager.

672
00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:28,119
Section Chief Seo.

673
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:32,190
Have a nice day, Section Chief Seo.

674
00:56:34,699 --> 00:56:35,699
And...

675
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:38,869
at the very place where I felt the worst,

676
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:43,300
I found the courage
within myself to start over.

677
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:46,980
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

678
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,380
This is nice.

679
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:57,550
Seul Gi, Hyun Nam, Kyung Sik.
You all did really great.

680
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:01,119
This pop-up store business
was way harder than I thought.

681
00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:04,590
Word got out and the number of customers
doubled each day.

682
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:05,659
My gosh.

683
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:08,360
Seeing how our chocolate
made people happy...

684
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,530
made me so happy.

685
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:13,130
How do you think the company knew...

686
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,900
and told us to sell our new stuff
at the store?

687
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,170
It's a mystery.

688
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,409
I heard it was
the honorary chairman's idea.

689
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:22,980
Did word of the chocolate Seul Gi...

690
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,309
gave her teammates reach him?

691
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,650
Those people?

692
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,780
Who cares what happened?

693
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:32,119
Anyway, Kyung Sik.

694
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:36,159
You seemed to enjoy the attention
at the pop-up store.

695
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,400
I'm relieved it's all over.

696
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:50,739
Here.

697
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,710
Stop looking under the heavy flower pot.

698
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,179
Come whenever you want...

699
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:01,519
and make whatever chocolate you want.

700
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:08,389
Now I'm curious about what people like.

701
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,789
And I also try...

702
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,389
other people's chocolate.

703
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:17,500
You've changed so much.

704
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:20,769
Kyung Sik, don't change so fast.
It's not easy for us to get used to it.

705
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:22,900
Take it slow.

706
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,570
Right. Hyun Nam,
you shouldn't rush to open your store.

707
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,380
You should start from here.

708
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,880
Thank you, Mr. Hong.

709
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,050
Here.

710
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:41,889
Ta-da.

711
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:44,260
The chocolate cases...

712
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,360
completed with my sentiment.

713
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,559
- Nice.
- Cool.

714
00:58:47,559 --> 00:58:50,500
They not only protect the chocolate
from moisture and the weather,

715
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:52,900
but you can also smile with confidence...

716
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,639
after having chocolate.

717
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,280
- Kyung Sik.
- Yes.

718
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,679
Nice.

719
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,579
- Thank you.
- Seul Gi.

720
00:59:04,579 --> 00:59:05,909
Thank you.

721
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,349
Hyun Nam.

722
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:09,519
Thank you, Jeremy.

723
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,489
It even has my name on it.

724
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,289
Are you sure this is me?

725
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:16,929
All right.

726
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:18,059
Drum rolls.

727
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:19,929
Here it is.

728
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,300
The chocolate for this winter.

729
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:24,500
- Is this different?
- No.

730
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:25,900
They're the same.

731
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,469
When you include the season
in the name of the food,

732
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,909
should I say...

733
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:34,809
it makes me happier?

734
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,280
Winter shabu-shabu.

735
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:39,849
Summer watermelon?

736
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:43,150
- Autumn dumplings.
- Yes.

737
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:44,920
Spring chocolate.

738
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:47,090
Spring chocolate sounds exciting.

739
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,659
How about summer yangjangpi?

740
00:59:50,659 --> 00:59:52,329
Winter poo pad pong curry?

741
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,500
Spring tom yum goong.

742
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,300
Early winter squid sundae...

743
00:59:57,869 --> 00:59:59,869
- Does that work?
- Drink.

744
00:59:59,869 --> 01:00:00,940
Maybe?

745
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,239
A sweet and bitter piece in my life.

746
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:09,079
Goodbye, Honggeumdang.

747
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,980
My memories of Honggeumdang...

748
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,849
will melt away like chocolate.

749
01:00:17,789 --> 01:00:19,550
Instead of regretting...

750
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:21,389
- what melts away,
- It's snowing.

751
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:24,030
we will recall a piece
of happy memories...

752
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,429
and enjoy it.

753
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:28,000
(Honggeumdang)

754
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:30,099
Like a gift of chocolate for myself.

755
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:31,130
It's snowing.

756
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,230
And I will look forward...

757
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:37,070
to the kind of chocolate we make next...

758
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,909
as we interact with the world and change.

759
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:42,840
- It's snowing.
- It's snowing.
