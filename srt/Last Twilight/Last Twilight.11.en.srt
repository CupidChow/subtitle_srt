Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,923
I'm completely blind, aren't I, doctor?

5
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:24,880
My sole responsibility is to provide Day safety.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,645
Yet you put him at risk.

7
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:29,566
I'd like to quit.

8
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:33,480
It's time you find yourself a new book.

9
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:36,485
To me, he isn't just a caretaker.

10
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:38,111
He's more.

11
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:42,945
The restaurant I work for is looking for a cook.

12
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:43,948
You should apply.

13
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:47,280
If you had taken care of your brother well enough, he wouldn't be like this.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,196
I'm sorry…

15
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:49,880
(...that I’m incapable of taking care of him.)

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,727
I forgive you.

17
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:52,664
For everything.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,928
It's Christmas next week.

19
00:00:56,186 --> 00:01:00,000
It’d be so nice if my boyfriend was there to support me.

20
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,209
Day.

21
00:01:03,758 --> 00:01:05,411
The hospital called.

22
00:01:05,617 --> 00:01:07,130
We got the eye donation.

23
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:04,237
I’ll be right back.

24
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,424
It’s going to be okay. Mrs. Mhon.

25
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,360
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

26
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:47,235
(“Men buy things all ready made at the shops.”)

27
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:51,169
(“But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship.”)

28
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:55,399
(“And so men have no friends anymore,” said the fox.)

29
00:03:55,399 --> 00:04:00,415
("What must I do if I want a friend?" asked the little prince.)

30
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:04,507
(“Tame me,” replied the fox.)

31
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:10,187
("You must be very patient.)

32
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:13,634
(First, you will sit down at a little distance from me and say nothing.)

33
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:15,377
(I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye.)

34
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:20,026
(But you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . .")

35
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:24,307
("It’d have been better to come back at the same hour.")

36
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:27,555
(“If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon,)

37
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:29,972
(then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy.”)

38
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:34,624
(“At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about.”)

39
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:38,758
(“I shall show you how happy I am!”)

40
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:39,493
Day.

41
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:43,200
Day, it’s your mom here.

42
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:44,929
I’m here too.

43
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,566
Hey.

44
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,895
It’s me, Day.

45
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:51,424
How are you feeling?

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,635
I’m sleepy, itchy, and hungry.

47
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:58,723
Everything altogether, Mom.

48
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:01,114
Be a bit more patient.

49
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:04,360
If everything goes as planned, we can remove the eye pads tomorrow.

50
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:11,322
Hey, I read somewhere that folks who have undergone surgery should avoid using body force.

51
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,710
Pushing farts out is included.

52
00:05:15,342 --> 00:05:18,000
I’m not nasty like you, Night.

53
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,095
Excuse me.

54
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:25,627
The patient’s family is asked to speak with the doctor regarding the recovery process.

55
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:26,402
Of course.

56
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:28,548
I’ll be right back.

57
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:30,812
Hey.

58
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:32,384
Don’t push farts out. Got it?

59
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:33,588
Jackass.

60
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,070
Mom?

61
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,412
What did you forget?

62
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:55,833
She forgot to lock the door and a burglar just broke in.

63
00:05:56,682 --> 00:05:58,021
Phi Mhok.

64
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:02,732
How are you feeling?

65
00:06:03,277 --> 00:06:04,546
I'm feeling better.

66
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,080
I waited until Mrs. Mhon left to come in.

67
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:13,546
Mhm.

68
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:15,440
Hey.

69
00:06:16,072 --> 00:06:19,382
Did Mom say anything to you after that night?

70
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:22,467
No.

71
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,829
If she was scary before, she's even scarier now.

72
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,234
I think she's waiting till I can remove the eye pads.

73
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:39,094
Things should get easier if I can see again.

74
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:48,590
Don't you think the problem is with me that I can't take care of you?

75
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:55,342
Your only problem is that

76
00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:58,347
you haven't given me a Christmas present yet.

77
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,600
Don't even think I forgot.

78
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:04,527
I didn't forget.

79
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:06,014
I brought it with me.

80
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:07,108
Wait here.

81
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:07,817
Mhm.

82
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:16,032
Here.

83
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,224
Belated Merry Christmas.

84
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,048
What is it?

85
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,169
Wear them during your recovery.

86
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,467
Thank you.

87
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,446
Of course.

88
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:38,104
Do you like them?

89
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:39,757
I do.

90
00:07:41,568 --> 00:07:42,898
Let me put them back for you.

91
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:46,565
Phi.

92
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:47,355
Hmm?

93
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:49,990
You’re not disappearing on me, are you?

94
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:51,742
Disappear what?

95
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:52,905
I'm sitting right here.

96
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:57,819
In all the movies featuring blind people I've watched,

97
00:07:58,473 --> 00:08:02,240
after the surgery, their lovers are all gone.

98
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:04,050
They have to look for them.

99
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:05,375
Come on.

100
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,560
What for?

101
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,557
I don't know.

102
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:13,426
If you ghost me, I won't look for you. I'm telling you.

103
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:15,577
Speak for yourself.

104
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:18,608
If you can see again, don't disappear on me.

105
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:19,922
I'm telling you.

106
00:08:21,262 --> 00:08:22,341
Of course, I will.

107
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:23,947
Fine. Do it.

108
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:25,183
I'll look for you.

109
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,000
Damn, I still miss you.

110
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:31,749
Then stay on.

111
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:33,719
But your mom will be back soon.

112
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:35,552
I'll step outside for now.

113
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,127
Phi.

114
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:41,840
Don't disappear.

115
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:43,696
Yes, dear.

116
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,292
I’ll be nearby.

117
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:47,154
Take some rest.

118
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:53,494
See you later.

119
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:54,512
Mhm.

120
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:56,771
Bye-bye.

121
00:08:56,923 --> 00:08:57,518
See you.

122
00:08:57,518 --> 00:08:58,117
Right.

123
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:17,393
Hello, Mrs. Mhon.

124
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
Night, get inside first.

125
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,000
I'll have a word with Mhok.

126
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:26,411
Alright.

127
00:09:47,144 --> 00:09:48,230
I'm sorry, ma'am.

128
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:52,184
I worked as a cook for the first time that night.

129
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:53,875
I just wanted Day to see it.

130
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:59,427
Do you think I'm a silly mom

131
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,402
who forces my son to date or not to date someone?

132
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,305
I'm just a mom who has a disabled son.

133
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:12,223
I want to find someone who can literally take care of him.

134
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,643
Day has never regarded himself as a normal person.

135
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,584
He always says, “Normal people don't grope to guide themselves.”

136
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:37,963
But deep inside, he's still the same Day

137
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:40,964
who wants to do things himself

138
00:10:40,964 --> 00:10:42,305
like a normal person.

139
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:47,030
And do you think Day is normal?

140
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:49,818
Day is normal.

141
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:51,874
He just can't see.

142
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:56,612
I just don't get it.

143
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,065
There are tons of people who can see.

144
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,440
Why Day?

145
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:12,910
Maybe because he’s able to see

146
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,333
something in me

147
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:19,943
that even I’m unable to see myself.

148
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:30,577
This is not the first time I've heard something so cheesy.

149
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:36,978
Yet it’s the first time that I actually believe it.

150
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:41,863
We are removing the eye pads tomorrow.

151
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:45,480
If you have time, come.

152
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:08,136
What did you say to Mom yesterday?

153
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:09,766
Why did she let you come?

154
00:12:14,696 --> 00:12:18,000
I threatened her that if she wouldn't let me come, I would disappear.

155
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:21,178
Seriously.

156
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,200
Hey, have you thought about the first image you want to see?

157
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,626
Whoa.

158
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:31,820
To be honest, I thought about it all night but I haven't been able to decide.

159
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:33,612
Just what I thought.

160
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:37,344
So I put up an album of pictures we took together before this.

161
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:38,135
You wanna see it?

162
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:38,976
Hey,

163
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:40,717
I'm buying this one.

164
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:42,728
Ahem.

165
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:46,824
I thought you would want to see the last image that you saw.

166
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:49,247
Hold on.

167
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,898
You’re talking about your damn face?

168
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:52,005
That's right.

169
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:55,952
Are you buying it?

170
00:12:58,406 --> 00:12:59,858
Wait. Are you calling yourself ‘Phi’?

171
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:01,761
I'm the real Phi here. You're the fake one.

172
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,571
Right, Day?

173
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:05,440
Stop it, you two.

174
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:08,213
Of course, Day wants to see his mom first.

175
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:09,238
Right, Day?

176
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:11,333
Yes, Mom.

177
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:16,034
Hello, Doctor.

178
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:17,148
Hi.

179
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,197
How are you feeling? Excited?

180
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:19,920
I am, doctor.

181
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,483
Let's get the eye pads off you.

182
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,639
Move to the side a little.

183
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,259
Slowly, Day.

184
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,547
Take it slow.

185
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:08,301
Day.

186
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:10,957
Can you see me?

187
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:16,471
Maybe you put too much makeup on. He's stunned by it.

188
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,590
Night. Stop teasing your brother.

189
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:19,667
Mom.

190
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:20,330
Hmm?

191
00:14:22,677 --> 00:14:23,635
I can't see.

192
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:26,862
Doctor,

193
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,338
I can't see anything.

194
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,444
Mom, get the doctor.

195
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:36,687
Day.

196
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:38,520
Doctor, what's happening?

197
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,600
Please calm down.

198
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,915
- Mom, get the doctor.
- Can you get me a wheelchair, please?

199
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:41,476
- Day.
- Day.

200
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:43,008
Mom, I can't see.

201
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,748
Day, calm down.

202
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,301
Could you excuse me for a bit?

203
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:49,281
Day, easy.

204
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:51,278
Phi Night.

205
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:52,569
Day, I’m here.

206
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:53,423
Phi Mhok.

207
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:54,615
Mom.

208
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,100
Doctor.

209
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,145
Get the doctor.

210
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,115
What's happening to me?

211
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,876
Day. Day.

212
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,572
Calm down, son. The doctor will be back soon.

213
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,120
The doctor diagnosed you with an eye infection.

214
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:57,513
The reason why the tissues don’t fuse.

215
00:16:01,332 --> 00:16:04,002
So this operation was done in vain.

216
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:09,297
It's okay, Day.

217
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:11,722
We will get the new eye donation.

218
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:26,091
Hey, don't worry.

219
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,306
This isn't about you anymore.

220
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:36,875
Can I please have some alone time?

221
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:43,874
Then I'll be waiting close by.

222
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,440
Can I please talk to him?

223
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:17,108
Look out for him.

224
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:43,551
I said I wanted to be alone.

225
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:48,265
You also said you didn't want me to disappear.

226
00:17:51,764 --> 00:17:52,613
Phi Mhok.

227
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:54,000
Hmm?

228
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:59,507
It's like I’d won the lottery jackpot.

229
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:06,170
The chance of being like this is less than 1%

230
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:32,801
If I had known, I would have bought you something else.

231
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:37,362
Hey, it's okay.

232
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,393
It's good this way.

233
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:53,449
See?

234
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,096
I get to use your present.

235
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:19,157
Day.

236
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:22,807
Day.

237
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:26,639
Don't overthink it, alright?

238
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:32,000
Remember when we first met?

239
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:35,301
Your vision wasn't much better than this.

240
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:48,000
I used to believe people were blind because they couldn't see things.

241
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:53,135
I just realized today that

242
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:57,181
true blindness is

243
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:03,197
the inability to see any hope.

244
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:16,375
Listen, Day.

245
00:20:17,772 --> 00:20:18,824
I'm not going anywhere.

246
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:22,696
And I'll never let go of your hand.

247
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:27,357
I promise.

248
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:51,999
Aon's friend owns a hotel in Songkhla.

249
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:54,561
And there's an event next week.

250
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,627
So he needs an extra cook for that.

251
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:57,411
Mom.

252
00:20:58,264 --> 00:21:01,848
Can I go with Phi Mhok?

253
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:27,914
MONTHS LATER

254
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:35,220
Hi, there.

255
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:38,660
Pretty girl.

256
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:41,181
Say hello to Uncle Mhok, Uncle Day, and the oldest, Uncle Night.

257
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:42,964
Hey.

258
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:44,495
The oldest uncle, huh?

259
00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:49,635
Are you awake?

260
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:51,635
Here. I made you Braised Black Chicken Soup.

261
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:52,437
Where should I put it?

262
00:21:53,543 --> 00:21:54,215
Thanks.

263
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:54,874
Of course.

264
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,783
What's her name?

265
00:22:01,748 --> 00:22:02,813
Me.

266
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,450
I nicknamed her after the character from Last Twilight.

267
00:22:06,331 --> 00:22:09,489
As for her full name, ask him.

268
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:14,304
The mom's name is Porjai.

269
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:15,668
So the daughter’s name is Poomjai.

270
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:18,617
‘Be proud,’ seriously?

271
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:21,141
A mom like me, is there anything to be proud of?

272
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,835
There is.

273
00:22:23,662 --> 00:22:27,370
You should be proud of yourself for carrying her alone for so long.

274
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,344
Sharp.

275
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:33,335
I think something weird is going on between these two.

276
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,815
What are you talking about?

277
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,778
Can I touch Me?

278
00:22:41,456 --> 00:22:42,298
Of course.

279
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:51,274
There, there.

280
00:22:51,274 --> 00:22:53,163
Don't cry, honey.

281
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:54,537
So?

282
00:22:56,013 --> 00:22:56,803
She's so soft.

283
00:22:57,725 --> 00:22:58,793
Do you want to hold her?

284
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,842
No, it's okay.

285
00:23:00,842 --> 00:23:02,080
Just try it, Day.

286
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,832
You can't be worse than Night.

287
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:05,743
Me cries every time he holds her.

288
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:08,578
Come on. Crying is babies’ nature.

289
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:09,842
Slowly.

290
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,905
Her head is over here.

291
00:23:13,905 --> 00:23:15,510
Then use your other hand.

292
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,764
Okay. That’s right.

293
00:23:17,977 --> 00:23:18,683
Just like that.

294
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:22,071
Oh, look.

295
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:23,687
You like Uncle Day, huh?

296
00:23:23,687 --> 00:23:24,879
Look at you sleeping peacefully.

297
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:26,044
See?

298
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,817
When Night holds you, you cry out loud.

299
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:31,514
Okay. Fine.

300
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:33,201
The baby hates me.

301
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:35,558
She isn’t crying at all.

302
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:39,348
Excuse me.

303
00:23:39,348 --> 00:23:41,331
It's time for the baby incubator.

304
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:42,813
Come on. Come to Mama.

305
00:23:55,164 --> 00:23:56,029
Bye-bye.

306
00:23:57,215 --> 00:23:58,666
I'm going with Porjai to drop Me off.

307
00:23:59,115 --> 00:23:59,829
Be right back.

308
00:24:00,704 --> 00:24:01,455
Okay.

309
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:05,338
Come on.

310
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,140
I think she likes you, Day.

311
00:24:14,641 --> 00:24:16,641
She slept tight in your hold.

312
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:18,624
Really?

313
00:24:20,704 --> 00:24:22,197
I want to see her face.

314
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:30,889
Day.

315
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:35,194
I'm fine.

316
00:24:36,496 --> 00:24:37,431
I'm okay.

317
00:24:39,322 --> 00:24:45,776
For a second there, I saw myself playing hide and seek with Me at home.

318
00:24:49,415 --> 00:24:49,982
Really?

319
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,052
Mhm.

320
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:53,684
Was I there too?

321
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,636
Of course, you were.

322
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:06,892
Come and eat your food.

323
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,519
Porjai has a baby now.

324
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:13,193
When will you two have a baby too?

325
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:16,884
Watch it. Little Day might talk back.

326
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:22,758
‘At least we are in the same tank. When will you two move in together?’

327
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:27,971
The fish is saying that or you are?

328
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:30,152
I don't know.

329
00:25:32,043 --> 00:25:35,845
All I know is that Porjai is moving out to live with her mom.

330
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:37,931
Just saying.

331
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:44,444
My mom just gave you the green light.

332
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:46,794
Planning to steal her son away already?

333
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:50,536
Or should I move in with you instead?

334
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:53,118
Come.

335
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:55,023
Then I'll go to live somewhere else.

336
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:00,032
Day,

337
00:26:00,954 --> 00:26:02,029
I'm serious.

338
00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:06,455
Otherwise, when will your mom know that I can take care of you?

339
00:26:12,353 --> 00:26:13,010
It's me.

340
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:17,798
Mom is waiting at the dining table.

341
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,250
I'm taking off then.

342
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,352
Day, I'll see you later.

343
00:26:25,612 --> 00:26:26,760
Hold on.

344
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,488
Mom asked you to join too.

345
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,431
Asked me?

346
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:37,472
I made baked spinach with cheese today.

347
00:26:39,018 --> 00:26:40,333
Let me get it for you.

348
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,687
Thank you.

349
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,639
Night, taste it.

350
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:47,254
Thank you, Mom.

351
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,238
It's my recipe.

352
00:27:00,465 --> 00:27:01,619
Try it, Mhok.

353
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,656
Of course.

354
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:23,405
So different from what we serve at the restaurant.

355
00:27:25,647 --> 00:27:27,032
Chef’s kiss, isn't it?

356
00:27:29,342 --> 00:27:35,029
When she stir-fries butter and flour, the heat is turned on low and she stirs it very quickly.

357
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:40,767
Have you been telling Mhok my food recipes?

358
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:50,023
Well…

359
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:59,708
Now that you have my recipes, don't ruin my reputation.

360
00:28:03,736 --> 00:28:04,814
Yes, ma'am.

361
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:10,655
Actually, I've been promoted to a sous chef now.

362
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,018
Wow.

363
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,975
Mom, Phi Mhok is so great that someone asked him to work with them.

364
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,098
Yeah?

365
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,583
Day, you're exaggerating.

366
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:25,125
Aon's friend owns a hotel in Songkhla.

367
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:27,683
And there's an event next week.

368
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,895
So he needs an extra cook for that.

369
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:33,807
Is it a big hotel?

370
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:35,288
In case I want to take a vacation there.

371
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:38,100
It's a 4-5 star hotel.

372
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:41,165
The guests are mostly foreigners.

373
00:28:45,368 --> 00:28:45,996
Mom.

374
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:50,323
Can I go with Phi Mhok?

375
00:28:52,735 --> 00:28:54,073
Day, I'll be there for work.

376
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:55,855
I don't want to bore you.

377
00:28:57,872 --> 00:29:02,023
After Aon’s wedding, I haven't got a chance to travel anywhere.

378
00:29:03,503 --> 00:29:04,550
I want to go.

379
00:29:05,283 --> 00:29:06,236
Please, Mom.

380
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:26,299
Then…

381
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,622
please take care of him, Mhok.

382
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:37,338
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:40,984
Thank you, Mom.

384
00:29:44,697 --> 00:29:46,342
Why did Mrs. Mhon come round so easily?

385
00:29:47,072 --> 00:29:48,008
Should I be worried?

386
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:54,095
It's not like she doesn't know that you two want to move out and live together.

387
00:29:54,765 --> 00:29:55,482
What?

388
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:00,905
So she wants this trip to be a tryout to see if you guys can live together.

389
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:06,965
But this time, without Mom and I helping.

390
00:30:09,136 --> 00:30:09,869
Alright.

391
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:11,585
No pressure.

392
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:19,600
Mom said being a caretaker and being a boyfriend are two different things.

393
00:30:20,135 --> 00:30:21,355
I don't get what she means.

394
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,143
(Hello, Mom.)

395
00:30:42,495 --> 00:30:43,844
(We’ve arrived at the hotel.)

396
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:47,922
(Phi Mhok told me it’s gorgeous like in Western movies.)

397
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:49,190
Welcome.

398
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:50,834
Hello.

399
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:51,751
Do you remember me, Day?

400
00:30:51,751 --> 00:30:53,412
- It’s Singha.
- Singha?

401
00:30:53,412 --> 00:30:54,055
Hello.

402
00:30:54,055 --> 00:30:54,620
Hi.

403
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,631
Hi, everyone.

404
00:30:56,727 --> 00:30:59,271
Let me introduce you to the head chef, Chef Tom.

405
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:02,617
A nice guy with a good sense of humor. A big eater, too.

406
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:04,016
If there's any problem, go to him.

407
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:04,975
Hello.

408
00:31:05,117 --> 00:31:07,106
Hi. Welcome.

409
00:31:07,106 --> 00:31:10,837
(Phi Mhok will start working tomorrow. So we have a free day today.)

410
00:31:10,837 --> 00:31:11,968
(The vibes are so great.)

411
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:13,334
(Wish I could take you here.)

412
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:14,184
Guys!

413
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:17,361
In 30 minutes, the first dish must be served.

414
00:31:18,304 --> 00:31:19,151
Yes, Chef.

415
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:20,115
Let me see.

416
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,236
Okay.

417
00:31:27,949 --> 00:31:31,887
(Phi Mhok will be in the kitchen from early in the morning until late at night.)

418
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:35,569
Your food is ready, sir.

419
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:38,145
Please leave it on the table.

420
00:31:38,145 --> 00:31:41,172
(And me? All I do is eat and sleep in the room.)

421
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,617
(It’s even more convenient than being at home.)

422
00:31:42,757 --> 00:31:44,426
- (Don’t worry about me, Mom.)
- Here you go.

423
00:31:44,426 --> 00:31:45,147
Thank you.

424
00:32:11,907 --> 00:32:13,576
Your dessert is being served.

425
00:32:14,378 --> 00:32:15,655
Hey, Phi Mhok.

426
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,040
You stink, Phi Mhok.

427
00:32:31,648 --> 00:32:33,553
I'm so tired today.

428
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:34,390
I want to recharge.

429
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,576
Can I?

430
00:32:35,765 --> 00:32:37,805
Take a shower first. Then you can recharge.

431
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:38,833
My co-workers will be here soon.

432
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:40,908
Phi Mhok.

433
00:32:41,948 --> 00:32:42,846
Phi Mhok.

434
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:44,126
Take a shower first.

435
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:48,133
Listen to me.

436
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:51,743
Once you take a shower, you can kiss me all you want.

437
00:32:52,868 --> 00:32:53,467
Okay.

438
00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:55,860
I'll be back to kiss you.

439
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,503
Mhm.

440
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,109
How about this?

441
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:12,793
Phi Mhok!

442
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:16,081
Stink, huh?

443
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:16,581
Do I?

444
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:17,877
Smell me.

445
00:33:23,442 --> 00:33:25,442
It tickles, Phi Mhok.

446
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:29,041
No energy, huh?

447
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:30,792
No energy?

448
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:42,495
A guest just got hit by a car.

449
00:33:42,674 --> 00:33:43,823
So damn ill-fated.

450
00:33:43,823 --> 00:33:44,584
Really?

451
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:47,148
Hey.

452
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,307
A Thai or a foreign guest?

453
00:33:49,866 --> 00:33:52,150
I don't know but the injury seemed severe.

454
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:23,733
Hey.

455
00:34:23,924 --> 00:34:25,101
Chai is here.

456
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,071
Day?

457
00:34:40,276 --> 00:34:43,184
A gift for an asshole.

458
00:34:58,567 --> 00:34:59,499
Why are you quiet?

459
00:35:02,297 --> 00:35:03,282
Are you mad?

460
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:07,024
I'm sorry.

461
00:35:08,077 --> 00:35:09,569
You did this to me first.

462
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:10,827
Don't you remember?

463
00:35:14,597 --> 00:35:15,760
Do you want me to stop being mad?

464
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,097
What must I do?

465
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:22,237
Come closer.

466
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,810
Why?

467
00:35:27,378 --> 00:35:28,077
Quickly.

468
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:40,804
Again?

469
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:03,422
Don’t.

470
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:04,172
Phi Mhok.

471
00:36:05,686 --> 00:36:07,686
Okay. Stop, stop.

472
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:08,933
Alright. I’m stopping.

473
00:36:17,852 --> 00:36:19,193
Come on. Stop.

474
00:36:19,931 --> 00:36:21,386
My cheeks are bruised.

475
00:36:21,386 --> 00:36:23,003
No, they're not.

476
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:26,251
Mhok.

477
00:36:26,342 --> 00:36:26,973
Here.

478
00:36:27,155 --> 00:36:28,244
Thank you.

479
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:29,191
Mhok.

480
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:30,273
Yes, Chef.

481
00:36:31,194 --> 00:36:32,079
Is the salad ready?

482
00:36:32,602 --> 00:36:33,535
Almost.

483
00:36:33,535 --> 00:36:34,419
Two more minutes, Chef.

484
00:36:34,419 --> 00:36:35,247
Faster.

485
00:36:35,247 --> 00:36:35,817
Yes, sir.

486
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,336
May I get the plates, please?

487
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:47,614
Mhok, I need one corn soup.

488
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:48,663
Sure.

489
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,062
Chef Tom.

490
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:51,899
Hmm?

491
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:54,644
A guest got hit by a car just now.

492
00:36:54,872 --> 00:36:55,801
So damn ill-fated.

493
00:36:55,892 --> 00:36:56,684
Really?

494
00:36:58,602 --> 00:36:59,286
Excuse me.

495
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,488
A Thai or a foreign guest?

496
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:04,178
I don't know but the injury seemed severe.

497
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:02,360
(Hello, Phi.)

498
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,843
(Sorry. I just went to the bathroom.)

499
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:05,989
(Why did you call?)

500
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:08,585
Nothing.

501
00:38:09,176 --> 00:38:10,295
I just missed you.

502
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:13,897
Hmm.

503
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:15,586
Get back to work.

504
00:38:15,975 --> 00:38:17,702
People might think you're slacking off.

505
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:19,969
Bye-bye.

506
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,947
We’re recruiting some chefs…

507
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:33,968
Hey.

508
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,964
Where have you been?

509
00:38:36,117 --> 00:38:37,708
The bathroom. I'm sorry, sir.

510
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:42,203
Hey, don't.

511
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:43,963
I already did it for you.

512
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:45,627
Go ahead and prepare the squids.

513
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:47,164
Thank you.

514
00:38:49,023 --> 00:38:49,947
I'll leave you to it then.

515
00:38:50,402 --> 00:38:51,183
Goodbye, sir.

516
00:38:51,684 --> 00:38:52,334
Thank you.

517
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:58,171
Chef.

518
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:00,920
Why was Singha here?

519
00:39:02,714 --> 00:39:04,237
Keep it up, Mhok.

520
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:07,289
Boss is keeping an eye on you.

521
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:10,601
Why?

522
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:15,141
He's opening a restaurant in the States.

523
00:39:15,246 --> 00:39:16,354
He's recruiting the staff for it.

524
00:39:22,331 --> 00:39:27,314
Don't you notice people are being extra hard-working?

525
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:30,010
Coming through.

526
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,369
Careful. It’s hot.

527
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:34,162
See?

528
00:39:37,117 --> 00:39:42,185
I think you should work hard and compete for it.

529
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:44,866
Keep fighting.

530
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:52,709
Day, I brought you a salad.

531
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:58,311
Day.

532
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:23,519
Excuse me.

533
00:40:23,837 --> 00:40:26,091
Have you seen a blind young man around here?

534
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,466
No, I haven't.

535
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:29,776
Thank you.

536
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:40,299
Excuse me, sir.

537
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:41,937
Have you seen a blind young man passing through this area?

538
00:40:41,937 --> 00:40:42,728
I haven't.

539
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:45,082
Thank you.

540
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:45,732
Sure.

541
00:40:58,258 --> 00:40:59,917
Where are you?

542
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:03,356
Where are you?

543
00:41:05,147 --> 00:41:07,147
I’m hearing your voice.

544
00:41:07,863 --> 00:41:08,915
There!

545
00:41:08,915 --> 00:41:10,863
I got you.

546
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:17,656
Boys, it's time to go.

547
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,015
Can we play again tomorrow?

548
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,520
Alright.

549
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,975
Bye-bye.

550
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:39,911
Gotcha!

551
00:41:42,998 --> 00:41:44,328
Did you just get off work?

552
00:41:44,328 --> 00:41:44,998
Mhm.

553
00:41:48,102 --> 00:41:49,897
Did you come here all by yourself?

554
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:52,790
No. I actually had a helper.

555
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,308
I wanted it to be a surprise at first.

556
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,038
What is it?

557
00:41:58,197 --> 00:41:58,833
Here.

558
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:02,565
Ta-da.

559
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:06,684
Hey, when did you get it?

560
00:42:07,905 --> 00:42:09,495
If I'm to be with you,

561
00:42:10,018 --> 00:42:11,574
I need to be able to take care of myself.

562
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,564
Am I causing you trouble?

563
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:19,771
No.

564
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:24,657
Even if I have you, Night, and Mom,

565
00:42:25,488 --> 00:42:27,488
it doesn't mean everyone can be with me all the time.

566
00:42:28,915 --> 00:42:31,983
I even think it's already too late to start using it now.

567
00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:40,483
That's good.

568
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:45,203
Tell you what.

569
00:42:46,746 --> 00:42:48,001
With this walking stick,

570
00:42:50,637 --> 00:42:57,905
it's like I'm hanging a sign around my neck that says, “Hello world. I’m blind.”

571
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:01,349
Everyone is worried when they see me.

572
00:43:02,495 --> 00:43:03,591
I don't blame them though.

573
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,245
They're not used to it yet.

574
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,124
That's why you didn't use it before.

575
00:43:15,702 --> 00:43:18,661
Then it turns out

576
00:43:19,911 --> 00:43:25,565
I want to walk myself, but I'm also afraid of appearing rude if I don't accept their help.

577
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:28,359
I don’t know what to do.

578
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,649
Let me know what you want me to do.

579
00:43:39,872 --> 00:43:41,684
Hey, you don’t have to worry about it.

580
00:43:42,521 --> 00:43:45,544
It's only you who doesn't feel pity for me like other people.

581
00:44:02,899 --> 00:44:03,563
Day.

582
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:04,818
Hmm?

583
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:12,604
Singha is looking for chefs for his new restaurant.

584
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:15,440
The result will come out after this job.

585
00:44:17,043 --> 00:44:18,057
Whoa.

586
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:21,029
It's your golden opportunity.

587
00:44:21,991 --> 00:44:25,014
Chef Mhon's major student must not ruin her reputation.

588
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:25,891
Got it?

589
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:37,221
But the resort I'm talking about is in Hawaii.

590
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:44,115
Hey.

591
00:44:45,124 --> 00:44:47,952
That just doubled your luck.

592
00:44:49,006 --> 00:44:50,438
Go back and rest.

593
00:44:51,245 --> 00:44:53,518
So tomorrow you have all the energy to show off your skills.

594
00:44:56,685 --> 00:44:57,952
Do you really want me to go?

595
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:00,662
Why not?

596
00:45:01,814 --> 00:45:05,132
What's bad about having a boyfriend who works abroad?

597
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:06,993
Right?

598
00:45:21,503 --> 00:45:22,264
Well.

599
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:25,571
Do you want to go abroad with me?

600
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:34,666
Day.

601
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:36,234
Hmm?

602
00:45:37,921 --> 00:45:40,739
The result came out.

603
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:42,572
Yeah?

604
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:44,757
Are you recruited?

605
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:08,393
Cheers!

606
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:14,964
Let’s dance.

607
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:24,937
Cheers.

608
00:46:27,229 --> 00:46:28,398
Day, can you drink?

609
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:29,779
I can.

610
00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:30,570
Cheers.

611
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,265
Drink up.

612
00:46:45,325 --> 00:46:49,195
Alright. Everyone, listen up.

613
00:46:49,195 --> 00:46:54,514
Our boss here is awarding this prize to the dancer he likes the most tonight.

614
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:55,492
Thank you, sir.

615
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:07,785
If you're going to dance this hard, you might as well get this, Day.

616
00:47:08,979 --> 00:47:11,305
Whoo-hoo!

617
00:47:14,663 --> 00:47:17,197
Bottoms up.

618
00:47:19,656 --> 00:47:21,211
Thank you so much.

619
00:47:21,576 --> 00:47:23,279
Everybody, cheers.

620
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,917
And I thought you were taking me to the real Hawaii.

621
00:47:31,908 --> 00:47:36,260
It's not even the real Hawaii, yet you danced your ass off till you got money.

622
00:47:37,302 --> 00:47:38,273
You’re really something.

623
00:47:38,867 --> 00:47:39,896
What?

624
00:47:40,393 --> 00:47:43,313
He gave me the prize because he felt pity for me.

625
00:47:57,931 --> 00:47:58,598
Day.

626
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:00,420
Hmm?

627
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,724
The result came out.

628
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:06,694
Yeah?

629
00:48:07,258 --> 00:48:08,949
Are you recruited?

630
00:48:11,352 --> 00:48:12,239
No.

631
00:48:13,071 --> 00:48:14,020
I’m not.

632
00:48:14,876 --> 00:48:16,045
He didn't pick me.

633
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:26,062
Was I the reason you couldn’t really commit to work?

634
00:48:26,062 --> 00:48:28,209
Hey, no.

635
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:29,815
It's not because of you.

636
00:48:29,815 --> 00:48:31,830
I'm just not qualified.

637
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,111
Everyone who worked with me is more experienced.

638
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:39,687
Don't worry about it.

639
00:48:44,139 --> 00:48:45,601
It's okay, Phi.

640
00:48:46,938 --> 00:48:47,775
You can try again.

641
00:48:52,883 --> 00:48:53,868
Forget about that.

642
00:48:54,865 --> 00:49:01,376
But I promise you I'll take you to Hawaii one day.

643
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:14,501
You promise.

644
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:28,813
I promise.

645
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,238
Phi Mhok, what are you doing?

646
00:49:37,444 --> 00:49:39,563
Let’s practice diving.

647
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:40,786
For our Hawaii trip.

648
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,317
What are you playing?

649
00:49:46,677 --> 00:49:50,343
What if I drowned?

650
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:53,835
You won't. I'm right here with you.

651
00:49:55,066 --> 00:49:55,860
Don't be afraid.

652
00:49:57,318 --> 00:49:58,104
Come on.

653
00:49:58,104 --> 00:49:59,555
Let's play.

654
00:49:59,555 --> 00:50:01,521
Phi Mhok.

655
00:50:03,147 --> 00:50:04,108
You won't drown.

656
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:04,910
I'm just right here.

657
00:50:05,423 --> 00:50:06,191
Come on.

658
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,008
Come on.

659
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:09,351
Take a dive.

660
00:50:09,351 --> 00:50:10,274
No.

661
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:10,903
Dive.

662
00:50:10,903 --> 00:50:12,276
No, I'm not diving.

663
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,678
Here you go!

664
00:50:14,643 --> 00:50:15,795
Are you starting a war?

665
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,916
Stop.

666
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:22,659
I surrender.

667
00:50:43,529 --> 00:50:44,401
Day.

668
00:50:55,984 --> 00:50:57,121
I love you so damn much.

669
00:50:58,162 --> 00:50:59,025
You know that?

670
00:51:03,918 --> 00:51:05,295
Out of nowhere just like that?

671
00:51:07,018 --> 00:51:08,454
I just wanted to say it.

672
00:51:09,016 --> 00:51:10,037
Just so you know.

673
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:20,367
Come closer.

674
00:51:31,616 --> 00:51:32,927
I…

675
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,995
love you so damn much as well.

676
00:52:14,973 --> 00:52:15,954
Hi, Mom.

677
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:17,992
Still up?

678
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:21,956
I'll go to bed soon.

679
00:52:25,788 --> 00:52:26,957
Be honest.

680
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:29,823
Are you up waiting for Day?

681
00:52:32,435 --> 00:52:33,757
Don’t worry about him.

682
00:52:33,757 --> 00:52:34,948
Mhok will take him home soon.

683
00:52:37,649 --> 00:52:40,536
I’m not worried about Day.

684
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:43,727
I’m more worried about Mhok.

685
00:52:46,402 --> 00:52:48,016
Why would you be worried about Mhok?

686
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:52,209
Oh, you guys are still up.

687
00:52:52,209 --> 00:52:53,723
Good evening. We're back.

688
00:52:53,723 --> 00:52:54,465
Hi.

689
00:52:55,122 --> 00:52:55,747
Day.

690
00:52:55,747 --> 00:52:56,914
I'm back.

691
00:52:56,914 --> 00:52:58,496
Day, did you have fun?

692
00:52:58,496 --> 00:52:59,676
I did, Mom.

693
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:01,212
Look at you all smiling.

694
00:53:01,809 --> 00:53:02,723
We're waiting for you here.

695
00:53:02,871 --> 00:53:04,135
Is that my gift?

696
00:53:04,135 --> 00:53:04,635
Let me see.

697
00:53:04,635 --> 00:53:05,494
Hey!

698
00:53:06,169 --> 00:53:07,147
You don't get one.

699
00:53:07,325 --> 00:53:08,347
It's for Mom only.

700
00:53:09,902 --> 00:53:12,792
Mom, it's the famous Crispy Noodles.

701
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:13,856
Let's see.

702
00:53:14,355 --> 00:53:16,060
I also grabbed you some salted eggs.

703
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,151
Thank you.

704
00:53:17,342 --> 00:53:18,705
You can have the salted eggs, Night.

705
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,403
This one is also well known.

706
00:53:24,015 --> 00:53:26,712
Day danced so hard he got a money garland.

707
00:53:26,941 --> 00:53:28,704
- Seriously?
- Phi Mhok.

708
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,453
You said you wouldn't tell.

709
00:53:31,453 --> 00:53:32,280
Money garland, huh?

710
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,221
Hey.

711
00:53:33,353 --> 00:53:34,284
Show me the dance.

712
00:53:35,075 --> 00:53:37,342
Show them. Come on.

713
00:53:38,391 --> 00:53:40,866
Day, come on. I want to see.

714
00:53:41,612 --> 00:53:42,530
Night!

715
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:43,819
I'm not doing it.

716
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:46,975
Day.

717
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:48,223
Let's get the backpack off you first.

718
00:53:48,223 --> 00:53:49,689
I'm too lazy.

719
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:51,078
Backpack off first.

720
00:53:53,103 --> 00:53:53,885
Come here.

721
00:54:02,552 --> 00:54:03,414
What are you looking for?

722
00:54:03,712 --> 00:54:04,654
My phone charger.

723
00:54:04,862 --> 00:54:05,742
Is it with you?

724
00:54:06,606 --> 00:54:08,606
It's either with you or me.

725
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:11,151
It's not with me.

726
00:54:11,938 --> 00:54:13,077
Maybe it's in your bag.

727
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:15,059
Let me check.

728
00:54:27,478 --> 00:54:28,442
Day, I'll be right back.

729
00:54:28,442 --> 00:54:29,478
Porjai is calling.

730
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:30,566
Yeah.

731
00:54:52,742 --> 00:54:53,555
What is this?

732
00:55:04,591 --> 00:55:06,710
(A permanent employment contract)

733
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:10,109
(Mr. Methas Pankhamdee)

734
00:55:13,348 --> 00:55:15,081
Thank you so much for choosing me.

735
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:18,955
But I'm really not up for it.

736
00:55:21,036 --> 00:55:22,710
I don't want to leave Day here by himself.

737
00:55:23,143 --> 00:55:24,193
I hope you understand.

738
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:30,886
Goodbye, sir.

739
00:55:41,279 --> 00:55:42,295
Hey.

740
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,199
So how was this trip? Fun?

741
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,277
You should ask your brother.

742
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:49,595
But as for me,

743
00:55:50,485 --> 00:55:51,635
I had a really good time.

744
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:53,442
That's good.

745
00:55:53,561 --> 00:55:54,541
Welcome.

746
00:55:55,058 --> 00:55:56,046
Thank you.

747
00:55:56,877 --> 00:55:57,889
Phi Mhok.

748
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:02,488
Hey, Day.

749
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,674
I was about to go upstairs.

750
00:56:05,834 --> 00:56:06,808
Sit with us.

751
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,098
Day.

752
00:56:19,903 --> 00:56:21,962
Read this document to me.

753
00:56:31,122 --> 00:56:31,940
Why quiet now?

754
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:38,291
Hey, Day.

755
00:56:39,092 --> 00:56:40,093
What's going on?

756
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:45,469
Someone asked him to work abroad.

757
00:56:45,993 --> 00:56:49,180
But he lied to me saying he didn't qualify for the job.

758
00:56:55,652 --> 00:56:56,788
Why, Mhok?

759
00:56:57,652 --> 00:56:58,605
Because of Day?

760
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:00,118
Don't worry about him.

761
00:57:00,118 --> 00:57:01,100
I can take care of him for you.

762
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:05,980
You won't be with him all the time.

763
00:57:08,352 --> 00:57:12,133
What if something happens to him and I'm not here to help?

764
00:57:15,388 --> 00:57:16,144
Hey.

765
00:57:16,649 --> 00:57:17,893
You're overthinking it.

766
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:18,885
Nothing will happen.

767
00:57:20,733 --> 00:57:21,664
No.

768
00:57:25,171 --> 00:57:28,388
No one knows what the future holds.

769
00:57:38,175 --> 00:57:42,164
My big sister killed herself because I didn't answer her call.

770
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,674
I once lost someone I loved so much…

771
00:57:50,674 --> 00:57:53,437
Porjai! What happened to my sister?

772
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:56,036
…because I thought nothing would happen. Every day was the same.

773
00:58:04,409 --> 00:58:06,409
So I will not repeat the same mistake.

774
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:11,519
In the end,

775
00:58:13,597 --> 00:58:16,643
you're one of those people who feel pity for me.

776
00:58:19,297 --> 00:58:20,295
Come on, Day.

777
00:58:22,016 --> 00:58:23,997
I just don't want to leave you.

778
00:58:24,196 --> 00:58:24,940
Is that so wrong?

779
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,374
Then why did you lie to me?

780
00:58:28,983 --> 00:58:34,723
Were you afraid I would get upset to know I'm the one holding you back?

781
00:58:35,473 --> 00:58:36,216
Right?

782
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,924
Day. It's not like that.

783
00:58:42,078 --> 00:58:43,209
One question for you.

784
00:58:46,088 --> 00:58:49,895
If I wasn't blind, would you lie to me?

785
00:58:53,046 --> 00:58:54,838
Day, how about you calm…

786
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:55,429
Save it, Night.

787
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:05,204
Let's break up.

788
00:59:20,989 --> 00:59:21,744
Day.

789
00:59:22,545 --> 00:59:23,523
Don't do this.

790
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:25,201
Don't do this.

791
00:59:26,232 --> 00:59:27,045
Phi Mhok.

792
00:59:34,829 --> 00:59:36,829
If you really don't feel pity for me,

793
00:59:41,114 --> 00:59:43,440
please do as I ask one last time.

794
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,313
Phi Mhok.

795
01:00:18,134 --> 01:00:18,890
Fine.

796
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,794
If that's what you want.

797
01:00:44,456 --> 01:00:46,860
Day, what the heck did you just do?

798
01:00:51,463 --> 01:00:52,246
Mom.

799
01:01:18,103 --> 01:01:20,637
Mom, did I do the right thing?

800
01:01:29,558 --> 01:01:32,300
I’m not worried about Day.

801
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:35,660
I’m more worried about Mhok.

802
01:01:38,186 --> 01:01:39,860
Why would you be worried about Mhok?

803
01:01:42,455 --> 01:01:44,069
Night, listen to me.

804
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:48,803
Day is used to living by himself.

805
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:55,915
But Mhok has never left Day alone without us helping to take care of him.

806
01:01:56,904 --> 01:02:00,121
You think they will be okay on their own?

807
01:02:02,448 --> 01:02:03,464
Mom.

808
01:02:04,448 --> 01:02:07,272
But Day can take care of himself just fine now.

809
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:17,392
Concerns happen for no reason.

810
01:02:18,937 --> 01:02:22,866
Back when he was just a caretaker, the two of them had some space.

811
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:28,882
But when they’re in a relationship, closeness comes into the picture.

812
01:02:29,828 --> 01:02:32,986
The number of concerns will continue to rise,

813
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:36,614
as well as silliness and many other things tangled up together.

814
01:02:38,264 --> 01:02:43,648
I don’t know if Mhok will be okay.

815
01:03:01,082 --> 01:03:08,187
But I’m still hoping they will hold hands and get through this feeling together.

816
01:03:09,795 --> 01:03:11,617
It might not be today.

817
01:03:12,587 --> 01:03:13,577
But one day,

818
01:03:14,706 --> 01:03:18,743
if they still love each other, they will eventually get past it.

819
01:03:19,765 --> 01:03:21,053
That’s what I believe.

820

Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

821
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:58,696
The inability to see might be a big deal.

822
01:03:59,141 --> 01:04:02,031
But it’s a big deal you must be able to deal with

823
01:04:02,957 --> 01:04:04,749
in order to live on.

824
01:04:07,104 --> 01:04:15,753
The important thing is to see what is left for us throughout those times of difficulty.

825
01:04:21,164 --> 01:04:22,633
Once we've adjusted,

826
01:04:24,295 --> 01:04:26,934
everything will continue as usual.

827
01:04:28,336 --> 01:04:33,156
After the storm, you will not be the same person anymore.
