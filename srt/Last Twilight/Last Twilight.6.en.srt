Day.

5
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:21,440
Where have you been?

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,614
I asked, where the hell have you been?

7
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,641
Hey!

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,664
Who is he?

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,855
August.

10
00:00:26,515 --> 00:00:27,520
My badminton partner.

11
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:29,743
Find yourself a new partner.

12
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,870
I don't want to partner up with anyone else but you.

13
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:37,963
May I?

14
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:41,314
What if I make a mess in front of him?

15
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:42,646
You can practice.

16
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:43,744
Baby.

17
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:45,472
No matter how messily you eat, you're still cute.

18
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:46,640
Just eat.

19
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:52,499
Come with me.

20
00:00:58,448 --> 00:01:00,160
I felt like a heartbroken man.

21
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:02,764
Day.

22
00:01:03,017 --> 00:01:04,381
Actually, I…

23
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:10,253
Stunned, aren't you?

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,922
To know that I like August.

25
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:29,153
Day, it’s me.

26
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:55,320
Day, are you alright?

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,817
Phi.

28
00:02:02,741 --> 00:02:04,479
I have a terrible headache right now.

29
00:02:05,535 --> 00:02:07,760
You shouldn't have handed me that beer last night.

30
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:17,757
Give me your hand.

31
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:28,656
Hangover pill.

32
00:02:30,124 --> 00:02:30,773
Ah.

33
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:32,829
Thank you.

34
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:38,089
So, how did last night end?

35
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:41,844
The next thing I knew, it was already morning.

36
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:51,011
Stunned, aren't you?

37
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,696
To know that I like August.

38
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:01,327
Hey, don't you remember?

39
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:08,223
Uh…

40
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:11,050
Last night was…

41
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,873
Right!

42
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,462
I'm meeting Master Aon today.

43
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:41,555
I came to see Day.

44
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,120
About last night,

45
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,282
- have you…
- I haven't.

46
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,648
He might not be in a good mood though.

47
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:06,496
Something bad happened to him last night.

48
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:09,396
Yeah.

49
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,559
I get it.

50
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:29,238
Come in.

51
00:05:20,082 --> 00:05:22,082
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

52
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:23,843
Day is waiting inside.

53
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,502
Master Aon.

54
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:27,911
How have you been?

55
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,603
It's me.

56
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,758
August.

57
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:38,526
Sorry.

58
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,097
I'm expecting someone else today.

59
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:41,975
Can you come again some other day?

60
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:44,920
Day.

61
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:48,010
I came to apologize about last night.

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,823
I collapsed.

63
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:52,038
The coach sent me to the hospital.

64
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,275
That's why I didn't show up.

65
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:56,059
Are you okay?

66
00:05:57,112 --> 00:05:57,681
Yeah.

67
00:05:58,845 --> 00:05:59,873
It’s just a sprain.

68
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:01,007
I'll get better.

69
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:09,418
You should have called, actually.

70
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,699
I could have brought Day to visit.

71
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:14,146
I left my phone at the court.

72
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:16,705
Next time, I'll call.

73
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,763
Just forget it.

74
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,350
It's good you're okay.

75
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,386
By the way, I've got you something.

76
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,183
Pizza?

77
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:34,486
Yeah.

78
00:06:35,549 --> 00:06:38,891
A Hawaiian pizza with extra pineapples.

79
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:40,165
Just how you like it.

80
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,880
You still remember?

81
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,454
Yeah, I remember everything.

82
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:52,400
Do you know how to eat it without getting your hands messy?

83
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,288
How?

84
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:55,200
Here. Let me show you.

85
00:06:58,322 --> 00:06:59,643
Open your mouth.

86
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:01,680
Hey! It's okay.

87
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,973
- Just eat.
- I can eat it myself.

88
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,365
Take a bite.

89
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,713
Yes.

90
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:10,288
Cheese, pineapple, bacon.

91
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:13,462
I guess someone just ordered pizza.

92
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:15,901
Hey, Master Aon.

93
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:18,995
Hi. What's up?

94
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,000
Have a seat.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
My friend just brought pizza.

96
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,268
Eat with us.

97
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:24,026
Sure. I'm hungry.

98
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,376
Oh, almost forgot.

99
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:28,320
This is Aon.

100
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:30,000
He's from the Shining Society.

101
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,160
This is August.

102
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:34,401
The guy I told you about.

103
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:35,080
Hello.

104
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:37,274
Hello. How are you?

105
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:38,386
You remember him?

106
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,401
I do.

107
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:42,201
Did he tell you bad things about me?

108
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:47,709
He said you could read his mind.

109
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:51,640
I can tell that’s true since you ordered an easy meal for him to eat.

110
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:55,640
Come on, Master.

111
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,419
It’s Day we’re talking about.

112
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,249
He has eaten things more difficult to eat.

113
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:01,971
A glass of water is on your right.

114
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:07,640
Oh, do you remember the runner girl I met on Tinder?

115
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,274
I do, Master.

116
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:12,520
We're a thing now.

117
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,341
Really?

118
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:14,065
Really.

119
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:15,947
We just ran a marathon together.

120
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:17,858
Wow, Master.

121
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,048
I have no idea what I should be excited about first.

122
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:22,375
Hold on.

123
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:24,193
We can't see.

124
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:25,311
How could you run?

125
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,292
Oh, it's easy.

126
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,564
You just pair up with someone with good vision

127
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:30,954
so they can coach you along the path.

128
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:33,617
That's even more difficult.

129
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,000
How can we trust them?

130
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:41,945
Couples take time to learn to trust each other.

131
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,541
Running partners are the same.

132
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,000
You need lots of practice.

133
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:46,295
Look at me.

134
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:48,600
I practiced so much that I got myself a girlfriend.

135
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:53,852
Are you interested?

136
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:56,732
You've complained that your old clothes no longer fit you.

137
00:08:57,786 --> 00:08:58,740
Come on.

138
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:01,440
Clothes shrink when washed.

139
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:06,071
Day.

140
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:08,826
Let's go.

141
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,562
I can take you to run.

142
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,760
But you have to practice for competitions.

143
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:15,847
That's right.

144
00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:20,821
But I want to know if we are still in-sync.

145
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,339
Ahem.

146
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:32,152
Can I really eat this pizza?

147
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:33,801
Of course, you can.

148
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:36,535
It's here. Right in front of you.

149
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:40,777
It smells good.

150
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,036
Finish it all.

151
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:49,542
Wow, Day.

152
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:51,668
How long have you had them?

153
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,401
For this one, the sole is completely ripped.

154
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,734
You can’t wear it.

155
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:02,388
Can we fix it?

156
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,352
I need it tomorrow.

157
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,365
We can but it’s not gonna finish by tomorrow.

158
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:15,000
How about you go buy a new pair with me tomorrow?

159
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,202
I'll call Aon and postpone the appointment with him.

160
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:18,444
Okay?

161
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:21,410
Fine.

162
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:27,050
Phi.

163
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:28,350
Hmm?

164
00:10:29,514 --> 00:10:30,729
Can't we really fix it?

165
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:45,520
Your friend asked once and you said yes right away.

166
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:48,758
I'd asked you for ages but it never happened.

167
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:50,892
What's your mumbling about?

168
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:51,536
Huh?

169
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:53,198
Would you please clarify that?

170
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:54,127
I’d love to understand.

171
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:56,906
It's Day.

172
00:10:57,564 --> 00:10:58,932
His friend asked him to go running.

173
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:00,552
And he's so thrilled about it.

174
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,183
Hey.

175
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:05,279
He's going out to exercise.

176
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,293
That's a good thing.

177
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:10,410
Yeah, I guess it is.

178
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:12,902
Then why are you irritated?

179
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:16,396
Irritated?

180
00:11:16,396 --> 00:11:17,125
Yeah.

181
00:11:17,532 --> 00:11:19,127
I'm freaking not. I'm okay.

182
00:11:19,856 --> 00:11:20,924
You're reading me wrong.

183
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:23,628
Fine. You're not irritated.

184
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:28,905
So…is his big brother going too?

185
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:30,947
No.

186
00:11:32,086 --> 00:11:32,957
Why do you ask?

187
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:36,406
Do you think

188
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,676
this family is full of attractive people?

189
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:43,962
Well, well.

190
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:46,040
Now that you're single, you start looking, huh?

191
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,367
I'm not like you.

192
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:50,204
All you focus on is work.

193
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:51,293
Mr. Best Employee.

194
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:54,136
One day when Day gets married,

195
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,009
you’ve got to be the one giving him blessings on stage.

196
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:25,125
Day.

197
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,766
Wake up, Day.

198
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,121
Day, wake up.

199
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,460
Or you'll be late for the run.

200
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:38,548
What run?

201
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:40,396
Didn't you cancel it already?

202
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:41,772
No, I did not.

203
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:43,853
I just happened to find you a new pair of shoes.

204
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,998
I fixed it.

205
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:09,612
What is it?

206
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:12,647
Do you like it?

207
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,008
I do.

208
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:21,974
They might be old, but don't throw them away just yet.

209
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:25,200
How can I throw them away?

210
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:27,466
I love them so much.

211
00:13:46,104 --> 00:13:46,990
Oh.

212
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:03,246
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:15,039
Are you ready?

214
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:18,072
I am.

215
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:25,187
Day, you wanna eat anything?

216
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:26,910
I’ve brought you sandwiches.

217
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,680
You want a banana?

218
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,601
I'll peel it for you.

219
00:14:55,287 --> 00:14:57,287
Wait. Where were we the last time?

220
00:14:58,137 --> 00:15:00,881
What? You forgot where you left off?

221
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:07,513
Mee exposed herself to sunlight and became visible again.

222
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,558
That's right.

223
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:12,097
You're good.

224
00:15:12,437 --> 00:15:13,228
Of course.

225
00:15:14,178 --> 00:15:15,987
Mee exposed to sunlight…

226
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,912
Where is it?

227
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:21,940
I'm going to continue to the next page then.

228
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:23,426
Go on.

229
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:29,748
(After that, Mee got back to playing with her friends.)

230
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:33,670
(But deep down, she was still scared.)

231
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:37,226
(She's scared that her friends wouldn't welcome her the way they used to.)

232
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:38,977
Ahem.

233
00:15:38,977 --> 00:15:41,222
Guys, this is my girlfriend.

234
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,190
Her name is Pla.

235
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,446
The one I told you about.

236
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:47,275
Hi, guys. I'm Pla.

237
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:48,482
Or you can call me Phi Pla.

238
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:52,780
Have you heard that a couple will last long

239
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:54,693
if they have something that binds them together?

240
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:56,043
The same goes for running.

241
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:57,782
We got to have something that links us together.

242
00:15:58,478 --> 00:16:02,157
In our case, we use this small strap.

243
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,348
Let's hold it.

244
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:06,488
I prepared one too.

245
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:09,172
Hey!

246
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:11,528
Me too.

247
00:16:15,523 --> 00:16:16,256
Hey.

248
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,889
We share the exact same mind.

249
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,220
I also bought a headband.

250
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,595
We can use mine.

251
00:16:24,595 --> 00:16:26,575
And you can keep yours for the competitions.

252
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,928
These remind me of the old times.

253
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:39,579
Ahem.

254
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:41,271
Should we start, Aon?

255
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:46,048
Please remember that running is like being in a relationship.

256
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,072
If something happens, talk nicely to each other.

257
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:51,058
But if the other one doesn't listen, you can start a war.

258
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:53,734
Enough already.

259
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,359
Come on guys. Let's run.

260
00:16:56,251 --> 00:16:56,962
Come on up.

261
00:17:08,422 --> 00:17:09,554
Slow down a little.

262
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:13,269
It's too slow now.

263
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:15,054
Water!

264
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,717
Are you okay?

265
00:17:22,735 --> 00:17:23,696
I'm fine.

266
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:25,840
Okay.

267
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:27,415
Can we go on then?

268
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:31,028
Sorry, I didn't tell you which way to go.

269
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:40,540
Come on.

270
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:42,835
Let's go.

271
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:44,780
Three, two, go

272
00:17:54,939 --> 00:17:55,831
This is nice.

273
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:58,575
I haven't worked up a sweat in a long time.

274
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:00,746
Day, you wanna eat anything?

275
00:18:01,277 --> 00:18:02,260
I’ve brought you sandwiches.

276
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,121
You want a banana?

277
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:03,911
I'll peel it for you.

278
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:06,655
Sure.

279
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:19,914
Should I feed you too?

280
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,791
Are you crazy?

281
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:23,720
Thanks.

282
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:32,412
Hey.

283
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:33,532
Wait here.

284
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:35,213
I'll go buy some water.

285
00:18:35,893 --> 00:18:36,895
Please stay with him.

286
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:42,659
Phi.

287
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:43,798
Hmm?

288
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:44,999
What's up?

289
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,574
Is it just me or he’s being extra caring?

290
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:53,081
You're overthinking it.

291
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:55,704
He might still be guilty about the other day.

292
00:18:57,282 --> 00:18:58,014
That's right.

293
00:18:59,076 --> 00:18:59,767
You’ve got a point.

294
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:01,342
That's probably it.

295
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:04,914
No way.

296
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,796
He got up so early just to run with you.

297
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:11,011
He wouldn't do it unless he’d given you some kind of thought.

298
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,714
Really?

299
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,150
What do you think he's thinking?

300
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:19,146
How would I know?

301
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,940
If you want to know, ask him out.

302
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:24,584
Are you nuts?

303
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:26,385
I can't ask him out all of a sudden.

304
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,705
That's weird.

305
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:29,380
Nope.

306
00:19:34,764 --> 00:19:35,438
I'm back.

307
00:19:37,138 --> 00:19:37,702
Water.

308
00:19:40,571 --> 00:19:41,142
Thanks.

309
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:47,442
Sorry, I forgot to buy you one.

310
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:49,298
But you can take this.

311
00:19:49,298 --> 00:19:50,281
I'm running with Day anyway.

312
00:19:51,418 --> 00:19:51,970
Thanks.

313
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,864
Hey, are you free today?

314
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:55,264
Should we grab something to eat?

315
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:56,112
Sure we should.

316
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:02,404
Not thirsty.

317
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:06,663
Think about what you want to eat.

318
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,038
Phi.

319
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,173
You can go home first.

320
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:15,709
I'll ask him to take me home later.

321
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:19,191
Mhm.

322
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,718
Please take care of him.

323
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:22,897
Sure.

324
00:20:25,414 --> 00:20:26,102
Don't worry.

325
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:29,794
Should we ask Gee too?

326
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:32,362
She has practice.

327
00:20:33,318 --> 00:20:34,947
I don't think she's free.

328
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:42,851
Ouch.

329
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,751
Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Tense.

330
00:20:46,005 --> 00:20:48,980
I forgot you just went out running like a teenager.

331
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:51,633
Can you be gentle?

332
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,523
I think…

333
00:20:55,373 --> 00:20:57,449
you must love this job very much.

334
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:00,557
Look at me.

335
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:01,681
How can I love this job?

336
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:03,609
Well,

337
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:08,100
you managed to get up so early to take him out running.

338
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,985
You’re never a morning person.

339
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:11,530
Right, Mhok?

340
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,420
By the time you wake up, the monks have already had their lunch.

341
00:21:15,078 --> 00:21:15,807
No way.

342
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:18,267
I used to get up early to take you to school.

343
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:19,969
Don't you remember that?

344
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:22,083
That's right, you did.

345
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,804
But you did that because you were hitting on me–duh!

346
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:30,974
And now I have to massage you

347
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:33,429
while you should be the one massaging me.

348
00:21:53,485 --> 00:21:54,345
Do you think…

349
00:21:55,485 --> 00:21:57,156
I like this job without realizing it?

350
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:01,455
Phi.

351
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:02,649
Are these nice?

352
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:04,633
He helped me choose yesterday.

353
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:07,140
They’re nice.

354
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:14,944
Do you want my help?

355
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:17,078
I'm fine.

356
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:44,661
With this hairdo,

357
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,313
you look good in a different way.

358
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:47,749
You can see me?

359
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:51,524
I can, for a little while.

360
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:52,930
Right after I use the eye drops.

361
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:56,026
We're done, young master.

362
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,770
Now get up.

363
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,218
Try jumping.

364
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,381
So do you like them?

365
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:09,497
I do.

366
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:12,795
How can you not? I chose them for you.

367
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,366
Should we go?ฃ

368
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:17,886
(Mee played with her friends day after day.)

369
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,940
(The fear she had eventually disappeared.)

370
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,358
You're pretty good.

371
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:34,827
Left curve.

372
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:39,229
Are you okay?

373
00:23:40,124 --> 00:23:40,844
I am.

374
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,710
I'm sorry.

375
00:23:44,535 --> 00:23:45,749
The band ripped.

376
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:52,335
Let's call it a day then.

377
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:55,689
Well then.

378
00:23:57,878 --> 00:23:58,824
Should we try this?

379
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:05,351
Okay?

380
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:07,147
Okay.

381
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:07,939
We’re continuing.

382
00:24:09,262 --> 00:24:11,940
Three, two, one.

383
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:17,516
(Finally, Mee felt at ease.)

384
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:23,701
She was back to being the same person who used to play happily with her friends.)

385
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,303
Jump.

386
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:49,643
Would you like to have dinner with me?

387
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:51,312
You’re going as what?

388
00:24:52,806 --> 00:24:53,987
What do you want me to be,

389
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:56,315
Nong Day?

390
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:21,663
Come on, guys. Quickly.

391
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,875
Day, keep it up.

392
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,953
Five, four, three, two, one.

393
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:27,602
Yeah!.

394
00:25:27,602 --> 00:25:29,522
That's 46.21.

395
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,565
That's awesome.

396
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,067
Did you guys do practice rounds or what?

397
00:25:34,762 --> 00:25:35,868
No.

398
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,489
It might be because we used to train together.

399
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,846
There's a race coming up next month.

400
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:43,614
Do you want to join, young men?

401
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:44,629
It'll be fun.

402
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:46,517
Please say yes.

403
00:25:46,517 --> 00:25:47,816
We’re joining too.

404
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:50,135
Whoa.

405
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,759
Isn't it too fast?

406
00:25:51,905 --> 00:25:53,428
I’ve just started practicing.

407
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:54,655
Besides,

408
00:25:55,704 --> 00:25:57,310
I’ve bothered my friend enough.

409
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:02,113
But if you want to join, I'm happy to.

410
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:05,170
That's cool.

411
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,674
I'll give you the application later.

412
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:07,804
Sure.

413
00:26:09,661 --> 00:26:10,578
Hey.

414
00:26:11,457 --> 00:26:12,752
Are you free the day after tomorrow?

415
00:26:13,631 --> 00:26:15,631
The day after tomorrow?

416
00:26:17,132 --> 00:26:18,463
I have to practice all day.

417
00:26:18,463 --> 00:26:19,374
Why do you ask?

418
00:26:22,234 --> 00:26:23,265
Nothing.

419
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:25,069
I'm just asking.

420
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:28,207
In case you're free to practice running.

421
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:31,427
Okay.

422
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:34,604
Mhok, we ran out of water.

423
00:26:34,604 --> 00:26:35,464
Let's go grab some.

424
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:55,454
What's wrong, Day?

425
00:26:56,787 --> 00:26:57,771
I'm alright.

426
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:00,260
Smile if you're alright.

427
00:27:06,307 --> 00:27:07,121
That's it?

428
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:12,952
Happy?

429
00:27:14,263 --> 00:27:15,165
Okay, I'm happy.

430
00:27:16,408 --> 00:27:17,506
Let's go eat.

431
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:35,468
Hello, Mrs. Mhon.

432
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,629
Hello.

433
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,909
Why are you home early today, Day?

434
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:41,418
I was tired today, Mom.

435
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:42,664
Have a seat.

436
00:27:45,938 --> 00:27:47,034
What are you making?

437
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:48,973
- It smells good.
- I'll get you some water.

438
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,621
Beef stew?

439
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:57,612
Yeah.

440
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:02,991
Why are we having a big meal today?

441
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:08,069
We usually have it for special occasions only.

442
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:13,701
There's a meeting among the chefs this Wednesday.

443
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,029
So I decided to make it for you today.

444
00:28:18,455 --> 00:28:21,425
So you do remember?

445
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:27,789
Of course, I do.

446
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:33,522
I screamed my lungs out in the hospital that day

447
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:36,351
giving birth to you.

448
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:46,505
Then should we celebrate a pre-birthday today?

449
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:48,977
I want to eat with you.

450
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,563
Of course.

451
00:28:57,407 --> 00:28:59,771
I did my best, you know?

452
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:03,053
I believe you.

453
00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:05,586
You try it, Day.

454
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,935
The water is on your left.

455
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:14,870
It's still hot.

456
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,693
Yes.

457
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,925
Here. I already blew it for you.

458
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:19,909
Slowly.

459
00:29:23,256 --> 00:29:24,498
Is it good?

460
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,380
It is.

461
00:29:28,715 --> 00:29:31,291
Night, you're not celebrating with them?

462
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:33,216
No.

463
00:29:34,465 --> 00:29:36,069
I don't want to upset the host.

464
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:42,059
You want it?

465
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:42,777
No.

466
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:43,701
I quit.

467
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,819
Are you tired of this job already?

468
00:29:49,607 --> 00:29:50,578
No.

469
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:53,609
I'm afraid your little brother would be tired of me first.

470
00:29:55,988 --> 00:29:57,624
Day seems happier.

471
00:30:02,943 --> 00:30:04,054
I didn't say that.

472
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:06,731
Mom did.

473
00:30:11,003 --> 00:30:12,280
She said thanks.

474
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:16,579
Thank you.

475
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:19,463
Well…

476
00:30:22,645 --> 00:30:24,069
Does Day talk about me at all?

477
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:31,408
Uh…

478
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:39,055
Seriously.

479
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:41,060
What's this tension between you two?

480
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:50,793
He must have said something bad about me, right?

481
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:55,729
It's okay.

482
00:30:56,578 --> 00:30:57,491
You don't have to tell me.

483
00:30:59,535 --> 00:31:00,276
Hey.

484
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,353
You okay?

485
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,351
I am.

486
00:31:07,503 --> 00:31:08,338
Phi Mhok.

487
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,444
- Are you out here?
- The hero is coming.

488
00:31:13,823 --> 00:31:15,043
I guess the villain has to go.

489
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:17,611
I'll talk to you later.

490
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:18,946
Sure.

491
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,943
What's up, Day?

492
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:29,703
You want to come outside?

493
00:31:30,552 --> 00:31:31,608
It’s not that.

494
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,549
Why didn't you join us for dinner?

495
00:31:38,238 --> 00:31:40,238
Just give me a break for today, would you?

496
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:46,133
Did taking care of me make you so tired?

497
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:48,599
It did.

498
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,669
I had to pamper a pouting kid all day.

499
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:56,899
It turns out he's grumpy because someone forgot his birthday.

500
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:02,015
That's him.

501
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,721
That's the real August.

502
00:32:15,285 --> 00:32:16,286
So that means

503
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:18,406
you're free the day after tomorrow.

504
00:32:20,612 --> 00:32:21,976
Would you like to have dinner with me?

505
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:29,451
But it's your day off.

506
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:31,843
I know.

507
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:38,540
Let's just say that I'm not going as your caretaker.

508
00:32:39,768 --> 00:32:42,495
You're going as my what then?

509
00:32:48,478 --> 00:32:52,145
What do you want me to be, Nong Day?

510
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:18,692
Day, stay still.

511
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:19,614
I'm making you look good here.

512
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:24,720
You've been better, hairdresser Mhok.

513
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,981
Of course, I'm better.

514
00:33:29,694 --> 00:33:32,058
I'm sure you like it, customer.

515
00:33:33,876 --> 00:33:35,452
I trust you.

516
00:33:46,434 --> 00:33:47,262
How do I look?

517
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:52,071
Honestly.

518
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,069
You're one handsome man, Day.

519
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:55,638
You realize that, sir?

520
00:34:02,231 --> 00:34:06,746
Speak politely makes you sound a lot more handsome too.

521
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:08,981
You realize that, sir?

522
00:34:16,466 --> 00:34:18,667
Let me see how you dressed today.

523
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:21,413
Let's see.

524
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:27,364
What is the color?

525
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,415
I'm wearing a green polo shirt.

526
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,579
Two brown bracelets.

527
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:43,013
The same one. Just because I had money to spend.

528
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:48,664
A pair of brown jeans.

529
00:34:49,361 --> 00:34:50,299
Jeans.

530
00:34:53,172 --> 00:34:57,081
And lastly, a black earring on my left ear.

531
00:34:57,808 --> 00:34:58,838
I wear it every day.

532
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:07,692
So?

533
00:35:08,925 --> 00:35:09,946
Do I look good enough?

534
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,047
Almost.

535
00:35:14,774 --> 00:35:15,957
You're still missing something.

536
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:16,950
Hmm?

537
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:18,786
What am I missing?

538
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:20,888
Wait here.

539
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,402
I think I'm fully dressed today.

540
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:24,674
Not yet.

541
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:40,501
Here.

542
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,443
It's yours now.

543
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:52,109
My favorite scent.

544
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:56,290
I think it should match your look today.

545
00:36:00,446 --> 00:36:01,439
How?

546
00:36:03,651 --> 00:36:04,658
I don't know.

547
00:36:05,738 --> 00:36:07,071
It smells like…

548
00:36:07,762 --> 00:36:10,149
toughness and aggression.

549
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:12,505
At first, you want to flee from it.

550
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,996
But after you scent it for a while, it makes you feel warm.

551
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:29,367
Ah.

552
00:36:32,004 --> 00:36:33,262
So that’s how you think of me?

553
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:35,017
Huh?

554
00:36:35,846 --> 00:36:37,240
I meant the perfume.

555
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:40,134
How can someone like you be warm?

556
00:36:41,727 --> 00:36:42,646
Okay.

557
00:36:44,586 --> 00:36:47,879
So will you tell me now

558
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:50,234
what you're going as

559
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,759
if not my caretaker?

560
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,186
I'll let you know once we get there.

561
00:37:02,326 --> 00:37:03,720
Why so secretive?

562
00:37:05,117 --> 00:37:06,107
We should get going.

563
00:37:06,865 --> 00:37:07,875
Alright. Be mysterious.

564
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:21,945
The atmosphere is different from the day we practiced.

565
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:24,234
Well, this is real.

566
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:25,672
Of course, it's not like the day we practiced.

567
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:34,101
The restaurant vibes are weird.

568
00:37:35,495 --> 00:37:36,376
We have arrived.

569
00:37:44,664 --> 00:37:47,209
There are people from the badminton club in front of you.

570
00:37:48,207 --> 00:37:54,669
Gee is walking towards you, holding the cake that says ‘Happy Birthday, Day’.

571
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,819
All of this was planned by someone smiling next to Gee.

572
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:03,781
His name is August.

573
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:10,130
What's the day after tomorrow?

574
00:38:12,645 --> 00:38:13,829
It's Day’s birthday.

575
00:38:15,856 --> 00:38:19,553
I'd like to throw him a surprise party.

576
00:38:20,777 --> 00:38:21,698
Can you help?

577
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:33,006
As for me, I came as a matchmaker.

578
00:38:34,998 --> 00:38:36,210
Happy birthday.

579
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,245
Blow the candles, birthday boy.

580
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:42,069
Right.

581
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:43,556
Where's the cake?

582
00:38:43,677 --> 00:38:46,159
It's right here.

583
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:47,349
Okay.

584
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:48,274
I'm going to use my hand.

585
00:38:48,274 --> 00:38:49,059
Sure.

586
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,822
Be careful. It's hot.

587
00:38:52,943 --> 00:38:53,752
Are they all out?

588
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,246
Almost.

589
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:56,263
Okay.

590
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:58,235
Yeah!

591
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:00,469
Happy birthday.

592
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,147
Come.

593
00:39:02,147 --> 00:39:03,393
Sit with me.

594
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:07,317
I am freaking starving.

595
00:39:07,317 --> 00:39:11,812
Sit at the head of the table.

596
00:39:13,627 --> 00:39:15,627
That means you're paying.

597
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:19,650
Don’t worry. I’m paying.

598
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,170
Keep your word.

599
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,493
Order more.

600
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,201
Just eat.

601
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,575
I want the fish.

602
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:37,869
Day, what do you want?

603
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:42,899
Get him food.

604
00:39:56,786 --> 00:39:58,210
Day seems so joyful.

605
00:40:00,203 --> 00:40:01,870
I've never seen him this happy.

606
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:10,249
Thank you.

607
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:17,830
You can consider your duty done for today.

608
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:20,603
I'll take care of him tonight.

609
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:05,312
Excuse me.

610
00:41:05,709 --> 00:41:07,110
Can I please have a cigarette?

611
00:41:07,749 --> 00:41:08,669
Sure.

612
00:41:13,928 --> 00:41:14,712
Thank you.

613
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:17,837
Yeah.

614
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:38,264
One, two, three.

615
00:41:38,264 --> 00:41:41,246
That's enough.

616
00:41:41,246 --> 00:41:42,069
No.

617
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:43,103
We’ve had just one.

618
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:46,303
No, we have taken a lot already.

619
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,119
A hundred of them.

620
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:56,068
The pictures from this event outnumber those from my entire life.

621
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,541
Oh, hey.

622
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:02,346
Where's Phi Mhok?

623
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,076
I saw him smoke outside.

624
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,076
Are you sure?

625
00:42:08,803 --> 00:42:11,242
He said he quit.

626
00:42:11,764 --> 00:42:12,657
Yes.

627
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,067
I did see him.

628
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:22,537
Can you take me to him?

629
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,375
Yeah, sure.

630
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,312
I need to use the bathroom too.

631
00:42:51,217 --> 00:42:52,149
Phi Mhok.

632
00:42:52,897 --> 00:42:54,897
Uh…I’m not.

633
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,221
Sorry.

634
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,407
(However, as the last beam of light vanished from the sky,

635
00:43:10,294 --> 00:43:13,900
Mee’s body slowly faded away again.)

636
00:43:14,502 --> 00:43:17,684
(The next thing she knew, her shadow was gone.)

637
00:43:35,103 --> 00:43:36,241
Hey.

638
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:37,830
You want sunflowers again?

639
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,047
There are only the pretty ones here.

640
00:43:55,081 --> 00:43:55,807
Day.

641
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:58,172
Nhong and Ta didn't come tonight.

642
00:43:58,172 --> 00:43:59,907
They said happy birthday though.

643
00:44:00,128 --> 00:44:01,189
Thanks a lot.

644
00:44:01,189 --> 00:44:03,008
I had a match the other day. It was a blast.

645
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:03,960
Really?

646
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,536
Hey, come and eat the cake. It's almost gone.

647
00:44:05,536 --> 00:44:07,188
We’ll continue this later.

648
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:07,864
Okay.

649
00:44:11,707 --> 00:44:13,707
Day, it's August here.

650
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:15,943
Hey, what's up?

651
00:44:16,398 --> 00:44:17,871
Are you bored?

652
00:44:18,346 --> 00:44:19,740
I'm not.

653
00:44:20,022 --> 00:44:21,104
I'm enjoying this.

654
00:44:21,104 --> 00:44:22,264
Let's keep the party going.

655
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,420
Should we go talk somewhere more private?

656
00:44:25,006 --> 00:44:25,951
I've got something for you.

657
00:44:30,436 --> 00:44:31,339
Sure.

658
00:44:31,521 --> 00:44:32,337
Let's go.

659
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:43,357
Oh!

660
00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:45,819
Oh, my God.

661
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:47,145
I'm sorry.

662
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,611
Day, I'm so sorry.

663
00:44:48,611 --> 00:44:49,938
It's all fine.

664
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:52,968
Why didn't you watch where you’re going?

665
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:53,838
I'm sorry.

666
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:54,902
Should I take you to the bathroom?

667
00:44:55,336 --> 00:44:56,609
Let me wipe it for you.

668
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:58,763
It's okay. You don't have to.

669
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,624
I’ll go get an extra tee for you.

670
00:45:00,624 --> 00:45:01,913
Excuse me. Can I have more tissues?

671
00:45:01,913 --> 00:45:03,391
You can wait until it’s dry.

672
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:04,780
I'm alright, really.

673
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:05,925
I only have this.

674
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:07,553
Let me help.

675
00:45:07,553 --> 00:45:10,162
Shouldn’t we go to the bathroom?

676
00:45:10,162 --> 00:45:11,116
Hold on.

677
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:12,473
Let’s dry it.

678
00:45:18,217 --> 00:45:20,217
Damn it! I said don't!

679
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,550
Calm down, Day.

680
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:24,417
Day.

681
00:45:24,592 --> 00:45:25,152
What's wrong?

682
00:45:25,152 --> 00:45:25,919
Gee!

683
00:45:26,343 --> 00:45:27,168
Gee!

684
00:45:28,502 --> 00:45:29,199
Day.

685
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:31,320
What's the matter?

686
00:45:31,733 --> 00:45:32,945
Get me out of here.

687
00:45:35,882 --> 00:45:37,882
Alright. Come on.

688
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:43,086
Well, you know he can’t see.

689
00:45:45,314 --> 00:45:46,526
I have a present for you.

690
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,768
It’s the headband.

691
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:49,976
It’s yours.

692
00:45:49,976 --> 00:45:51,046
It’s yours now.

693
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:21,451
Have a seat.

694
00:46:23,798 --> 00:46:24,835
Right here.

695
00:46:33,063 --> 00:46:34,304
Relax, okay?

696
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:36,755
You want some water?

697
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:37,923
I’ll get it for you.

698
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:39,608
I'm good.

699
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,412
Thanks.

700
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:48,689
Gee.

701
00:46:49,044 --> 00:46:49,702
Hmm?

702
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,410
Can you leave me alone for a while?

703
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:04,015
Day.

704
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,924
I want to understand you.

705
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:15,238
Please.

706
00:47:24,513 --> 00:47:25,411
Okay.

707
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,567
Fine.

708
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,230
Once you're okay, give me a call.

709
00:47:30,394 --> 00:47:31,040
Okay?

710
00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:39,488
Phi Mhok.

711
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:41,845
It's me August.

712
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:54,473
I'm sorry about what just happened.

713
00:48:57,202 --> 00:48:58,800
Why are you apologizing?

714
00:48:59,823 --> 00:49:01,659
I should be the one apologizing.

715
00:49:03,522 --> 00:49:05,522
I think I'm not ready to be at a party like this.

716
00:49:09,974 --> 00:49:11,401
I've got a present for you.

717
00:49:23,536 --> 00:49:26,300
I tried to find things to replace that ripped headband.

718
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:29,187
But I didn't like any of them.

719
00:49:30,722 --> 00:49:31,983
So I think this should do.

720
00:49:37,223 --> 00:49:39,440
It's your headband.

721
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:42,290
Um.

722
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:46,021
Ever since you disappeared,

723
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:47,837
I've never used it.

724
00:49:49,645 --> 00:49:51,645
I guess I wanted to only use it with you.

725
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,585
I'm giving it to you.

726
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:57,772
Let's use it together again.

727
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:06,362
Let me put it on for you.

728
00:51:10,989 --> 00:51:12,225
Happy birthday.

729
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:49,241
Hey!

730
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:52,800
I'm sorry.

731
00:52:01,664 --> 00:52:02,406
Hey!

732
00:52:03,334 --> 00:52:04,428
Where do you think you are going?

733
00:52:10,924 --> 00:52:12,101
What the hell did you just do?

734
00:52:15,294 --> 00:52:16,226
I don't know.

735
00:52:18,089 --> 00:52:20,089
I just wanted him to have a good memory.

736
00:52:21,307 --> 00:52:22,509
A good memory?

737
00:52:23,546 --> 00:52:25,800
You think what you just did is good?

738
00:52:28,435 --> 00:52:30,435
I feel sorry for what he is going through.

739
00:52:31,709 --> 00:52:33,709
Whatever makes him happy,

740
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,868
I'm willing to do it.

741
00:52:37,986 --> 00:52:39,331
Happy?

742
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:44,111
Is he happy with what you just did?

743
00:52:45,214 --> 00:52:46,528
Does Day look happy?

744
00:52:46,528 --> 00:52:47,760
And do you?

745
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:48,699
Answer me.

746
00:52:49,607 --> 00:52:50,840
I tried.

747
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:52,958
But I really couldn't.

748
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,938
You f*cking tried what?

749
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:58,390
I really can't think of him as more than a friend.

750
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:59,371
I'm sorry.

751
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:06,491
The one you should say sorry to isn't me.

752
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,100
Phi Mhok.

753
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:16,800
Let him go.

754
00:53:21,494 --> 00:53:22,409
Phi Mhok.

755
00:53:54,849 --> 00:53:55,785
Day.

756
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:11,000
(That night, Mee discovered that

757
00:54:11,656 --> 00:54:13,656
as the last light went out,

758
00:54:13,785 --> 00:54:18,596
she was back to being invisible.)

759
00:55:16,372 --> 00:55:17,395
Where are we?

760
00:55:19,114 --> 00:55:20,091
Come with me.

761
00:55:44,705 --> 00:55:46,432
We're on a rooftop, Day.

762
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,786
I found this building after seeing a police checkpoint on the street.

763
00:55:52,188 --> 00:55:53,751
I had to drive up here to sober up.

764
00:55:55,613 --> 00:55:56,647
Lucky me,

765
00:55:57,411 --> 00:55:59,578
I found myself a good spot to see the sunrise.

766
00:56:01,127 --> 00:56:02,936
In exchange for just 20 baht parking fee.

767
00:56:10,229 --> 00:56:13,539
When I'm stressed out, I like to come up here.

768
00:56:15,654 --> 00:56:16,767
And think…

769
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:20,519
a new day is coming soon.

770
00:56:33,096 --> 00:56:34,043
You know what?

771
00:56:36,254 --> 00:56:40,800
This is the first time ever someone threw me a birthday party.

772
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,664
Before this,

773
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,745
people disliked me.

774
00:56:51,261 --> 00:56:54,844
I was a bad-mouthed rich boy.

775
00:56:58,697 --> 00:56:59,987
Look how it turned out today.

776
00:57:02,161 --> 00:57:04,488
I didn't even recognize some of them.

777
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,487
Yet they agreed to come and wish me a happy birthday.

778
00:57:13,324 --> 00:57:18,681
And someone I've had a crush on forever managed to kiss me.

779
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:30,223
I'm just so damn lucky to be blind.

780
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,800
Is there anyone else in this world

781
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,557
who doesn't feel pity for me?

782
00:58:03,502 --> 00:58:04,356
Day.

783
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:57,351
What are you doing?

784
00:59:00,616 --> 00:59:02,234
Are you feeling pity for me too?

785
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:25,520
(A ray of sunlight from the next day recreated Mee's shadow.)

786
00:59:25,868 --> 00:59:27,001
In that split second,

787
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,193
Mee realized that the only way to break the curse

788
00:59:31,448 --> 00:59:34,976
was to keep chasing after the sunlight.

789
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,800
Do you still think I feel pity for you?

Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

791
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:39,877
I like Day.

792
01:00:39,877 --> 01:00:41,354
Don’t let him know.

793
01:00:41,354 --> 01:00:43,002
What if he doesn’t feel the same?

794
01:00:43,002 --> 01:00:44,255
Will he be uncomfortable?

795
01:00:44,255 --> 01:00:47,046
I just want you to know how I feel about you.

796
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:49,048
Once you cross the line and hit on me,

797
01:00:49,895 --> 01:00:50,861
you’re fired.

798
01:00:51,895 --> 01:00:52,929
Ouch!

799
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:54,174
Cramp!

800
01:00:54,174 --> 01:00:55,730
If Phi Mhok here gives you a massage,

801
01:00:55,906 --> 01:00:57,906
will that be considered crossing the line?

802
01:00:57,906 --> 01:00:59,525
Just help me already!

803
01:00:59,525 --> 01:01:00,618
Day told me

804
01:01:00,618 --> 01:01:02,868
he likes someone warm and nice.

805
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,382
You’re the first to get crossed out.

806
01:01:04,382 --> 01:01:07,253
Maybe if we’re comfortable with each other,

807
01:01:07,253 --> 01:01:08,504
he doesn’t have to be so warm.

808
01:01:08,504 --> 01:01:09,709
I think I’m okay with that.

809
01:01:10,342 --> 01:01:13,240
With August, we sync quite fast.

810
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,108
He isn’t much better than me.

811
01:01:15,294 --> 01:01:17,294
Don’t tell me you’re jealous.

812
01:01:19,496 --> 01:01:22,369
I’m afraid you won’t have enough energy to run tomorrow.
