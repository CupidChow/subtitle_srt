What are you stressed out for?

5
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,041
Just do what we always do.

6
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:14,383
Let’s kick their asses.

7
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:15,817
Then we’ll go get something to eat.

8
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:24,000
You’re paying though.

9
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:26,722
No way.

10
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,000
Jackass.

11
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:32,921
Guys.

12
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:35,224
Ready?

13
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:37,482
Let’s do this.

14
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:38,654
Let’s go.

15
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:45,025
Come on. Show them what you got.

16
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:39,206
Yeah!

17
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:40,878
What did I say?

18
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:42,842
Mhok, get out of there.

19
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,180
That was cool.

20
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,331
Messi was awesome tonight.

21
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:54,927
Pay up.

22
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:57,589
It was dope.

23
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:59,475
He’s so slow when it comes to money.

24
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:00,955
Quit stalling.

25
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,448
You jackasses are f*cking rich.

26
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:04,808
Will you relax?

27
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:15,529
Are you not paying me, Mhok?

28
00:03:18,108 --> 00:03:19,280
One more game.

29
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:21,389
What?

30
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:23,560
The match is over.

31
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:27,040
Don’t we have any other game to watch?

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,343
There’s this.

33
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:32,819
Badminton something between Thailand and Singapore.
I don’t know. Look.

34
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:34,024
Let me see.

35
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:43,179
I bet 5,000 on Singapore.

36
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,453
You guys wanna bet?

37
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:45,643
I am in.

38
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:47,383
You are?

39
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:48,828
Yes, 5,000 it is.

40
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:50,395
You?

41
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:51,526
Yes, I’m betting too.

42
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:52,260
You guys are loaded.

43
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,053
I must pee.

44
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:15,106
What?

45
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,172
Your girlfriend wants you back home?

46
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,851
Hell, no.

47
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:27,232
Oh, look.

48
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:28,922
That’s sweet!

49
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:31,480
Pay up.

50
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:34,014
Alright. I won’t bail.

51
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:34,865
I’m paying.

52
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:35,639
Drink first.

53
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,533
Guys, Chai is here.

54
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,864
Hey.

55
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:57,080
Are you still mingling with his lover?

56
00:05:57,877 --> 00:05:59,212
I didn’t know he’d come.

57
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,161
You’re dead!

58
00:06:57,363 --> 00:06:58,764
Day, what’s wrong?

59
00:07:02,574 --> 00:07:04,574
Day, are you okay?

60
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,215
Day, what’s wrong?

61
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:07,680
Day!

62
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,317
Day, tell me what’s wrong.

63
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:10,417
Day!

64
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,973
Day, say what’s wrong.

65
00:07:12,973 --> 00:07:14,495
Day.

66
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:33,863
Day.

67
00:07:43,782 --> 00:07:45,117
Day!

68
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:47,065
Mom.

69
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:49,159
- Mom, get me out of here.
- Day, what it is?

70
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,483
Day.

71
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,065
Day.

72
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:58,683
Mom, get me out of here.

73
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,568
Calm down, okay?

74
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:03,623
Let’s go.

75
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:55,881
Porjai.

76
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:57,185
Why are you here?

77
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,424
Where is Rung?

78
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:01,449
Where is she?

79
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:05,626
Listen.

80
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:10,480
Rung…

81
00:09:12,982 --> 00:09:14,217
Rung what?

82
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,338
Porjai.

83
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,155
She…

84
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:32,253
Porjai.

85
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:34,049
Tell me what happened to her.

86
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:36,781
She…

87
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,160
Porjai!

88
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,547
What’s up with Rung?

89
00:09:42,492 --> 00:09:44,492
Porjai, answer me.

90
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:45,635
What’s wrong with my sister?

91
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:48,249
Tell me!

92
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,209
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

93
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:31,963
What were you charged with?

94
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:33,539
Affray, sir.

95
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:37,549
That’s it?

96
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,390
The other party likes to take things far.

97
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:45,620
Before this, he got me locked up for six months.

98
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
A YEAR LATER

99
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,965
Are you still hanging out with the same group of pals?

100
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:54,845
No, sir.

101
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:56,283
They all ditched me.

102
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:57,407
Good for you.

103
00:10:57,521 --> 00:10:59,400
Have you got a permanent job?

104
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,310
Let me call you back.

105
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:22,941
Okay, guys.

106
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:24,725
Hurry up. The customer is waiting.

107
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:28,608
We have enough mechanics.

108
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:29,873
Sorry.

109
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,920
Hey, you’re pretty skillful.

110
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:42,014
I’d love to hire you.

111
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:43,567
But there’s one thing.

112
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:46,561
How about you clear that thing off first?

113
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:48,166
You can come back after that.

114
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:50,672
Of course.

115
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:53,160
You’re great.

116
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,331
I won’t let you slip away.

117
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:56,332
Thank you so much.

118
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:57,510
See you.

119
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,895
Remember.

120
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:00,973
Once you’re done with it, come back to me.

121
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,087
Sure.

122
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:05,406
Thank you.

123
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:09,832
I’ve been looking, sir.

124
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:12,000
But haven’t found the job the like.

125
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:16,196
That’s alright.

126
00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:17,580
Don’t get discouraged yet.

127
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,800
Some people spend years looking for a job.

128
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:21,698
Only one thing I’m asking.

129
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:23,759
Don’t go back to the same path.

130
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,950
There must be people who give you chances.

131
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:44,920
Good luck.

132
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:52,252
Thank you, sir.

133
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:56,314
Why doesn’t it slide down?

134
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:57,524
Is it broken?

135
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:00,575
Hello, sir.

136
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:01,770
Hello.

137
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,080
You’re here for a job?

138
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,891
Right.

139
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:08,121
What can you do?

140
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:10,060
Sir, it’s me.

141
00:13:10,604 --> 00:13:12,604
You told me to come back once the case was over.

142
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,125
When should I start?

143
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,169
Well, I’m sorry.

144
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,722
I already hired someone else.

145
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:24,594
Let’s say you’ll be the first one I call if I need an extra hand.

146
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,840
Thank you.

147
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:44,788
Hello, sir.

148
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:46,651
I’m here for the welder position.

149
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:48,525
- You’re the one that called yesterday?
- That’s right, sir.

150
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:49,315
Alright.

151
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:51,333
When can you start?

152
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,073
- Tomorrow, sir.
- Good.

153
00:14:00,117 --> 00:14:01,221
Hey. What?

154
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:02,616
What are you doing?

155
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:06,000
What? What are you doing?

156
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,528
Hey!

157
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:23,959
Hey!

158
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:24,968
No!

159
00:14:46,273 --> 00:14:47,242
Done.

160
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:03,683
I’m not charging you for that.

161
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,667
Don’t forget to give me a call,

162
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:06,986
sir.

163
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,353
Right.

164
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:14,010
Come back again in three months.

165
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:25,311
Hey.

166
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:27,438
Look who’s here.

167
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:29,320
Here.

168
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,452
My treat.

169
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:33,493
No.

170
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:34,631
I quit.

171
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:36,020
Just still water.

172
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,157
Oh, wow!

173
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:39,701
That’s just bullshit.

174
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:41,711
You always drink.

175
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,267
Still water, it is.

176
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:50,496
So?

177
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:51,904
Where will you be working?

178
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,120
I haven’t got a job.

179
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,816
Why not?

180
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:03,000
I think they only want clean people.

181
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,714
They haven’t taken that thing off yet?

182
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:07,892
It’s gone.

183
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,867
But I guess some people still see it.

184
00:16:22,836 --> 00:16:24,271
Hey.

185
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:26,615
It’s an anniversary tomorrow.

186
00:16:27,558 --> 00:16:29,558
I’m visiting Rung.

187
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:31,234
Coming with me?

188
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,713
[Methinee Pankhamdee]
[Jul 9, 1989 - Oct 17, 2022]

189
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:25,523
Mhok.

190
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,861
Mhok, get up. Our parents are waiting.

191
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:31,969
Do you need to be so freaking loud?

192
00:17:32,948 --> 00:17:34,117
Come on.

193
00:17:34,117 --> 00:17:35,879
He’s hungover. Let me handle him.

194
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:36,964
Alright.

195
00:17:36,964 --> 00:17:38,109
Come quick.

196
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:39,315
Mhok, get up.

197
00:17:39,738 --> 00:17:41,106
Get out.

198
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:43,818
I told you not to drink so much. You see what I mean now?

199
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:48,336
I brought you your favorite, Mom. It’s sugar cane juice.

200
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:49,340
Enjoy.

201
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:53,220
Hey, Mom.

202
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,614
This is Porjai, Mhok’s girlfriend.

203
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:59,558
I wonder what sin she committed to deserve your son.

204
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:02,139
Oh, please. Shut your mouth.

205
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:03,647
I’m better than your daughter.

206
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,200
She’s still on the shelf.

207
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:08,863
I’m focusing on work only, you hear?

208
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,856
Mom.

209
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,379
I’m opening a nail salon.

210
00:18:13,379 --> 00:18:18,617
Please, Mom and Dad, appear in people’s dreams and tell them to visit my shop.

211
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:21,384
Please help. I invested a lot in it.

212
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:23,978
I spent all my savings. Help me.

213
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:27,822
You guys do it too. Hands together and beg them to help me.

214
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:29,328
Sadhu!

215
00:18:29,328 --> 00:18:31,449
- I wish you money and success, Rung.
- Good job, Porjai.

216
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:32,784
Sadhu!

217
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:36,577
Give Rung a husband soon so he can help her with the salon.

218
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:38,762
It’s supposed to be only about my nail salon.

219
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:40,171
Help me, Mommy.

220
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:41,786
I love you.

221
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:47,353
(Don’t worry about me and Mhok.)

222
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:48,932
[For Sale]

223
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:51,568
(Once we’re rich, we’ll come visit you guys more often.)

224
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:53,290
(Wish me luck, Mom.)

225
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,391
I failed, Mom.

226
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:17,120
Mhok.

227
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:19,946
You must stop feeling guilty.

228
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:23,410
No one knew why she chose to do it.

229
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,875
The one that should feel guilty is her.

230
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,760
Not me.

231
00:19:46,037 --> 00:19:47,837
What are you going to do now?

232
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:50,680
The car installment is due next week.

233
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,124
Should I borrow someone for you?

234
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:02,289
No, thanks.

235
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:05,702
Besides, we’re not the same anymore.

236
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:07,914
Oh, please.

237
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:10,051
You don’t have to act cool.

238
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:13,340
Fine then.

239
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:15,902
But, hey.

240
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:18,408
Tong is looking for help with the air-con cleaning service this week.

241
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,333
Are you interested? I can talk to him for you.

242
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:27,551
You okay there, Mhok?

243
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:28,548
I am.

244
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:30,000
Pull it out.

245
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,484
Shit.

246
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:38,480
It’s a complete mess inside.

247
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,418
That’s fine. Get down.

248
00:20:40,878 --> 00:20:42,346
Go get clean water. I’ll take it from here.

249
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:14,001
Bro, may I ask?

250
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:16,137
What are you guys doing here?

251
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:18,199
We’re waiting for the job interview.

252
00:21:18,683 --> 00:21:21,920
Someone is looking for a caregiver for her son.

253
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:25,893
Like a secretary?

254
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:28,127
Not really.

255
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:33,408
Why are there so many applicants?

256
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:34,481
It pays well?

257
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:36,382
Quite well.

258
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:38,847
The mom is a famous chef.

259
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:42,728
Are you interested?

260
00:21:44,424 --> 00:21:45,310
No.

261
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,297
Just curious.

262
00:22:19,382 --> 00:22:21,182
Have you ever given care to anyone before?

263
00:22:21,182 --> 00:22:22,974
Yes, a couple of times.

264
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,639
But I’ve never taken care of anyone this young.

265
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:26,302
Must be pretty tough.

266
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,107
I'd like for everyone to see him as a normal person,

267
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:46,684
to trust him,

268
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:51,659
and to give him a chance to rejoin society.

269
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:53,064
Alright, ma’am?

270
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,882
Hello.

271
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:11,069
Howdy.

272
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,094
Hello, Mom.

273
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:20,796
Let’s not say I’m helping him.

274
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,765
Actually,

275
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:28,205
he’s the one helping me.

276
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:31,081
He’s making my life…

277
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:36,000
so meaningful.

278
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:42,000
Mom.

279
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,642
Let’s call it a day.

280
00:23:43,642 --> 00:23:45,052
I wanna puke.

281
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:50,739
Day, are you feeling sick?

282
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,389
Looking forward to hearing from you.

283
00:23:56,389 --> 00:23:57,384
Thank you.

284
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:00,588
Please hold.

285
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:03,600
My little brother is tired.

286
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,193
Let’s do your interview next week.

287
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,898
Hey!

288
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:08,499
I’ve waited for hours.

289
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:09,648
Can’t you just do one more?

290
00:24:10,392 --> 00:24:11,727
Uh…

291
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:13,936
I’m sorry.

292
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:15,470
Move aside.

293
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,514
Hey, don’t.

294
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:17,379
Hey!

295
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:19,525
It won’t freakin’ kill you to interview one more applicant.

296
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:29,170
Sorry.

297
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,782
I misunderstood.

298
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:32,815
Didn’t know it was this kind of job.

299
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,703
Come on.

300
00:24:35,335 --> 00:24:36,881
You had such a grand opening.

301
00:24:37,246 --> 00:24:38,480
Don’t go just yet.

302
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:45,013
Stay a bit longer for the interview.

303
00:24:45,663 --> 00:24:47,064
It won’t freakin’ kill you.

304
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,557
Look for someone else.

305
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:54,617
Bye.

306
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:56,269
Hold on.

307
00:24:57,146 --> 00:24:58,581
The interview isn't over yet.

308
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,224
How much do you make a day?

309
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:04,172
My mom will double it.

310
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:26,415
Sorry.

311
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:28,088
I misunderstood.

312
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:30,313
Didn’t know it was this kind of job.

313
00:25:31,373 --> 00:25:32,205
Come on.

314
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:34,254
You had such a grand opening.

315
00:25:34,888 --> 00:25:35,791
Don’t go just yet.

316
00:25:40,746 --> 00:25:42,252
Stay a bit longer for the interview.

317
00:25:43,348 --> 00:25:44,327
It won’t freakin’ kill you.

318
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:48,894
Mom.

319
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,462
What are you waiting for?

320
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:52,334
Interview him.

321
00:25:55,561 --> 00:25:57,561
We’re looking for someone to take care of Day.

322
00:25:58,194 --> 00:25:59,622
He can’t see clearly.

323
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:02,232
His vision is only 20% effective.

324
00:26:03,143 --> 00:26:04,857
Don’t beat around the bush.

325
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,733
Just tell him.

326
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:08,987
You want someone to feed a blind man.

327
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,668
Because this is what happens when you let him eat by himself.

328
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:13,517
See?

329
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:16,638
Okay.

330
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:20,086
Have you ever given care to anyone before?

331
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,364
I send my friends home when they’re dead drunk.

332
00:26:28,864 --> 00:26:29,691
Does that count?

333
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:32,790
How great.

334
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:36,191
I’m not much different from a dead man.

335
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,683
And you will even get paid.

336
00:26:39,323 --> 00:26:40,249
Interested?

337
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:42,371
No.

338
00:26:43,254 --> 00:26:44,704
Dead or not, I have the right to choose.

339
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,516
Look for someone else.

340
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:47,549
Bye.

341
00:26:48,383 --> 00:26:49,278
Hold on.

342
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:51,669
The interview isn't over yet.

343
00:26:52,803 --> 00:26:54,184
How much do you make a day?

344
00:26:55,317 --> 00:26:57,174
My mom will double it.

345
00:27:01,905 --> 00:27:03,572
What do you want?

346
00:27:05,122 --> 00:27:06,455
Tell me about you.

347
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,463
Start with your appearance.

348
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:11,112
How do you look? Good or bad?

349
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:12,747
Are you hot?

350
00:27:13,975 --> 00:27:15,213
Go into details.

351
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:16,802
Don’t be shy.

352
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,239
Day, stop it.

353
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,855
You don’t want to know about me.

354
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:29,321
Why not?

355
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:31,694
Are we not paying you enough?

356
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,283
How about three times more?

357
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:36,650
Five times more?

358
00:27:37,412 --> 00:27:38,547
Ten times more?

359
00:27:39,652 --> 00:27:40,794
What do you say?

360
00:27:42,905 --> 00:27:44,048
That’s a lot.

361
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,000
It isn’t easy to make.

362
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:49,458
So?

363
00:27:50,244 --> 00:27:51,059
Why are you quiet?

364
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,282
You want more money?

365
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:02,076
I was hired to clean the air cons here.

366
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:06,234
I saw a bunch of applicants awaiting the job interview.

367
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:11,831
At first, I thought it was a rich boy’s minion job.

368
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:13,405
Who would have guessed?

369
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:15,604
It's a caregiver job for a brat.

370
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:19,151
Keep your money.

371
00:28:20,318 --> 00:28:21,731
This mouth seems to love asking for bruises.

372
00:28:22,548 --> 00:28:23,667
Save the money for medical treatment.

373
00:28:53,236 --> 00:28:55,760
I truly have no clue where he is, Pae.

374
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:58,506
If I knew, I would tell you.

375
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,483
He left the car in my garage for so long.

376
00:29:07,588 --> 00:29:08,564
How about this?

377
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:13,055
If you see him, tell him I can’t give him much time.

378
00:29:13,174 --> 00:29:16,187
Tomorrow is the deadline. He must come and talk about the car.

379
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:20,396
I can’t keep it forever. Let him know.

380
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,578
Alright.

381
00:29:22,983 --> 00:29:24,600
I’ll let him know if I see him.

382
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:28,290
- Bye then. See you.
- Goodbye.

383
00:29:38,722 --> 00:29:39,793
Out of hiding.

384
00:29:54,098 --> 00:29:54,869
Mhok.

385
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:56,696
I’m warning you

386
00:29:57,548 --> 00:30:02,587
Pae is going to sell your car if you don’t give him the money by tomorrow.

387
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:06,963
It’s Rung’s car.

388
00:30:06,963 --> 00:30:07,877
Not mine.

389
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,107
Even the owner abandoned it.

390
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,691
Why not let Pae sell it?

391
00:30:15,978 --> 00:30:17,383
You’re saying it now.

392
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:20,383
But you’ll regret it later, Mhok.

393
00:30:25,381 --> 00:30:27,547
And where are you going?

394
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:29,389
Have a beer with me.

395
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:30,860
No.

396
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,094
You drink alone.

397
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:34,108
I'm going home to Keng.

398
00:30:34,728 --> 00:30:35,561
What?

399
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:37,241
You prioritize a boyfriend over a friend?

400
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:38,168
Oh, shut it.

401
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:40,818
You prioritized friends over a girlfriend before.

402
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:42,932
I'm out. Enjoy drinking by yourself.

403
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:46,243
Do you need any help?

404
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:48,620
I'll go home then.

405
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,189
Okay.

406
00:30:49,189 --> 00:30:49,823
See you. Bye.

407
00:30:58,807 --> 00:30:59,684
Pae, hello.

408
00:31:00,446 --> 00:31:01,664
Well, hello, Mhok.

409
00:31:01,923 --> 00:31:03,828
You've been gone.

410
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,794
I thought you were dead.

411
00:31:06,043 --> 00:31:06,579
I'm not.

412
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:07,662
So what do you want to do?

413
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,307
Bank transfer or cheque?

414
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:11,067
My guys have the documents ready for us.

415
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:20,647
Here.

416
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,454
I'm giving you back the spare key.

417
00:31:28,683 --> 00:31:29,558
You can sell it.

418
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:33,327
Are you kidding me right now?

419
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,404
You sure about that?

420
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:43,226
Mhok.

421
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:47,955
I took this car because of your sister.

422
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:53,590
You know how much Rung loved it.

423
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:56,381
Come on.

424
00:31:58,763 --> 00:31:59,740
Just sell it.

425
00:32:00,976 --> 00:32:02,643
Tell people it’s the owner-selling car.

426
00:32:03,852 --> 00:32:06,085
Original engine.

427
00:32:08,848 --> 00:32:09,758
It hasn’t been used much.

428
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:11,647
Rung nurtured it like her child.

429
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:15,257
Look at the color.

430
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,591
She gave it a wax every week.

431
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,635
Smoother than her facial skin, I bet.

432
00:32:25,098 --> 00:32:26,210
Except for this part.

433
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:32,696
Rung scratched it on the first day while reversing into the garage at home.

434
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,795
She didn’t have money to get the new paint so she did this.

435
00:32:41,637 --> 00:32:43,518
I told her to bandage it.

436
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:01,590
Oh, and…

437
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:05,327
this glove compartment,

438
00:33:06,872 --> 00:33:09,110
Rung stuffed so much stuff into it that it loosened.

439
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:13,907
It will make a sound when you drive.

440
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,846
I told her to get it fixed many times.

441
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:18,839
She just didn't do it.

442
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:22,360
I found out later that,

443
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:23,878
I never knew this,

444
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:32,677
she was saving for my tuition fee.

445
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:00,713
How about we do this, Mhok?

446
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:03,635
I'm not in a rush.

447
00:34:04,924 --> 00:34:06,352
I'll give you more time.

448
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:10,486
How does six months sound?

449
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:13,252
Spend this time thinking it through.

450
00:34:44,671 --> 00:34:45,933
Excuse me.

451
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:46,683
Of course.

452
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:48,374
I need to check a little here.

453
00:34:50,227 --> 00:34:51,273
It doesn't hurt, does it?

454
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:51,965
No, ma’am.

455
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:56,281
I suggest you take light steps for now.

456
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:57,611
All right.

457
00:34:58,791 --> 00:34:59,852
That'll be all.

458
00:35:01,571 --> 00:35:02,579
Be still.

459
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,525
Let me check the other one.

460
00:35:09,885 --> 00:35:10,724
We're done.

461
00:35:15,941 --> 00:35:18,031
His vision remains stable.

462
00:35:18,465 --> 00:35:20,417
It's not getting any worse like it used to.

463
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:24,789
But, just to be safe, take good care of yourself in the meantime.

464
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,579
We will meet again for the next check-up.

465
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,282
I'd like to go to the bathroom.

466
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,612
Sure.

467
00:35:33,446 --> 00:35:35,010
I'll be taking you, sir.

468
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,053
Yes.

469
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,014
This way, please.

470
00:35:46,113 --> 00:35:46,877
Doctor.

471
00:35:47,372 --> 00:35:49,920
Have we got any news on the eye donation for my brother?

472
00:35:58,587 --> 00:36:00,325
I'm stopping by The Shining Society for the Blind.

473
00:36:01,363 --> 00:36:03,101
Mom asked me to give them some documents.

474
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,522
Will you be waiting for me inside or outside the car?

475
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,380
Wait for me here. I'll be right back.

476
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:54,947
Excuse me.

477
00:37:00,229 --> 00:37:02,705
I saw a job posting for a maintenance technician the other day.

478
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,797
Are you still accepting applications?

479
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:06,536
Ah, we already hired someone.

480
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:13,004
Thank you.

481
00:39:19,778 --> 00:39:20,619
Over here.

482
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,170
Take your time.

483
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,966
You can borrow the one you like and listen to it at home.

484
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,866
These are not in our online system.

485
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,212
Thank you.

486
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:40,306
Excuse me.

487
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:45,720
He dropped his library member card.

488
00:39:47,076 --> 00:39:47,924
Thank you.

489
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,745
I've got a question.

490
00:39:53,087 --> 00:39:53,970
What happened to him?

491
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,895
I heard he had a car accident that caused his corneas to be damaged.

492
00:39:59,895 --> 00:40:01,761
His vision has become worse after that.

493
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:07,956
Can't he be cured?

494
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:15,699
In his case, a cornea transplant is the only solution.

495
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,082
Poor him.

496
00:40:19,185 --> 00:40:21,404
I heard he was a national athlete.

497
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:24,609
May you excuse me?

498
00:40:56,232 --> 00:40:57,119
What did I tell you?

499
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,945
Wait outside.

500
00:41:01,066 --> 00:41:01,673
Piss off.

501
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:51,802
Day, buckle up.

502
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:58,574
Day, put on your seat belt.

503
00:42:23,433 --> 00:42:24,178
Yes, Mom.

504
00:42:24,178 --> 00:42:25,433
(Night, where are you two?)

505
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:28,971
We're done. On our way home.

506
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,288
(Talk to Day about the documents.)

507
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,155
Yes, Mom. I'll talk to him.

508
00:42:44,137 --> 00:42:44,755
Hey.

509
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:49,628
Mom wants your signature authorizing me to act as your custodian.

510
00:42:52,219 --> 00:42:52,879
No.

511
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:54,813
Mom must be my custodian.

512
00:42:56,876 --> 00:42:58,803
You know how many days a month she stays home, right?

513
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,163
Who will help you in case of an emergency?

514
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:03,081
Help?

515
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:05,225
Do you think I don't know

516
00:43:05,766 --> 00:43:07,382
that you want everything I have?

517
00:43:08,345 --> 00:43:11,405
The car you're driving, Mom bought it for me.

518
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,055
Are you nuts, Day? What are you thinking?

519
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:15,837
What?

520
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,982
You think you’ll become the hero of the house because I’m blind?

521
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,575
Remember this.

522
00:43:23,053 --> 00:43:24,468
I will be able to see again.

523
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:27,750
And you, no one will ever care about you.

524
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:35,458
Do you think it's easy for me to take care of you?

525
00:43:36,131 --> 00:43:38,460
Oh, and the eye donation, when will you get it exactly?

526
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:42,836
The doctor told me you might not get it in 10 years.

527
00:43:43,774 --> 00:43:44,864
Do you realize it now?

528
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:48,297
No matter how much you hate me, you're going to have to rely on me.

529
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:55,801
Night, you asshole.

530
00:43:57,465 --> 00:43:58,580
Get out of my car.

531
00:44:03,895 --> 00:44:04,838
I'm sorry, Day.

532
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:07,869
Damn it! Even though I'm dying, don't help me.

533
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:12,645
Day.

534
00:44:13,632 --> 00:44:14,441
Day, get back in the car.

535
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:15,637
Day!

536
00:44:17,337 --> 00:44:17,942
Hey!

537
00:44:18,765 --> 00:44:19,454
Day.

538
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:21,145
Day!

539
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:26,010
Day!

540
00:44:29,555 --> 00:44:30,220
Day.

541
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:36,193
Day.

542
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:43,598
Day.

543
00:44:56,495 --> 00:44:57,252
Day.

544
00:44:58,597 --> 00:44:59,619
Watch out!

545
00:45:20,955 --> 00:45:21,908
Are you okay?

546
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:26,793
It's me.

547
00:45:28,294 --> 00:45:29,764
The AC guy you met the other day.

548
00:45:33,019 --> 00:45:35,110
Where are you going?

549
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:36,694
I have a bike. I'll take you.

550
00:45:40,135 --> 00:45:40,822
Hey.

551
00:45:41,389 --> 00:45:42,196
Are you in a hurry?

552
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:43,415
No.

553
00:45:44,901 --> 00:45:45,974
Come inside.

554
00:45:46,522 --> 00:45:47,102
Day.

555
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:48,779
Why did you ask him to come in?

556
00:46:18,588 --> 00:46:19,337
Day.

557
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:21,226
What’s going on?

558
00:46:21,827 --> 00:46:23,484
How come you came home with this man?

559
00:46:25,459 --> 00:46:26,139
Night.

560
00:46:27,315 --> 00:46:28,244
Come here.

561
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:30,294
What happened?

562
00:46:30,726 --> 00:46:33,877
Is he the one we met before?

563
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:35,767
Long story, Mom.

564
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:37,223
But it’s all good now.

565
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,024
Day, let’s come inside.

566
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:42,771
Someone is on his way here for the interview.

567
00:46:42,771 --> 00:46:43,374
Come on.

568
00:46:44,953 --> 00:46:45,863
Hold on, Mom.

569
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:48,084
Hey.

570
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:49,565
Are you in a hurry?

571
00:46:52,011 --> 00:46:52,658
No.

572
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:55,094
Come inside.

573
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,241
Day.

574
00:46:56,787 --> 00:46:57,969
Why did you ask him to come in?

575
00:46:58,689 --> 00:46:59,507
Mom.

576
00:47:02,216 --> 00:47:04,504
Come inside. You’re all drenched.

577
00:47:30,207 --> 00:47:31,274
Do you like to read?

578
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:34,314
Why do you ask?

579
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,506
Pick one book from the shelf.

580
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:38,421
Any book.

581
00:47:39,141 --> 00:47:40,043
Read it to me.

582
00:47:47,285 --> 00:47:48,059
Day.

583
00:47:48,676 --> 00:47:49,676
What are you doing?

584
00:48:12,675 --> 00:48:13,446
Can you read?

585
00:48:14,782 --> 00:48:15,929
Or you want me to help you read?

586
00:48:25,705 --> 00:48:29,041
"Good morning," the little prince responded politely,

587
00:48:29,704 --> 00:48:32,280
although when he turned around he saw nothing.

588
00:48:33,485 --> 00:48:37,253
"I am right here, under the apple tree." the voice said.

589
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:41,603
"I am a fox."

590
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:48,484
"Come and play with me," proposed the little prince.

591
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,057
"I am so unhappy."

592
00:48:56,381 --> 00:48:57,609
"I cannot play with you."

593
00:48:58,547 --> 00:48:59,971
"I am not tamed."

594
00:49:03,928 --> 00:49:07,346
"And now here is my secret:

595
00:49:09,712 --> 00:49:16,913
It is only with the heart that one can see rightly;

596
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,133
what is essential is invisible to the eye."

597
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:26,482
The Little Prince: Chapter 21

598
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,932
We don’t need the interview, Mom.

599
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:36,684
Hire this guy.

600
00:49:37,293 --> 00:49:38,310
Have you lost it, Day?

601
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:39,519
This guy?

602
00:49:39,717 --> 00:49:40,897
How can he take care of you?

603
00:49:42,418 --> 00:49:43,670
You told me to choose.

604
00:49:44,554 --> 00:49:45,565
I chose him.

605
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,432
Hire this guy or hire no one at all.

606
00:49:50,553 --> 00:49:51,373
Well.

607
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,129
I’m sorry.

608
00:49:53,854 --> 00:49:55,340
I’m just here to drop him off.

609
00:49:56,003 --> 00:49:57,097
Since we’re done here,

610
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:57,921
please excuse me.

611
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,057
Wait.

612
00:50:00,468 --> 00:50:01,123
Hold on.

613
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:05,832
Please think about it.

614
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,613
You can give us the answer later.

615
00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:12,420
Sure.

616
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,099
Please think about it.

617
00:50:59,845 --> 00:51:01,434
You can give us the answer later.

618
00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:08,484
Pae is going to sell your car if you don’t give him the money by tomorrow.

619
00:51:08,484 --> 00:51:09,531
It’s Rung’s car.

620
00:51:09,531 --> 00:51:10,539
Not mine.

621
00:51:11,053 --> 00:51:12,621
You’re saying it now.

622
00:51:13,277 --> 00:51:15,277
But you’ll regret it later, Mhok.

623
00:51:16,012 --> 00:51:19,225
You know how much Rung loved this car.

624
00:51:19,678 --> 00:51:21,020
I'll give you more time.

625
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,742
How does six months sound?

626
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:25,543
Spend this time thinking it through.

627
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:31,386
Don’t get discouraged yet.

628
00:51:31,699 --> 00:51:33,684
Some people spend years looking for a job.

629
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:35,305
Only one thing I’m asking.

630
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:37,485
Don’t go back to the same path.

631
00:51:37,836 --> 00:51:39,754
There must be people who give you chances.

632
00:51:57,728 --> 00:51:58,265
Hey.

633
00:52:01,636 --> 00:52:02,428
Almost forgot.

634
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:04,806
You dropped your library member card.

635
00:52:07,931 --> 00:52:08,691
It’s okay.

636
00:52:09,575 --> 00:52:10,309
It’s his.

637
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,452
Let him get it himself.

638
00:52:16,865 --> 00:52:17,509
What?

639
00:52:18,187 --> 00:52:19,543
Should I bring it to you?

640
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:24,396
Don’t.

641
00:52:25,383 --> 00:52:26,423
What are you doing now?

642
00:52:32,165 --> 00:52:32,846
It’s alright.

643
00:52:37,061 --> 00:52:38,298
I’m standing right here.

644
00:53:05,693 --> 00:53:06,492
My name is Mhok.

645
00:53:07,397 --> 00:53:08,484
When should I start?

646
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:13,963
I’ll see you

647
00:53:14,497 --> 00:53:15,228
tomorrow.

648
00:53:39,645 --> 00:53:41,645
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

649
00:53:42,362 --> 00:53:44,588
Your sole responsibility is to look after Day.

650
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,338
I just knew easy jobs with huge pay really existed.

651
00:53:47,462 --> 00:53:48,484
Where is my phone charger?

652
00:53:48,748 --> 00:53:51,365
I classified them so they're easy to find.

653
00:53:51,624 --> 00:53:52,788
This is a tablet charger.

654
00:53:53,724 --> 00:53:54,745
Leave me room.

655
00:53:55,285 --> 00:53:55,935
What?

656
00:53:56,284 --> 00:53:58,148
He’s a badass just like you said, Day.

657
00:53:58,148 --> 00:53:59,520
One week max.

658
00:53:59,894 --> 00:54:00,663
He’ll be out of here.

659
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:03,524
Why did you take off your shirt?

660
00:54:03,524 --> 00:54:06,524
Right after using eye drops, I can see better.

661
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:07,827
Not much though.

662
00:54:08,053 --> 00:54:10,900
But it’s the 10 seconds I can see most clearly.
