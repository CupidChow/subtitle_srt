4
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,173
Let's get the eye pads off you.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,848
Day, can you see me?

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,042
I can't see.

7
00:00:25,364 --> 00:00:28,893
The doctor diagnosed you with an eye infection.

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:30,928
The reason why the tissues don’t fuse together.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,249
What’s her name?

10
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:34,251
The mom's name is Porjai.

11
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:35,736
So the daughter’s name is Poomjai.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,520
You should be proud of yourself for carrying her alone for so long.

13
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:42,156
Aon's friend owns a hotel in Songkhla.

14
00:00:42,156 --> 00:00:45,749
Can I go with Phi Mhok?

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,842
Singha is looking for chefs for his new restaurant.

16
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:51,914
It's your golden opportunity.

17
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:53,444
But it’s in Hawaii.

18
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:54,935
Do you really want me to go?

19
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:56,720
Are you recruited?

20
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,555
No.

21
00:00:58,449 --> 00:00:59,538
He didn't pick me.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,640
Thank you so much for choosing me.

23
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:03,160
But I'm really not up for it.

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,704
Then why did you lie to me?

25
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:09,040
Were you afraid I would get upset to know I'm the one holding you back?

26
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,458
Let's break up.

27
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:17,088
I could see.

28
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:20,069
I used to be able to see.

29
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:27,499
The inability to see might be a big deal.

30
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:31,322
But it’s the big deal you must be able to deal with

31
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:34,297
in order to live on.

32
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:40,928
The important thing is that we must find

33
00:01:41,962 --> 00:01:46,961
what is left for us throughout those times of difficulty.

34
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:58,532
Once we've adjusted, everything will continue as usual.

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,249
People around us must adjust as well.

36
00:02:04,396 --> 00:02:05,485
We all adjust together.

37
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:19,120
After the storm…

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,965
Smile. One, two, three.

39
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:24,245
you will not be the same person anymore.

40
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:29,343
You will know that every cloud has a silver lining,

41
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,012
even if you can’t see it.

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,812
That’s good.

43
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:50,840
Smile.

44
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,245
Okay.

45
00:02:58,743 --> 00:02:59,499
Thank you.

46
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:06,457
Day, Aon is here.

47
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,237
- Master!
- Day is right in front of you.

48
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,388
Thank you.

49
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,224
Whoa.

50
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,808
You’re quite eloquent these days.

51
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:17,294
Why don’t you write a book, Master?

52
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:20,442
Come on. Like it’s so easy.

53
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,839
We must speak for the computer to write.

54
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,531
Then we must recheck.

55
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,516
Difficult.

56
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:30,442
Should we get someone back here to assist you write?

57
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,491
It’s been three years.

58
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:44,480
He must be with someone new by now, Master.

59
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,280
Hey.

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,840
By the way, when will you go to Songkhla again?

61
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,610
Pla would love to see you.

62
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,614
They are a bunch of new tourist attractions.

63
00:03:55,614 --> 00:03:56,975
I promise you a fun trip this time.

64
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:58,953
I’m gonna take you to very good restaurants.

65
00:03:58,953 --> 00:04:01,719
There are also lots of cafés.

66
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,848
Nan, the Chicken Basil is ready.

67
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:23,049
An order for Pad Thai.

68
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,890
Okay.

69
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:25,938
Mhok.

70
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:26,700
Yeah.

71
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,742
Pad Thai sauce.

72
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:28,333
Okay.

73
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:30,212
And dry shrimp.

74
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:30,947
Yeah.

75
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:38,745
Hey, Mhok.

76
00:04:39,068 --> 00:04:40,506
You said you got something urgent.

77
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:41,864
You’re going to miss your flight.

78
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,329
I already packed.

79
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:46,330
I can just change and go.

80
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,666
Listen to me.

81
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,507
I’m letting you go right now.

82
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:50,688
Nan will take it from here.

83
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:51,327
Go.

84
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,853
You sure?

85
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:52,428
Yes!

86
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:54,520
Nan, can I leave this with you?

87
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,080
Sure.

88
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:56,008
Thank you, sir.

89
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:57,276
- Yes.
- See you.

90
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,552
Hey, see you.

91
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:10,802
See you later, sir.

92
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:11,877
See you, Mhok.

93
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:56,040
[Porjai]

94
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:04,257
The groom will be here soon. Please wait a little longer.

95
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:06,860
How much longer, ma’am?

96
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:10,139
I called him. He’s coming from the airport.

97
00:06:10,397 --> 00:06:11,770
Please bear with me a little.

98
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,485
Of course.

99
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:50,405
There he is.

100
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,610
Yes, ma’am.

101
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:02,133
Sorry, darling.

102
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:03,254
I went to see Mom off.

103
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:06,621
Day.

104
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:07,289
Hmm?

105
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:09,009
Mom asked me to give you this.

106
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:10,565
Here.

107
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:14,962
Thanks a lot.

108
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:15,484
Yeah.

109
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:17,661
I’m going straight to the shop.

110
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:20,482
Day, how will you go? Should I drive you?

111
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,380
Come on, Porjai.

112
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:25,801
Are you going to drive me in that wedding dress?

113
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,711
It’s alright. I’ll find my way there.

114
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:28,482
Already booked a ride.

115
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:32,120
May our staff walk you to the escalators?

116
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:34,093
Of course.

117
00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:35,107
Thank you.

118
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:35,782
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

119
00:07:35,782 --> 00:07:36,541
No problem at all.

120
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,291
Come on, you.

121
00:07:39,943 --> 00:07:41,473
Go get change.

122
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:47,537

Oh!

140
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,306
I'm sorry.

00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,164
Thank you.

It's my pleasure.

Here.

144
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,925
I didn't have time to find you a present.

145
00:12:43,072 --> 00:12:44,094
I'm giving you this instead.

146
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:46,289
What is it?

147
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:49,644
Hey!

148
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:52,104
Thanks.

149
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,119
Actually, I’m already happy you’re here.

150
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:57,782
I thought you’d be arrogant and just send me a money envelope.

151
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:01,615
I only came back for my visa extension.

152
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,070
Your wedding is just in my way.

153
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,618
Mhok, have you talked to Day ever?

154
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:13,531
To talk, he needs to unblock my contacts first.

155
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,480
I'm fine with anything.

156
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,524
If he doesn’t want to talk, then we won’t talk.

157
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:24,542
Day is running a bookshop.

158
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,518
A bookshop?

159
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:31,960
With who? Where? How?

160
00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:33,510
You said you didn't want to know.

161
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:38,840
Well, I'm just making conversation.

162
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,560
You talk to me, I talk to you.

163
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:45,400
Do you want the location?

164
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,600
I'll share it with you.

165
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:48,758
No.

166
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:51,293
I'm busy enough with the visa thing.

167
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:52,184
I don't have time to go.

168
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,501
Fine.

169
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,330
Then I guess we’ll never see you there.

170
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:01,927
What is this, darling?

171
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:02,783

You still haven't used up the perfume I gave you?

183
00:15:33,353 --> 00:15:35,794
I only wear it on special occasions.

184
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,995
- Special occasions?
- Mhm.

00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:17,806
I think I'm going to get this one.

188
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:23,178
I don't think the book suits you.

189
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,101
Disagree.

190
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:28,782
Among all the books here, I think this one suits me best.

191
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:30,688
I'm buying it.

192
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:46,849
(Editor's Note: Many books encourage us to put the past behind us and move forward.)

193
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:53,994
(But this book raises the question: if the past was so beautiful,

194
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:57,196
can we simply hold onto that beauty?)

195
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:01,684
Before you read it,

196
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,221
please pay first.

197
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:05,322
Oh,

198
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:07,792
I'm sorry.

199
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:10,648
How should I pay?

200
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:12,513
Here.

201
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:14,173
Please scan.

202
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,427
Still using the same chat ID?

203
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:21,985
I’m sending you the payment slip.

204
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:25,281
Only the payment slip is accepted.

205
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:27,320
No other things.

206
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:30,151
Gosh,

207
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:34,722
the shop owner is moody.

208
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:39,755
I just want to…begin again with the same person.

209
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,048
Phi Mhok.

210
00:17:42,283 --> 00:17:43,475
What?

211
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:46,225
I just read the book title.

212
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:49,588
I haven't said anything yet.

213
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,379
I was going to say

214
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,487
thank you for your purchase.

215
00:17:57,713 --> 00:17:58,962
I'll walk you out.

216
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:01,830
It's my pleasure.

217
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,187
Let's go.

218
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,513
After you.

219
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:12,193
I’m slow.

220
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:43,323
Are you dating someone, Day?

221
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,355
I…

222
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:53,029
You didn't answer.

223
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:56,017
I'll take that as a no.

224
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:01,778
Just go home.

225
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:08,338
I'm not dating anyone either.

226
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:10,759
I'm just saying.

227
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,586
In case you want to know.

228
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:27,717
I could smell it from upstairs.

229
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:30,391
Did Chef Ramhon make us breakfast today?

230
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:32,520
Your mom isn't home.

231
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:34,695
Then who cooked?

232
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:36,281
I did.

233
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:02,526
Wow!

234
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,985
I could smell it from upstairs.

235
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:07,792
Did Chef Ramhon make us breakfast today?

236
00:20:08,378 --> 00:20:09,938
Your mom isn't home.

237
00:20:10,196 --> 00:20:12,289
She took Poomjai to get the vaccine shot.

238
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,568
Then who cooked?

239
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,034
I did.

240
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:23,227
Wow.

241
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:24,006
Day, sit here.

242
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:25,541
These look yummy.

243
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:35,815
Our menu includes Seafood Tom Yum, Sweet and Sour Sausages, Sweet Basil Omelet, and Day's favorite, Chicken Massaman.

244
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:40,209
The glass of water is on your right. The cutlery is at the same spot.

245
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:42,019
And everything is served with white rice today.

246
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:43,567
I know.

247
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:45,657
Mhok.

248
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:49,363
I'm not paying you for your excellent care.

249
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:50,734
Old habits.

250
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:52,691
I always did this, didn't I?

251
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,074
What about the Chicken Massaman, Day’s favorite?

252
00:20:58,074 --> 00:21:00,656
Intentionally made or an old habit?

253
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:02,033
Huh?

254
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:07,057
You've spent too much time with Night.

255
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,085
- What?
- What?

256
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:10,420
Don't drag me into this.

257
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:15,337
Why did you come here?

258
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:18,769
I ran an errand nearby.

259
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:20,306
Wanted to see my niece as well.

260
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:23,668
That's right but my daughter isn't even home.

261
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:29,494
Mhok came back for a short break. He’ll go back soon.

262
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:31,168
When exactly?

263
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:35,010
I'm flying out on the night of your wedding.

264
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:36,132
Late at night.

265
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:45,535
Oh,

266
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,113
Day.

267
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:48,864
The suit shop called.

268
00:21:48,864 --> 00:21:50,378
Your suit is ready to be picked up.

269
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,265
Try it on. If it fits, you can just take it.

270
00:21:53,697 --> 00:21:54,394
Mhm.

271
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:59,727
And…can you take my bridesmaid with you, Day?

272
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:01,323
So you guys can just go to the shop together.

273
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:03,320
Who is it?

274
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,217
Me.

275
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:18,795
Mhok, why are you smiling?

276
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:20,823
You too, Day.

277
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:22,567
I'm not.

278
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:27,771
You're just picking up a suit.

279
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,331
Why so happy, Mhok?

280
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:32,902
Of course, I'm happy.

281
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:35,923
I've been living in a different country for so long. What if I get lost?

282
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:39,377
It's good to have company, isn't it?

283
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:43,265
Is it a good idea?

284
00:22:45,002 --> 00:22:46,870
I don't want to trouble the bridesmaid.

285
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:49,949
No troubles at all.

286
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:52,550
The bridesmaid wants to go.

287
00:22:52,712 --> 00:22:53,668
You should go with him, Day.

288
00:22:58,051 --> 00:22:58,897
Besides,

289
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,696
I think we can get along just fine, Day.

290
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:07,823
Let's eat.

291
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:29,633
Excuse me. We came to pick up the suits.

292
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:35,373
Hello, sir.

293
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,194
We have prepared them for you.

294
00:23:37,194 --> 00:23:39,410
Please try them on before signing the pick-up paper.

295
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,112
- Of course. Thank you.
- Thank you.

296
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:46,183
Mine should be the green one.

297
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:48,364
Okay.

298
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:57,927
Hold it.

299
00:23:58,715 --> 00:23:59,215
Here.

300
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,136
Let me help.

301
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:09,402
It's okay.

302
00:24:09,402 --> 00:24:10,253
Day.

303
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:11,835
Phi Mhok, I can do it myself.

304
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:12,428
Day.

305
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:15,925
You don't have to put up such high walls with me.

306
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:23,136
You know how happy I am when I get to take care of you.

307
00:24:25,555 --> 00:24:27,277
Please don't say anything like this.

308
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:31,228
What if people hear us?

309
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:33,116
Why?

310
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:34,856
I don't even care.

311
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:38,186
When we were boyfriends, I said a lot more than this.

312
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:41,689
Then is then. Now is now.

313
00:24:42,546 --> 00:24:43,897
Stop talking nonsense.

314
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:51,949
Phi Mhok, what are you doing?

315
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:53,290
Phi Mhok.

316
00:24:53,684 --> 00:24:54,918
Have you grown bigger, Day?

317
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:58,741
I think you're getting more masculine.

318
00:25:00,552 --> 00:25:01,258
Really?

319
00:25:01,443 --> 00:25:02,019
Yeah.

320
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,019
I've been doing weight training.

321
00:25:05,557 --> 00:25:07,372
I also have a six-pack.

322
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,400
Not even bragging.

323
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,127
Really?

324
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:10,152
Let me see.

325
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:12,152
Phi Mhok.

326
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:13,904
Phi Mhok.

327
00:25:13,904 --> 00:25:16,125
I can’t give you bear hugs now since you're so big.

328
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:17,218
You're a brawny.

329
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:20,657
If you hug me now, I'll punch you in the face.

330
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,764
I can fight, you know?

331
00:25:24,036 --> 00:25:25,175
Let go.

332
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:27,774
Alright.

333
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:31,256
I know an ex-boyfriend’s boundaries.

334
00:25:33,856 --> 00:25:34,695
Phi Mhok.

335
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:39,215
Don't say things like that.

336
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:42,445
You’re going back in a few days.

337
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:55,304
Hello.

338
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,512
I'm done here.

339
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:00,084
I'll be right there.

340
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:01,592
Sure.

341
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:02,970
Yes.

342
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,606
I have to go.

343
00:26:19,935 --> 00:26:21,101
I think it’s good.

344
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:25,468
I don't make Fish Maw Soup very often in the States.

345
00:26:25,468 --> 00:26:27,289
But the chef here is doing a good job.

346
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,570
Chef Ramhon handled the food list.

347
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,582
Checking for taste adjustments is all that's left.

348
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,359
Of course. We’ll share with you some feedback.

349
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,079
Yes, ma'am.

350
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:36,297
Try this.

351
00:26:36,545 --> 00:26:42,622
You know, Night, a bowl of Fish Maw Soup at my restaurant is like 30 dollars.

352
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,246
Ooh! That's pricey.

353
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:47,257
- They have a higher living expense there.
- Yeah?

354
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:48,333
- Miss Porjai.
- Yes?

355
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,489
The venue is ready for you to have a look at.

356
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:51,352
Oh, right.

357
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:56,724
Thank you.

358
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:57,717
Let's go.

359
00:27:01,808 --> 00:27:04,341
Can you two continue the food tasting?

360
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:07,302
Take note of what you like and what you don't.

361
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:08,096
Help us.

362
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:11,542
I’m the best man or your servant exactly?

363
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:12,723
You keep ordering me around.

364
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:13,926
Do it. Don’t complain.

365
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:14,842
Let's go, darling.

366
00:27:15,848 --> 00:27:19,238
There are more colors of the flowers to choose from.

367
00:27:19,524 --> 00:27:22,097
I think everything tastes good.

368
00:27:22,255 --> 00:27:24,697
Okay. I'll write that down.

369
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:27,007
Are you full?

370
00:27:27,424 --> 00:27:28,297
I am.

371
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:30,906
Here are the samples of the wedding cake.

372
00:27:30,906 --> 00:27:31,845
Should I serve?

373
00:27:32,036 --> 00:27:33,248
Of course. Thank you.

374
00:27:33,531 --> 00:27:35,657
And we think everything tastes good.

375
00:27:35,657 --> 00:27:37,802
Let's stick to it.

376
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:38,789
Of course, sir.

377
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:44,195
Please take these. Thank you.

378
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:59,547
This cake reminds me of that day.

379
00:28:00,822 --> 00:28:02,150
Dessert, the tough part.

380
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:04,163
Want any help with this?

381
00:28:05,657 --> 00:28:06,763
It's okay.

382
00:28:07,984 --> 00:28:08,986
I can eat it myself.

383
00:28:09,845 --> 00:28:12,094
Everybody is created for development.

384
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:19,252
Look.

385
00:28:21,682 --> 00:28:24,748
I can't believe it's been three years.

386
00:28:30,884 --> 00:28:31,681
Mhm.

387
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:33,417
That's true.

388
00:28:34,604 --> 00:28:39,361
We've been broken up for three years.

389
00:28:45,775 --> 00:28:50,657
That day, I didn’t get why you broke up with me at all.

390
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:57,283
But after a while, I understood everything.

391
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:01,808
You were right.

392
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:05,284
It was my fault to feel pity for you.

393
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:18,650
I'm glad that at least we can discuss this today.

394
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:20,549
Like adults.

395
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,098
Mhm.

396
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,817
You know, I only had one thought back then.

397
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,609
I thought you couldn't live without me. You must stick with me.

398
00:29:37,998 --> 00:29:39,089
Look at you now.

399
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:42,940
Your life is going so damn good.

400
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,343
Your life is going so damn good as well.

401
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:56,593
Thank you for breaking up with me then.

402
00:29:58,938 --> 00:30:00,938
You’re the reason I've grown a lot.

403
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:09,826
Stop being dramatic.

404
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:11,703
Time to watch me eat the cake.

405
00:30:12,617 --> 00:30:14,733
I eat so neatly that you will be surprised.

406
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:15,832
Look.

407
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,178
I'm mastered at it now.

408
00:30:31,052 --> 00:30:31,778
So?

409
00:30:41,061 --> 00:30:42,008
I'm sorry.

410
00:30:43,606 --> 00:30:44,659
For what?

411
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:08,997
I'm sorry.

412
00:31:11,221 --> 00:31:12,005
For everything.

413
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:46,880
What you felt then

414
00:31:48,468 --> 00:31:49,889
should just stay in that moment.

415
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,052
Can't I have a second chance?

416
00:31:54,353 --> 00:31:55,450
I'm sorry.

417
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:24,617
Whatever problems you may have, talk to each other.

418
00:32:24,617 --> 00:32:26,724
Try to adjust to one another.

419
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:30,080
Whatever you're upset about, speak up.

420
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:35,223
Some men just don't realize their flaws unless we yell at them.

421
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,368
Mom.

422
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:40,953
You're supposed to give us wishes, not pick at your own son.

423
00:32:40,953 --> 00:32:42,442
I know.

424
00:32:42,442 --> 00:32:45,698
I was about to say that not all men are the same.

425
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:55,133
Porjai, what you encountered in the past might influence you to have lower opinions of men.

426
00:33:00,401 --> 00:33:01,939
I've been there.

427
00:33:03,726 --> 00:33:07,576
I know how difficult it is.

428
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:19,517
But I'm glad that you gave yourself a chance to start fresh.

429
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:35,246
Please take care of my son.

430
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:38,791
If he misbehaves, let me know.

431
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:40,352
I'll deal with him for you.

432
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:43,463
That's enough, Mom.

433
00:33:48,052 --> 00:33:49,163
Thank you.

434
00:33:55,723 --> 00:33:57,118
Mom.

435
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:06,633
That's the right word to call me.

436
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:08,203
I have enough sons.

437
00:34:08,203 --> 00:34:09,990
I want a daughter.

438
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,313
Can I get a hug?

439
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:18,966
Welcome to our family.

440
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,688
Yes, Mom.

441
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:41,361
Your mom is hugging Porjai.

442
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:43,470
The atmosphere is filled with love.

443
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:47,249
I heard that.

444
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:48,939
You don't need to repeat it.

445
00:34:53,538 --> 00:34:55,538
Did you also hear that

446
00:34:56,241 --> 00:35:00,198
we should give ourselves a chance to start fresh?

447
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:05,470
Phi Mhok.

448
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:07,800
Enough already.

449
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:27,596
Pictures of Night and Porjai in Thai traditional costumes.

450
00:35:30,702 --> 00:35:35,299
Night is now wearing a suit and a black leather jacket like a mafia.

451
00:35:37,695 --> 00:35:39,197
So cute.

452
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:42,694
Day.

453
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:43,893
It's me, your dad.

454
00:35:54,983 --> 00:35:56,713
How's the wedding going now?

455
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:58,291
My flight got delayed.

456
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:02,349
And I thought you weren't coming.

457
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:03,889
How could I miss this?

458
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:05,455
It's my son's wedding.

459
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,260
Have you got anything to eat, Dad?

460
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,123
I haven't.

461
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:11,588
I came straight from the airport. Afraid I couldn’t make it in time.

462
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,561
Then eat first.

463
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:25,229
Good evening to all honorable guests.

464
00:36:26,123 --> 00:36:29,937
I believe everyone here knows Chef Ramhon, my mother.

465
00:36:31,794 --> 00:36:35,793
My father, however, is unknown to you.

466
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:39,071
So I'd like to take advantage of this occasion to…

467
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:45,688
ask my father up on stage to wish me a happy marriage.

468
00:36:46,355 --> 00:36:48,035
A round of applause, please.

469
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:57,945
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, sir.

470
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:10,700
On my way here, I prayed not to get dragged on stage to give a speech.

471
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:13,678
But here I am.

472
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:17,207
Dang! How right I was.

473
00:37:18,673 --> 00:37:25,313
If my son wants my wishes, of course, I'll be a good dad and grant them.

474
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:29,099
Actually, I have no worries about him.

475
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:35,352
My son here is a far better man than I am.

476
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,655
I simply hope he is a better husband than me.

477
00:37:44,813 --> 00:37:46,635
A better father than me.

478
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:51,239
Life always throws choices at you.

479
00:37:52,176 --> 00:37:58,587
And I believe my son will not make the wrong ones.

480
00:38:01,521 --> 00:38:02,916
Thank you, Dad.

481
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:16,670
Well.

482
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,389
There's one more person I'd like to invite here on stage.

483
00:38:20,389 --> 00:38:22,117
My younger brother.

484
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,473
Day.

485
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:26,704
Come up here.

486
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:29,198
Come on up.

487
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:35,107
Day, I can take you.

488
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:36,972
That's okay, ma’am. Let me take him.

489
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,119
Come on.

490
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:57,711
You said you hadn't eaten.

491
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:06,630
As you all can see, I'm blind.

492
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:13,658
Life as a blind man isn’t easy.

493
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:22,591
But it would be even more difficult without Night, my older brother.

494
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:29,113
We've been fighting ever since we were kids.

495
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:35,534
I’ve told myself many times that I want to be an only child.

496
00:39:38,097 --> 00:39:39,386
That was a joke.

497
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:47,231
No matter how bad we fight, I still want him as my older brother.

498
00:39:50,563 --> 00:39:52,385
Thank you, dude.

499
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,313
You’re welcome.

500
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:12,381
Now that you have a wife, don't forget about your little brother here.

501
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:17,665
Thank you on his behalf.

502
00:40:18,627 --> 00:40:19,993
Come on.

503
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:38,063
Are you going straight back to your table?

504
00:40:40,046 --> 00:40:43,647
Can you see if my mom and my dad are still there?

505
00:40:44,752 --> 00:40:45,898
They are.

506
00:40:46,229 --> 00:40:47,793
They’re having a conversation about something.

507
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:54,391
Then don't go back just yet.

508
00:40:57,932 --> 00:40:59,932
Oh, one more thing.

509
00:40:59,932 --> 00:41:00,875
Hmm?

510
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:05,935
When you guide me around, touching my arm would be enough.

511
00:41:08,136 --> 00:41:10,136
Oops. Sorry.

512
00:41:11,195 --> 00:41:13,195
I haven't done this in a long time.

513
00:41:13,195 --> 00:41:14,582
I forgot all about it.

514
00:41:16,293 --> 00:41:21,281
Ever since we've known and loved each other,

515
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:24,488
Porjai is like my safe haven.

516
00:41:26,074 --> 00:41:31,881
She always says I have my own good qualities.

517
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:40,229
And she never asks me to be more than who I am.

518
00:41:43,531 --> 00:41:44,891
Thank you, darling.

519
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,404
Well…

520
00:42:02,941 --> 00:42:13,443
Ever since I was pregnant with Poomjai, I’d told myself I wouldn't fall in love again.

521
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:23,311
And when he asked me to be his girlfriend, I said I wasn't ready to date anyone.

522
00:42:25,054 --> 00:42:30,673
But then he asked for a second chance.

523
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,907
Not for him,

524
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:39,128
but for me to open up and fall in love.

525
00:42:42,152 --> 00:42:50,993
He makes me realize that everyone should get a second chance.

526
00:42:53,395 --> 00:42:59,793
Especially a second chance to make themselves happy.

527
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:03,001
Thank you.

528
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,774
A second chance is good

529
00:43:25,962 --> 00:43:27,286
if we give it to the right person.

530
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:39,806
Porjai wouldn't be this happy if she didn't open her heart to someone again.

531
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:52,833
Would you like to dance with me?

532
00:43:55,612 --> 00:43:57,150
Sure.

533
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:18,702
You dance a lot better.

534
00:44:20,704 --> 00:44:23,522
I figured I could use some preparation.

535
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:26,041
In case I'm given a second chance.

536
00:44:28,742 --> 00:44:34,299
If you get money each time the word ‘second chance’ comes out of your mouth,  you’d be a rich man by now.

537
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:44,290
This is a shame.

538
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:49,182
The last time we danced together, I could still blurrily see.

539
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,153
How did you see me then? Do tell.

540
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,500
You were tense.

541
00:44:58,823 --> 00:45:00,823
Your palms were all sweaty.

542
00:45:05,124 --> 00:45:08,832
And do you know how I feel?

543
00:45:10,862 --> 00:45:12,649
Then or now?

544
00:45:17,561 --> 00:45:18,814
It's a shame.

545
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:27,158
If you could see, you would know that from then to now,

546
00:45:29,174 --> 00:45:31,174
my feelings for you remain.

547
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:52,946
Phi Mhok,

548
00:45:54,938 --> 00:46:02,151
no matter what, you will need to fly back to work anyway.

549
00:46:06,123 --> 00:46:07,874
What you felt then

550
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:10,854
should just stay in that moment.

551
00:46:19,115 --> 00:46:21,328
Can't I have a second chance?

552
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:30,633
I'm sorry.

553
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,786
Okay.

554
00:47:10,255 --> 00:47:11,650
Day.

555
00:47:13,055 --> 00:47:15,055
Why are you sitting here all by yourself?

556
00:47:16,097 --> 00:47:17,101
Where is Mhok?

557
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,218
I haven't even talked to him yet.

558
00:47:21,648 --> 00:47:23,079
He's gone, Mom.

559
00:47:24,655 --> 00:47:26,086
Phi Mhok is gone.

560
00:47:27,162 --> 00:47:28,700
What happened?

561
00:47:29,268 --> 00:47:31,837
He didn't seem like he wanted to leave yet.

562
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:37,189
Mom.

563
00:47:38,658 --> 00:47:40,196
I don't get it.

564
00:47:41,794 --> 00:47:44,292
It's not like I wasn't happy with him.

565
00:47:45,913 --> 00:47:53,498
But how do I know if I give him a second chance, he won't repeat what he did?

566
00:47:55,037 --> 00:47:58,033
I can't live with this feeling for the rest of my life.

567
00:48:01,195 --> 00:48:05,329
I'm confused, Mom.

568
00:48:20,781 --> 00:48:23,172
We don't know the future, Day,

569
00:48:23,731 --> 00:48:26,473
whether we can see just fine or are blind.

570
00:48:27,826 --> 00:48:29,826
It's just how love is.

571
00:48:35,173 --> 00:48:37,458
You want to be normal, don't you?

572
00:48:38,511 --> 00:48:41,365
This is love that normal people have.

573
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:48,641
We don't know if it's head or tail

574
00:48:50,654 --> 00:48:52,512
but we choose to take the risk

575
00:48:53,095 --> 00:48:55,095
in order to step forward.

576
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,601
Are you ready to take the risk?

577
00:49:01,735 --> 00:49:03,735
Mom, what time is it?

578
00:49:03,976 --> 00:49:05,593
It's 9.

579
00:49:05,794 --> 00:49:07,474
His flight is at 10:40.

580
00:49:07,894 --> 00:49:09,894
If you go now, I think you might make it.

581
00:49:09,894 --> 00:49:11,044
Night.

582
00:49:11,554 --> 00:49:13,554
So, are you going or not?

583
00:49:14,742 --> 00:49:16,457
What will you do, Day?

584
00:49:17,657 --> 00:49:20,760
A baddie like that doesn’t walk into your life every day.

585
00:49:21,176 --> 00:49:22,571
Porjai.

586
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,269
I'm going.

587
00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:25,230
Then get up.

588
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,219
Chop-chop.

589
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:27,279
Come.

590
00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:28,360
Take care of your little brother.

591
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,246
Sure, Mom.

592
00:49:33,182 --> 00:49:34,968
Day, be careful.

593
00:49:34,968 --> 00:49:35,934
Come on.

594
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,700
Darling, take him with you.

595
00:49:44,953 --> 00:49:46,491
Maybe you should call Mhok.

596
00:49:46,491 --> 00:49:48,127
I am but he doesn't pick up.

597
00:49:48,483 --> 00:49:49,593
Get in.

598
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,768
Mind your head.

599
00:49:51,768 --> 00:49:52,766
Come on, Day.

600
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:01,204
Are we okay?

601
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,776
Faster.

602
00:50:09,776 --> 00:50:11,153
Your brother is anxious here.

603
00:50:11,153 --> 00:50:13,858
Night, can't we go faster?

604
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:15,395
I'm going as fast as I can.

605
00:50:15,395 --> 00:50:17,193
Faster than this and we'll be flying.

606
00:50:17,193 --> 00:50:19,208
I'm afraid we won't make it in time.

607
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,524
We might see the next life before we see the airport.

608
00:50:21,524 --> 00:50:22,733
You're exaggerating.

609
00:50:23,634 --> 00:50:25,513
Night, what time is it?

610
00:50:26,174 --> 00:50:27,605
9:50.

611
00:50:28,283 --> 00:50:29,322
I think we can still make it.

612
00:50:29,322 --> 00:50:31,037
We can.

613
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,217
Quickly.

614
00:50:35,217 --> 00:50:36,619
There’s traffic.

615
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,326
We’re going fastest here.

616
00:50:38,928 --> 00:50:40,928
[Suvarnabhumi Airport]

617
00:50:46,754 --> 00:50:47,971
Here you go, ma’am.

618
00:50:57,104 --> 00:50:59,566
May I have your passport for check-in, please?

619
00:51:10,518 --> 00:51:11,590
Sir?

620
00:51:12,871 --> 00:51:13,799
Sorry.

621
00:51:23,529 --> 00:51:24,782
Here you go, sir.

622
00:51:40,354 --> 00:51:41,793
I don’t know. Let’s just go.

623
00:51:45,914 --> 00:51:47,203
Just for a second, sir.

624
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,052
Let's go, Day.

625
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:52,109
We're sorry, sir.

626
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,020
Come on.

627
00:51:59,058 --> 00:52:01,058
Darling, try calling him again.

628
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:03,123
Are you okay?

629
00:52:03,123 --> 00:52:05,091
Which gate is he going to?

630
00:52:05,091 --> 00:52:06,720
Let's get inside first.

631
00:52:11,734 --> 00:52:12,880
Wow, this is a lot.

632
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,529
Which flight is he catching?

633
00:52:21,175 --> 00:52:22,267
I’ve got it.

634
00:52:23,175 --> 00:52:24,439
It’s the counter R16.

635
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:26,349
Let’s do this.

636
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:27,868
You try the Information.

637
00:52:27,868 --> 00:52:29,247
We'll go that way.

638
00:52:29,247 --> 00:52:30,707
- Okay?
- Okay.

639
00:52:30,707 --> 00:52:31,846
Let's go, Day.

640
00:52:32,202 --> 00:52:33,178
This way.

641
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:37,237
Mhok.

642
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:38,991
Phi Mhok.

643
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:40,181
Mhok.

644
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:44,622
Excuse me, ma'am.

645
00:52:44,622 --> 00:52:46,581
Can you make an announcement for a missing person?

646
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:47,590
No, ma’am.

647
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:50,544
We only do official announcements here. I’m sorry.

648
00:52:50,544 --> 00:52:53,857
But, ma’am, it’s official here. Look at my dress.

649
00:52:53,857 --> 00:52:57,113
My husband stole all the wedding money envelopes and is running off to live with his mistress.

650
00:52:57,113 --> 00:52:58,386
Please, ma’am.

651
00:52:58,386 --> 00:52:59,793
Look at me.

652
00:52:59,793 --> 00:53:02,130
I'm dragging him back to pay for this.

653
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,360
Please ma'am. Please help.

654
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,667
Please.

655
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:06,447

00:53:08,024 --> 00:53:09,758
He’s not here.

658
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:11,400

659
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,002

660
00:53:13,002 --> 00:53:14,593
Day is here to see you.

661
00:53:14,593 --> 00:53:15,874
Show yourself.

00:53:15,874 --> 00:53:16,921
Was that Porjai’s voice?

663
00:53:16,921 --> 00:53:18,104
Heck yeah.

664
00:53:18,438 --> 00:53:19,833
Hey! Over there.

665
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:22,980
Ma’am, please stop. I don’t want to get fired.

We’re here.

667

Excuse me.

668
00:53:28,018 --> 00:53:30,693
Has the flight TWL731 taken off?

669
00:53:30,693 --> 00:53:33,002
Ah, the aircraft already left the gate.

670
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:38,233
And can you please check if any passenger is missing the flight or not showing up?

671
00:53:38,233 --> 00:53:39,048
That’s right.

672
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:39,873
Please help.

673
00:53:39,873 --> 00:53:40,847
Just a moment, please.

So?

675
00:53:44,053 --> 00:53:45,173
Anyone?

676
00:53:45,946 --> 00:53:47,433
No, sir.

677
00:53:50,433 --> 00:53:52,433
Can you please check again?

678
00:53:52,433 --> 00:53:53,723
It might be some kind of mistake.

679
00:53:53,723 --> 00:53:56,653
Please take a look closely.

680
00:54:26,059 --> 00:54:27,597
It’s alright, Day.

681
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,714
It will be okay.

683
00:54:30,499 --> 00:54:32,890
I forgot something upstairs. I need to go grab it.

Just come.

Wasn’t your wedding over?

690
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:04,630
Or they just didn’t turn the music off?

691
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:08,595
The event was over

692
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:10,854
but I asked them to leave the music on.

693
00:55:11,486 --> 00:55:12,707
Phi Mhok.

694
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,055
Oh.

00:55:14,526 --> 00:55:16,135
That was loud.

00:55:17,131 --> 00:55:17,971
Hey.

697
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:22,878
Come a little closer you might kiss me.

698
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:37,499
Mr. Former Employer,

699
00:55:37,954 --> 00:55:41,448
care to dance to one more song with me?

700
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:46,589
Of course.

701
00:55:56,399 --> 00:55:58,399
I’ve told you before, haven’t l?

702
00:55:59,741 --> 00:56:04,694
When I dream, my vision is so clear.

703
00:56:06,517 --> 00:56:11,363
So clear that I am mad at myself that they are just dreams.

704
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:33,275
Phi Mhok.

705
00:57:33,631 --> 00:57:34,689
Hmm?

706
00:57:35,616 --> 00:57:37,412
If this was a dream,

707
00:57:38,657 --> 00:57:40,147
I wouldn’t want to wake up.

708
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:43,682
You’re not dreaming, Day.

709
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:45,744
I’m really standing right here.

710
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:50,352
I thought you left.

711
00:57:50,352 --> 00:57:51,370
What?

712
00:57:51,619 --> 00:57:52,765
Do you want me to leave?

713
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:54,965
I don’t.

There may be a second chance for people to make the wrong decision.

717
00:58:10,315 --> 00:58:11,793
Who knows, right?

718
00:58:14,488 --> 00:58:16,773
You banned me from saying that word.

719
00:58:17,252 --> 00:58:18,683
Here you are saying it yourself.

720
00:58:20,607 --> 00:58:21,967
You’re right.

721
00:58:22,981 --> 00:58:24,696
I don’t want you to say it anymore.

722
00:58:26,453 --> 00:58:28,026
I’ll be the one saying it.

723
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:35,793
I…

724
00:58:38,889 --> 00:58:42,027
I want a second chance for myself.

725
00:58:43,246 --> 00:58:48,056
Will you please be with me once again?

726
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:53,406
Can’t you tell if I will?

00:59:21,931 --> 00:59:23,362
I promise

729
00:59:24,867 --> 00:59:29,286
I won’t repeat the same mistake.

730
00:59:30,603 --> 00:59:34,417
And I’ll never hurt you again.

731
00:59:47,156 --> 00:59:48,587
And I promise

732
00:59:50,221 --> 00:59:53,039
I’ll never love you less than I already do.

733
00:59:56,493 --> 00:59:59,027
I never love you less than I already do.

734
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:03,231
I know that.

737
01:00:37,147 --> 01:00:42,206
A life dedicated to taking the best care of someone is so meaningful.

738

Right?

739
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:56,866
Thank you.

740
01:02:11,178 --> 01:02:14,213
3 YEARS EARLIER

741
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:30,795
I can see now, Phi.

742
01:02:32,126 --> 01:02:33,463
I can see.

743
01:02:34,273 --> 01:02:35,157
Phi Mhok.

744
01:02:36,273 --> 01:02:37,522
I can see now.

745
01:02:40,804 --> 01:02:42,220
I’m so happy for you, Day.

746
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,530
I finally get to see your face clearly.

747
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:58,348
Hello! My mom is here too.

748
01:02:58,348 --> 01:02:59,342
You only care about your boyfriend.

749
01:03:00,567 --> 01:03:02,567
Mom.

750
01:03:03,101 --> 01:03:04,623
Congrats, son.

751
01:03:04,623 --> 01:03:05,649
Thank you.

752
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:06,874
I missed you.

753
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,106
I’m Porjai.

754
01:03:14,008 --> 01:03:16,802
Porjai! And where is Poomjai?

755
01:03:16,802 --> 01:03:17,611
At home.

756
01:03:18,881 --> 01:03:20,483
So am I pretty in person?

757
01:03:20,483 --> 01:03:21,661
You are.

758
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:24,103
What now?

759
01:03:24,103 --> 01:03:25,000
I’m blushing.

760
01:03:36,198 --> 01:03:39,021
(I have read Last Twilight countless times.)

761
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:46,833
(I always wondered how Me would live if she had a normal life.)

762
01:03:48,467 --> 01:03:49,962
Time for food.

763
01:03:50,206 --> 01:03:51,941
(I couldn’t think of the answer then.)

764
01:03:52,794 --> 01:03:56,731
(Life amidst the dilemma caused me to forget

765
01:03:57,532 --> 01:04:01,390
what it was like to live a normal life

766
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:04,923
or how happy I could be.)

767
01:04:08,061 --> 01:04:13,883
(When I finished Last Twilight for the first time, it was like my heart was shattered to pieces.)

768
01:04:14,645 --> 01:04:16,937
(I had always imagined myself as Me.)

769
01:04:17,698 --> 01:04:20,972
(If she disappeared, I must also disappear.)

770
01:04:21,879 --> 01:04:29,267
(But eventually, I realized that everyone had their unique tale to tell.)

771
01:04:31,606 --> 01:04:37,401
(We were made to discover our own preferred version of the novel’s finale.)

772
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:44,002
(I consider myself lucky to have gone past the worst page in my novel.)

773
01:04:44,729 --> 01:04:47,047
(But I don’t believe that this is the end.)

774
01:04:47,623 --> 01:04:49,623
(I’m still turning the pages.)

775
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:26,951
Dad. Mom.

776
01:05:28,145 --> 01:05:28,954
Rung.

777
01:05:30,562 --> 01:05:32,960
This is Day, my boyfriend.

778
01:05:33,626 --> 01:05:35,386
Don’t worry about me anymore.

779
01:05:35,777 --> 01:05:36,901
I have someone who takes care of me now.

780
01:05:48,307 --> 01:05:53,173
A life dedicated to taking the best care of someone is so meaningful.

781
01:05:54,128 --> 01:05:54,959
Right?

782
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:15,342
We’re going to go now.

783
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:16,489
Will visit again.

784
01:06:19,362 --> 01:06:20,327
Let’s go.

785
01:06:36,835 --> 01:06:39,021
Poomjai, pretty girl.

786
01:06:39,715 --> 01:06:40,945
Eat some veggies.

787
01:06:40,945 --> 01:06:43,051
- Eat vegetables so you’ll be healthy.
- Eat more, Mom.

788
01:06:43,051 --> 01:06:45,552
No. I don’t like veggies.

789
01:06:46,905 --> 01:06:47,826
Come here.

790
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:49,675
Papa will eat it for you.

791
01:06:50,017 --> 01:06:50,959
You’re Papa’s little girl, aren’t you?

792
01:06:50,959 --> 01:06:52,522
Here. Papa will eat it.

793
01:06:52,707 --> 01:06:56,034
Should I make a spinach dish for you next time?

794
01:06:56,034 --> 01:06:57,188
You like spinach, don’t you?

795
01:06:57,188 --> 01:06:57,874
Yes, please.

796
01:06:57,874 --> 01:06:59,442
I like spinach soup.

797
01:07:01,566 --> 01:07:04,150
Yeah, also Grandma’s little girl.

798
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,097
You want some bread?

799
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:09,346
Creamy Pasta with Seafood is ready.

800
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,109
Wow!

801
01:07:12,902 --> 01:07:15,666
I am adding it to this month’s menu.

802
01:07:15,941 --> 01:07:17,543
I’d love to hear your opinion.

803
01:07:20,141 --> 01:07:22,141
The restaurant owner must love you very much.

804
01:07:22,141 --> 01:07:24,048
You come up with a new menu every month.

805
01:07:24,048 --> 01:07:24,829
Of course.

806
01:07:25,728 --> 01:07:27,946
Mom, please taste it for Phi Mhok.

807
01:07:31,574 --> 01:07:33,415
The colors are looking good.

808
01:07:34,924 --> 01:07:36,207
Let me try.

809
01:07:38,331 --> 01:07:39,588
Do you want this, baby?

810
01:07:51,141 --> 01:07:54,229
Tell the owner to set the price high.

811
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,470
It will be a best-selling dish.

812
01:07:57,618 --> 01:07:58,904
Uncle Mhok is great, huh?

813
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:00,308
Thank you, Chef.

814
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:03,753
You can call me Mom.

815
01:08:06,509 --> 01:08:08,031
Yes, Mom.

816
01:08:16,502 --> 01:08:17,718
Now you guys try it.

817
01:08:18,249 --> 01:08:19,537
It’s so good.

818
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:22,852
Uncle Mhok, can I have it too?

819
01:08:22,852 --> 01:08:24,268
Aww!

820
01:08:26,948 --> 01:08:27,620
Come here.

821
01:08:27,625 --> 01:08:28,658
What do you want to eat, Poomjai?

822
01:08:31,737 --> 01:08:32,704
Do you want some french fries?

823
01:08:34,387 --> 01:08:35,158
Want some?

824
01:08:35,526 --> 01:08:36,543
Have some vegetables.

825
01:08:36,925 --> 01:08:38,315
For the other one in your tummy.

826
01:08:41,947 --> 01:08:42,572
Oops!

827
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:44,664
The baby is kicking my hand.

828
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:45,686
Really?

829
01:09:00,373 --> 01:09:02,373
Whoo-hoo!!

830
01:09:07,228 --> 01:09:08,480
Isn’t it beautiful?

831
01:09:08,984 --> 01:09:09,732
It is.

832
01:09:11,318 --> 01:09:12,479
Let’s sit over here.

833
01:09:25,351 --> 01:09:29,083
What do you suppose the sunlight in Last Twilight symbolizes?

834
01:09:32,277 --> 01:09:33,720
I think it’s the eyes.

835
01:09:34,732 --> 01:09:37,263
The author has a daughter who was going blind.

836
01:09:38,191 --> 01:09:39,660
In the end, his daughter went completely blind.

837
01:09:40,243 --> 01:09:41,659
That’s why he wrote the ending like that.

838
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,149
But I think it symbolizes hope.

839
01:09:51,497 --> 01:09:54,426
Everybody is just like Me.

840
01:09:55,706 --> 01:09:59,426
We live to pursue hope in life.

841
01:10:03,952 --> 01:10:05,527
When did you start seeing the light, Day?

842
01:10:08,521 --> 01:10:11,689
Ever since you came into my life, I guess.

843
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:17,090
That’s the most beautiful love confession ever.

844
01:10:20,405 --> 01:10:24,289
It's your reward for taking me up here.

845
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:26,586
Saying love won’t hurt.

846
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,820
Oh, please.

847
01:10:30,237 --> 01:10:33,272
You hated my guts at first, remember?

848
01:10:33,272 --> 01:10:36,915
Come on. Don’t talk like you liked me so much then.

849
01:10:37,372 --> 01:10:38,947
You always pranked me.

850
01:10:42,743 --> 01:10:43,841
When did you fall for me?

851
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,141
I want to know.

852
01:10:47,156 --> 01:10:47,925
Not telling.

853
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:49,209
You tell me first.

854
01:10:49,962 --> 01:10:51,250
You liked me first.

855
01:10:51,383 --> 01:10:52,161
What?

856
01:10:52,745 --> 01:10:54,303
How do you know I liked you first?

857
01:10:55,657 --> 01:10:57,546
Then who kissed me?

858
01:10:59,427 --> 01:11:04,214
And then he said, “Do you still think I feel pity for you?”

859
01:11:06,281 --> 01:11:07,856
Handsome talk.

860
01:11:11,037 --> 01:11:11,932
Well.

861
01:11:14,533 --> 01:11:15,426
I’m handsome, aren’t I?

862
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:20,999
No.

863
01:11:25,735 --> 01:11:27,125
Fine, not handsome.

864
01:11:30,222 --> 01:11:31,202
But I love you.

865
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:38,273
I love you too.

866
01:11:39,426 --> 01:11:40,512
Come on. Tell me.

867
01:11:40,512 --> 01:11:41,725
When did you like me?

868
01:11:43,414 --> 01:11:44,387
I want to know.

869
01:11:45,193 --> 01:11:46,211
When?

870
01:11:48,587 --> 01:11:50,481
The feelings gradually piled up.

871
01:11:51,918 --> 01:11:53,761
Looking back,

872
01:11:54,876 --> 01:11:56,521
the next thing I knew, I liked you more and more,

873
01:11:57,052 --> 01:11:58,007
every day.

874
01:12:00,051 --> 01:12:01,880
Is that what you wanted to hear?

875
01:12:17,245 --> 01:12:18,927
You completely changed my life, Day.

876
01:12:18,927 --> 01:12:19,814
You know that?

877
01:12:24,183 --> 01:12:26,183
You completely changed my life too.

878
01:12:31,284 --> 01:12:32,329
Beautiful, don’t you think?

879
01:12:40,617 --> 01:12:42,192
So you’ve seen everything you've wanted to see?

880
01:12:47,135 --> 01:12:47,926
Not yet.

881
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,205
There is still the last image.

882
01:13:04,427 --> 01:13:05,139
No.

883
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:08,736
There is no one-palm distance anymore.

884
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:13,215
And this will not be the last image that you’ll see.

885
01:13:15,065 --> 01:13:17,622
I’ll stay here for you to look at forever.

886
01:13:37,589 --> 01:13:38,687
I love you, Day.

887
01:13:40,195 --> 01:13:42,646
I love you too, Phi Mhok.
