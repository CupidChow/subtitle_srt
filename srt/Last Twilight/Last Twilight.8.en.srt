4
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:20,849
If you cross the line and hit on me,

5
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:23,080
you're fired.

6
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:30,795
If you want us to be the same, then why can't we run together?

7
00:00:33,392 --> 00:00:34,250
I'm single now.

8
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:35,440
Are you flirting with me?

9
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,560
My friend is looking for a lead mechanic at his garage.

10
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:40,036
In case you're interested.

11
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:42,883
Once you're tired of the caretaker job, you can contact him.

12
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:45,213
Of course.

13
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:46,232
You're leaving me soon.

14
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:47,595
Why would you think that?

15
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:51,417
Because you're doing all this for that car, right?

16
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:53,706
We will reach the finish line in 50 meters.

17
00:00:53,747 --> 00:00:54,966
Once we get there,

18
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:57,540
I'll ask you to be my boyfriend.

19
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:04,247
Day!

20
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:07,583
Will you be my boyfriend?

21
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:09,047
Fine, I'll be your boyfriend.

22
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:10,340
Phi.

23
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:12,014
Why can't I see you?

24
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:13,982
- It's all dark.
- Day.

25
00:01:13,982 --> 00:01:15,348
- Why can't I see anything?
- Day.

26
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:16,119
Day, calm down.

27
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:16,836
Day.

28
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:08,596
Phi Mhok, what are you doing?

29
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:13,103
I’m just checking if you’re back to seeing things.

30
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:15,050
Not entirely the same.

31
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:19,171
But at least it’s no blackout like it was at the marathon.

32
00:02:21,828 --> 00:02:23,712
Maybe you were just tired that day?

33
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:24,969
Your vision became blurry.

34
00:02:28,728 --> 00:02:29,760
You might be right.

35
00:02:31,237 --> 00:02:33,237
We'll find out when I go to the doctor on Saturday.

36
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,449
Why does it have to be now?

37
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:52,840
- (If you’re watching this video, please know that you’re in trouble.)
- Aon and Pla?

38
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,291
Because you’re our special guest.

39
00:02:55,868 --> 00:03:00,528
That's because we're about to become husband and wife.

40
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:06,000
If you want to give us a present, please know we only accept books.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,208
Any book you want us to read.

42
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,042
But we accept money envelopes too.

43
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:14,298
We will share with you our location.Bye.

44
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:16,404
Bye.

45
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,056
That’s great.

46
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:25,713
The event is held in Songkhla.

47
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,984
My mom doesn’t like me going out in general.

48
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,266
Now with these eyes, it’ll be even more difficult.

49
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:42,015
Do you want to go though?

50
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:45,252
Of course, I do.

51
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,331
It’s Aon’s wedding.

52
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,941
I’d love to attend.

53
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:54,296
What if I say I’ll do whatever to take you there?

54
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:56,160
Will you trust me on that?

55
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,750
Really?

56
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:04,947
Well, if my boyfriend wants to,

57
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,159
Songkhla won’t be a problem.

58
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:10,254
Phi Mhok.

59
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:12,594
Don’t say that. People can hear.

60
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:15,173
No one else is here.

61
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:22,309
Hand off me.

62
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,548
Hand off.

63
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,513
Trust me.

64
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,862
My boyfriend will be fine.

65
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,837
Please be still.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,388
Let me see the other one.

67
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,638
Alright.

68
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:53,840
The patient's cornea has deteriorated since the last time we checked.

69
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:56,789
His vision might gradually weaken.

70
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:58,698
We might have to spare our hearts for the unfortunate.

71
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,497
What’s the worst thing that can happen, doctor?

72
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:15,014
You might not be able to see again for the rest of your life.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,925
But that's not going to be soon, is it, doctor?

74
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't think I can give you an exact time.

75
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:38,157
However, compared to similar cases, I believe you should have roughly three months.

76
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:00,593
Do you have any suggestions for me, doctor?

77
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:08,964
If I were you, I would do anything I've always wanted to do but never have.

78
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:05,937
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

79
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:07,675
Day.

80
00:07:09,149 --> 00:07:10,355
Are you really going?

81
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:12,412
Don't.

82
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:14,711
You can give them the money envelope.

83
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:17,657
Mom.

84
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:21,566
Aon is the first friend I've had since I became blind.

85
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:25,362
Are you really not letting me go to congratulate them?

86
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:27,710
You're not blind yet.

87
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,857
Don't say that again.

88
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:35,561
What if you go and something happens to you along the way?

89
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:40,052
If you're so worried, why don't you come with me?

90
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:41,777
Day.

91
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:44,010
It's very short notice. I can't go.

92
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,899
What about the flight and hotel?

93
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,830
And my work has been confirmed.

94
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:53,827
I'm sorry that my sight can’t wait for your schedule to become available.

95
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:57,195
Day, my son.

96
00:07:58,254 --> 00:08:03,925
I promise after I'm done with this work, I'll take you wherever you want to go.

97
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:04,614
Please.

98
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:05,770
Just wait for me.

99
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:09,739
It's okay.

100
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,366
By the time your work is done,

101
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,578
I'll be completely blind.

102
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:47,465
Mom won't let me go to Aon’s wedding.

103
00:08:48,342 --> 00:08:49,535
She said it's too far away

104
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:50,804
and dangerous.

105
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:56,760
It really is far away.

106
00:08:58,697 --> 00:09:01,111
But if I'm going with you, it shouldn’t be dangerous, right?

107
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:03,486
I'll try reasoning with her.

108
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,096
You sure?

109
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:11,725
Yes.

110
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:14,276
I gave you the promise, didn't I?

111
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:18,454
But my boldness should get a little reward from you.

112
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:24,744
Phi Mhok.

113
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:28,117
You're just the most dangerous thing.

114
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,471
It's me.

115
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,772
You don't have to ask her.

116
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:39,473
I did.

117
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:48,421
Thank him.

118
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:52,960
But Mom said I must be the one who takes you there.

119
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,881
Then I'm not going.

120
00:10:01,782 --> 00:10:02,629
Up to you then.

121
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,563
I'm not forcing you to.

122
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:24,523
Day.

123
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,539
Have you picked the book you want to give to Master Aon?

124
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:28,855
It's here.

125
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:31,907
Here.

126
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:33,424
This one.

127
00:10:36,922 --> 00:10:40,210
I'm a little sad to let it go. It’s my favorite.

128
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:45,152
But it should be a present for my beloved big bro.

129
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:47,331
Wait.

130
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:48,637
Beloved big bro?

131
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:52,749
I thought that position was solely mine.

132
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:55,896
Ah.

133
00:10:56,598 --> 00:10:57,817
You want to be my big bro?

134
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:00,448
I'm kidding.

135
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:02,273
Your boyfriend, of course.

136
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:05,032
Otherwise, why would I buy these?

137
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:08,183
Ta-da.

138
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:09,955
Couple keychains.

139
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,800
Yours is with the letter D.

140
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,062
Touch it.

141
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:15,986
I have mine too.

142
00:11:16,362 --> 00:11:17,248
It's with the letter M.

143
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:20,587
I'll hang them on our bags

144
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:22,644
so you know which one is which.

145
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:23,659
Okay?

146
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,541
Never thought a baddie would have such a cute little side.

147
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,504
Of course, I do.

148
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:38,185
Hey, guys.

149
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:40,506
Are we all set?

150
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:42,902
Yes, we are.

151
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:44,020
Okay.

152
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,785
We should hit the road.

153
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:48,000
Day, you take the front seat.

154
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:51,184
No. I'll sit in the back.

155
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:54,441
Day.

156
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,400
Night, I'll sit with you in the front.

157
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:00,984
It's fine.

158
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:04,897
Day, if you don't take the passenger seat, I won't go.

159
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:12,758
Day, come on.

160
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:24,961
Oh.

161
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:29,662
Do you want to know why I have to sit here?

162
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:31,931
Tell you why.

163
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:33,584
Because I'm freaking blind.

164
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:57,864
Are you hot?

165
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,533
Should I turn the temperature down?

166
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:01,662
Huh?

167
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:09,676
Night.

168
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,374
Please turn it down. I feel hot too.

169
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:19,585
Phi Mhok.

170
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,924
Is there a gas station around?

171
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:24,315
I want to use the bathroom.

172
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:27,643
Can you wait a little longer?

173
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:30,000
We should reach a decent gas station soon.

174
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,976
I'll make a stop for you.

175
00:13:39,388 --> 00:13:41,388
Hey, you can just stop at the next one.

176
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:42,603
It's okay.

177
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:45,000
Let him off.

178
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,008
Fine.

179
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:05,430
We're here.

180
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:09,013
But the bathroom here is quite old.

181
00:14:09,695 --> 00:14:10,979
Just be careful.

182
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:14,818
The handicapped bathroom is on the right.

183
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,390
I know that I'm blind.

184
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,520
Why the f*ck do you have to highlight it?

185
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:24,000
I didn't mean it that way.

186
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,216
I just said it so you could see the picture.

187
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,041
I'm sorry that I can't see it.

188
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:38,388
Can you stop being like this?

189
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,323
I'm trying to help here.

190
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:42,928
Did I ask you to?

191
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:46,106
Stop it. I don't want to fight.

192
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:47,607
You want me to see the picture?

193
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:52,113
You know what I'm seeing right now?

194
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:55,801
Not a damn thing.

195
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:58,909
And it's getting worse.

196
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:01,704
Oh, wait.

197
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:05,746
I can see things clearly sometimes.

198
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:08,913
In my dreams.

199
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,310
And when I realize they are just dreams,

200
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:14,071
I feel even shittier.

201
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:19,242
Because I know I'm still blind when I wake up.

202
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:19,770
Hey.

203
00:15:19,914 --> 00:15:20,634
Day.

204
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,948
Are you happy now?

205
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:22,623
Day.

206
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:25,784
I'm blind.

207
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,318
I'm going to use the bathroom for the blind as you suggested.

208
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:39,638
I'll go check on him.

209
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:34,233
Phi Mhok.

210
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,240
I want to go home.

211
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:57,547
[Bangkok - Songkhla]

212
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,810
How long do we need to wait?

213
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:18,652
Just a moment, please.

214
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,440
Day, I’m here.

215
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:30,338
Let's go, sir.

216
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,144
It wasn't easy to ditch Night.

217
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:37,821
Lucky for us this van still has some spots left.

218
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:42,971
I was terrified while waiting for you.

219
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:46,920
If you couldn't make it in time and the driver decided to go, I wouldn’t know what to do.

220
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:49,533
Like I said.

221
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:50,733
You have me. There’s nothing to be afraid of.

222
00:17:53,804 --> 00:17:55,804
Let me check our stuff. In case we need to buy something else.

223
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:17,261
[Night: That’s all the cash I had on me. If I call, that means it’s urgent. Answer.]

224
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,560
Welcome to the beach.

225
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:55,804
Well.

226
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:58,555
Now that you're here, you seem to forget everything.

227
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:41,403
Day.

228
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:42,718
Day.

229
00:19:46,387 --> 00:19:47,318
What is it, Phi Mhok?

230
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,456
The van broke down.

231
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:51,212
He's been fixing it for half an hour.

232
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:53,256
It doesn't seem to be done soon.

233
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:57,233
Where are we right now?

234
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:07,985
I think we're close.

235
00:20:09,737 --> 00:20:12,045
Let’s not wait.

236
00:20:14,237 --> 00:20:16,319
Then how can we get there from here?

237
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:39,173
You're ready to play a rich boy on his downfall?

238
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:58,998
You've never told me about your father.

239
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,879
He passed away when I was young.

240
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,544
I don't know what to tell.

241
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:07,861
Do you miss him?

242
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:11,545
No.

243
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,191
I don't have much memory of him.

244
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,803
I miss Rung more.

245
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:24,927
My parents separated when I was young.

246
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:28,696
I guess I was about five years old then.

247
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:34,287
Similar to you, I don't remember much about him.

248
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:37,353
After they broke up,

249
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:39,876
I moved to Bangkok with Mom.

250
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:41,201
Hold on.

251
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:44,238
Are you a country boy?

252
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,409
Where's your hometown?

253
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:16,856
Okay. We have arrived.

254
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:19,805
You walk a bit further and you’ll reach the hotel area.

255
00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:21,967
- Okay. Thank you.
- Enjoy your trip.

256
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:22,467
Sure.

257
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:23,790
Let's go, day.

258
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:26,227
Watch your head.

259
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:28,346
Okay.

260
00:22:30,774 --> 00:22:32,110
Wait for me here.

261
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,692
Wait.

262
00:22:33,832 --> 00:22:34,458
Take a step down.

263
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:00,933
Welcome to the beach.

264
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:17,693
Well.

265
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:20,486
Now that you're here, you seem to forget everything.

266
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:29,298
In front of me must be a blue ocean,

267
00:23:31,312 --> 00:23:33,271
reaching all the way to the skyline.

268
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,975
From what I hear,

269
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:41,034
it's a peaceful ocean.

270
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:42,560
The waves aren't so strong.

271
00:23:45,453 --> 00:23:50,290
And the sun is about to set on my left, right?

272
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:52,491
How do you know?

273
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:56,705
I can feel the warmth from this side.

274
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:02,941
Do you want to know if the ocean water is cold or warm?

275
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,259
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

276
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:17,376
Whoo-hoo!

277
00:24:56,543 --> 00:25:00,397
The scenery now must be stunning, am I right?

278
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,380
Mhm.

279
00:25:08,316 --> 00:25:08,992
Super stunning.

280
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:22,190
Getting in the ocean without seeing the ocean is weird somehow.

281
00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:35,632
Day.

282
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:40,485
It’s difficult for you, isn’t it?

283
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:48,834
Not as difficult as the beginning.

284
00:25:52,315 --> 00:25:54,233
Everything remains the same.

285
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:57,715
The sea remains to sea.

286
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:01,505
This.

287
00:26:04,215 --> 00:26:06,889
The sand remains the sand.

288
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:19,665
The sky remains the sky.

289
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:27,493
Though I can't see, everything remains the way it is.

290
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,247
You know?

291
00:26:34,307 --> 00:26:35,545
I just realized this.

292
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:40,526
For something, we don’t need eyes to look

293
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:42,660
yet we’re still able to see it.

294
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,085
Right.

295
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,803
For something, you need to feel it by heart.

296
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:54,626
Just like my feelings right now.

297
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:10,949
You're smiling, aren't you?

298
00:28:21,753 --> 00:28:22,345
Phi.

299
00:28:22,488 --> 00:28:23,114
The book.

300
00:28:24,581 --> 00:28:25,363
The book?

301
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:26,749
Last Twilight.

302
00:28:27,055 --> 00:28:28,044
Isn't it with you?

303
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:29,482
It's not with me.

304
00:28:31,968 --> 00:28:32,769
It's not.

305
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:04,277
What is this place?

306
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:07,229
There’s a party here.

307
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:08,714
Seems like fun.

308
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:11,899
Come on. Let's go check in.

309
00:29:18,475 --> 00:29:19,409
What is it, young man?

310
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:24,497
Since we're here, why don't we get fueled?

311
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:28,885
You just ordered the fun.

312
00:29:29,294 --> 00:29:31,029
I'll serve you the fun.

313
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,399
Let's go.

314
00:30:49,071 --> 00:30:49,829
Day.

315
00:30:50,135 --> 00:30:51,377
Day, wake up.

316
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:52,720
Day.

317
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,554
What, Phi Mhok?

318
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,079
I think we were too wasted last night.

319
00:30:58,574 --> 00:31:00,309
We're basically dead drunk on the beach.

320
00:31:00,884 --> 00:31:02,782
Lucky for us, no one took our bodies.

321
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:10,841
Everything you brought is still there.

322
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:24,607
Day, I'm sorry.

323
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,584
Phi.

324
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:27,362
The book.

325
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:29,509
The book?

326
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:31,145
Last Twilight.

327
00:31:31,145 --> 00:31:32,176
Isn't it with you?

328
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:33,732
It's not with me.

329
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:43,698
It's not.

330
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,469
No way.

331
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:51,331
We can lose anything but this book.

332
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:54,026
Or what's the point of this trip?

333
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,861
Day, I'm sorry.

334
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:00,029
Day.

335
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,471
How about this?

336
00:32:17,189 --> 00:32:18,781
I'm going to go look around.

337
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:20,701
It might still be somewhere near.

338
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:22,030
Wait for me here.

339
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:25,336
Day?

340
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,697
Oops.

341
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:32,869
It's right here.

342
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:36,410
I forgot I put it here.

343
00:32:38,978 --> 00:32:39,804
Day.

344
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,952
I used it as a pillow last night.

345
00:32:45,117 --> 00:32:46,469
Sorry.

346
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:50,805
If it's truly gone, I'd be so terrified that the colors would drain from my face.

347
00:32:51,213 --> 00:32:52,090
Right?

348
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,703
Did I scare you?

349
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:03,289
Day.

350
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:09,078
I think you can be so inappropriate sometimes.

351
00:33:11,503 --> 00:33:12,993
Come on, Phi.

352
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:14,894
Don't be mad.

353
00:33:15,498 --> 00:33:17,192
It was just a fun joke.

354
00:33:21,227 --> 00:33:24,309
If you're that good, why don’t you find the way to Aon's wedding yourself?

355
00:33:24,746 --> 00:33:25,583
Sounds like fun?

356
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:28,711
Wait, Phi Mhok.

357
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,191
Damn it.

358
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,087
Phi Mhok.

359
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:38,827
Phi Mhok.

360
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:44,886
Phi Mhok.

361
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,549
Phi Mhok, where are you?

362
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:48,707
I'm sorry.

363
00:33:49,837 --> 00:33:50,886
Phi Mhok.

364
00:33:51,979 --> 00:33:53,571
Phi Mhok, I'm sorry.

365
00:33:54,005 --> 00:33:54,835
Phi Mhok.

366
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:08,660
Hey!

367
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:09,784
Watch it, would you?

368
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:11,372
Or you'll get smacked in the face.

369
00:34:13,388 --> 00:34:14,223
I'm sorry.

370
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:21,191
Phi Mhok.

371
00:34:21,778 --> 00:34:22,541
Phi Mhok.

372
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:24,975
I'm sorry.

373
00:34:25,256 --> 00:34:26,229
Phi Mhok.

374
00:34:34,378 --> 00:34:35,232
Phi Mhok.

375
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,236
My name is Fah.

376
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:41,331
Not Phi Mhok.

377
00:34:47,145 --> 00:34:48,941
Phi Mhok, are you playing me?

378
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:52,486
Not funny.

379
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:55,767
Get this.

380
00:34:59,048 --> 00:35:00,129
Where are you?

381
00:35:01,124 --> 00:35:02,358
Here, have this.

382
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:03,977
- Here, for you!
- Oh, oh, oh.

383
00:35:04,575 --> 00:35:05,911
I don't want this.

384
00:35:05,911 --> 00:35:06,552
I want this.

385
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,614
Let's call it even, Nong Day.

386
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,114
Oops.

387
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:18,964
Phi Day.

388
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:20,230
We’re cool?

389
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,988
I'm mad. Let go of me.

390
00:35:26,528 --> 00:35:27,587
Come help me.

391
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:28,975
Quick.

392
00:35:29,179 --> 00:35:30,541
There, there.

393
00:35:31,152 --> 00:35:32,243
Sorry.

394
00:35:33,953 --> 00:35:35,143
We’re cool.

395
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:51,625
Come on, Phi Mhok.

396
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:52,992
Stop that already.

397
00:35:53,604 --> 00:35:54,625
How do you know it’s me?

398
00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:58,210
You’re the only one who does this.

399
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:02,463
You said you’re hungry.

400
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:04,539
So I bought this. Fill your stomach for now.

401
00:36:06,153 --> 00:36:07,165
But…

402
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:08,791
Do you want to play a game?

403
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:10,841
Let’s play.

404
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:13,509
You’ll get to drink only if you can find it.

405
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:15,231
Phi Mhok.

406
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:18,547
Come on, Phi Mhok.

407
00:36:20,295 --> 00:36:21,402
Phi Mhok.

408
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,378
- Where is it? Where is it?
- Phi Mhok, give it up.

409
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:31,689
If you can’t find it, it’s all mine.

410
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:33,361
Let me have it.

411
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:40,249
Found it.

412
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,138
Let me open it for you.

413
00:36:54,183 --> 00:36:55,043
Thank you.

414
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,692
Sure.

415
00:36:59,856 --> 00:37:00,509
Oh.

416
00:37:01,274 --> 00:37:03,443
How far away are we from Aon’s wedding?

417
00:37:07,691 --> 00:37:08,951
I don’t think it’s that far.

418
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:13,177
But it should take quite some time on foot.

419
00:37:15,044 --> 00:37:16,069
That’s fine.

420
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,376
We’re not in a hurry.

421
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:20,695
You’re right.

422
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:22,871
Come on.

423
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:24,983
Alright. Let’s go.

424
00:37:35,695 --> 00:37:36,524
Come.

425
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,823
Thank you so much.

426
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:46,780
Hold on, Day.

427
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,738
I’m not sure.

428
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,537
Excuse me.

429
00:37:54,098 --> 00:37:54,889
Yes?

430
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:56,905
I’m going to my friend’s wedding.

431
00:37:58,569 --> 00:37:59,257
Do you know this place?

432
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:03,223
That’s Pla’s wedding.

433
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:06,621
I’m going to the area.

434
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:08,309
Do you guys wanna ride with me?

435
00:38:09,308 --> 00:38:10,179
That’d be great.

436
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:13,247
Let me pay for the meatballs first.

437
00:38:13,847 --> 00:38:14,624
Come.

438
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:15,388
Follow me.

439
00:38:18,525 --> 00:38:19,809
Hold on, Day.

440
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,235
Are you sure?

441
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:23,862
I am.

442
00:38:23,862 --> 00:38:24,496
Why?

443
00:38:26,742 --> 00:38:27,768
Come on.

444
00:38:29,178 --> 00:38:31,306
Feel it for yourself.

445
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:33,934
Let’s get your bags over here.

446
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:40,750
Oh, please.

447
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,903
I can ride this just fine.

448
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:44,498
You want some fun, don’t you?

449
00:38:44,498 --> 00:38:45,544
Hop on.

450
00:39:37,005 --> 00:39:37,576
We’re here.

451
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:43,317
Day, come on out.

452
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,583
Thank you so much, sir.

453
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:51,390
No problem.

454
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:53,027
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

455
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:53,731
Goodbye.

456
00:39:57,863 --> 00:39:58,382
Day,

457
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,654
I think we’re a little too early.

458
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:03,503
But that’s good.

459
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:06,393
Let’s go see Aon.

460
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,858
Hold on.

461
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,076
I don’t think we should go now.

462
00:40:11,403 --> 00:40:12,252
Why not?

463
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,521
We’re wearing this to the wedding?

464
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:24,064
You’re right.

465
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,460
Look at the camera.

466
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,288
One, two, three.

467
00:41:10,288 --> 00:41:12,065
Okay. Let’s have one more.

468
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,820
One, two, three.

469
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:15,083
Okay.

470
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:16,742
We’ve got it.

471
00:41:35,124 --> 00:41:35,759
Day.

472
00:41:37,877 --> 00:41:38,578
Hmm?

473
00:41:40,554 --> 00:41:41,993
I’d like to remind you again.

474
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,080
You’re a handsome man.

475
00:41:51,685 --> 00:41:56,781
And I think you must look gorgeous today.

476
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:58,505
Right?

477
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,709
I will never let go of your hand.

478
00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:27,720
I promise.

479
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,570
Even if you want to,

480
00:42:43,836 --> 00:42:44,917
I won’t let you.

481
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:22,509
Care to dance to one more song with me, handsome?

482
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:08,845
Hello.

483
00:44:08,886 --> 00:44:10,429
Thank you so much.

484
00:44:10,718 --> 00:44:13,122
This is from Danainut and Methas.

485
00:44:13,122 --> 00:44:14,024
Thank you so much.

486
00:44:14,024 --> 00:44:18,469
Aon and Pla would like their guests to write down their reasons for giving their book.

487
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:19,601
That way, please.

488
00:44:21,629 --> 00:44:22,660
Please.

489
00:44:24,826 --> 00:44:26,180
That way, please.

490
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:34,479
Day.

491
00:44:35,448 --> 00:44:38,355
Whatever wish you have for them, tell me.

492
00:44:38,355 --> 00:44:39,174
I’ll write it down for you.

493
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:49,990
I had always wondered why you recommended this book.

494
00:44:51,194 --> 00:44:54,647
But about halfway through, I think I get it.

495
00:44:55,451 --> 00:44:58,312
I still don't know how it ends.

496
00:44:59,756 --> 00:45:04,824
But Day’s version of Mee will find his own finale.

497
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,432
Have a kid soon.

498
00:45:11,272 --> 00:45:12,437
Can't wait to help raise your kid.

499
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:16,177
Day.

500
00:45:18,222 --> 00:45:19,237
Sign right here.

501
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,785
Now that's tricky.

502
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,100
It's fine. Just do it.

503
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,691
Right here.

504
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,098
Great.

505
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:42,477
Hey, Mhok and Day.

506
00:45:42,477 --> 00:45:44,688
- Hello, Pla.
- Pla.

507
00:45:44,688 --> 00:45:46,014
- Thank you for coming.
- Hello, Master.

508
00:45:46,014 --> 00:45:46,766
Congratulations.

509
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:48,499
Thank you.

510
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:49,277
You guys really came.

511
00:45:49,277 --> 00:45:50,197
I didn't expect you to really make it.

512
00:45:50,906 --> 00:45:51,940
Of course, we came.

513
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,225
I'm so thankful.

514
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:55,049
Hi, Singha.

515
00:45:55,049 --> 00:45:56,008
Thank you for coming.

516
00:45:56,008 --> 00:45:57,110
Here.

517
00:45:57,475 --> 00:45:59,152
Your wedding present.

518
00:45:59,152 --> 00:46:00,035
What is it?

519
00:46:00,362 --> 00:46:01,237
A bottle of wine.

520
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:04,058
I stole one from the hotel.

521
00:46:05,206 --> 00:46:07,206
Thanks a lot.

522
00:46:07,206 --> 00:46:08,346
Hey.

523
00:46:08,346 --> 00:46:09,113
Let me introduce you.

524
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:11,975
Day, Mhok, this guy is Pla’s close friend.

525
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,846
He owns a hotel downtown.

526
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:16,040
Make friends with him. You probably get to stay for free.

527
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:16,622
Hey.

528
00:46:17,753 --> 00:46:19,753
- Hello.
- Hello.

529
00:46:20,163 --> 00:46:21,625
Should we go find our seats?

530
00:46:22,035 --> 00:46:22,878
Let’s go.

531
00:46:22,878 --> 00:46:23,795
Where did you store your belongings?

532
00:46:23,795 --> 00:46:25,453
Over there.

533
00:46:25,962 --> 00:46:26,750
Let's find your seat.

534
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,962
Come on.

535
00:46:27,962 --> 00:46:31,683
May I hear some noise for the groom and the bride?

536
00:46:35,914 --> 00:46:39,237
They make such a perfect couple.

537
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:41,957
I heard their love happened so easily.

538
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:43,917
Please tell us where you guys met.

539
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:49,737
We first met when she was a guide runner.

540
00:46:52,422 --> 00:46:56,144
But actually, I have to thank Tinder for matching us.

541
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,810
I fell in love with her voice.

542
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:11,238
I felt like I wanted to hear her voice for the rest of my life.

543
00:47:14,015 --> 00:47:15,504
What an overstatement.

544
00:47:15,644 --> 00:47:18,936
Actually, I was faking my voice then.

545
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,217
He's hot. I was afraid he wouldn't like me.

546
00:47:23,217 --> 00:47:25,226
So I tried my best to sound pretty.

547
00:47:26,566 --> 00:47:30,342
Is there any problem that has stood in the way of your love, Pla?

548
00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:32,890
Problem?

549
00:47:34,161 --> 00:47:39,875
You would assume that his inability to see is a problem, however…

550
00:47:39,876 --> 00:47:44,702
The real problem is that he snores.

551
00:47:46,126 --> 00:47:47,588
Every single night.

552
00:47:48,858 --> 00:47:56,517
Many people are concerned that because I am with a blind man, I must be the one caring for him.

553
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:00,772
When, in fact, Aon can take very good care of himself.

554
00:48:00,906 --> 00:48:03,397
He's even the one who looks after me at times.

555
00:48:04,401 --> 00:48:10,465
So love is just one of the factors that foster our relationship.

556
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:14,557
Please give it up once again for our groom and bride.

557
00:48:49,157 --> 00:48:50,003
Is the food good, Day?

558
00:48:50,003 --> 00:48:50,888
It is.

559
00:48:50,888 --> 00:48:52,640
Each dish has its own unique name.

560
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,660
The chefs propose and I'm the one who approves.

561
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,770
Like…

562
00:48:57,064 --> 00:48:59,064
Well, well.

563
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:00,606
You're such a bragger.

564
00:49:00,677 --> 00:49:02,058
I am not bragging.

565
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:08,604
He just told us that all the food in this event is from his hotel.

566
00:49:08,604 --> 00:49:10,344
Is it good though?

567
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:11,896
- Yes.
- Yes.

568
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:13,677
Okay.

569
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,478
Glad to hear it is good.

570
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:21,709
By the way, most people who come to your wedding are senior citizens.

571
00:49:22,238 --> 00:49:24,238
- Are you teasing?
- It’s cute.

572
00:49:24,238 --> 00:49:25,848
They're not that old.

573
00:49:26,419 --> 00:49:27,558
There are my mom's friends.

574
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:31,367
Mrs. Penn, hello.

575
00:49:31,367 --> 00:49:33,053
- Hello, ma’am.
- Hi, there.

576
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:37,774
Does anyone here have an interest in dancing with us old people?

577
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:38,945
Here we go.

578
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:41,105
Do you want to join them, young men?

579
00:49:41,105 --> 00:49:41,957
Day, Mhok.

580
00:49:41,957 --> 00:49:44,063
Let's go.

581
00:49:44,352 --> 00:49:45,137
Day, do you want to go?

582
00:49:45,137 --> 00:49:46,352
Go on, Day.

583
00:49:46,352 --> 00:49:47,579
I can't dance.

584
00:49:47,998 --> 00:49:49,998
You can.

585
00:49:49,998 --> 00:49:51,856
Day, come on.

586
00:49:54,004 --> 00:49:55,035
Mrs. Penn, please take care of him.

587
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:56,004
Of course.

588
00:49:56,004 --> 00:49:57,021
Do your best.

589
00:49:57,263 --> 00:49:58,045
Phi Mhok.

590
00:50:00,814 --> 00:50:02,464
It'll be fun.

591
00:51:01,237 --> 00:51:03,837
Thank you to all the lovely dancers.

592
00:51:03,837 --> 00:51:06,456
Let's give them a big hand.

593
00:51:15,276 --> 00:51:16,717
May I take it from here, ma’am?

594
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:17,226
Sure.

595
00:51:17,226 --> 00:51:18,152
Thank you so much.

596
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:23,197
Care to dance to one more song with me, handsome?

597
00:51:26,515 --> 00:51:28,317

It contains good meaning.

623
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:22,052

Yes?

632
00:54:57,835 --> 00:54:58,774
It's your dad.

633
00:55:01,237 --> 00:55:02,298
Do you remember me?

634
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:14,658
Dad?

Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

636
00:55:56,856 --> 00:55:58,856
Wow!

637
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:00,538
Did you really just play that?

638
00:56:03,046 --> 00:56:04,517
No, the piano played itself.

639
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:09,931
I never knew my boyfriend was so talented.

640
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,602
Can you play one more song for me?

641
00:56:14,464 --> 00:56:15,183
No way.

642
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:21,093
But I just brought you your favorite drink.

643
00:56:28,341 --> 00:56:29,168
Hey.

644
00:56:30,325 --> 00:56:31,821
Come on.

645
00:56:32,642 --> 00:56:33,546
You're cheating.

646
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:35,469
Fine.

647
00:56:36,122 --> 00:56:37,584
I'll play you a song.

648
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:19,533
Now where's my reward?

649
00:57:28,765 --> 00:57:29,608
Here.

650
00:57:43,717 --> 00:57:46,148
Actually, this is just a drink.

651
00:57:47,952 --> 00:57:49,952
Your real reward is this.

652
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:56,222
Phi Mhok.

653
00:57:56,868 --> 00:57:57,677
What did you just do?

654
00:57:57,919 --> 00:57:59,973
There's no one around. I checked.

655
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:04,520
It's right in the middle of the house.

656
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,534
We have a whole day off today.

657
00:58:14,102 --> 00:58:15,106
Where do you want to go?

658
00:58:24,827 --> 00:58:26,827
Have you got a chance to see the real last twilight?

659
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,222
What is it?

660
00:58:28,222 --> 00:58:31,502
The Last Twilight cover, the one with the beautiful mountain,

661
00:58:31,502 --> 00:58:32,752
it was taken at Khuha Mountain.

662
00:58:32,752 --> 00:58:34,071
It’s in the district nearby.

663
00:58:34,071 --> 00:58:36,391
The real thing is even more beautiful than the picture.

664
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:39,037
Can you take me to the mountain in Last Twilight?

665
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:41,407
This might be my last chance.

666
00:58:44,143 --> 00:58:48,296
There's also one thing I want to do for the first time.
