4
00:00:18,993 --> 00:00:21,960
The patient's cornea has deteriorated since the last time we checked.

5
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,000
His vision might gradually weaken.

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,944
We're about to become husband and wife.

7
00:00:29,342 --> 00:00:30,579
The event is held in Songkhla.

8
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:33,035
My mom doesn’t like me going out in general.

9
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:36,219
Now with these eyes, it’ll be even more difficult.

10
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,454
Do you want to go though?

11
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,761
I'm trying to help here.

12
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:40,480
Did I ask you to?

13
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:46,201
Welcome to the beach.

14
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:53,313
Getting in the ocean without seeing the ocean is weird somehow.

15
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:55,433
You're smiling, aren't you?

16
00:00:57,967 --> 00:00:59,560
I will never let go of your hand.

17
00:01:00,118 --> 00:01:00,920
I promise.

18
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:03,823
Care to dance to one more song with me, handsome?

19
00:01:13,526 --> 00:01:14,279
Day.

20
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:17,018
Yes?

21
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:19,114
It's your dad.

22
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:22,598
Do you remember me?

23
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:28,885
Dad?

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,413
Night told me you were coming to this event.

25
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:33,298
So I came to see you.

26
00:01:40,722 --> 00:01:42,560
I…

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,156
I know about your sight.

28
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,724
It's okay, son.

29
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,605
He told you?

30
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:59,664
I'm curious what he's left out.

31
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:10,482
Did he say he's the cause of my blindness?

32
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:29,173
Day.

33
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:32,143
Get me out of here.

34
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,037
But Night really feels sorry about that.

35
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:37,762
Let's go.

36
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:42,659
Just go.

37
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:20,428
That thing about Night,

38
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:22,051
is it true?

39
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:28,394
That night,

40
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:32,245
I picked him up at the bar.

41
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:46,468
Excuse me.

42
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:47,963
Good evening, Mr. Day.

43
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:49,580
Where can I find Night?

44
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:51,415
This way, please.

45
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:56,684
Here.

46
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:02,285
Night.

47
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:04,690
Night.

48
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:11,918
Let's go home.

49
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:13,537
Gosh, I feel so drunk.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,926
Go home.

51
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:21,176
Why did you drink so much?

52
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:23,207
Hold on.

53
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:25,262
Hey,

54
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:26,837
this is my little brother.

55
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:29,324
A junior badminton player on the national team.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,770
Want his autograph?

57
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:32,783
You can take pictures with him. You want that?

58
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:35,192
Stop being nonsense. Let’s go.

59
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,892
(He was wasted.)

60
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,300
(So I dragged him to the car.)

61
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,826
Walk steadily, Night.

62
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:43,048
Gosh, why am I so drunk?

63
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:45,678
You’re such a lightweight.

64
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,934
You little shit, how about we go back in there and have a drink competition?

65
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,118
Yeah, let’s do that.

66
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,880
Yo, girls.

67
00:04:53,724 --> 00:04:54,757
Oh, come on.

68
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,406
What, Day?

69
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:01,780
Get in.

70
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:03,745
Mind your head.

71
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:09,600
You okay?

72
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,498
Head inside, damn it.

73
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,601
You sound like Mom.

74
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:40,121
Who's the big brother and who's the little brother here?

75
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,425
Of course, you're the big brother.

76
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,299
And I am…

77
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:49,907
Bag.

78
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:52,598
Damn it, Night, don't throw up in my car.

79
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:56,809
Hold it.

80
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:57,699
Don’t.

81
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:01,701
Hurry up.

82
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:05,418
Hold on, Night.

83
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:06,804
Day!!

84
00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:08,500
Holy shit!!

85
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:18,730
Then…

86
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,730
The next thing I knew,

87
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,745
I was in the hospital.

88
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:32,349
The doctor said my cornea was damaged.

89
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,513
I didn't completely get it at the time.

90
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:39,151
Until the final badminton match.

91
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,609
That's when I truly did.

92
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:00,593
I get it now

93
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,800
why you and Night…

94
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,183
I know that it was an accident.

95
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:23,064
But what I can't bear is when he pretends to be a good son to please Mom.

96
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:26,267
Day.

97
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:27,471
Hey.

98
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,340
It's like he's taking advantage of the situation.

99
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:37,151
He's stealing what's mine behind my back.

100
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:40,417
And what's left for me?

101
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:48,142
But now he says he feels sorry.

102
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,002
Shit.

103
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:53,350
How the heck could he say that?

104
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:58,502
The one sorry should be me.

105
00:07:59,756 --> 00:08:00,560
Not him.

106
00:08:57,653 --> 00:08:59,653
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

107
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:04,401
Here we go, Stir-fried Stink Beans with Shrimp.

108
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:05,235
Awesome.

109
00:09:05,235 --> 00:09:06,082
Smells good?

110
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:07,444
You smell good, honey.

111
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:13,407
So did you guys get a good night's sleep?

112
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:16,152
I forgot to tell you the mosquitoes here are aggressive.

113
00:09:16,342 --> 00:09:17,341
Their bites hurt like shit.

114
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,080
We slept well.

115
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:21,406
Aon.

116
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:25,320
I'm sorry I made a scene at your wedding.

117
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:27,305
Hey, it's alright.

118
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:28,189
No worries.

119
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:32,880
I'm surprised though to know you're from the same hometown as Pla.

120
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,145
Right.

121
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,600
What district are you from?

122
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:38,928
I lived here until it was only three.

123
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:40,821
I don't recall much of anything.

124
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:46,080
All I remember is that there was a noodle shop in the neighborhood that served it with sweet tofu.

125
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:49,314
Ah! That dish is called Tao Koa.

126
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:50,680
It's right in front of you.

127
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:52,807
You can't find it anywhere else.

128
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:53,725
Really?

129
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:54,326
Yes.

130
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:55,867
Do you want it? I'll get it for you.

131
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:56,713
Yes, please.

132
00:09:56,713 --> 00:09:59,300
Come on. If his mom used to live here,

133
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:00,918
she must have made it for him too many times already.

134
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:01,780
Right?

135
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:07,169
My mom never cooks any local food from here.

136
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:08,519
Why not?

137
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:09,978
There is plenty of good food here.

138
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:11,164
Right.

139
00:10:14,395 --> 00:10:17,031
My dad left her for another woman.

140
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:21,083
She had to beg for food from someone else.

141
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:29,680
One day, she decided to pack and bring us to Bangkok to fight for our lives.

142
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,484
She has never spoken of this place since.

143
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:41,971
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:44,000
I shouldn't have asked.

145
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:45,695
It's all fine.

146
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:46,945
Let's eat.

147
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:52,257
What is this called again?

148
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:55,147
It’s Tao Koa.

149
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:56,944
- Tao Koa?
- Yes, Tao Koa.

150
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:58,777
And those fried stuffed taros are called Kanom Khang Khao.

151
00:10:58,777 --> 00:10:59,728
Kanom Khang Khao.

152
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:00,797
Yes. Give it to Day.

153
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:01,530
Try it.

154
00:11:02,687 --> 00:11:04,025
Can we buy these in Bangkok?

155
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:04,597
Nope.

156
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:05,794
They’re only sold here.

157
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:08,799
Day, enjoy your Tao Koa and Kanom Khang Khao.

158
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,680
We won’t get to eat them again back home.

159
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:13,222
Tao Koa is at noon.

160
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:14,381
Eat all you want, Day.

161
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:16,909
Kanom Khang Khao is 9 a.m.

162
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,129
Okay?

163
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:36,157
Day.

164
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:38,196
I just found something great.

165
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:39,613
It’s cold and refreshing.

166
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:41,288
I’m sure it’s as good as Tao Koa.

167
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,216
What? Are you serious?

168
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:52,245
Well, good stuff is good stuff regardless of where it is.

169
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,754
Drink. I opened the lid for you.

170
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:03,648
So?

171
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:05,459
Cool and refreshing, huh?

172
00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:06,720
Mhm.

173
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:12,800
So what time are we going back tomorrow?

174
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:17,121
I bought the tickets. We leave tomorrow at nine.

175
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:21,420
That means we have the whole free day today.

176
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:22,929
Is there any place you want to go?

177
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:37,185
Aon told me there's a mangosteen farm on the left and a cockfighting pit on the right.

178
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:40,748
Or we can go to The Red Bridge if you like.

179
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:45,438
Phi.

180
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:46,625
Hmm?

181
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:49,412
Can you take me to Dad?

182
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:19,931
We're here.

183
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:31,166
He’s inside.

184
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,728
Let’s go.

185
00:13:43,218 --> 00:13:49,824
It reflects the history of Songkhla.

186
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:52,547
An important piece of art.

187
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:56,180
The material can’t be found anywhere else.

188
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:02,249
I don’t know when we’ll find it again. I guess at least 60-70 years.

189
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,306
Please enjoy the art. We have a lot here.

190
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:05,863
Your father is right in front of you.

191
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:08,899
Day.

192
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:17,475
I just came to ask you a question.

193
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:22,441
How do you know Night feels sorry?

194
00:14:32,103 --> 00:14:35,935
Night will never forgive himself for this.

195
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:41,035
I'll never forgive him no matter what.

196
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:07,951
Careful. It's hot.

197
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:28,184
Since your mom took you guys away, she's never allowed me to reach out.

198
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:37,156
Until one day.

199
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:48,901
Like the doctor said, we’ll get the eye donation soon. Okay?

200
00:15:53,415 --> 00:15:54,139
Dad.

201
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,852
He’s blind because of me.

202
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,559
(After that, Night’s been trying to change.)

203
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,212
Night, bottoms up.

204
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:14,314
Sorry. I quit.

205
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,184
(He’s trying to be the big brother you once wanted him to be

206
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,213
even though it’s too late.)

207
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:32,040
(No matter how hard he tries, he knows it can’t make up for what he did.)

208
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:40,724
Do you think hearing this would soften me?

209
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:48,238
I'll never forgive him no matter what.

210
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,532
The point isn’t whether or not you forgive him.

211
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:03,575
It’s that Night will never forgive himself for this.

212
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:08,686
I know it because…

213
00:17:10,383 --> 00:17:13,773
that's how I feel toward your mom.

214
00:17:16,674 --> 00:17:18,231
I never forgive myself.

215
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,460
How is your mom doing anyway?

216
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:37,279
She's doing great.

217
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,220
A lot better than when she was with you.

218
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:46,573
The last time I saw you, you weren’t much of a talker like you are now, son.

219
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:52,934
Can I take a closer look at you?

220
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,230
You now look quite like me.

221
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:09,469
Does that mean you're good-looking?

222
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:10,571
Of course, I am.

223
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,572
I don't really remember how you look.

224
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:21,848
Mom got rid of all your photos.

225
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:31,080
And I don't see very well now.

226
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:34,923
Get closer and see.

227
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:43,788
Tell you what.

228
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:49,113
I went to the wedding last night not because I wanted you to see me.

229
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,181
I just wanted to see you again.

230
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:09,090
Thank you so much for coming to see me.

231
00:19:11,254 --> 00:19:12,762
Thank you for understanding.

232
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,711
You know what?

233
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:30,981
You have my lips and my eyes.

234
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,470
Night has my nose.

235
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:45,548
You have long hair?

236
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,099
I’m an artist.

237
00:19:55,033 --> 00:19:56,036
You're wearing glasses.

238
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:58,337
Farsighted. You know, people my age.

239
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:16,172
I missed you.

240
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:19,033
I missed you, too.

241
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:20,680
I always have.

242
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,358
Without you,

243
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,902
it's like something is missing.

244
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,454
If I could turn back time, I’d do just anything to make up for that.

245
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:53,100
I love you, son.

246
00:21:39,002 --> 00:21:42,101
Wow, Pla. Your sous chef looks great here.

247
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:46,306
Not sous chef. He’s the head chef.

248
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,672
I’m his helper today.

249
00:21:47,993 --> 00:21:48,645
For real?

250
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:49,329
Yes.

251
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:50,781
So, what are you making, chef?

252
00:21:51,182 --> 00:21:52,186
Spicy Shrimp Paste Dipping Sauce.

253
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:54,018
Can I try?

254
00:21:54,018 --> 00:21:54,805
Of course.

255
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,270
Thank you.

256
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:04,752
Hey,

257
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:06,101
it’s good.

258
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:07,620
Wow, it’s nice and mellow.

259
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:09,985
Awesome.

260
00:22:09,985 --> 00:22:11,610
Pla, can you take over?

261
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,615
Sure.

262
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:15,018
Pla, you try it.

263
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:17,582
It’s good.

264
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:34,967
Pla.

265
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,781
Wow, Nong Mhok.

266
00:22:52,978 --> 00:22:53,913
Sorry for my dialect.

267
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,128
Mhok,

268
00:22:56,181 --> 00:22:57,689
you’re pretty talented.

269
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:00,894
Thank you.

270
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:05,167
I hope this meal covers the cost of our stay. Master Aon.

271
00:23:06,046 --> 00:23:07,181
We’ll let you stay the whole month.

272
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:10,383
You’ve got skills.

273
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:14,141
Are you sick of a caretaker job already?

274
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:17,671
Why?

275
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:22,981
Employees in my hotel restaurant keep coming in and out.

276
00:23:22,981 --> 00:23:25,047
We need one good kitchen staff there.

277
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:29,461
Singha, ask someone else.

278
00:23:29,836 --> 00:23:32,230
Day won’t let this one away from his side.

279
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,490
Really?

280
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:34,946
Please take him.

281
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,141
He’s all yours. I’ll even pay you for it.

282
00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:37,952
Wow.

283
00:23:37,952 --> 00:23:39,445
I’ll get paid too?

284
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:43,085
So where did you guys go today?

285
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,401
Did you get a chance to see the real last twilight?

286
00:23:46,854 --> 00:23:47,771
What is it?

287
00:23:48,263 --> 00:23:50,355
I guess I forgot to mention.

288
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:53,693
The Last Twilight cover, the one with the beautiful mountain,

289
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,116
it was taken at Veha Mountain.

290
00:23:55,116 --> 00:23:56,181
It’s in the district nearby.

291
00:23:56,956 --> 00:23:58,956
Come on. Are you joking?

292
00:23:58,956 --> 00:24:00,104
I'm serious.

293
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,600
The author was on vacation here.

294
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:05,630
They say the real thing is even more beautiful than the picture.

295
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:06,908
It’s superb.

296
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:10,729
Since you have come here, you should go check it out.

297
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:11,687
It really is beautiful.

298
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,679
What do you say?

299
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,687
We already bought the tickets home.

300
00:24:19,212 --> 00:24:20,901
Maybe next time.

301
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:26,832
This one is good.

302
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:47,437
I know you want to go to that Last Twilight place.

303
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,018
I want to hurry home.

304
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:57,475
I'm afraid Mom will find out.

305
00:24:59,345 --> 00:25:00,649
We can go next time.

306
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:22,173
Are you sure that there is next time?

307
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,328
Come on, Phi.

308
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,539
The doctor said I have three months.

309
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:30,517
I can still come here like 10 times until then.

310
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,835
Let's come back together again next time.

311
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:40,992
Ah, that feels so good.

312
00:26:03,957 --> 00:26:04,614
Day.

313
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:08,035
Are you okay?

314
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:11,689
I am.

315
00:26:13,316 --> 00:26:14,076
I'm sleepy.

316
00:26:14,494 --> 00:26:15,193
Let's go to sleep.

317
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:25,802
Alright.

318
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:28,195
Come here.

319
00:26:44,726 --> 00:26:45,798
Sweet dreams.

320
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:49,407
Sweet dreams.

321
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:52,830
Sweet dreams.

322
00:27:39,522 --> 00:27:40,525
Tomorrow…

323
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:44,597
can you take me to that Last Twilight mountain?

324
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:26,688
Hold on.

325
00:28:30,051 --> 00:28:31,261
Where’s the way up?

326
00:28:31,688 --> 00:28:33,122
You lost us, didn’t you?

327
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:34,545
No.

328
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:36,373
I followed the map here.

329
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:03,725
Walk a bit further and catch a truck taxi to town.

330
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,623
Once you're there, rent a motorbike to get to your destination.

331
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,685
If you go now, I think you can still catch the last light.

332
00:29:11,407 --> 00:29:13,042
We will take off then.

333
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:16,730
Never forget your duty in bed.

334
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,165
I already did.

335
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:22,563
Good. We can’t wait to play with your kid.

336
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:23,463
Don't worry. The baby is on its way.

337
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,736
Hey! Take our wedding souvenir with you.

338
00:29:33,686 --> 00:29:34,643
Master.

339
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,598
It's the book Day gave you.

340
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:38,146
Why are you giving it back?

341
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:44,436
Our wedding souvenirs are to distribute the books we received to the guests.

342
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:47,650
And we believe there is no better book for you than this one.

343
00:29:48,994 --> 00:29:52,114
Bring it to the mountain and compare if they're as beautiful.

344
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,457
Sure.

345
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:00,002
Thank you.

346
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:03,805
And when you get off the truck taxi, don't forget to visit the Old Town.

347
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:08,605
Many places mentioned in this book are true places that the author has visited.

348
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:25,982
(Folklore holds that the last light on the Last Twilight mountaintop was so powerful that it could break all evil curses.)

349
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:29,905
Day, we’re here.

350
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:31,848
We are?

351
00:30:31,848 --> 00:30:33,383
Yeah. Give me the book.

352
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:36,088
(Therefore, Mee traveled far to seek a wizard with magic eyes.)

353
00:30:36,314 --> 00:30:40,372
(“Go as far as my eyes can see and you will find the last twilight.”)

354
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:43,816
Hey! We found the building with the eyes.

355
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:44,928
Just like in the book.

356
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:45,678
Really?

357
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,575
Yes. It’s right in front of you.

358
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:48,680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

359
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:50,278
Day, smile.

360
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:51,935
One, two, three.

361
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:52,789
Do I look good?

362
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:54,049
You do.

363
00:30:54,414 --> 00:30:55,410
Now let’s take one together.

364
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:56,962
Where’s the camera?

365
00:30:56,962 --> 00:30:58,165
This way.

366
00:30:58,693 --> 00:31:00,693
One, two, three.

367
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:02,499
Move.

368
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:04,685
One, two, three.

369
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:07,436
One, two, three.

370
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:24,890
(“But to go there, you need a map.”)

371
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,276
(“As well as bravery.”)

372
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:31,757
We’re gonna go separate ways; left and right.

373
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,896
You go left and I go right.

374
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,078
Try it.

375
00:31:34,312 --> 00:31:36,272
You can do it. Trust me.

376
00:31:37,408 --> 00:31:38,262
Come on.

377
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:41,793
(“And one essential element you can’t lack is faith.”)

378
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,085
See? I told you you could do it.

379
00:31:59,556 --> 00:32:00,514
Great job.

380
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:09,207
After seven days of wandering and seven oceans crossing,

381
00:32:09,443 --> 00:32:12,199
Mee encountered kind mermaids who guided her the way.

382
00:32:12,418 --> 00:32:14,685
“Go where my tail points you.”

383
00:32:14,685 --> 00:32:16,610
“Keep going until you reach the skyline.”

384
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:36,314
Hold on.

385
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:41,160
Where’s the way up?

386
00:32:47,147 --> 00:32:48,756
I think the mermaids fooled us.

387
00:32:50,822 --> 00:32:52,353
You lost us, didn’t you?

388
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,754
No.

389
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:55,676
I followed the map here.

390
00:32:59,135 --> 00:33:01,422
Damn. No phone reception.

391
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:05,926
Excuse me, sir.

392
00:33:08,343 --> 00:33:10,343
Is this Veha Mountain?

393
00:33:10,343 --> 00:33:12,428
It is. All of this is Veha Mountain.

394
00:33:13,686 --> 00:33:15,885
And how do I go up there?

395
00:33:15,885 --> 00:33:17,982
You've come the wrong way.

396
00:33:17,982 --> 00:33:21,365
The entrance is on the other side.

397
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:22,112
What?

398
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,761
Thank you so much.

399
00:33:26,064 --> 00:33:27,586
Let's go then.

400
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,643
You don't have to hurry because I don't think you will make it today.

401
00:33:30,643 --> 00:33:32,817
You have to go all the way to the other side.

402
00:33:32,817 --> 00:33:33,701
And it's quite dangerous.

403
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:35,880
Okay.

404
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:38,117
Is there any accommodation around here then?

405
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:51,648
Here it is.

406
00:33:52,684 --> 00:33:53,720
Thank you so much.

407
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,523
- Sure.
- We’d be in trouble if we hadn't met you.

408
00:34:05,314 --> 00:34:06,082
Phi.

409
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,122
Shouldn’t we go home?

410
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,757
Come on. We’ve come all the way here.

411
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,844
I'll take you to see the last light tomorrow no matter what.

412
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:22,574
It's not like I'll be seeing much even if we go up there.

413
00:34:27,614 --> 00:34:35,997
Well. Then who said we don't need eyes to look yet we're still able to see?

414
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:40,575
Hmm?

415
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,022
Let's go.

416
00:34:48,204 --> 00:34:49,269
Get some rest.

417
00:35:19,302 --> 00:35:21,563
I have a feeling that you’re scared somehow.

418
00:35:24,316 --> 00:35:26,316
Because the surroundings don’t look so welcoming.

419
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:29,527
Really?

420
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:34,520
Turns out I don't fear anything because I can't see.

421
00:35:35,514 --> 00:35:37,514
Here. I’ll take the lead.

422
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:48,840
- Hey!
- Oops!

423
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,398
Will you two stop being sneaky?

424
00:35:55,212 --> 00:35:56,795
Do you have any room available?

425
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:57,496
For how long?

426
00:35:57,945 --> 00:35:58,770
Just one night.

427
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:01,351
1,500 baht with 500 for deposit.

428
00:36:02,317 --> 00:36:03,527
Do you accept bank transfers?

429
00:36:10,274 --> 00:36:11,663
Day, they only take cash.

430
00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:19,445
Ma’am, we kind of changed our plan so suddenly and we didn't carry cash with us.

431
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:22,426
Okay.

432
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:24,685
Please. Hold on.

433
00:36:28,513 --> 00:36:29,184
What?

434
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,748
Ma’am.

435
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,685
I'm going blind soon.

436
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:41,447
I want to see the last light on the top of the mountain.

437
00:36:43,332 --> 00:36:45,150
As said in this novel.

438
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:51,720
This might be my last chance.

439
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:57,982
It might sound dramatic but we are telling the truth.

440
00:37:08,378 --> 00:37:10,065
David used to stay here.

441
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:12,770
David?

442
00:37:14,229 --> 00:37:16,019
The author of Last Twilight.

443
00:37:17,704 --> 00:37:18,473
Oh.

444
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:20,303
You look like you don't believe me.

445
00:37:25,852 --> 00:37:26,609
Here.

446
00:37:27,964 --> 00:37:28,712
See this?

447
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:30,175
I'm not lying.

448
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:31,874
Believe me now?

449
00:37:35,649 --> 00:37:36,658
That's true, Day.

450
00:37:40,488 --> 00:37:42,755
My name is Cherry. Yours?

451
00:37:43,607 --> 00:37:44,422
I'm Mhok.

452
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:46,284
This is Day.

453
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:48,380
Hello.

454
00:37:55,726 --> 00:37:56,499
Thank you.

455
00:37:56,655 --> 00:37:57,674
That was beautiful.

456
00:38:00,513 --> 00:38:01,451
Cherry.

457
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:02,200
Hmm?

458
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:04,559
So you’ve met David.

459
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:07,218
Mhm.

460
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:12,286
Back then, this place was run by my grandfather.

461
00:38:12,886 --> 00:38:17,325
He told me David's daughter was going blind at the time.

462
00:38:18,308 --> 00:38:20,933
So David took his daughter to travel around the world.

463
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,441
The trip ended here.

464
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:24,854
On that mountain.

465
00:38:28,137 --> 00:38:33,563
So that mountain is the inspiration for him to write Last Twilight?

466
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:36,973
I guess so.

467
00:38:37,598 --> 00:38:41,445
I think the character Mee is his daughter.

468
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:46,843
It's a shame.

469
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:50,530
The last page of the book we have is missing.

470
00:38:51,552 --> 00:38:53,786
So we don't know how it ends.

471
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:55,958
It's frustrating.

472
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:01,525
I'm going to go clean up the table.

473
00:39:02,431 --> 00:39:03,674
Let me help.

474
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,874
Thank you.

475
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:06,672
Day, wait here.

476
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:10,730
I’ll help.

477
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:27,253
♪ There’s no place to run away to ♪

478
00:39:27,253 --> 00:39:30,245
♪ So I decided to tell you ♪

479
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:37,276

484
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:16,219
Whoa.

485
00:40:17,044 --> 00:40:18,351
What a pleasant surprise.

486
00:40:19,992 --> 00:40:23,499
Not only a national badminton player, but you're also a musician.

487
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,685
Hmm?

488
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:32,856
It’s the first time I've ever played guitar for someone else.

489
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:47,340
Actually, by coming here together, we achieved many firsts.

490
00:40:51,642 --> 00:40:53,355
We got wasted and passed out on the beach.

491
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:55,838
We took a sidecar ride.

492
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:01,453
We tried Tao Koa.

493
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,026
We danced with a boyfriend.

494
00:41:20,899 --> 00:41:25,035
There's one more thing I'd like to do for the first time tonight.

495
00:41:33,351 --> 00:41:34,413
With you.

496
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:54,809
Phi, can I get my tee back?

497
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:00,385
Of course.

498
00:44:00,295 --> 00:44:01,093
Phi.

499
00:44:02,725 --> 00:44:04,266
Mom is coming home.

500
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:08,128
I don't want to cause you trouble tomorrow.

501
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:53,590
Are you peeping at me?

502
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,627
I saw every bit of your body last night.

503
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:00,748
I don't need to peep.

504
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,782
Then I'm at a disadvantage here.

505
00:45:12,697 --> 00:45:14,050
I didn't see any part of your body.

506
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,663
Do you want to try and see it again?

507
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:46,645
The sensation of doing something for the first time happens only once.

508
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:52,887
Yeah?

509
00:45:53,605 --> 00:45:54,173
Mhm.

510
00:45:55,134 --> 00:45:58,009
Are you sure it happens only once?

511
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:02,768
Where are you going?

512
00:46:02,768 --> 00:46:03,923
Come here.

513
00:46:05,705 --> 00:46:06,737
Phi Mhok.

514
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,538
I said once.

515
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,360
Cherry, thank you so much.

516
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,053
Once we arrive in Bangkok, we’ll send you the money.

517
00:46:21,053 --> 00:46:23,323
I'm happy to. No problem at all.

518
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,572
It's so sunny today.

519
00:46:29,211 --> 00:46:30,368
Well, it is the South after all.

520
00:46:30,368 --> 00:46:31,612
It's either rainy or sunny.

521
00:46:31,612 --> 00:46:33,184
You might not be so lucky.

522
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:39,014
But I have a hunch that something good will happen today.

523
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:45,903
Here.

524
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:48,835
David sent me this.

525
00:46:48,835 --> 00:46:50,119
I already finished it.

526
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:51,086
Take it.

527
00:46:55,425 --> 00:46:56,218
Day.

528
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,013
Cherry is giving us her Last Twilight book.

529
00:47:07,587 --> 00:47:08,864
The last page is here.

530
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:10,399
As well as David's autograph.

531
00:47:11,242 --> 00:47:12,034
Day.

532
00:47:13,923 --> 00:47:14,625
Cherry.

533
00:47:15,468 --> 00:47:16,485
It's okay.

534
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,250
You should keep it. It seems important.

535
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,442
We feel bad.

536
00:47:20,442 --> 00:47:21,175
Right.

537
00:47:27,716 --> 00:47:28,730
Hey!

538
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:31,173
You don’t have to do that.

539
00:47:31,173 --> 00:47:32,523
Just take it.

540
00:47:33,298 --> 00:47:35,079
I think it's more important to you than me.

541
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:39,773
Thank you.

542
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:43,795
Cherry, does it have a happy ending?

543
00:47:45,111 --> 00:47:46,072
What?

544
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,328
What's the fun if you already know the ending?

545
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:50,810
I'm not giving it to you anymore.

546
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,015
Find the ending yourselves.

547
00:47:52,015 --> 00:47:53,593
Hey. We want it.

548
00:47:53,593 --> 00:47:55,417
Yes, we want it.

549
00:47:55,865 --> 00:47:57,865
We'll keep it safe.

550
00:47:57,865 --> 00:47:58,670
You sure?

551
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,469
Yes. We’ve been looking for this.

552
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:06,356
No spoilers, of course.

553
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,618
We're taking off now.

554
00:48:10,118 --> 00:48:11,773
We will be in touch.

555
00:48:11,773 --> 00:48:13,431
Please do. Have a safe trip.

556
00:48:13,431 --> 00:48:14,220
Sure.

557
00:48:14,924 --> 00:48:16,237
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

558
00:48:16,237 --> 00:48:17,166
Will tell you how it goes.

559
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:17,809
Sure.

560
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:19,128
Thank you.

561
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:49,432
Are we here?

562
00:49:03,934 --> 00:49:05,934
It doesn't look this tall on the book cover.

563
00:49:06,174 --> 00:49:10,079
But the real thing looks like a 40-story building.

564
00:49:12,304 --> 00:49:15,054
Do you think what we're doing is crazy?

565
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,353
I do.

566
00:49:17,852 --> 00:49:21,882
And we must see the beautiful sky as a reward for our craziness.

567
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:25,733
Should we go?

568
00:49:26,732 --> 00:49:27,491
Yeah.

569
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:46,286
Day, are you okay?

570
00:49:47,695 --> 00:49:49,227
Let me know if your legs hurt.

571
00:50:25,475 --> 00:50:26,463
Still doing okay?

572
00:50:27,712 --> 00:50:28,724
I am.

573
00:50:29,837 --> 00:50:30,962
There's a trunk here.

574
00:50:30,962 --> 00:50:31,964
Let's take a break first.

575
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,093
It's okay.

576
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:36,648
Let's go on.

577
00:50:36,648 --> 00:50:37,386
We need to make it in time.

578
00:50:37,386 --> 00:50:38,504
Just a short break.

579
00:50:38,504 --> 00:50:39,385
Get something to drink.

580
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:50,891
Here, Day. I opened it for you.

581
00:51:03,879 --> 00:51:05,223
[Night]

582
00:51:06,957 --> 00:51:07,694
Hey.

583
00:51:08,006 --> 00:51:09,425
We have a phone reception today.

584
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:11,941
Just wait here. I'll be right back.

585
00:51:12,173 --> 00:51:12,977
Mhm.

586
00:51:18,299 --> 00:51:19,186
Yes, Night?

587
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,361
(Where are you guys?)

588
00:51:20,751 --> 00:51:22,189
(Mom is coming home tonight.)

589
00:51:25,873 --> 00:51:27,467
Can I have one more day?

590
00:51:27,763 --> 00:51:28,888
(Are you nuts, Mhok?)

591
00:51:29,505 --> 00:51:30,849
(Take Day back right now.)

592
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,705
I really can't do that.

593
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,217
(Do you even realize what you're doing?)

594
00:51:47,344 --> 00:51:48,277
It's nothing.

595
00:51:48,277 --> 00:51:49,625
Just Porjai.

596
00:51:53,138 --> 00:51:54,157
Stop it.

597
00:51:54,532 --> 00:51:56,013
Did Night just call?

598
00:51:57,437 --> 00:51:58,320
Let's go home.

599
00:51:58,945 --> 00:52:00,437
We can come back later.

600
00:52:01,223 --> 00:52:02,238
You stop it.

601
00:52:03,223 --> 00:52:04,770
You think I don't know?

602
00:52:06,571 --> 00:52:07,978
Your sight is giving out, isn't it?

603
00:52:08,898 --> 00:52:10,055
That's why you changed your mind and decided to come.

604
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:18,441
After the day I met Dad, my vision has worsened.

605
00:52:20,072 --> 00:52:21,000
And right now…

606
00:52:22,197 --> 00:52:25,613
I can't quite see things even from a palm distance.

607
00:52:28,147 --> 00:52:31,521
I don't know if it will last until we reach the top.

608
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:40,777
Let’s go.

609
00:52:42,432 --> 00:52:43,304
Phi.

610
00:52:44,425 --> 00:52:45,370
Phi.

611
00:52:47,013 --> 00:52:48,568
Mom is coming home.

612
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:52,365
I don't want to cause you trouble tomorrow.

613
00:52:56,534 --> 00:52:57,409
Day.

614
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:03,548
To me, there's only today.

615
00:53:13,183 --> 00:53:14,183
Let's go.

616
00:53:44,904 --> 00:53:48,903
Do you know why Aon pushed me so hard to read Last Twilight?

617
00:53:49,528 --> 00:53:50,508
Why?

618
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:54,019
Because I'm just like Mee.

619
00:53:54,503 --> 00:53:56,409
Locked myself up in my room.

620
00:53:56,924 --> 00:53:58,924
Let the world slowly forget about me.

621
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:02,084
Until you came along.

622
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:05,088
You took me outside.

623
00:54:06,429 --> 00:54:10,178
And I felt like I was seen again.

624
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,161
Yeah, I hauled and yanked you out of your room.

625
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:17,494
How weird.

626
00:54:18,415 --> 00:54:20,133
Even though I'm going blind,

627
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:25,610
I feel like this is the first time I'm seeing the world clearly.

628
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,946
Seeing the Sun touch my face.

629
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,210
Seeing the cool breeze.

630
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:39,013
Seeing the good scent of flowers.

631
00:54:40,641 --> 00:54:42,173
Seeing everything.

632
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,248
It's a shame.

633
00:54:48,512 --> 00:54:50,012
I should have seen them all sooner.

634
00:54:51,995 --> 00:54:53,402
It's not a shame.

635
00:54:54,322 --> 00:54:57,165
There are so many things out there I want you to see.

636
00:55:00,713 --> 00:55:04,337
But at least you must see the last twilight today.

637
00:55:10,411 --> 00:55:11,418
Should we continue?

638
00:55:11,418 --> 00:55:12,411
Yes.

639
00:56:13,756 --> 00:56:15,038
Are we there yet?

640
00:56:15,561 --> 00:56:17,936
Yes, we are.

641
00:56:19,575 --> 00:56:21,075
But there are clouds everywhere.

642
00:56:21,996 --> 00:56:25,277
We have half an hour until the last light goes out.

643
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:27,837
Let's hope for the best.

644
00:56:31,569 --> 00:56:35,256
While we wait, can you read me the ending?

645
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,501
Last Twilight: Epilogue.

646
00:56:54,143 --> 00:56:58,142
Finally, Mee arrived at the Last Twilight Mountain.

647
00:56:58,493 --> 00:57:02,617
The place where the last light would break all curses.

648
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:07,048
Mee was softly cradled by an orange ray of light.

649
00:57:07,736 --> 00:57:11,829
The curse within Mee was gradually washed away

650
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:17,983
as Mee's body slowly turned to a stone.

651
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:28,370
In the end, Mee became a statue and gazed joyfully at the last light, forever.

652
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:29,275
What?

653
00:57:29,994 --> 00:57:31,151
Why does it end like this?

654
00:57:33,446 --> 00:57:34,759
How would I know?

655
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,774
You must ask David.

656
00:57:41,474 --> 00:57:48,173
How bad was the picture he saw that day to write such a painful ending?

657
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:55,887
I think it's good to end like this.

658
00:57:56,961 --> 00:57:58,961
Mee will never fade away again.

659
00:58:02,268 --> 00:58:08,547
I think what David saw that day must be so beautiful.

660
00:58:11,306 --> 00:58:16,523
So beautiful that he didn't think he had to take his daughter to find anything else.

661
00:58:18,573 --> 00:58:19,761
That's exaggerating.

662
00:58:20,432 --> 00:58:23,775
Nothing in this whole world is that beautiful.

663
00:58:25,854 --> 00:58:26,616
There is.

664
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:35,643
A moment so good that you feel like you can live there forever.

665
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,379
I just got it.

666
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:10,593
But you deserve to see something better than this, Day.

667
00:59:19,897 --> 00:59:20,862
Hey!

668
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,093
We went through so much trouble to get here.

669
00:59:26,513 --> 00:59:28,513
Show us the beautiful sky!

670
00:59:29,508 --> 00:59:30,630
Will you?

671
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:33,912
Just for today.

672
00:59:33,912 --> 00:59:35,605
Give it to us.

673
00:59:40,406 --> 00:59:44,592
What kind of beautiful sky do you want?

674
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:48,173
At least more beautiful than this.

675
00:59:51,869 --> 00:59:52,957
How?

676
00:59:53,869 --> 00:59:55,343
Explain it to me.

677
01:00:00,311 --> 01:00:03,311
An orange sky, I guess.

678
01:00:07,426 --> 01:00:09,832
And the round shape of the Sun in the middle.

679
01:00:13,283 --> 01:00:14,783
Pretty clouds all around it.

680
01:00:19,577 --> 01:00:20,984
It would be great to have a rainbow too.

681
01:00:28,335 --> 01:00:29,398
I'm seeing it.

682
01:00:31,734 --> 01:00:33,422
As beautiful as you describe.

683
01:00:35,483 --> 01:00:41,012
Day, all I'm seeing now is gray clouds.

684
01:00:46,331 --> 01:00:47,643
Look again more closely.

685
01:00:49,892 --> 01:00:50,924
See?

686
01:00:53,734 --> 01:01:03,167
The sky is a gradient from red to orange to yellow.

687
01:01:05,047 --> 01:01:09,358
And there's the Sun hiding at the skyline,

688
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,768
shining through the edge of the clouds.

689
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:17,233
Looks just like ocean waves.

690
01:01:57,024 --> 01:01:58,181
I'm seeing it now.

691
01:02:01,893 --> 01:02:03,612
As beautiful as what you just described.

692
01:02:21,001 --> 01:02:22,595
So you've seen everything you want to see?

693
01:02:26,374 --> 01:02:27,437
Not yet.

694
01:02:30,174 --> 01:02:31,737
There's still one last image.

695
01:02:48,944 --> 01:02:50,351
Are you smiling?

696
01:03:03,465 --> 01:03:04,363
Mhm.

697
01:03:10,984 --> 01:03:12,173
Don't lie to me.

698
01:03:42,654 --> 01:03:43,620
This is it.

699
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:46,403
The last image I want to see.

Am I completely blind, doctor?

707
01:04:39,808 --> 01:04:40,840
I am so sorry.

708
01:04:41,293 --> 01:04:43,293
You totally went over the line with my son.

709
01:04:43,293 --> 01:04:45,922
I want to quit.

710
01:04:45,922 --> 01:04:49,742
To me, he’s not just a caretaker.

711
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:51,565
He is more.

712
01:04:51,813 --> 01:04:53,220
How sweet you are.

713
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:57,268
Come and work at my restaurant.

714
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:58,774
They're looking for a cook.

715
01:04:59,015 --> 01:05:01,133
I guess I've come to the wrong place.

716
01:05:01,133 --> 01:05:02,623
You've come to the right place.

717
01:05:03,602 --> 01:05:06,173
I reserved you the best table, Mr. Customer.

718
01:05:07,281 --> 01:05:08,173
Please come in.
