4
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:20,841
We’re looking for someone to take care of Day.

5
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:22,107
He can’t see clearly.

6
00:00:22,107 --> 00:00:24,298
His vision is only 20% effective.

7
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:25,689
How much do you make a day?

8
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:27,668
My mom will double it.

9
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:29,291
Keep your money.

10
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:31,664
This mouth loves asking for bruises.

11
00:00:32,428 --> 00:00:33,926
Save the money for medical treatment.

12
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:36,000
What happened to him?

13
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:39,734
I heard he had a car accident that caused his corneas to be damaged.

14
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,457
His vision has become worse after that.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,280
Do you think it's easy for me to take care of you?

16
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:48,152
Day!

17
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:52,555
Watch out!

18
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,494
He dropped his library membership card.

19
00:00:57,494 --> 00:00:58,406
It’s his.

20
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,554
Let him get it himself.

21
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:01,732
We don’t need the interview, Mom.

22
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:03,388
Hire this guy.

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,640
My name is Mhok.

24
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,586
When should I start?

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,960
I’ll see you

26
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:09,049
tomorrow.

27
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,000
Good morning, Mrs. Mhon.

28
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:39,738
You said casual, didn’t you?

29
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:43,852
Come in.

30
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,232
We have housekeepers here.

31
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:59,716
Your sole responsibility is to look after Day.

32
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:02,158
That's a relief.

33
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:07,440
Your work is eight-to-six, six days a week.

34
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,905
If you must stay longer, I'll pay you for the overtime.

35
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:11,298
Yes.

36
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,198
This is my office.

37
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:18,537
Don't go in unless it's necessary.

38
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,092
And Day's room?

39
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:23,733
Day’s is over here.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Night’s is on that side.

41
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,679
Mine is on the other wing.

42
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:30,232
What about their father?

43
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:34,620
Only the three of us live here.

44
00:02:37,102 --> 00:02:37,850
Oh.

45
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:38,883
Yes.

46
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:41,061
Here.

47
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:43,458
The contract.

48
00:02:43,676 --> 00:02:46,592

51
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:11,770
and prepare him food.

52
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:13,057
That’s easy.

53
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:15,061
I’m the cook when there’s a drinking party.

54
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,433
Day is a picky eater.

55
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:22,073
He only eats what I make.

56
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:27,920
Before I go somewhere, I'd cook and put the food in the fridge.

57
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:29,736
You just need to heat it up for him.

58
00:03:30,238 --> 00:03:31,056
Sure.

59
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:33,157
Anything else?

60
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,102
That’d be all.

61
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:38,527
Isn't it too little?

62
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:40,684
Even when I took care of my friend's dog,

63
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:42,363
I was asked to take it out for a walk.

64
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:44,358
Please.

65
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,421
Before you take him out for a walk,

66
00:03:46,797 --> 00:03:48,649
make him come out of his room and come downstairs first.

67
00:03:50,152 --> 00:03:53,216
He came downstairs, kicked stuff, and tripped.

68
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,066
He's locked himself up in his room ever since.

69
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,049
Hey.

70
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,677
Can you make coffee?

71
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:02,906
I can.

72
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:03,902
Make me one.

73
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,102
Sure.

74
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:09,361
Night.

75
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:11,705
Is Day okay with the delegation of authority?

76
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:13,628
Come on, Mom.

77
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:16,983
If he agreed to that, we wouldn't need to hire a caretaker, right?

78
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:22,317
Here.

79
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:23,867
Thank you.

80
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:25,800
Take this.

81
00:04:26,502 --> 00:04:28,147
Bring breakfast to Day.

82
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:30,911
If he hasn't been up, don't wake him.

83
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,240
Just leave it there.

84
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:33,503
Yes, ma’am.

85
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:45,265
Don't worry, Mom.

86
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:48,176
I think Mhok seems okay. It's just his bad-guy look.

87
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:49,400
Trust me.

88
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:51,229
Fine.

89
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:52,976
I'm going to take off now.

90
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,497
Leave me a message if you need anything.

91
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:03,936
Damn.

92
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,000

Hi.

99
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:47,196
Have you got fired yet?

100
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:48,690
No.

101
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:53,784
Not only still hired, but also paid a very high salary.

102
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,862
I just knew that easy jobs with huge pay really existed.

Hey.

108
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:16,942
What is it?

109
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,099
Who are you?

00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:35,683
Sorry.

00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:42,122
Did you do this?

116
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,976
Yes, I cleaned it.

134
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:35,845
don't come into my room.

Yeah?

00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:27,585
I remember this.

152
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:32,240
Back when you hit on me, I just said my computer was a little slow,

153
00:12:32,656 --> 00:12:36,814
you had it reset and all my files were gone. Remember that?

154
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:39,228
So?

00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,159

Otherwise, you wouldn't like me back.

157
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:47,795
That’s because I felt pity.

158
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:50,293
Not for you though.

159
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,840
I felt pity for those other girls you might hit on.

00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:56,694
Yeah, whatever.

00:12:56,955 --> 00:12:58,127

Right.

182
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,541
Mhok, why don’t you look under the plant pot next to the gate?

183
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:34,816
Found it.

184
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:35,732

00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:41,955
What? No.

00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:52,571
Actually, I just come to get free food once a week.

192
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,379
Let's get inside.

193
00:14:55,913 --> 00:14:56,804
All right.

194
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:01,046
But I'm not sure if Day will let you see him today.

195
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,383
Something happened yesterday.

196
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:06,786
Master Aon!

197
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:07,693
Yeah!

198
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:08,354
Where are you?

199
00:15:16,032 --> 00:15:17,382
- I missed you.
- Me too.

200
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:19,128
Excuse me. You want anything to eat?

201
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:21,196
Let’s talk.

202
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:22,215
Sure.

203
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:27,776
Oh, wow!

204
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,823
He really is a badass, isn’t he?

205
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:33,171
Just what I need.

206
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,443
Mom will have a long-term negative view toward hiring caretakers.

207
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:38,849
Well, I’m afraid someone here will too.

208
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:41,493
Right. You know?

209
00:15:41,645 --> 00:15:45,389
On his first day, he organized my desk and removed everything.

210
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:48,285
I still haven’t found my charger.

211
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:50,327
I wonder if he took it and sold it.

212
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:52,437
Relax.

213
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:55,464
Adjustment needs time.

214
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,715
I give him one week max.

215
00:15:59,006 --> 00:15:59,812
He will quit for sure.

216
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,715
No.

217
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:04,054
I meant you.

218
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:06,937
Give yourself time.

219
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:14,133
I know it isn’t easy to spend time with someone with no visual impairment.

220
00:16:18,755 --> 00:16:19,927
Come on, bro.

221
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,189
Who said I wanted to spend time with him?

222
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:23,480
Well.

223
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,844
You never complained about any of your caretakers to me before.

224
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:30,317
Really?

225
00:16:30,317 --> 00:16:31,191
Yes.

226
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:33,689
You always let me talk alone.

227
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,172
Is that so?

228
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,127
Speaking of talking,

229
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:42,216
the other day, I was on Tinder.

230
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,142
I met this girl who was a runner.

231
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:48,481
Are you serious?

232
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:51,122
I'm thinking of asking her out for a run.

233
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:53,428
Just run or something else too?

234
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:55,976
Well, I'll just see how it goes.

235
00:16:58,772 --> 00:16:59,607
Are you done?

236
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:00,555
That's right.

237
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,575
I'm done.

238
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:04,808
Finally.

239
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:08,406
Oh, hey.

240
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:09,301
Can I have a selfie with you?

241
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,195
Almost forgot that I needed to show this to The Shining Society.

242
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,330
Make sure to look brightened up.

243
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:23,306
One, two, cheese!

244
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:30,519
Okay.

245
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:31,833
And it's done.

246
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,759
Bro, seriously.

247
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,212
Are you really blind?

248
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:37,675
What?

249
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:40,029
Blind people have their ways.

250
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:41,770
That was a super easy skill.

251
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,924
Anyone can do that.

252
00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:48,916
If my boss was as good as you, he wouldn't need me.

253
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,960
Don't be discouraged yet, Mhok.

254
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:55,334
Day was a national athlete.

255
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:57,773
He was a guy with confidence.

256
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:00,271
But now he's in this condition.

257
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:02,880
Who would want to leave the house?

258
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:04,890
Why?

259
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,471
He has me to take care of him now.

260
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,447
What is he afraid of?

261
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:09,643
He isn't afraid of tripping.

262
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:14,593
He's afraid of the way people would look at him.

263
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:22,913
It's scary when we are perceived as…

264
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:25,449
abnormal people.

265
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:35,357
There's nothing to be embarrassed of.

266
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:38,819
You're not in his shoes, you wouldn't get it,

267
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:39,983
Mhok.

268
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:03,659
Oh, I've got a question.

269
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,717
Why did Day choose me?

270
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:09,643
I don't know.

271
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:17,727
All I know is he bets you won't last a week.

272
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:21,255
Why is he so confident?

273
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:24,493
You should be glad, Mhok.

274
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:28,375
The previous ones couldn't even last three days.

275
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:48,962
Why did you take off your shirt?

276
00:20:19,922 --> 00:20:20,908
Your lunch.

277
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:23,111
Leave it by the door.

278
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:33,031
I'll wait here then.

279
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:34,176
Call me if you need anything.

280
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:35,877
Don't wait.

281
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:37,065
Go wherever you want.

282
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:16,787
I'm right here.

283
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:17,548
Oh, son of a–!

284
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:19,771
I told you to go away.

285
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:21,362
Damn it.

286
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:51,789
(“Men buy things all ready made at the shops.”)

287
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:55,643
(“But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship.”)

288
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:00,261
(“And so men have no friends anymore,” said the fox.)

289
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,340
("What must I do if I want a friend?" asked the little prince.)

290
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,351
(“Tame me,” replied the fox.)

291
00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:14,071
("You must be very patient.)

292
00:22:14,587 --> 00:22:17,383
(First, you will sit down at a little distance from me and say nothing.)

293
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,213
(I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye.)

294
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:23,683
(But you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . .")

295
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:17,831
Hey.

296
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:18,845
Can you come in?

297
00:23:47,723 --> 00:23:48,488
What’s up?

298
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:49,843
Hey.

299
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,020
I dropped my eye drops.

300
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:53,957
I’ll help you look.

301
00:23:58,349 --> 00:23:58,855
Where is it?

302
00:24:00,156 --> 00:24:01,650
How should I know that?

303
00:24:03,153 --> 00:24:03,860
Around here.

304
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,706
Just take a look.

305
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:08,923
What does it look like?

306
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,860
A round and small bottle.

307
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:13,993
Small, huh?

308
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:15,415
That's gonna be difficult.

309
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,057
Just search carefully.

310
00:24:49,976 --> 00:24:50,660
I found it.

311
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:53,238
Should I help you put it in?

312
00:24:53,805 --> 00:24:54,393
No.

313
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:55,203
Give it to me.

314
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,452
Why did you take off your shirt?

315
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:06,304
Well.

316
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,853
You said I smelled like cigarettes.

317
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:10,901
Didn't you?

318
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:15,552
So should I help you with this?

319
00:25:16,912 --> 00:25:17,784
It's okay.

320
00:25:43,284 --> 00:25:43,915
What are you doing?

321
00:25:45,284 --> 00:25:49,120
Right after using eye drops, I can see more clearly.

322
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:50,958
Not much though.

323
00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:55,447
But it's the 10 seconds of the day that I can see most clearly.

324
00:25:56,824 --> 00:25:57,525
Where are you?

325
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:01,815
Oh! You're right here.

326
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:03,725
Come here.

327
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:06,610
Swim quickly.

328
00:26:06,868 --> 00:26:07,554
Go over there.

329
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:11,240
You're here.

330
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,728
Go.

331
00:26:17,604 --> 00:26:19,934
Living alone in a small fish tank is lonely, right?

332
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,314
Goldfish have a short memory.

333
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:26,089
It can't be lonely.

334
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,462
Do you even know anything?

335
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:37,124
Have you got bigger?

336
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:03,065
Breakfast is ready, young master.

337
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:15,959
What are you doing?

338
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:17,620
Opening your curtains.

339
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:18,985
Opening your eyes.

340
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:21,711
Opening my eyes?

341
00:27:22,315 --> 00:27:23,207
Are you freaking kidding me?

342
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:25,423
Hey.

343
00:27:25,716 --> 00:27:27,153
The weather is nice today.

344
00:27:27,153 --> 00:27:28,380
Should we go eat downstairs?

345
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:29,827
No.

346
00:27:30,345 --> 00:27:31,033
Come on.

347
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:33,919
If you're too lazy to walk, I’ll carry you.

348
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:35,776
I'm not going.

349
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:36,895
Leave my room.

350
00:27:37,944 --> 00:27:38,971
- Let's go.
- Leave my room.

351
00:27:39,465 --> 00:27:40,278
Go!

352
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:43,174
Hold on!

353
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:44,107
The fish.

354
00:27:44,107 --> 00:27:45,021
It's freaking dying.

355
00:27:48,912 --> 00:27:49,902
Shit.

356
00:27:52,048 --> 00:27:52,608
It's not.

357
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:53,737
But it looks suffocated.

358
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,674
When was the last time you cleaned the tank?

359
00:27:56,965 --> 00:27:58,007
Help it first.

360
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,145
If it dies, you're fired.

361
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,473
What? Why me?

362
00:28:03,365 --> 00:28:04,666
You must help me.

363
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,983
What? Why me?

364
00:28:07,382 --> 00:28:08,760
It's your fish, not mine.

365
00:28:09,084 --> 00:28:10,665
Your hands are available.

366
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:14,570
Hurry up and help it.

367
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,701
What's your vision like?

368
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:22,945
If I look close enough, I can blurrily see.

369
00:28:23,913 --> 00:28:24,706
How close?

370
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:25,816
One span.

371
00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:54,909
That was close, you.

372
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,454
What are you laughing at?

373
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:04,518
There's a kid who refused to leave his room just now.

374
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,483
How old are you?

375
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:11,484
Old enough to call me ‘kid’?

376
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:13,835
Oh, I'm older than you for sure.

377
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,159
Nong Day.

378
00:29:19,106 --> 00:29:20,483
Clean it quickly.

379
00:29:21,103 --> 00:29:22,261
And put everything back in its place.

380
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:24,604
Listen.

381
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:27,243
I have assembled cars before.

382
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,467
This is so easy that I can do it with my eyes closed.

383
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:38,020
Hey.

384
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,116
Hm?

385
00:29:39,502 --> 00:29:40,727
Is the jasmine blooming?

386
00:29:42,713 --> 00:29:43,754
Yes, it is.

387
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:45,316
Do you want to see?

388
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:49,938
No, it's okay.

389
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:51,944
Just finish this.

390
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:53,387
I want to go back to my room.

391
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:01,013
Jasmine?

392
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:01,824
Um.

393
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:31,302
What's your vision like?

394
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:33,085
Well.

395
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:35,819
Like looking at the world through a plastic bag.

396
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:40,014
If I look close enough, I can blurrily see.

397
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:41,788
How close?

398
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:48,250
About this close.

399
00:30:48,617 --> 00:30:49,390
One span.

400
00:30:49,851 --> 00:30:50,468
One span?

401
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:51,199
Um.

402
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:12,549
What are you doing?

403
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:15,658
Don't you want to know what I look like?

404
00:31:24,506 --> 00:31:25,103
No.

405
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,087
I'm hungry.

406
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,314
Take me back to my room.

407
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,246
You can't.

408
00:31:30,697 --> 00:31:33,603
On the way here, we spilled water all over your room’s floor.

409
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:37,529
I guess we need to change the place to eat today.

410
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:43,390
Be careful. It's hot.

411
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:56,359
Chicken Massaman Curry?

412
00:31:56,843 --> 00:31:57,525
Yes.

413
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,591
How long are you going to stare at me?

414
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,125
How do you know?

415
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:28,691
Well, I can feel it.

416
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,004
You normally talk so much.

417
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,121
I’d like to know this.

418
00:32:35,484 --> 00:32:37,726
Aren't you bored of your mom's food?

419
00:32:38,364 --> 00:32:41,696
You’re rich. You can order fancy food here every day.

420
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:47,161
Those fancy foods you're mentioning are all my mom's recipes.

421
00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:53,433
There's also a fried egg.

422
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:54,843
Do you want soy sauce? I’ll get it for you.

423
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:56,637
Yes.

424
00:32:57,388 --> 00:32:58,759
Cupboard on the right.

425
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,994
It's not here. Only glasses here.

426
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,501
No. Glasses are in the lower cupboard.

427
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,284
It's up there. Just look more carefully.

428
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,143
I looked. It really isn't there.

429
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,349
Found it.

430
00:33:26,543 --> 00:33:28,015
It's under the sink.

431
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,483
I think you need to come down here more often.

432
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,065
Really?

433
00:33:35,484 --> 00:33:39,978
You know what? The last time I was here, I got myself a cast.

434
00:33:40,373 --> 00:33:42,543
You have me now. Nothing to be afraid of.

435
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,885
Ouch!

436
00:33:47,674 --> 00:33:48,464
Serves you right.

437
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:49,989
Just where I hit it.

438
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:57,180
Here.

439
00:34:07,209 --> 00:34:09,693
Oh. I cleaned your room.

440
00:34:11,163 --> 00:34:13,986
After we're done eating, let's do something fun.

441
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,024
You have a home theater but leave it unused?

442
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,011
Are you asking me to watch a movie?

443
00:34:31,397 --> 00:34:32,187
Seriously?

444
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:33,857
Why not?

445
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,738
You can't see but you can still hear.

446
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:40,894
It won't be fun hearing only the voices.

447
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,341
Have you tried it before to know that it is not fun?

448
00:34:51,587 --> 00:34:52,522
You wanna watch this?

449
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,643
4…RIA?

450
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:03,907
It’s called 4BIA, not 4RIA.

451
00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:16,315
Your life isn't exciting enough or what?

452
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:17,987
Why do you like to watch horror movies?

453
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:19,843
No.

454
00:35:20,263 --> 00:35:22,433
I saw you have both 4BIA and Phobia 2.

455
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:24,155
So I guessed they were good movies.

456
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:25,162
Why?

457
00:35:25,598 --> 00:35:26,396
Are you scared of ghosts?

458
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:29,234
Yeah, I'm scared to death.

459
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,474
All I hear is the sound of people walking around.

460
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,006
How scary.

461
00:35:40,968 --> 00:35:42,702
How scary.

462
00:35:42,702 --> 00:35:43,446
Scary, huh?

463
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:46,683
I haven't seen you guys for so long.

464
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:47,891
That's right.

465
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:49,430
Make yourself at home.

466
00:35:53,132 --> 00:35:54,454
Day, why are you down here?

467
00:35:54,743 --> 00:35:55,992
Hi, Day.

468
00:35:56,451 --> 00:35:57,509
When did you get back from the States?

469
00:35:58,308 --> 00:35:59,250
How have you been?

470
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,831
Which city did you live in?

471
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:03,829
Gosh!

472
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:04,643
Hey!

473
00:36:05,484 --> 00:36:06,198
Day.

474
00:36:09,483 --> 00:36:10,236
Day!

475
00:36:11,124 --> 00:36:11,915
Day.

476
00:36:12,593 --> 00:36:13,802
Day, relax.

477
00:36:13,802 --> 00:36:15,220
- Day, relax.
- Day.

478
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:17,106
Day.

479
00:36:21,237 --> 00:36:21,978
Day.

480
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:24,351
Let go.

481
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,035
Day.

482
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,207
Day.

483
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:28,000
Let go of me.

484
00:36:32,061 --> 00:36:33,867
I didn't know you'd be here.

485
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:41,670
Mhok, go check on him.

486
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,470
Of course.

487
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,596
Day!

488
00:36:46,565 --> 00:36:47,838
What's wrong with your little brother?

489
00:36:48,951 --> 00:36:49,864
Damn it.

490
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:52,694
I'll fill you in later.

491
00:36:55,812 --> 00:36:57,521
Hey, it’s me.

492
00:36:59,082 --> 00:36:59,981
Day.

493
00:37:02,741 --> 00:37:03,527
Day.

494
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,169
It’s me. Open up.

495
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:10,837
Now you know why I don’t want to go downstairs.

496
00:37:16,876 --> 00:37:18,393
Why do you care what they think?

497
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,159
It’s your life.

498
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,794
You think I haven’t been looked down on before?

499
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:27,536
You think I’m like you, huh?

500
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,885
No, you’re not.

501
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:39,765
At least you have money, a house, a family who cares about you.

502
00:37:40,379 --> 00:37:42,043
Isn’t that enough?

503
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:43,253
You wanna trade then?

504
00:37:43,718 --> 00:37:47,050
Give me your eyes and take everything I have.

505
00:37:48,425 --> 00:37:49,432
Do you dare?

506
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,966
People keep saying they understand.

507
00:37:56,746 --> 00:38:00,483
But in the end, you will never ever get how it feels

508
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:07,643
to look in the mirror and can’t see your old self.

509
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:11,873
You’ve never been there.

510
00:38:12,987 --> 00:38:14,090
You never know.

511
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:24,796
What? Why are you quiet now?

512
00:38:29,628 --> 00:38:31,798
Fine. I’m sorry.

513
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,554
Can you let me in?

514
00:38:38,072 --> 00:38:38,748
Hey,

515
00:38:40,249 --> 00:38:41,012
I’m sorry.

516
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:44,403
Day.

517
00:38:46,862 --> 00:38:48,232
Hey, open the door.

518
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:54,593
Day.

519
00:38:57,862 --> 00:38:58,523
Day.

520
00:39:01,498 --> 00:39:02,094
Day.

521
00:39:25,874 --> 00:39:26,781
Rung.

522
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:29,908
I bought you your favorite spicy salad.

523
00:39:33,181 --> 00:39:33,751
Rung.

524
00:39:39,853 --> 00:39:40,944
Rung!

525
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:48,231
Rung.

526
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,611
Rung!

527
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:51,919
Rung!

528
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:53,407
Rung!

529
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:55,483
Why, Rung?

530
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,879
Porjai, answer me.

531
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:02,731
What happened to my sister?

532
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,214
Answer me!

533
00:40:14,342 --> 00:40:15,164
Day!

534
00:40:15,697 --> 00:40:17,045
Day, open the door.

535
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:18,526
Day!

536
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,629
Day, do you hear me?

537
00:40:21,227 --> 00:40:22,562
Open the door now.

538
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,445
Hey!

539
00:40:27,614 --> 00:40:28,403
Day!

540
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:42,353
Shit.

541
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:43,717
Who’s that?

542
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:50,920
It’s me.

543
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:52,963
Holy shit.

544
00:40:53,481 --> 00:40:54,458
Why are you in here?

545
00:41:02,255 --> 00:41:03,563
I was just worried about you.

546
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:06,140
Are you okay?

547
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:07,664
Let go of me.

548
00:41:11,864 --> 00:41:13,864
I’m sorry for what I said.

549
00:41:14,225 --> 00:41:14,966
Get out.

550
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:19,851
I didn’t mean to come in and see…

551
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:20,880
You’re fired.

552
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:47,556
My name is Porjai.

553
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:49,089
I’m Mhok’s friend.

554
00:41:51,462 --> 00:41:52,145
Yes.

555
00:41:55,603 --> 00:41:57,264
He asked me to give you this.

556
00:41:58,279 --> 00:41:59,722
I don’t know what it is.

557
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,510
(…said the fox.)

558
00:42:25,758 --> 00:42:30,138
("What must I do if I want a friend?" asked the little prince.)

559
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:34,520
(“Tame me,” replied the fox.)

560
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:40,293
("You must be very patient.")

561
00:42:40,554 --> 00:42:43,585
("First, you will sit down at a little distance from me and say nothing.")

562
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:45,328
("I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye.")

563
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:50,259
("But you will sit a little closer to me, every day . . .")

564
00:42:50,584 --> 00:42:54,303
("It’d have been better to come back at the same hour.")

565
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:59,806
(“If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy.”)

566
00:43:00,195 --> 00:43:04,733
(“At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about.”)

567
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,874
(“I shall show you how happy I am!”)

568
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:10,592
Give yourself time.

569
00:43:12,044 --> 00:43:17,825
I know it isn’t easy to spend time with someone with no visual impairment.

570
00:43:20,296 --> 00:43:21,300
What are you doing?

571
00:43:21,617 --> 00:43:24,332
Don't you want to know what I look like?

572
00:43:24,747 --> 00:43:25,769
You’re fired.

573
00:44:01,376 --> 00:44:02,477
I’ll get the door.

574
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:19,183
Who are you here for?

575
00:44:20,796 --> 00:44:21,812
I’m Mhok’s friend.

576
00:44:23,306 --> 00:44:24,090
Ah.

577
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:25,861
He told me last night.

578
00:44:26,148 --> 00:44:28,306
I’ll transfer the rest to his account and…

579
00:44:28,473 --> 00:44:29,359
Um…

580
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:31,161
No.

581
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,200
I’m actually here for Day.

582
00:44:45,825 --> 00:44:46,744
This way.

583
00:44:49,282 --> 00:44:50,151
Day.

584
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:52,531
Mhok sent his friend to see you.

585
00:44:53,188 --> 00:44:56,061
Whatever it is, you can talk to her.

586
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:24,221
My name is Porjai.

587
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:25,757
I’m Mhok’s friend.

588
00:45:28,031 --> 00:45:28,871
Yes.

589
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,112
He asked me to give you this.

590
00:45:34,823 --> 00:45:36,426
I don’t know what it is.

591
00:45:38,885 --> 00:45:40,250
Here. Let me.

592
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:49,575
They are slippers.

593
00:45:50,127 --> 00:45:51,866
It’s a fish.

594
00:45:52,218 --> 00:45:56,016
Wait. A dog, no, a bear, I don’t know.

595
00:45:56,016 --> 00:45:57,151
They’re orange.

596
00:46:18,467 --> 00:46:21,506
He came downstairs, kicked stuff, and tripped.

597
00:46:21,506 --> 00:46:23,537
He's locked himself up in his room ever since.

598
00:46:24,424 --> 00:46:28,195
Because this is what happens if you let him eat by himself.

599
00:46:31,895 --> 00:46:33,102
Ouch!

600
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,004
Serves you right.

601
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:37,627
Just where I hit it.

602
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,347
That would be all.

603
00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:46,817
I’m taking off now.

604
00:46:46,976 --> 00:46:47,908
Thanks for your time.

605
00:46:53,805 --> 00:46:54,547
Excuse me.

606
00:46:56,026 --> 00:46:56,755
Yeah?

607
00:47:00,799 --> 00:47:01,847
What’s up?

608
00:47:05,308 --> 00:47:07,096
Can you take me to him?

609
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:30,234
Here we are.

610
00:47:31,588 --> 00:47:33,306
Mhok is sitting right in front of you.

611
00:47:47,063 --> 00:47:49,906
I don't know what happened yesterday.

612
00:47:50,352 --> 00:47:53,833
After he got back, out of nowhere he just blindfolded himself.

613
00:47:54,064 --> 00:47:55,667
He’s slept and eaten here.

614
00:48:00,132 --> 00:48:03,306
I tried to drag him home but he refused.

615
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:05,936
People think he's lost it.

616
00:48:22,707 --> 00:48:23,568
Hey, you.

617
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:26,373
What the heck are you doing?

618
00:48:26,706 --> 00:48:27,651
You want to be blind?

619
00:48:29,766 --> 00:48:30,927
I just want to understand.

620
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,467
You think you’d understand me by doing this?

621
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:39,769
Have a seat.

622
00:49:00,193 --> 00:49:00,956
So.

623
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:02,907
What have you understood so far?

624
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,500
Tell me.

625
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:09,465
Oh, I understand.

626
00:49:11,342 --> 00:49:14,294
I understand that I have never understood you at all.

627
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:16,665
That’s why I said those silly things to you.

628
00:49:18,645 --> 00:49:24,690
Even with my eyes covered, I could feel that the way people looked at me was damn scary.

629
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,096
No.

630
00:49:29,788 --> 00:49:31,393
The way they look isn't scary.

631
00:49:32,705 --> 00:49:36,820
But because we can't see it. We don't know what they think of us.

632
00:49:37,746 --> 00:49:38,794
That's what's scary.

633
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:49,034
Get out of the way, damn it!

634
00:50:04,855 --> 00:50:06,194
Coming through. Please make the way.

635
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:12,372
Not to mention I kicked utility poles four times.

636
00:50:14,126 --> 00:50:14,723
Damn.

637
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,945
And this is the market I visit every day.

638
00:50:26,144 --> 00:50:26,714
Hey.

639
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:32,163
I'm sorry for…

640
00:50:34,963 --> 00:50:36,408
being badmouthed.

641
00:50:43,913 --> 00:50:45,543
Get naked and let people watch.

642
00:50:46,498 --> 00:50:48,026
Then I will forgive you.

643
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:51,304
Are you serious?

644
00:50:51,912 --> 00:50:52,795
Would you do it?

645
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:56,792
Hey! I’m joking.

646
00:50:58,142 --> 00:50:59,375
Let's save their eyes.

647
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,747
Just take me home.

648
00:51:02,747 --> 00:51:03,697
That's all.

649
00:51:06,004 --> 00:51:06,900
Take you home, huh?

650
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:08,797
Hell, yeah.

651
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:10,622
You're my caretaker.

652
00:51:11,492 --> 00:51:12,831
Or should I be the one riding the bike?

653
00:52:04,895 --> 00:52:05,686
Hey.

654
00:52:06,763 --> 00:52:08,448
I need to make a stop and buy something.

655
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,549
Hurry up before it's dead.

656
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,765
It’s going in.

657
00:52:27,765 --> 00:52:28,516
Yeah.

658
00:52:28,883 --> 00:52:30,566
One, two, three.

659
00:52:33,257 --> 00:52:34,596
Here we go.

660
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:38,621
Wow!

661
00:52:38,621 --> 00:52:39,790
Look how happy it is.

662
00:52:40,086 --> 00:52:42,086
Happy to have a new friend, aren’t you?

663
00:52:44,933 --> 00:52:45,746
Oh, wait.

664
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:47,567
We have to give it a name.

665
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:49,157
What's the old one's name?

666
00:52:52,487 --> 00:52:53,517
Day…

667
00:52:54,892 --> 00:52:55,392
What?

668
00:52:56,854 --> 00:52:57,938
Little Day.

669
00:53:00,688 --> 00:53:02,133
Night named it.

670
00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:04,172
He bought it and just put it here.

671
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,407
I never wanted to have a fish.

672
00:53:07,232 --> 00:53:08,108
Ah.

673
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:09,337
Okay.

674
00:53:11,106 --> 00:53:13,106
The old one was named Little Day.

675
00:53:13,831 --> 00:53:16,624
What should we name the new one I bought?

676
00:53:23,307 --> 00:53:24,778
Let's just name it Big Mhok.

677
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,066
No.

678
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:29,421
It sounds more intimidating.

679
00:53:29,734 --> 00:53:32,025
But the fish’s mouth says ‘I like it.’

680
00:53:33,149 --> 00:53:34,541
Can you say ‘like?’

681
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:36,919
‘Like.’

682
00:53:37,233 --> 00:53:37,880
Like.

683
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,466
Yes.

684
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:39,949
See? You like the name too, right?

685
00:53:42,457 --> 00:53:46,810
Big Mhok and Little Day are having a big conversation.

686
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:45,922
Look.

687
00:54:46,345 --> 00:54:47,145
Come here.

688
00:54:47,673 --> 00:54:49,091
Quickly.

689
00:54:49,091 --> 00:54:50,035
Come. Come.

690
00:54:50,507 --> 00:54:51,668
Come here, Little Day.

691
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:52,983
Right here.

692
00:54:57,258 --> 00:54:59,390
No more loneliness, Little Day.

693
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,177
Come here.

694
00:55:31,404 --> 00:55:33,404
Come here.

695
00:55:34,138 --> 00:55:35,371
I'm right here.

696
00:56:00,136 --> 00:56:02,136
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

697
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:03,462
Ready?

698
00:56:03,462 --> 00:56:04,466
We're having a test.

699
00:56:04,466 --> 00:56:05,378
Phone charger.

700
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:06,686
Headphones.

701
00:56:10,811 --> 00:56:11,874
Wanna fight?

702
00:56:13,226 --> 00:56:17,106
I'm looking for a book called Last Twilight.

703
00:56:17,106 --> 00:56:18,774
Until the last light goes out.

704
00:56:19,331 --> 00:56:21,066
I know an old bookshop.

705
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,205
Wanna go?

706
00:56:22,786 --> 00:56:26,706
It's the first time I have ever been in a fitting room with someone else.

707
00:56:27,172 --> 00:56:28,590
And do you think I have before?

708
00:56:32,827 --> 00:56:33,690
Day!
