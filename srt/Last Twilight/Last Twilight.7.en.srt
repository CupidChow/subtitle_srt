5
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:23,206
I came to see Day.

6
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:28,658
There's a race coming up next month.

7
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,341
Do you want to join, young men?

8
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:31,562
We can't see.

9
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:32,707
How could you run?

10
00:00:32,707 --> 00:00:33,516
Let's go.

11
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:35,374
I can take you to run.

12
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:38,153
Three, two, one.

13
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:42,287
It's Day’s birthday.

14
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:44,732
I'd like to throw him a surprise party.

15
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:46,038
Can you help?

16
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:48,268
I've got a present for you.

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,502
It's your headband.

18
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:51,574
I’m giving it to you.

19
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:57,081
Hey.

20
00:00:57,081 --> 00:00:57,908
I’m sorry.

21
00:00:58,274 --> 00:00:59,279
What the hell did you just do?

22
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:01,549
I just wanted him to have a good memory.

23
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:03,078
But I really couldn't.

24
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:05,133
I really can't think of him as more than a friend.

25
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:06,136
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:08,829
Is there anyone else in this world

27
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:10,543
who doesn't feel pity for me?

28
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:16,861
Do you still think I feel pity for you?

29
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:32,482
If you’re done here, you can…go home.

30
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:38,897
Hold on.

31
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,176
Hangover pill.

32
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:08,605
I’m gonna go home and change.

33
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:09,946
See you later.

34
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:25,086
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

35
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,000
When did you get back?

36
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:32,196
What did you do?

37
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:33,797
You stayed up all night.

38
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,759
It’s a long story.

39
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:04,326
Hey.

40
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:10,120
There’s something important I want you to know.

41
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:13,731
What is it?

42
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:16,223
That’s a scary intro.

43
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:22,889
Well…

44
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,455
I like Day.

45
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:36,000
He has said it, finally.

46
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:38,248
Did you know?

47
00:05:39,664 --> 00:05:40,707
Yes–duh!

48
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:46,077
Don’t you realize all you’ve been doing lately is talking about him all day?

49
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:57,669
So

50
00:05:59,198 --> 00:06:00,157
are you okay with that?

51
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:09,070
Look.

52
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:12,000
As a friend,

53
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:15,597
I’m okay with whoever makes you happy.

54
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:21,650
Is there any other status to speak as?

55
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,883
Well.

56
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:28,089
As your ex, frankly speaking,

57
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:33,275
I might be a little envious.

58
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:35,552
Envious of what?

59
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:39,251
You dated a new guy before I knew it.

60
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:41,510
The envy isn’t for you. It’s for Day.

61
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,560
I’m envious of Day’s ability to make you smile.

62
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:56,569
Thanks for understanding.

63
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:02,249
Of course.

64
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:05,603
These days, you can like whomever you like.

65
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:08,341
But don’t let Day know that.

66
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:10,551
Why?

67
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:12,000
Why?

68
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,312
He’s your employer.

69
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:15,849
You’re his employee.

70
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:19,854
What will you do if he’s uncomfortable because he doesn’t share your feelings?

71
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:24,357
And you're the type who is so deeply and passionately in love when you're in love.

72
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:26,903
Don’t tell him, alright?

73
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:34,763
Holy shit! Did you tell him already?

74
00:07:34,763 --> 00:07:35,610
Not yet. Damn it.

75
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,418
Mhok, come on.

76
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:37,123
Not yet.

77
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:37,861
I’m not that crazy.

78
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:38,926
I didn’t say it.

79
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,255
Really, I haven’t said anything.

80
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:55,676
Hello.

81
00:07:56,384 --> 00:07:57,603
I’m home.

82
00:07:58,238 --> 00:08:00,238
Sorry, I didn’t let you know earlier.

83
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:01,907
It’s fine.

84
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,114
August kind of told me.

85
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:05,878
What did he tell you?

86
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:10,340
(He said he accidentally did something to upset you.)

87
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:13,818
(I don't know what this is all about.)

88
00:08:14,552 --> 00:08:17,288
But I think you two should patch things up quickly.

89
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,041
You guys are friends after all.

90
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:24,817
Right.

91
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:26,115
Friends.

92
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:32,869
Just give me time.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm afraid you don't have much time.

94
00:08:56,547 --> 00:09:00,473
August is moving to the States.

95
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:06,795
I guess he just wanted to be nice to me before he left.

96
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,033
Do you want to see him?

97
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,436
He's flying off tonight.

98
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:29,536
If I want to see him, I must go now.

99
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,664
Get up then.

100
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,738
What are you waiting for?

101
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:37,635
I'm not ready to talk nicely to him.

102
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:40,453
Who said anything about talking?

103
00:09:40,989 --> 00:09:42,762
I'm dragging you there to yell at him.

104
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,740
Do it right in his face.

105
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:45,864
It'll be more satisfying.

106
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:49,440
Okay?

107
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:51,933
Come on.

108
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,981
How are you feeling right now?

109
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:08,697
The fact that I will be training with a great coach abroad thrills me.

110
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:10,877
I hope you'll keep an eye out for my performance.

111
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,498
He's acting like a cool ass and giving his interview to the press.

112
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,114
- How long ago did you decide to play singles?
- You want me to make a scene now?

113
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:20,952
- You've been watching too many dramas.
- I’d thought about it for a while.

114
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:21,666
Just let him be.

115
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:25,025
But I really decided just last night.

116
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:28,483
Don't you feel bad for your friend who's played doubles with you?

117
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,000
I did, at first.

118
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:39,487
But actually, he's a lot stronger than I thought.

119
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:43,931
It's me who's so weak that I let him down.

120
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:47,721
He’s moved on now.

121
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,372
I need to move on as well.

122
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,729
Would you like to give a message to that friend of yours?

123
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,484
Um…

124
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:00,331
I still think I play doubles these days.

125
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:03,423
Though he's not on the court,

126
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:05,189
he’s still in my play.

127
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:08,999
Any victory I'm conquering from now on

128
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:11,167
will not only be mine.

129
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,487
It's ours.

130
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:38,721
What a handsome way to end an interview.

131
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:39,578
Of course.

132
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:42,075
Damn you.

133
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,409
You don't give your friends enough time to say goodbye.

134
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:46,385
Trust me.

135
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:48,317
I'm already late going now.

136
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:52,750
Hey.

137
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,988
I told him.

138
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:59,693
But I guess he really doesn't want to see you.

139
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:03,557
Mhm.

140
00:12:07,364 --> 00:12:08,716
Even though I'm here,

141
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,031
I can't see you.

142
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:12,608
I'm blind.

143
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:13,962
Day!

144
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:16,245
You told me you wouldn't come.

145
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,339
Well, here I am.

146
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:21,065
Thank you so much for seeing me off.

147
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:26,233
Actually, I came to yell at you.

148
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:29,637
But after hearing those cheesy things you said,

149
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:32,084
I just can't force myself to do it.

150
00:12:34,177 --> 00:12:35,201
Have a seat.

151
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:42,379
Now.

152
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:45,546
Whatever it is, just talk it out right here.

153
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:46,496
I'm staying too.

154
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:48,904
Day.

155
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:52,951
I'm sorry about that.

156
00:12:58,659 --> 00:12:59,403
Mhm.

157
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:05,785
Here.

158
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:07,389
Take it.

159
00:13:08,465 --> 00:13:09,678
It's your punishment.

160
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,091
I gave it to you. Don't you want to keep it?

161
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,483
Hey,

162
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:19,675
I'm not returning it.

163
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:23,081
I want you to wear it while competing.

164
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:25,673
It'll be as if we're still playing together.

165
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:29,928
Thanks.

166
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:31,295
Mhm.

167
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,397
As for our run,

168
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:37,331
I guess someone here might have to take on the job.

169
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,527
(Me?)

170
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,567
Please take care of that.

171
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,195
Here, let me put it on for you

172
00:13:58,267 --> 00:13:59,729
I'll help.

173
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:03,665
Do it nicely.

174
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,870
Are you afraid we’ll mess your hair?

175
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:07,939
Well, I set it nicely.

176
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:11,022
You're all about looking good.

177
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:12,144
But I do look good, don't I?

178
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:13,915
A bit less than me.

179
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:14,984
Let me.

180
00:14:16,183 --> 00:14:18,365
Relax, Day.

181
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:20,619
Do I look good?

182
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:21,766
Just the same.

183
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,653
You can't lose when you have it on.

184
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah.

185
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:33,442
We can go grab something good to eat after the victory.

186
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,194
You're paying.

187
00:14:36,978 --> 00:14:37,849
No way.

188
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,640
You should be the one who pays.

189
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:44,120
Let's snap some photos.

190
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:47,024
Let him hold it.

191
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:47,950
Of course.

192
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,466
Are you nuts? I can't see.

193
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:51,563
- Try it.
- Gee. August.

194
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:53,606
Give it a try.

195
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,818
Right here?

196
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:56,352
Hold it further so my face doesn’t seem so big.

197
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,207
I can’t possibly see that.

198
00:14:59,575 --> 00:15:00,561
Get closer.

199
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,905
One, two.

200
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:24,683
Thanks for coming today.

201
00:15:25,587 --> 00:15:27,474
It means a lot to August.

202
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,153
You should thank me.

203
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:33,433
I dragged him here.

204
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:35,665
Thank you.

205
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:39,559
Phi.

206
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,097
I want a coffee.

207
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,654
Can you go get it for me?

208
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,564
Sure.

209
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:48,480
What coffee would you like?

210
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:50,563
Anything.

211
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:52,400
Just buy it.

212
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:53,879
Okay.

213
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:55,367
Wait here.

214
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:57,502
Gee, please take care of him.

215
00:15:58,153 --> 00:15:58,780
Sure.

216
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:05,254
Day.

217
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:07,443
You don't usually drink coffee.

218
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,173
He's gone.

219
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:10,180
Now what is it?

220
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,397
Phi Mhok likes me.

221
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:18,171
What?

222
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:19,557
Yeah.

223
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,547
Are you, like, delulu or something?

224
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:24,990
He kissed me.

225
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:26,680
Sounds delulu?

226
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,517
He kissed you?

227
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:32,875
Mhm.

228
00:16:34,897 --> 00:16:37,124
That's so fast.

229
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:38,594
Gee.

230
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,309
So

231
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:43,742
what are you going to do about it?

232
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:48,486
That's what I'm asking you. What should I do?

233
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:51,011
You're asking me?

234
00:16:51,874 --> 00:16:53,841
How the heck should I know?

235
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:57,440
Ask yourself what you think of him.

236
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't think anything.

237
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:03,755
You know I like a warm and nice man.

238
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,400
Not a bad guy like that.

239
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:08,968
Probably bad on the outside?

240
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:12,000
He takes care of you so well.

241
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:16,827
Maybe, on the inside, he’s warm like a microwave.

242
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:21,021
Come on, Gee. Stop pushing.

243
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,760
No means no.

244
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:30,702
Then…

245
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:33,880
tell him honestly.

246
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:38,558
And find yourself a new caretaker.

247
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:39,718
The end.

248
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,934
What?

249
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:44,176
Do I really need to do that?

250
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,041
Yeah.

251
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,359
Better than leaving things awkward, right?

252
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:51,008
I think this is the way.

253
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:53,001
Trust me.

254
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:06,000
I just wanted you to know how I feel about you.

255
00:18:06,994 --> 00:18:08,027
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:10,551
But you're not my type.

257
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,136
- About last night…
- About last night…

258
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:00,200
I’ve thought about it.

259
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:09,704
I've thought about it too.

260
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:16,658
I'm sorry.

261
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:19,148
But you're not my type.

262
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,023
I figured.

263
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:56,858
I just wanted you to know how I feel about you.

264
00:20:03,195 --> 00:20:09,954
Did you think we could be the same if I knew it?

265
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:31,947
Okay.

266
00:20:33,962 --> 00:20:35,180
I'll quit.

267
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:38,275
Don't worry about it, Day.

268
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:39,794
Hey.

269
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:42,589
Though I don't have feelings for you,

270
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:45,879
I still want to have you…here.

271
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,229
What do you mean?

272
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:56,578
I mean as my caretaker.

273
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:01,502
If you can just act the same, I won't have a problem with that.

274
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,783
I guess.

275
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:13,166
So…

276
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:18,091
if I can do that, I'll get to continue taking care of you.

277
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,061
Right?

278
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:23,073
Right, but…

279
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:26,293
if you cross the line and hit on me,

280
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,139
you're fired.

281
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:34,540
I get it now, sir.

282
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,365
I'm serious.

283
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:39,543
Yeah, I know.

284
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:44,858
Well then…

285
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:47,301
What are you doing?

286
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,311
Buckle you up.

287
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:04,630
Like I always do.

288
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:07,151
I can do it, right?

289
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:10,346
You can.

290
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:24,972
Should we go home?

291
00:22:25,504 --> 00:22:26,214
Sure.

292
00:22:27,194 --> 00:22:28,034
What are we waiting for?

293
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,540
August ditched me.

294
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,090
Gee, another friend of mine, will take his place.

295
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:48,896
Yeah?

296
00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:49,693
Yeah.

297
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,566
Gee can handle it, right?

298
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:53,692
But August told me to take his place.

299
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:58,418
I remember him looking into my eyes when he said it.

300
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:05,214
If you don't stop, I'll think you're trying to hit on me.

301
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:12,667
Phi,

302
00:23:12,863 --> 00:23:13,958
can you grab me the phone?

303
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,087
Gee is calling.

304
00:23:23,238 --> 00:23:23,983
I hit the answer button.

305
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:28,048
Hello, where are you?

306
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:29,059
I've arrived.

307
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:32,047
Oh.

308
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,729
That's okay.

309
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:38,858
Yeah, don't worry about it.

310
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:40,359
Okay. Bye.

311
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:48,410
Gee has to take a make-up test.

312
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:50,858
She can't make it to practice.

313
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:55,938
I guess I won't get to run with you, master.

314
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,374
Oh, no.

315
00:23:58,626 --> 00:23:59,822
That’s a shame, Day.

316
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,858
No. You have to join no matter what.

317
00:24:03,294 --> 00:24:04,178
Please.

318
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:06,470
Maybe next race, master.

319
00:24:06,672 --> 00:24:08,448
No. It has to be this one.

320
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,358
Please, Day.

321
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:10,335
I'm begging you with the hand gesture.

322
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:12,004
Master, don't do that.

323
00:24:12,303 --> 00:24:13,240
- Please.
- Hey, it’s okay.

324
00:24:13,538 --> 00:24:15,553
Day. Day. Day.

325
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:25,154
If you want us to be the same, then why can't we run together?

326
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:31,927
Unless you don't think the same about me anymore.

327
00:24:36,322 --> 00:24:37,167
Fine.

328
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:38,994
Okay, fine.

329
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:40,545
I'll run with you.

330
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:42,880
Problem solved.

331
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:53,697
Use this instead.

332
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:58,229
It's your headband.

333
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,371
Wasn't it ripped already?

334
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,754
It could be ripped but it could be fixed too.

335
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,027
Okay, I'm ready. Let's go running.

336
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,815
Lead me the way, baby.

337
00:25:20,858 --> 00:25:21,722
This way.

338
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:23,271
Which way?

339
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,226
Come this way.

340
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,592
Day, you alright?

341
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:40,231
Are you okay?

342
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:42,467
I am. Let's go on.

343
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:43,630
- You sure?
- Yes.

344
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:47,741
Day, turn left.

345
00:25:47,741 --> 00:25:49,540
Five, four, three…

346
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:51,705
You okay there?

347
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:53,644
Should we go on?

348
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:54,311
Come on.

349
00:25:54,887 --> 00:26:03,493
One, two.

350
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:05,617
Are you hurt?

351
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:07,450
I'm okay.

352
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:08,550
Sorry.

353
00:26:09,922 --> 00:26:10,791
You sure you got this?

354
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,922
I'm sure.

355
00:26:11,922 --> 00:26:13,538
We can still tell Aon we want out.

356
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,690
Will you relax?

357
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,552
We just started practicing.

358
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,926
We can just sync immediately.

359
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:20,646
Right?

360
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:27,851
But with August, it took no time for us to sync.

361
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:33,069
Why?

362
00:26:33,685 --> 00:26:35,377
He's not much better than me.

363
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:36,665
There.

364
00:26:37,488 --> 00:26:39,684
Don't tell me you're jealous.

365
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:41,501
No.

366
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:43,674
I'm just stating a fact.

367
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:47,531
Why do you sound frustrated?

368
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,479
That's suspicious.

369
00:26:54,175 --> 00:26:57,519
I'm just irritated that we can't seem to sync.

370
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,939
Tell you what.

371
00:27:07,555 --> 00:27:08,846
It's the shoes.

372
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:10,122
They're the cause of our bad rhythm.

373
00:27:10,486 --> 00:27:11,175
Hey.

374
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,940
What are you doing?

375
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,925
This is what happens when you don't ask me to help choose.

376
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:17,274
Wait here.

377
00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:19,155
Hey.

378
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:20,050
Where are you going?

379
00:27:20,386 --> 00:27:21,137
Phi Mhok.

380
00:27:21,921 --> 00:27:22,778
Phi Mhok.

381
00:27:22,778 --> 00:27:24,060
Just a sec.

382
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:27,578
Here I am.

383
00:27:31,077 --> 00:27:31,857
What is it?

384
00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:40,789
Alright.

385
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:46,633
Stand up.

386
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:54,380
This pair will do.

387
00:27:55,863 --> 00:27:57,219
You literally went to get these.

388
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:05,491
There’s no way the new pair knows you better than the old pair.

389
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:06,978
Right?

390
00:28:07,515 --> 00:28:10,495
Are you still talking about the shoes?

391
00:28:11,177 --> 00:28:12,066
Of course, I am.

392
00:28:12,486 --> 00:28:13,597
Do you think I'm hitting on you?

393
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:19,126
Let's resume running.

394
00:28:20,358 --> 00:28:21,456
Give them a jump.

395
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:24,717
Yes.

396
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:26,491
That's right.

397
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:27,928
Come on. Let's go.

398
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,652
Yes.

399
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:43,309
My legs feel like they're being ripped apart.

400
00:28:44,997 --> 00:28:45,929
Ripped apart?

401
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,496
Are you okay?

402
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:51,430
Should I…give you a massage?

403
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:53,585
Don't even think about it.

404
00:28:54,874 --> 00:28:56,100
I can do it myself.

405
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,434
You can go home.

406
00:28:58,043 --> 00:28:58,876
Are you sure?

407
00:28:59,212 --> 00:29:00,043
Mhm.

408
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,033
Okay.

409
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:02,858
I'm taking off then.

410
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:04,055
See you tomorrow.

411
00:29:04,055 --> 00:29:05,083
See you.

412
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,005
Ouch, Phi!

413
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:09,868
Cramp!

414
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:13,494
Ow!

415
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:15,378
Cramp.

416
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:21,355
Well, well.

417
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,360
If Phi Mhok here gives you a massage,

418
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,670
will that be considered as crossing the line?

419
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,706
Seriously?

420
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:28,858
Help me already.

421
00:29:29,892 --> 00:29:31,160
Sorry.

422
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,892
Come here.

423
00:29:38,387 --> 00:29:39,527
Easy.

424
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,751
Go easy.

425
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,177
It's tense.

426
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:51,738
Are you feeling okay now?

427
00:29:52,382 --> 00:29:53,222
I am.

428
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:55,106
I'm putting it down.

429
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,402
Thank you.

430
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:04,956
Sure.

431
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:06,885
I'll be leaving then.

432
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,267
Don't wanna get chased away again.

433
00:30:11,552 --> 00:30:12,365
Bye.

434
00:30:13,317 --> 00:30:14,504
Wait up.

435
00:30:15,288 --> 00:30:16,021
Hmm?

436
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:20,858
Can you read me Last Twilight?

437
00:30:24,977 --> 00:30:26,165
Let's see.

438
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:29,905
I'm tired today.

439
00:30:30,943 --> 00:30:32,467
And we already went beyond my working hours.

440
00:30:34,384 --> 00:30:40,555
But if my employer is kind enough to beg with his nice words,

441
00:30:41,337 --> 00:30:44,858
I might do it.

442
00:30:49,654 --> 00:30:50,558
Phi Mhok.

443
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:51,945
Yes?

444
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,780
Could you read me Last Twilight…

445
00:30:56,096 --> 00:30:56,858
please?

446
00:31:00,273 --> 00:31:01,091
Then yes,

447
00:31:02,015 --> 00:31:02,780
sir.

448
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:23,829
After discovering that she was only seen in direct sunlight,

449
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:27,498
Mee began pursuing the sun.

450
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:41,182
(Her path was difficult, but her heart was full of hope.)

451
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:45,328
Phi Mhok.

452
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:46,114
Hmm?

453
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,510
Can you give me a massage?

454
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,078
My legs are sore.

455
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,317
Sure.

456
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:02,239
It's going to be a little cool, Nong Day.

457
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:15,439
It tickles.

458
00:32:16,326 --> 00:32:18,130
I haven't done anything yet.

459
00:32:18,972 --> 00:32:20,858
Phi, it’s ticklish.

460
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:22,424
Hey, Phi Mhok.

461
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:24,604
Stop.

462
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,136
Stop it.

463
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Okay. I'm stopping.

464
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:37,995
(Mee held her shadow's hand and ran along together under the bright sunlight.)

465
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:39,507
Oops.

466
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,531
- I'm okay.
- Are you alright?

467
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:42,348
Yes, I am.

468
00:32:42,348 --> 00:32:43,600
Just a bit further.

469
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:44,395
Come on.

470
00:32:50,754 --> 00:32:54,406
(Mee hoped that if she didn't stop pursuing the sun,

471
00:32:54,894 --> 00:33:00,169
one day, the wicked curse would go away for good.)

472
00:33:15,852 --> 00:33:16,778
The time.

473
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:18,188
How long did we take?

474
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,683
Time.

475
00:33:21,106 --> 00:33:24,813
We did it.

476
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:25,988
It’s 42.

477
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:45,630
How was it, Day?

478
00:33:49,997 --> 00:33:50,858
Day.

479
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:54,339
Day.

480
00:33:55,963 --> 00:33:57,175
I know you're faking it.

481
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,759
If you really sleep, I must hear you snoring.

482
00:34:00,983 --> 00:34:01,737
Right?

483
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:04,774
I know it.

484
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:19,648
Day.

485
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:22,833
Day.

486
00:34:25,551 --> 00:34:26,711
He's really sleeping.

487
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:32,551
I'm taking off then.

488
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:42,007
Wait.

489
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,469
So that means whatever I say after this,

490
00:34:49,027 --> 00:34:50,272
you won't hear it.

491
00:34:55,982 --> 00:34:57,045
Then…

492
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:03,559
Sweet dreams,

493
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,226
Nong Day.

494
00:36:30,028 --> 00:36:32,231
Speed it up. You're almost there.

495
00:36:32,478 --> 00:36:32,978
Come on.

496
00:36:32,978 --> 00:36:35,126
Five, four, three, two, one.

497
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,962
- We're here.
- Yeah.

498
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,019
It's 1 hour and 53 minutes.

499
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,287
Day, drink some water.

500
00:36:43,761 --> 00:36:45,177
- Here it is.
- Wow,

501
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:46,943
that was pretty impressive.

502
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:49,072
Just don't pressure yourself too hard tomorrow.

503
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,638
Oh, where are you guys staying tonight?

504
00:36:51,638 --> 00:36:52,798
We can go together.

505
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:54,577
My house.

506
00:36:55,335 --> 00:36:56,523
Your house?

507
00:36:56,523 --> 00:36:57,335
Mhm.

508
00:36:57,787 --> 00:36:59,787
But it's so far away from where it's held.

509
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:01,746
Can you make it in time?

510
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:06,122
I forgot to say the event starts at 5:00 a.m.

511
00:37:07,112 --> 00:37:09,391
Runners usually sleep near there.

512
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:12,185
I guess all accommodations are full by now.

513
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:16,077
Master Aon.

514
00:37:16,077 --> 00:37:17,191
I know a place.

515
00:37:17,313 --> 00:37:18,494
From there, you can just walk to the event.

516
00:37:18,494 --> 00:37:19,313
And it's not full.

517
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,478
Where is it?

518
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:51,028
Welcome to Phi Mhok’s residence, Nong Day.

519
00:37:54,965 --> 00:37:58,286
Even though I can't see, I know you're grinning.

520
00:38:00,037 --> 00:38:01,758
It's not often that I get to welcome a guest.

521
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:03,158
Am I allowed to be happy?

522
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,455
Hey.

523
00:38:07,455 --> 00:38:08,438
What are you bragging about?

524
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:10,394
Why don't you come inside?

525
00:38:10,394 --> 00:38:11,654
I'm freaking starving.

526
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:13,918
Fine. I'll fix something for us all.

527
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:15,438
Day, let's get inside.

528
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:16,926
Come on, Day.

529
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:18,020
Let's eat

530
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:21,030
Be careful. It’s the stairs.

531
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,698
- It’s my job.
- What?

532
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:23,330
The stairs.

533
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,531
Quickly, Mhok.

534
00:38:27,451 --> 00:38:30,416
We have stir-fried pumpkin and egg,

535
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:33,412
fried salted chicken, sardine salad,

536
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:34,549
and clear soap with egg tofu and minced pork.

537
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:36,638
Please enjoy.

538
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,141
It's simple.

539
00:38:39,471 --> 00:38:40,638
Are you okay with this, Day?

540
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:42,261
I am.

541
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,699
He's just not used to it yet.

542
00:38:46,712 --> 00:38:51,151
My spoons are a lot lighter than those at your house.

543
00:38:51,888 --> 00:38:54,930
The plates are quite small.

544
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:57,870
Because I'm just flat broke.

545
00:39:03,516 --> 00:39:07,320
The salad is at noon. The chicken is at 3:00 p.m.

546
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,763
I've been wanting to tell you.

547
00:39:12,293 --> 00:39:14,242
Your cooking skills are a lot better now.

548
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,635
Are you there to take care of Day or practice to be a chef?

549
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,359
Let's just say I'm interning with the chef's son.

550
00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:26,371
He even commented on the way I heated rice.

551
00:39:28,762 --> 00:39:30,762
I just used my mom’s teaching method.

552
00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:34,038
Actually, her cooking course costs a hundred thousand baht, you know?

553
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:35,839
Wow.

554
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,516
Your mom is competent.

555
00:39:39,022 --> 00:39:44,238
I bet you like someone with good cooking skills.

556
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,099
I'm not that serious about it.

557
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:53,783
What about someone quite bad?

558
00:39:58,056 --> 00:40:00,056
Uh…

559
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:09,398
Day told me he likes someone warm and nice.

560
00:40:10,126 --> 00:40:11,516
Like a walking microwave.

561
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:13,358
Then you're the first to get crossed out, Mhok.

562
00:40:13,572 --> 00:40:14,759
Yeah, I think so too.

563
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:16,656
The egg tofu is at the center of the plate.

564
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:18,598
Eat up.

565
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,019
Thank you.

566
00:40:22,925 --> 00:40:24,117
But maybe…

567
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:26,909
If I feel comfortable around him,

568
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:29,183
he doesn't have to be so warm.

569
00:40:29,341 --> 00:40:30,579
I'm okay with that.

570
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,918
Why are you smiling, Mhok?

571
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:49,149
I'm not.

572
00:40:49,352 --> 00:40:50,417
You are.

573
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:51,916
The food is just so good.

574
00:40:52,454 --> 00:40:53,144
Right.

575
00:40:53,144 --> 00:40:54,454
I thought you were glad.

576
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:57,215
Here.

577
00:40:57,464 --> 00:40:58,676
You're the guest.

578
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,476
Just leave the clean-up duty to the host.

579
00:41:01,848 --> 00:41:04,610
Day, here's your spoon and fork.

580
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,869
Raw mango is in front of you.

581
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:07,987
Thank you.

582
00:41:14,897 --> 00:41:16,414
Am I smelling jasmine?

583
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:17,798
Yes.

584
00:41:18,146 --> 00:41:20,451
Mhok just planted them not so long ago.

585
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:29,998
Phi Mhok said you’re carrying a baby.

586
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:31,638
I am.

587
00:41:31,638 --> 00:41:32,730
How many months are you?

588
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:35,038
Five months.

589
00:41:35,228 --> 00:41:36,001
Whoa.

590
00:41:36,001 --> 00:41:38,078
Do you want to feel it?

591
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:46,347
The baby seems to like you, Day.

592
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:47,558
Can you feel it?

593
00:41:56,857 --> 00:41:58,090
You must be tired.

594
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,914
My mom is a single mom too.

595
00:42:04,424 --> 00:42:05,219
Wow.

596
00:42:06,638 --> 00:42:10,384
I can't imagine how good your mother is.

597
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,060
She raised you so well.

598
00:42:15,596 --> 00:42:17,113
Not easy for her.

599
00:42:18,123 --> 00:42:18,805
I'm stubborn.

600
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,695
But I believe you can do it.

601
00:42:31,256 --> 00:42:31,967
Mhm.

602
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:34,198
Thank you.

603
00:42:35,717 --> 00:42:37,819
Have you got the name?

604
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,999
I've come up with a few.

605
00:42:42,781 --> 00:42:46,638
But the one I like is Mee.

606
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,838
Like the character in Last Twilight.

607
00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:52,509
You know that book too?

608
00:42:52,509 --> 00:42:53,645
Of course.

609
00:42:54,024 --> 00:42:57,523
Mhok brings the book home to read all the time.

610
00:42:58,514 --> 00:43:00,514
He practices reading before reading it to you.

611
00:43:02,561 --> 00:43:03,850
Whoa.

612
00:43:04,734 --> 00:43:06,480
I didn't know that.

613
00:43:07,382 --> 00:43:09,306
You know, when he was in college,

614
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:12,521
looking at a book cover already put him to sleep.

615
00:43:14,412 --> 00:43:18,953
There's only one person in this whole world who could make him read.

616
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:22,442
You?

617
00:43:22,442 --> 00:43:23,334
No.

618
00:43:24,055 --> 00:43:25,032
It's Rung.

619
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,436
His big sister.

620
00:43:27,116 --> 00:43:28,354
Has he told you about her?

621
00:43:30,473 --> 00:43:32,752
I just know that she passed.

622
00:43:33,968 --> 00:43:36,222
Phi Mhok doesn't like to talk about her that much.

623
00:43:38,855 --> 00:43:40,000
How I miss her.

624
00:43:41,296 --> 00:43:42,430
I miss you, Rung.

625
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:47,799
Phi Porjai.

626
00:43:49,146 --> 00:43:50,850
Can you tell me about her?

627
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:55,982
Rung?

628
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:08,337
Day.

629
00:44:09,023 --> 00:44:09,665
Hey.

630
00:44:11,223 --> 00:44:11,999
Where's Porjai?

631
00:44:13,574 --> 00:44:17,720
It's cold outside so I told her to get inside the house.

632
00:44:21,986 --> 00:44:23,037
What did you two talk about?

633
00:44:25,425 --> 00:44:27,695
Did she gossip about me?

634
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:35,830
I get you now why you don't tell me about your sister.

635
00:44:44,868 --> 00:44:45,850
Did Porjai tell you?

636
00:44:46,638 --> 00:44:47,275
Mhm.

637
00:44:48,108 --> 00:44:49,803
I asked her to.

638
00:44:56,988 --> 00:44:58,988
Actually, I don't want to keep it a secret or anything.

639
00:45:00,606 --> 00:45:01,513
It's just, I don't know…

640
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:05,668
Though I disagree what the choice she made,

641
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,314
I don't want anyone to have bad opinions towards her.

642
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:16,085
I think she must have been a very nice lady.

643
00:45:18,854 --> 00:45:20,016
Why would you think that?

644
00:45:20,646 --> 00:45:21,638
Well.

645
00:45:22,031 --> 00:45:23,650
Since the first step inside this house.

646
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:28,106
I’ve felt the warmth in every corner.

647
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:33,189
I can really feel it.

648
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:48,796
You know what?

649
00:45:50,092 --> 00:45:53,071
Rung was the one who picked this house.

650
00:45:55,242 --> 00:45:56,220
I believe that.

651
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:02,375
This very front porch, we helped each other paint.

652
00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:37,052
I feel like I'm causing you trouble.

653
00:46:39,055 --> 00:46:40,547
Why? Are you worried about me?

654
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,433
No.

655
00:46:43,246 --> 00:46:46,148
I'm just afraid you'll have no energy left to run tomorrow.

656
00:46:56,373 --> 00:46:57,865
You take the thin blanket.

657
00:46:58,094 --> 00:46:59,000
So it won't be too hot.

658
00:47:08,897 --> 00:47:11,329
This blanket surely belongs to you.

659
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:13,545
How do you know?

660
00:47:14,434 --> 00:47:16,381
The scent is obvious.

661
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,467
You recognize my scent.

662
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:21,638
Are you thinking something about me?

663
00:47:23,704 --> 00:47:24,489
I am.

664
00:47:26,293 --> 00:47:29,236
I'm thinking whether I should fire you tonight or not.

665
00:47:31,888 --> 00:47:32,728
I'm going to sleep.

666
00:47:37,911 --> 00:47:39,071
This is all unfamiliar.

667
00:47:40,236 --> 00:47:41,638
I don't know if I'm able to sleep.

668
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,467
Wait here.

669
00:47:59,301 --> 00:48:00,084
Jasmine?

670
00:48:02,853 --> 00:48:04,070
It might help you relax.

671
00:48:08,192 --> 00:48:10,395
A picture of a jasmine garden in front of the house just popped into my head.

672
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:24,868
It smells nice.

673
00:48:25,706 --> 00:48:26,392
Yeah?

674
00:48:28,894 --> 00:48:29,903
You want to smell it?

675
00:48:32,694 --> 00:48:33,347
Here.

676
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,038
Go to sleep.

677
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,087
Mhm.

678
00:49:49,256 --> 00:49:49,922
Phi.

679
00:49:52,691 --> 00:49:55,854
Your house has thin walls.

680
00:50:04,538 --> 00:50:05,598
It's the woman next door.

681
00:50:07,244 --> 00:50:08,914
Her boyfriend comes to visit once in a while.

682
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,983
Every time they meet, they just give it all they have.

683
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,609
What are you doing?

684
00:50:27,756 --> 00:50:30,340
You're a kid. Don't eavesdrop on adult business.

685
00:50:33,237 --> 00:50:34,780
You shouldn't either.

686
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:37,024
I can listen. I'm an adult.

687
00:50:37,274 --> 00:50:38,588
No, you're not.

688
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:40,288
You can’t listen to them.

689
00:50:41,101 --> 00:50:41,917
Day.

690
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:49,416
We will reach the finish line in 50 meters.

691
00:50:50,709 --> 00:50:51,839
Once we get there,

692
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:54,183
I'll ask you to be my boyfriend.

693
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:24,512
Thank you.

694
00:51:25,307 --> 00:51:26,098
Come on.

695
00:51:26,098 --> 00:51:26,722
Okay.

696
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,130
You ready?

697
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,048
I so am.

698
00:51:34,672 --> 00:51:35,929
Hello, Day, Mhok.

699
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:37,589
- Good morning.
- Morning.

700
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:38,574
Master.

701
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:40,841
Hello, Master Aon.

702
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,630
What did you do last night?

703
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,553
You sound like you didn't get any sleep.

704
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:45,747
Please.

705
00:51:45,747 --> 00:51:46,968
How could I sleep?

706
00:51:47,222 --> 00:51:50,445
Phi Mhok’s neighbors were doing the bam bam in the ham all night.

707
00:51:50,445 --> 00:51:51,775
I couldn’t sleep.

708
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:53,944
Bam bam in the ham?

709
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:56,038
Yes, It’s what you think it is.

710
00:51:56,038 --> 00:51:57,143
You mean literally ham?

711
00:51:57,143 --> 00:51:58,113
It’s that thing, master.

712
00:51:58,113 --> 00:51:59,701
It’s bam, bam, bam?

713
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:00,714
- Yes.
- Yes.

714
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:04,834
Have you two registered yet?

715
00:52:04,834 --> 00:52:05,709
No, we just got here.

716
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:06,755
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

717
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,054
You are Mhok's friend, aren't you?

718
00:52:12,054 --> 00:52:12,879
Mhm.

719
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:16,286
I just want to capture some photos.

720
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,319
In case Day wants to see them one day.

721
00:52:22,033 --> 00:52:24,033
Why don't you go up close?

722
00:52:24,033 --> 00:52:25,915
You look like a psycho sneakily taking people's photos. Come on.

723
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:27,555
Hey. No.

724
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:31,055
I'm only gonna distract him.

725
00:52:44,524 --> 00:52:46,987
Stop it. It's not what you think.

726
00:52:48,238 --> 00:52:49,932
This is my ex’s.

727
00:52:50,576 --> 00:52:52,056
But I dumped him.

728
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:54,701
I'm single now.

729
00:52:59,622 --> 00:53:02,069
What? I'm just saying.

730
00:53:07,025 --> 00:53:07,827
Thank you.

731
00:53:11,739 --> 00:53:12,448
Day.

732
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:16,987
You got the number 075.

733
00:53:17,363 --> 00:53:19,760
- Let me put it on for you.
- Phi, I'm nervous.

734
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,047
Is anyone here looking at me?

735
00:53:27,193 --> 00:53:29,865
On your right, there's a kid running with his family.

736
00:53:30,663 --> 00:53:34,987
On your left, an uncle and an auntie are warming up.

737
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:43,388
At the back, a couple of people are preparing to run together.

738
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:44,361
Just like us.

739
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,787
They're all focusing on themselves.

740
00:53:48,401 --> 00:53:50,248
The only one who's looking at you

741
00:53:50,706 --> 00:53:51,769
is me.

742
00:53:54,956 --> 00:53:58,301
What a long answer to such a simple question.

743
00:54:03,564 --> 00:54:06,145
I'll go get you a banana. Fill your energy.

744
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:07,827
Wait here.

745
00:54:08,652 --> 00:54:10,730
Can you grab me a bottle of water too?

746
00:54:10,987 --> 00:54:11,980
Okay.

747
00:54:15,855 --> 00:54:16,807
Oh,

748
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,995
this guy is Mhok.

749
00:54:18,995 --> 00:54:20,703
- Hello.
- Hi.

750
00:54:21,002 --> 00:54:23,766
How have you been? I never took you for a healthy guy who runs.

751
00:54:24,009 --> 00:54:25,856
No. It’s my first join.

752
00:54:26,042 --> 00:54:27,889
There. I just took him out to run.

753
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,486
That's good.

754
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:32,260
Time flies so fast.

755
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:33,831
You’ll get your car back next month.

756
00:54:33,831 --> 00:54:35,191
Fast, isn't it?

757
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,671
Have you thought about what you’d do once you’ve paid off the car?

758
00:54:44,445 --> 00:54:46,262
I haven't.

759
00:54:46,262 --> 00:54:47,150
Here's the thing.

760
00:54:47,274 --> 00:54:49,885
My friend is looking for a lead mechanic at his garage.

761
00:54:49,885 --> 00:54:51,053
In case you're interested.

762
00:54:51,053 --> 00:54:53,964
Once you're tired of the caretaker job, you can contact him.

763
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:56,259
Of course.

764
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,249
Thank you so much.

765
00:54:57,249 --> 00:54:58,899
- See you.
- See you.

766
00:54:59,806 --> 00:55:01,164
Excuse me. Where can I get water?

767
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:02,138
That way, please.

768
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:20,275
Runners, listen up.

769
00:55:20,566 --> 00:55:22,244
Please wait for the signal.

770
00:55:22,244 --> 00:55:22,749
Ready?

771
00:55:26,278 --> 00:55:28,003
Day, what's wrong?

772
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:33,318
You take pictures.

773
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:34,632
I'll record their videos.

774
00:55:35,256 --> 00:55:36,448
Just give me your chat ID.

775
00:55:41,674 --> 00:55:42,727
Are you flirting with me?

776
00:55:45,043 --> 00:55:45,820
I'm kidding.

777
00:55:46,827 --> 00:55:48,430
Look. They're starting.

778
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:50,309
Prepare for the signal.

779
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:51,499
Ready?

780
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:55,030
They’re coming.

781
00:55:56,178 --> 00:55:58,178
Whoo-hoo!

782
00:55:58,178 --> 00:56:01,411
Mhok. Mhok.

783
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:02,941
Day, do your best.

784
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:03,631
Day!

785
00:56:39,174 --> 00:56:40,023
Day.

786
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:41,357
You want some water?

787
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:42,662
There is a water station out front.

788
00:56:52,544 --> 00:56:53,408
Day, are you okay?

789
00:56:56,373 --> 00:56:57,509
I'm okay.

790
00:56:57,509 --> 00:56:58,316
Hey.

791
00:56:58,652 --> 00:56:59,573
Are you mad at me?

792
00:57:00,652 --> 00:57:01,486
No.

793
00:57:02,567 --> 00:57:04,720
I'm just trying to take care of myself.

794
00:57:05,709 --> 00:57:07,006
Because you're leaving me soon.

795
00:57:09,534 --> 00:57:10,987
Why would you think that?

796
00:57:14,714 --> 00:57:18,670
Because you're doing all this for that car, right?

797
00:57:23,137 --> 00:57:24,342
It's true.

798
00:57:25,912 --> 00:57:27,545
But it's not like that.

799
00:57:28,433 --> 00:57:29,432
Forget it.

800
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:31,166
It's your right.

801
00:57:32,374 --> 00:57:34,129
I shouldn't cross the line.

802
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,966
Day, will you just listen?

803
00:57:40,988 --> 00:57:43,691
Mhok and Day are in front of us.

804
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:44,418
Yeah?

805
00:57:44,968 --> 00:57:46,248
Hey, guys.

806
00:57:46,248 --> 00:57:47,335
Why are you guys stopping?

807
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:49,336
What's wrong?

808
00:57:49,972 --> 00:57:50,752
Are you guys okay?

809
00:57:50,752 --> 00:57:51,636
We are.

810
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,265
You guys go ahead.

811
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:54,280
We'll catch up later.

812
00:57:54,821 --> 00:57:55,965
Come.

813
00:57:55,965 --> 00:57:56,936
Or you'll miss something great.

814
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:06,724
Let's get this over with.

815
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:09,758
Come on.

816
00:58:30,303 --> 00:58:36,154
(No matter how far Mee ran, she could never catch up with the Sun.)

817
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,854
Day, stop.

818
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:09,768
I don't want to play this game anymore.

819
00:59:10,809 --> 00:59:13,023
We will reach the finish line in 50 meters.

820
00:59:14,064 --> 00:59:15,347
Once we get there,

821
00:59:16,478 --> 00:59:17,772
I'll ask you to be my boyfriend.

822
00:59:21,012 --> 00:59:21,951
That's settled.

823
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,052
Wait.

824
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:38,394
Are they okay over there?

825
00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:50,235
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six…

826
00:59:51,238 --> 00:59:58,220
Five, four, three, two, one.

827
01:00:11,923 --> 01:00:12,914
What?

828
01:01:09,155 --> 01:01:15,168
(Instead of being sad, Mee invited her shadow to dance with her under the final glow of sunlight of the day.)

829
01:01:15,168 --> 01:01:16,779
(They joyfully danced together.)

830
01:01:18,171 --> 01:01:19,224
Day!

831
01:01:30,484 --> 01:01:31,689
Yeah!

832
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:33,603
Great job. You're awesome.

833
01:01:33,603 --> 01:01:35,814
Mhok, Day, you guys are so great.

834
01:01:43,091 --> 01:01:43,835
Day.

835
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:46,619
Will you be my boyfriend?

836
01:01:49,332 --> 01:01:51,026
We both crossed the line.

837
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:52,784
Do you still need to ask?

838
01:01:53,789 --> 01:01:55,025
Fine, I'll be your boyfriend.

839
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:01,230
Now you can't tell me to go back to being a technician.

840
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:02,603
Yeah.

841
01:02:12,717 --> 01:02:13,983
Give it here.

842
01:02:13,983 --> 01:02:15,173
What are you doing?

843
01:02:15,173 --> 01:02:16,275
Let me take your photos.

844
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:18,659
So siblings can be in the same frames.

845
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:19,980
It's okay.

846
01:02:20,127 --> 01:02:21,199
Smile.

847
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,288
Smile.

848
01:02:26,272 --> 01:02:27,235
Look.

849
01:02:27,235 --> 01:02:27,875
Here.

850
01:02:32,607 --> 01:02:33,405
Thanks.

851
01:02:34,841 --> 01:02:35,890
I'm taking off.

852
01:02:36,197 --> 01:02:36,968
What?

853
01:02:37,151 --> 01:02:38,716
Are you not going to celebrate it with us?

854
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:40,804
No.

855
01:02:40,987 --> 01:02:42,420
I don't want to be the third wheel.

856
01:02:45,533 --> 01:02:47,533
Oh, you know about those two?

857
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:49,193
I do.

858
01:02:49,193 --> 01:02:50,391
Even you can tell.

859
01:02:50,952 --> 01:02:52,987
They're so obvious. Who can't?

860
01:02:53,922 --> 01:02:54,852
True.

861
01:02:55,556 --> 01:02:58,045
I should probably go too.

862
01:02:58,045 --> 01:02:58,810
Wait.

863
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:01,816
Where are you going?

864
01:03:01,999 --> 01:03:02,973
You want a ride?

865
01:03:02,973 --> 01:03:03,901
Or…

866
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:06,043
We can grab something to eat around here.

867
01:03:10,785 --> 01:03:11,998
Are you flirting with me?

868
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:15,811
I'm kidding.

869
01:03:17,382 --> 01:03:20,299
But pregnant women usually eat a lot.

870
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:21,885
Will you be able to treat me?

871
01:03:29,387 --> 01:03:30,506
Here, Day.

872
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:31,693
Drink and refresh yourself.

873
01:03:41,855 --> 01:03:43,305
Do you want to be refreshed too?

874
01:03:44,468 --> 01:03:45,750
I do.

875
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,599
But I don't want you to think I’m crossing the line.

876
01:03:48,477 --> 01:03:50,477
Oops! I forgot.

877
01:03:51,413 --> 01:03:52,564
We're boyfriends now. Right?

878
01:03:54,819 --> 01:03:55,943
Yeah, keep playing.

879
01:03:56,339 --> 01:03:57,474
Don't drink.

880
01:03:57,474 --> 01:03:59,225
Wait. I'm kidding.

881
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:02,499
My boyfriend handed me a drink. Of course, I'd take it.

882
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:13,207
Hey.

883
01:04:13,727 --> 01:04:14,929
Where's Aon though?

884
01:04:15,807 --> 01:04:16,719
Right.

885
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:18,717
He should have finished before us.

886
01:04:22,805 --> 01:04:23,858
What's going on?

887
01:04:25,508 --> 01:04:26,455
Ah.

888
01:04:26,776 --> 01:04:29,112
There's a group of people looking at something on your left.

889
01:04:29,543 --> 01:04:30,474
You want to check it out?

890
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:31,634
Yes.

891
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:32,462
Let's go.

892
01:04:33,685 --> 01:04:34,502
Up.

893
01:04:38,471 --> 01:04:40,318
Hey, Day.

894
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,398
Master Aon is proposing to Phi Pla.

895
01:04:46,659 --> 01:04:48,292
Whoa.

896
01:04:48,631 --> 01:04:51,456
That's why he kept telling us to come.

897
01:04:52,238 --> 01:04:53,993
He is a total badass.

898
01:04:54,955 --> 01:04:56,111
What's happening now?

899
01:04:58,911 --> 01:05:00,000
Come here.

900
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:01,783
I'll show you.

901
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:09,524
He takes out the ring from his pocket

902
01:05:10,988 --> 01:05:13,233
as he kneels in front of her.

903
01:05:19,263 --> 01:05:23,232
Then he holds her hand.

904
01:05:24,665 --> 01:05:28,254
He opens the ring box and says,

905
01:05:31,169 --> 01:05:32,680
“Will you marry me?”

906
01:05:35,672 --> 01:05:38,027
Kiss. Kiss.

907
01:05:38,027 --> 01:05:40,177
He’s giving her the ring.

908
01:05:40,418 --> 01:05:42,112
He takes it out

909
01:05:44,997 --> 01:05:46,263
and do this.

910
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:07,186
Kiss. Kiss.

911
01:06:07,186 --> 01:06:09,438
Should I demonstrate that too?

912
01:06:10,788 --> 01:06:12,788
Kiss. Kiss.

913
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:25,898
No answer.

914
01:06:28,254 --> 01:06:29,368
I'll take that as a yes.

915
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:56,680
Phi.

916
01:06:57,812 --> 01:06:58,455
Hmm?

917
01:07:00,877 --> 01:07:02,143
Why can't I see you?

918
01:07:08,279 --> 01:07:09,143
Phi.

919
01:07:09,143 --> 01:07:10,096
Day.

920
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:11,229
Phi.

921
01:07:13,326 --> 01:07:14,654
It's all dark.

922
01:07:14,654 --> 01:07:16,916
- Why can't I see anything?
- Day, calm down.

923
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:17,760
Day.

924
01:07:21,095 --> 01:07:22,514
Day, I’m right here.

925
01:07:22,514 --> 01:07:23,575
Take it easy.

926
01:07:25,702 --> 01:07:27,091
I can't see anything.

927
01:07:27,091 --> 01:07:28,451
I know.

928
01:07:28,451 --> 01:07:29,709
Just calm, okay?

929
01:07:44,764 --> 01:07:47,681
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

930
01:07:48,483 --> 01:07:50,116
I made it in time.

931
01:07:50,604 --> 01:07:51,993
Where’s my reward?

932
01:07:52,227 --> 01:07:53,371
Don’t rush it.

933
01:07:53,371 --> 01:07:54,246
Take a break first.

934
01:07:55,452 --> 01:07:56,871
Here you go.

935
01:08:12,684 --> 01:08:14,409
This will definitely take away my tiredness.

936
01:08:18,996 --> 01:08:19,888
Day,

937
01:08:20,377 --> 01:08:21,485
I’ve got a question.

938
01:08:22,377 --> 01:08:26,761
I heard blind people enjoy the taste of food more.

939
01:08:26,761 --> 01:08:27,546
Is that true?

940
01:08:28,988 --> 01:08:30,072
Not this again.

941
01:08:30,408 --> 01:08:33,249
It’s like when I’m asked if blind people can hear better.

942
01:08:34,138 --> 01:08:35,374
That’s not true.

943
01:08:35,966 --> 01:08:37,660
The taste is the same.

944
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:39,257
It’s just we can’t see it.

945
01:08:40,274 --> 01:08:44,805
So we take it to our hearts more.

946
01:08:45,082 --> 01:08:47,938
Ooh! How sharp.

947
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,001
If you don’t believe me,

948
01:08:53,224 --> 01:08:53,982
here.

949
01:08:58,911 --> 01:09:00,131
Wait. Wait.

950
01:09:00,131 --> 01:09:01,247
Don’t drink it yet.

951
01:09:01,647 --> 01:09:02,302
Why?

952
01:09:02,302 --> 01:09:02,818
Here.

953
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:07,892
Try this.

954
01:09:08,381 --> 01:09:09,594
And you’ll be surprised.

955
01:09:14,414 --> 01:09:15,251
So?

956
01:09:15,404 --> 01:09:16,261
Good?

957
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,035
Sweet.

958
01:09:25,358 --> 01:09:26,958
A little sweet.

959
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:29,575
Smells good.

960
01:09:32,662 --> 01:09:33,867
And soft.

961
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:41,633
That ‘soft’ part gives you away.

962
01:09:42,772 --> 01:09:44,344
I meant the taste is soft and mellow.

963
01:09:44,765 --> 01:09:45,617
What are you thinking?

964
01:09:48,123 --> 01:09:50,738
I’m not bold enough to cross the line.

965
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,780
Speaking of which, I should back off a little.

966
01:10:01,336 --> 01:10:04,681
The patient's cornea has deteriorated since the last time we checked.

967
01:10:04,681 --> 01:10:07,202
His vision might gradually weaken.

968
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:08,961
It’s Aon’s wedding.

969
01:10:08,961 --> 01:10:10,520
Held in Songkhla.

970
01:10:10,828 --> 01:10:13,470
With a sight like this, it’s even harder.

971
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:14,633
Do you want to go?

972
01:10:17,089 --> 01:10:18,967
Though I can’t see,

973
01:10:18,967 --> 01:10:20,757
everything remains the same.

974
01:10:21,352 --> 01:10:23,902
The sky remains the sky.

975
01:10:24,684 --> 01:10:27,693
The sea remains the sea.

976
01:10:28,321 --> 01:10:29,411
You know?

977
01:10:30,145 --> 01:10:31,575
I just realized this.

978
01:10:32,578 --> 01:10:35,617
For something, we don’t need eyes to look

979
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:37,507
yet we’re still able to see it.

980
01:10:37,507 --> 01:10:38,359
Right.

981
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,215
For something, you need to feel it by heart.
