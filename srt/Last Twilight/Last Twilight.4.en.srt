Viewer discretion is advised.

5
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:20,519
Why don’t you keep in touch with your friends?

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,716
I think they want to see you.

7
00:00:22,716 --> 00:00:24,171
I'm looking for a book.

8
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:25,793
It's a novel.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,520
Called Last Twilight.

10
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:33,690
I think this is it.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,384
Hey! This is the one.

12
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:38,920
But the last page is missing.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,134
How will we know the ending then?

14
00:00:41,134 --> 00:00:41,695
Hey.

15
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:44,880
I think this one suits you.

16
00:00:45,236 --> 00:00:46,480
The color is so bright.

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,280
I can see it from Mars.

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,026
Who is she?

19
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:50,228
My little sister.

20
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:51,495
Little sister, my ass.

21
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:54,196
Does Porjai know you're such a dick?

22
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:55,003
Keng, you bastard!

23
00:00:56,654 --> 00:00:58,149
Excuse me. Please get out of the way.

24
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,208
Make the way, please.

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,356
Day!

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,444
Hey.

27
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:03,275
I’m over here.

28
00:01:11,384 --> 00:01:12,346
Good night.

29
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,784
That was from me.

30
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:16,676
No one wrote it.

31
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:24,727
Hey.

32
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:27,512
Oh.

33
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:32,313
You want coffee?

34
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:34,111
Uh…

35
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:34,990
Black coffee.

36
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:53,508
I haven’t spread jam on that.

37
00:01:54,236 --> 00:01:56,600
I’ll do it for you. Wait a second.

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,918
Here you go.

39
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:06,100
In front of you.

40
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,753
It’s hot.

41
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:18,898
Gosh.

42
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,244
Why is it so bitter?

43
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:24,880
Black coffee is supposed to be bitter.

44
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:26,163
Do you even know coffee?

45
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:29,691
But this one is so bitter that it’s sour.

46
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:31,785
Seriously.

47
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:33,603
Do you know how to make coffee?

48
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:38,718
No?

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,067
Then why did you ask if I wanted coffee?

50
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:44,082
I was just asking.

51
00:02:44,655 --> 00:02:46,655
I never said I knew how to make coffee.

52
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:52,571
You’re single, aren’t you?

53
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,442
You don’t seem like a person in a relationship.

54
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:02,853
There is absolutely zero tenderness in you.

55
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:05,526
Do you even know how to flirt?

56
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,712
Quiet, huh?

57
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:13,910
You’re quiet.

58
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:16,465
I guess I’m right.

59
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:24,215
Jasmine?

60
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,961
The jasmine tree is in full bloom.

61
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:36,605
It’s a shame to leave it like that.

62
00:03:41,418 --> 00:03:42,660
I know you like jasmines.

63
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,266
Smells good?

64
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:03,222
Yes.

65
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:06,291
This is as tender as I can be.

66
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:07,586
Someone like me.

67
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,187
Still zero tenderness?

68
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:20,362
Still zero.

69
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,364
Oh, I’ve got a question.

70
00:04:27,296 --> 00:04:28,485
Why did you take this job?

71
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,230
A car?

72
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,080
Um.

73
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,761
You asked me why I took the job.

74
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:55,609
Come on, Pae!

75
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,870
How many times have I told you that bird droppings damage the car paint?

76
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,394
You must immediately wipe it off.

77
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:08,149
If the paint gets ruined, we must redo the entire car.

78
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,169
It’s a shame.

79
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,069
Its current color is already nice.

80
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:16,408
Damn it.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,732
Hey.

82
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,356
Who are you complaining to?

83
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,912
I’m complaining to my sister’s car.

84
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,189
Mhok.

85
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:27,135
What the hell are you whining so loud for?

86
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:29,704
Hi.

87
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,238
This is Day,

88
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:34,244
my boss.

89
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:35,986
His friend.

90
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:42,273
Here. This month’s installment.

91
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,498
Sorry, it’s not a bank transfer.

92
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:46,224
I wanted to come visit you too.

93
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:49,213
Visit me or the car?

94
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:51,214
Both.

95
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,554
And this.

96
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:57,570
What do we do?

97
00:05:58,534 --> 00:06:00,534
You said you’d take good care of my car.

98
00:06:01,332 --> 00:06:02,297
Look around.

99
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:05,688
How could I have known that birds would be soaring in and pooping here?

100
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:09,812
Let’s do this.

101
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:12,429
I think…

102
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:18,000
you should give it a drive and a wash.

103
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:20,156
For real?

104
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:21,105
For real.

105
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:23,371
So you can stop nagging just like Rung.

106
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,652
Give the engine a test drive.

107
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:26,870
The battery should be used.

108
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,243
That’d be awesome.

109
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:29,900
Day.

110
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,360
You’re coming?

111
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:33,018
I am.

112
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:47,216
Well.

113
00:06:47,216 --> 00:06:48,492
You're being naughty.

114
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:50,029
What are you doing?

115
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,729
Turning the radio on.

116
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,524
Right here.

117
00:06:58,427 --> 00:06:59,357
Here.

118
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:01,952
The button kinda broke.

119
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:03,017
You must press it hard.

120
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:04,898
Ah.

121
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:07,841
(Alright, let's check out this message.)

122
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:10,812
(Guys, here’s what the message says.)

123
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:14,899
(DJ, my heart flutters every time I'm close to him.)

124
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:18,393
(We're not even a thing. I just like to be near him.)

125
00:07:18,393 --> 00:07:20,386
(I can't find the reasons for that.)

126
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:22,161
(Do you think I like him already?)

127
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:26,513
(Can you play a song that represents my feelings?)

128
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,497
(I think this song will do.)

129
00:07:34,945 --> 00:07:40,471

130
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:47,667

You just killed the mood.

134
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:00,771
Sorry.

135
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:02,772
That was not my kind of song.

136
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,033
What's your kind of song?

137
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,391

You're that bad?

151
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:16,647
Hungry?

152
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:20,188
Um.

153
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,450
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

154
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:16,931
Once you're done being sad, cook me something.

155
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:20,303
Don't you have work to do?

156
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:22,777
I do.

157
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:25,031
I just wanted to stop by and see how you're holding up.

158
00:10:28,807 --> 00:10:29,497
Hey.

159
00:10:30,616 --> 00:10:31,730
I'm worried.

160
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:37,361
I started packing.

161
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:40,265
I'll move out when he's not home.

162
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,106
Why didn't you ask for my help?

163
00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:44,306
It should be done in a day.

164
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:48,722
Do you still care about this guy or what?

165
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:50,393
Please.

166
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:52,899
I don't care.

167
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,446
But you two are surely fighting again if you confront each other.

168
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:58,035
You have history.

169
00:10:58,035 --> 00:11:00,497
If the police know, you are screwed.

170
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:11,374
I can't see how you could put up with that asshole.

171
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:16,294
If I could date someone like you,

172
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:19,200
I could date any man.

173
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,171
What a mouth.

174
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:25,106
Yours isn't much different, Mhok.

175
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,362
So why did you come here?

176
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:44,382
Day, it’s me.

177
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,698
Hey.

178
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:46,797
You're done?

179
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:47,824
That was quick.

180
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:52,343
I'd like to introduce you to someone.

181
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,654
This is…Porjai.

182
00:11:58,654 --> 00:11:59,649
Do you remember me?

183
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I dropped something off at your house.

184
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,775
The slippers.

185
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:05,440
Ah, you…

186
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:07,115
Porjai.

187
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,938
I work at this restaurant.

188
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:12,884
Do you want to eat anything?

189
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:15,072
Everything here is delicious. I confirm.

190
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:16,924
Whoa.

191
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:19,495
We’d like to order a takeaway.

192
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,259
Fried Rice with anything for me.

193
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:25,063
And Day…

194
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:26,485
Fried Rice with anything as well.

195
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:28,483
See?

196
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,480
He's not picky like you said.

197
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:32,004
Hey.

198
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:36,610
You're such a big mouth.

199
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,667
My boss will fire me.

200
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,340
Oh, please.

201
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,264
Your boss seems really nice.

202
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:44,020
Right?

203
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:45,363
Not a boss.

204
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:47,811
Let's just say I'm a friend.

205
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,399
Okay.

206
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,171
Just wait a moment, Day.

207
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:56,633
Your food will be done in no time.

208
00:12:57,137 --> 00:12:57,856
Sure.

209
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:00,987
What are you smiling at?

210
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:01,778
Huh?

211
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:02,896
What?

212
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,916
You have to help me in the kitchen.

213
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,098
We've just got an order for a hundred boxes.

214
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:10,478
What?

215
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:11,877
What a double standard.

216
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:12,698
Quickly.

217
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:17,622
I'm a caretaker. I'm not your employee.

218
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:19,294
Do you want to eat or not?

219
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:28,691
Day, you want more water?

220
00:13:31,737 --> 00:13:32,618
Oh!

221
00:13:34,257 --> 00:13:36,257
This is Porjai by the way.

222
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:37,955
Oh, I forgot.

223
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:40,934
What's the process here? Do I need to introduce myself before I speak?

224
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:43,836
No, it's okay.

225
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:47,760
If we've talked before, I think I recognize your voice.

226
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:49,188
Yeah?

227
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:50,251
You do?

228
00:13:51,512 --> 00:13:54,407
How does my voice sound?

229
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:56,449
You sound really nice.

230
00:13:57,178 --> 00:13:58,271
Like a kind person.

231
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:01,064
I think you're pretty too.

232
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:04,767
Aren't you so cute?

233
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,331
No wonder why Mhok likes to tease you.

234
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:11,176
How does Mhok’s voice sound?

235
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:14,044
Let me think.

236
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,615
He sounds like a chop buster, doesn't he?

237
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,820
I guess he sounds grumpy.

238
00:14:22,773 --> 00:14:25,000
Sometimes he sounds cool.

239
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:27,362
Mysterious.

240
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:30,000
Mhok’s voice is mysterious?

241
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:30,994
You think?

242
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:35,488
How can I put this?

243
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,651
I think his voice is like the scent of cigarettes.

244
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:42,000
It's unique.

245
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,446
If you like it, you like it.

246
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:48,819
If you don't like it, you hate it.

247
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:52,018
That's deep.

248
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:56,193
Oh,

249
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:58,216
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,080
I take so much of your boyfriend's time.

251
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:04,650
Boyfriend?

252
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:05,888
Yes.

253
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:07,625
What? No!!

254
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,754
He's not my boyfriend.

255
00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:10,284
He's my ex.

256
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:13,384
No more. I'm so done with him. No return.

257
00:15:16,064 --> 00:15:17,672
Hold on one second.

258
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:19,631
Why did you mention that?

259
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:23,400
Are you interested in Mhok?

260
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:32,447
The food is ready.

261
00:15:33,627 --> 00:15:34,612
Do you want anything else?

262
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,158
No.

263
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:38,395
I want to go home.

264
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,201
I'm hungry.

265
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:41,954
I'll see you later.

266
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,120
Yes, Porjai.

267
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:48,612
Go. He's hungry.

268
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:49,586
Take him home.

269
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:51,059
Okay.

270
00:15:59,034 --> 00:15:59,697
Bye.

271
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:08,529
The door, Day.

272
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:11,105
Down the steps.

273
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,906
Three steps.

274
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:16,105
I'm counting it for you.

275
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:16,864
One,

276
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:18,056
two,

277
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:19,674
three.

278
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:20,696
Come on.

279
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:24,774
Hey!

280
00:16:24,774 --> 00:16:25,781
Day.

281
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,586
What brings you here?

282
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:30,247
Night told me you were studying abroad.

283
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:32,489
Why didn't you tell me you're back?

284
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:34,634
Who are you?

285
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:36,235
Gee?

286
00:16:39,044 --> 00:16:40,078
Yes, I’m Gee.

287
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:42,779
What?

288
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:43,697
Don't you remember me?

289
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:44,775
You forgot about me already?

290
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:46,240
And what is this? Why are you not talking to me?

291
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,505
Okay, relax. Easy there.

292
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,174
We are in a hurry.

293
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:49,987
Sorry.

294
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:51,171
Come on, Day.

295
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,978
Day!

296
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:58,103
Am I not your friend anymore?

297
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,894
Whatever it is, just talk to me.

298
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:09,230
You just disappeared. How am I supposed to know anything?

299
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:18,336
Gee.

300
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:21,516
I'm blind.

301
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:38,288
Day, I'm your fan.

302
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,106
Can I please take photos with you?

303
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:44,526
Should I say no?

304
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:11,584
Are you doing okay?

305
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,700
It's been over a year.

306
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:17,523
I'm just living with it.

307
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,544
What can I do if I'm not okay?

308
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:22,502
Nothing.

309
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,416
Right?

310
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,221
You're stronger than I am.

311
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:32,040
No.

312
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:33,818
It's just an act.

313
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:36,396
Day.

314
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:37,925
This is something serious.

315
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:39,530
Take it seriously.

316
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:43,538
I'll get you more water.

317
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:45,506
Thanks.

318
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:50,948
Hey.

319
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,324
Who's he?

320
00:18:54,122 --> 00:18:56,104
I don't know. I can't see.

321
00:18:56,714 --> 00:18:57,626
Who do you mean?

322
00:18:57,873 --> 00:18:59,411
What? Damn you!

323
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:00,846
The guy, just now.

324
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:01,663
He's the only one here.

325
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:05,194
That’s Mhok.

326
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:07,262
He's my caretaker.

327
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,101
My mom hired him to help me.

328
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,511
Smiling, smiling.

329
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:16,802
Smiling what?

330
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,054
You’re smiling.

331
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:18,948
I’m not.

332
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:19,515
You are.

333
00:19:23,314 --> 00:19:26,175
By the way, I'm visiting the badminton club.

334
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:29,028
They're cleaning up. You know that?

335
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:31,284
Cleaning what up?

336
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:33,400
You know, they're clearing off stuff.

337
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,062
Returning things to the owners.

338
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:37,183
Trophies, medals, that sort of thing.

339
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:38,655
I guess lots of your stuff is still there.

340
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,061
Do you want them? I'll keep them for you.

341
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:44,770
I'll go get them myself.

342
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:47,661
Mhok.

343
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:48,766
Hm?

344
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,990
Can you drive me there?

345
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:56,749
Alright, kids, are you ready?

346
00:19:56,974 --> 00:19:58,121
Yes.

347
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,581
If you're ready, go!

348
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:01,738
Play it like we practiced.

349
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:04,213
This place smells like liniment oil, as always.

350
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:09,362
Everything stays the same.

351
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,730
I still practice every day, just the same.

352
00:20:17,511 --> 00:20:19,264
Go on!

353
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,679
Nice.

354
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,932
Keep it up.

355
00:20:23,704 --> 00:20:24,442
Who are they?

356
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:25,951
Keep going.

357
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:28,265
Youth players.

358
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:30,725
They're borrowing our gym to practice.

359
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,621
They come here every day. The selection is approaching.

360
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,468
Coach Aek must have thought I love children very much.

361
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:42,205
Damn you, Gee.

362
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,207
Day, go.

363
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:51,535
This side, Day.

364
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:53,140
This side, go!

365
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,073
This way. Okay.

366
00:20:54,073 --> 00:20:55,061
Good.

367
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:55,950
Go.

368
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,146
That way.

369
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,999
This way.

370
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:00,415
Up high.

371
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:04,103
Can you handle this, Day?

372
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:05,458
I can, coach.

373
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:07,349
The selection is next week.

374
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:10,315
Should I send someone else's name?

375
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:11,846
No.

376
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:12,747
Send mine.

377
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:14,022
My name.

378
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:15,217
Are you sure?

379
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:16,229
I am.

380
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:17,478
Send me.

381
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:19,003
Then back to your spot.

382
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:20,758
One more round. Go!

383
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:22,673
Left.

384
00:21:22,903 --> 00:21:23,491
Right.

385
00:21:23,626 --> 00:21:24,214
Left.

386
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:24,714
Right.

387
00:21:26,461 --> 00:21:27,361
Well.

388
00:21:27,361 --> 00:21:28,619
Let me walk with you.

389
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,530
Perhaps I can take over this job from your Mhok.

390
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:34,849
My Mhok, my ass.

391
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:36,162
You're speaking nonsense.

392
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,378
I meant he’s your caretaker.

393
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:40,707
He's not someone else's, right?

394
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:44,042
You should have been more clear about that.

395
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:49,607
Hey.

396
00:21:50,563 --> 00:21:53,170
Have you seen his face before?

397
00:21:55,062 --> 00:21:56,216
Are you trying to bug me?

398
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,838
With these eyes, how can I see him?

399
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:00,346
Well.

400
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:04,351
You said it yourself that you can still see up close.

401
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,411
Um.

402
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,101
Spoilers alert,

403
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:14,169
not only is his voice handsome,

404
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,238
but so is his face.

405
00:22:16,665 --> 00:22:18,808
He’s such an eye candy.

406
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,274
Yeah?

407
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,427
Hotter than me?

408
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:23,356
Oh, please.

409
00:22:24,672 --> 00:22:25,766
Your confidence remains the same.

410
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,302
And you're talkative, just the same.

411
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,687
Yes, that's me.

412
00:22:31,878 --> 00:22:32,661
Oh, hey.

413
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:36,138
Coach Aek is moving back to his hometown.

414
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:39,402
The club members are throwing him a farewell party.

415
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,133
You want to come?

416
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:45,726
Come.

417
00:22:46,563 --> 00:22:47,506
We're all friends.

418
00:22:47,506 --> 00:22:48,314
Let's say goodbye to the coach.

419
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:52,576
Gee, hello.

420
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:53,716
Hi.

421
00:22:56,405 --> 00:23:00,465
Is this Day Danainat, the national player?

422
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:02,195
Yeah.

423
00:23:02,195 --> 00:23:03,113
Hello.

424
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:04,415
Hello.

425
00:23:05,854 --> 00:23:08,831
Day, I'm your fan.

426
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,750
Can I please take photos with you?

427
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:28,659
Should I say no?

428
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:35,061
That's okay.

429
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:37,497
Sure.

430
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:38,904
Let's take photos.

431
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:40,013
Yeah.

432
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:40,963
Thank you.

433
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,106
Here. Let me take them for you guys.

434
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:43,724
Thank you.

435
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:45,370
Should we turn this way?

436
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:46,901
We can capture the club’s sign.

437
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:47,801
Good.

438
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,688
You stand over there.

439
00:23:51,312 --> 00:23:52,109
Day, this way.

440
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:55,581
Smile.

441
00:23:58,963 --> 00:24:01,300
One, two, three.

442
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:02,693
Change your pose.

443
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:06,250
One, two, three.

444
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:10,928
Okay.

445
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:14,118
Thank you.

446
00:24:14,382 --> 00:24:15,390
Two photos are enough, right?

447
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:16,404
No.

448
00:24:16,404 --> 00:24:17,421
That's enough.

449
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:18,965
That’s all you got.

450
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:21,340
Why do you want so many?

451
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:22,848
Look. You’re pretty.

452
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:25,497
I’ve been pretty for so long. Right, my friend?

453
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:29,027
You’re so confident, just like me.

454
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,621
Not as much as you.

455
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:35,877
The room is the same.

456
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:38,110
Messy, as always.

457
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,286
We're trying to clean it up.

458
00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:48,646
Hold on one second.

459
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:49,922
My family is calling.

460
00:24:51,303 --> 00:24:52,013
I'll be right back.

461
00:24:52,013 --> 00:24:53,393
That's the room. You can go in.

462
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:54,604
Sure.

463
00:24:56,073 --> 00:24:56,800
Hello.

464
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,006
Let's get inside that room.

465
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,461
Wow.

466
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:07,127
I didn't realize Mr. Day was this famous.

467
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,339
I was ranked first among players my age two years in a row.

468
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:14,090
You're not a humble man, I see.

469
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:16,891
Just let me brag.

470
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:21,101
I worked so damn hard to maintain that high score.

471
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,720
Should I ask for your autograph now?

472
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,424
In case you fire me one day.

473
00:25:28,964 --> 00:25:30,802
Pay me. I'll give you my autograph.

474
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:32,221
I have no money.

475
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:35,742
Wow.

476
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:38,043
They're a bunch of trophies here.

477
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:40,229
Where?

478
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:41,269
Take me there.

479
00:25:43,946 --> 00:25:44,819
It's narrow here.

480
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:51,278
You bragged so much.

481
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:52,411
Are any of these yours?

482
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:55,711
Here it is.

483
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:01,882
SCT,

484
00:26:02,182 --> 00:26:04,294
the biggest tournament in Thailand.

485
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:08,164
Even some members of the national team are unable to win this cup.

486
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,514
What a bragger.

487
00:26:12,245 --> 00:26:15,314
Look whose name is on this.

488
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,998
Champions,

489
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,231
Mr. Danainat Korbnoppakhun.

490
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:26,974
Mr. Annop…

491
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:27,859
Wait.

492
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,350
You played men's doubles?

493
00:26:33,104 --> 00:26:33,653
Um.

494
00:26:39,062 --> 00:26:40,221
Shit!

495
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,073
Oh, crap

496
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:52,641
The trophy's handle broke off and is now missing.

497
00:26:56,454 --> 00:26:57,272
Where is it?

498
00:26:57,497 --> 00:26:58,477
It's already broken.

499
00:27:00,462 --> 00:27:02,732
August and I tugged it while taking photos.

500
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,211
It was embarrassing.

501
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,829
Who's August again?

502
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,150
The other name on the trophy.

503
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:17,848
Ah.

504
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,340
Let's go.

505
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:24,505
I don't want it anymore.

506
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:25,386
Let's just leave it here.

507
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:31,306
Okay.

508
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:32,838
Let's go.

509
00:27:35,805 --> 00:27:36,542
Hold on.

510
00:27:36,812 --> 00:27:37,514
Hm?

511
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,461
Can you take photos for me?

512
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:44,756
With the trophy?

513
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:46,294
Um.

514
00:27:47,103 --> 00:27:47,798
Of course.

515
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:00,255
Wow.

516
00:28:00,682 --> 00:28:02,322
It’s like you just won the competition.

517
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:07,415
Smile.

518
00:28:09,011 --> 00:28:10,736
One, two, three.

519
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:15,800
One, two, three.

520
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:21,000
All done.

521
00:29:13,036 --> 00:29:13,877
(Hello.)

522
00:29:14,776 --> 00:29:15,485
(Are you free?)

523
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:17,814
Not really.

524
00:29:18,264 --> 00:29:18,933
What is it?

525
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:22,312
Is it about Keng?

526
00:30:06,188 --> 00:30:06,750
Hey.

527
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:07,820
Has the food been delivered yet?

528
00:30:08,336 --> 00:30:09,035
It has.

529
00:30:09,035 --> 00:30:09,738
Have a seat.

530
00:30:21,532 --> 00:30:22,135
Thank you.

531
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:34,803
Here we go.

532
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:39,684
We have deep-fried pork, stir-fried vegetables, and clear soup with egg tofu and minced pork.

533
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:41,142
Clear soup?

534
00:30:41,142 --> 00:30:42,851
Yes. It's on your right.

535
00:30:45,089 --> 00:30:46,813
Deep-fried pork is in the middle of the table.

536
00:31:03,016 --> 00:31:03,706
Good?

537
00:31:05,016 --> 00:31:06,832
It’s…standard.

538
00:31:07,786 --> 00:31:09,625
Standard means good or bad?

539
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:12,107
Good.

540
00:31:12,612 --> 00:31:13,363
Standardly good.

541
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:17,717
I made it.

542
00:31:18,384 --> 00:31:19,927
Eatable, huh?

543
00:31:22,016 --> 00:31:22,888
Not standard then.

544
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,660
It’s not good at all.

545
00:31:25,604 --> 00:31:26,318
What?

546
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:27,834
You just said it was good.

547
00:31:31,134 --> 00:31:32,345
Well, I changed my mind.

548
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:34,238
It's not good.

549
00:31:34,423 --> 00:31:35,216
You have a problem?

550
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:36,699
Come on.

551
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:38,628
I welcome compliments.

552
00:31:40,244 --> 00:31:42,612
Are my cooking skills comparable to Chef Mhon’s?

553
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:51,083
I think they are.

554
00:31:52,923 --> 00:31:53,941
Cocky much?

555
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,079
You want to compete with my mom?

556
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:57,230
I'll be the judge.

557
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:06,829
Hey, it's me.

558
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:08,452
Hey.

559
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:09,215
What are you up to?

560
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:11,292
I'm looking for a shirt.

561
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,730
Can you help look?

562
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,454
Is it a white T-shirt with cartoon printing?

563
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:17,612
No.

564
00:32:18,256 --> 00:32:19,027
This is unusual.

565
00:32:19,262 --> 00:32:20,427
Is today a special occasion?

566
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:24,015
It’s the farewell party for the coach.

567
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:27,612
I want to wear the shirt Gee bought me as a gift.

568
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,480
Ah.

569
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:31,773
What are you looking for again?

570
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,454
A white tee with cartoon printing?

571
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:34,087
Yes.

572
00:32:35,494 --> 00:32:36,375
Hey.

573
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:37,333
Is it this one?

574
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:41,913
Yes?

575
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:42,997
Yes, this is the one.

576
00:32:45,816 --> 00:32:46,403
Mhok.

577
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,713
Can you grab me a pair of jeans?

578
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:50,413
Which ones?

579
00:32:50,413 --> 00:32:51,366
The blue ones.

580
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:53,189
The ones I always wear.

581
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:58,238
I can see now that you really like to dress up.

582
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:02,797
Hey, though I can't see,

583
00:33:03,463 --> 00:33:06,061
I want to look good in people's eyes.

584
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:08,730
Alright, Mr. Handsome.

585
00:33:10,064 --> 00:33:10,679
Here.

586
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,604
Thank you.

587
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:16,826
Let go.

588
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:18,519
Don't mess with me.

589
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:19,830
Hey.

590
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:23,853
Whoa.

591
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:25,850
Your hand is so damn rough.

592
00:33:27,612 --> 00:33:28,883
I'm a technician.

593
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,196
Of course, I don't have soft hands.

594
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:32,876
I've played badminton since I was young.

595
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:34,175
I’ve bruised my fingers many times.

596
00:33:34,589 --> 00:33:36,052
Yet my hands are not as rough as yours.

597
00:33:36,373 --> 00:33:37,540
They are still soft.

598
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:39,339
Look if you don't believe me.

599
00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:49,312
How soft can it be?

600
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:53,677
I told you.

601
00:33:55,103 --> 00:33:55,785
Soft, huh?

602
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:38,499
Alright.

603
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:40,612
It's soft.

604
00:34:53,232 --> 00:34:53,825
Hello.

605
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:56,972
What's up?

606
00:34:57,612 --> 00:34:58,264
(Hello.)

607
00:34:59,156 --> 00:34:59,927
(Are you free?)

608
00:35:01,156 --> 00:35:02,132
Not really.

609
00:35:02,612 --> 00:35:03,233
What is it?

610
00:35:05,694 --> 00:35:06,666
Is it about Keng?

611
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:11,283
I'll let you know later.

612
00:35:21,283 --> 00:35:23,283
Look, I…

613
00:35:23,283 --> 00:35:24,408
It's fine.

614
00:35:26,174 --> 00:35:26,894
You can go.

615
00:35:28,274 --> 00:35:29,554
I'll ask Gee to take me.

616
00:35:32,612 --> 00:35:33,409
Really.

617
00:35:38,306 --> 00:35:39,501
Just get lost.

618
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:45,311
20,000 baht,

619
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:47,334
pay it back.

620
00:35:48,009 --> 00:35:48,806
What's it for?

621
00:35:49,496 --> 00:35:52,332
You borrowed it from me to buy your new computer screen.

622
00:35:52,613 --> 00:35:54,452
You stayed at my place for free.

623
00:35:54,741 --> 00:35:55,621
Shouldn't we call it even?

624
00:35:56,012 --> 00:35:56,695
Come on.

625
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:59,772
I stayed at your place but I paid for water and electricity.

626
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,692
I even paid for Netflix.

627
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,039
It’s you who wanted to watch it.

628
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:04,965
It’s all you.

629
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:06,092
Wow, Keng.

630
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,383
You are freaking selfish.

631
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:11,754
What about the fact that you cheated on me?

632
00:36:11,984 --> 00:36:12,892
Is it all me, too?

633
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:13,737
Huh?

634
00:36:14,592 --> 00:36:15,175
Huh?

635
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,983
You’re at fault too.

636
00:36:17,732 --> 00:36:19,479
You are back to seeing your ex Mhok.

637
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:21,852
Don't blame it all on me.

638
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,425
What the hell are you talking about?

639
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:24,702
We’re just friends.

640
00:36:24,702 --> 00:36:26,123
We don’t screw each other like you did.

641
00:36:26,808 --> 00:36:27,974
Friends, my ass.

642
00:36:28,365 --> 00:36:32,121
A chick like you may be sleeping around behind my back.

643
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:32,889
You bastard.

644
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:33,389
What?

645
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:35,267
What the f*ck?

646
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:37,113
I'm not an asshole like you are.

647
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:38,549
Just go!

648
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:41,375
Keng, you son of a bitch.

649
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:42,474
Damn you.

650
00:36:42,474 --> 00:36:43,758
What the f*ck are you doing?

651
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:46,771
Are you okay?

652
00:36:57,146 --> 00:36:57,852
Mhok.

653
00:36:57,852 --> 00:36:59,052
Keng, stop!

654
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,346
Stay away.

655
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:02,012
Keng!

656
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,338
I told you to let go.

657
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:04,283
Damn it, Keng.

658
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:05,496
Let go.

659
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:08,285
Keng, get off him.

660
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,709
Mhok, enough.

661
00:37:25,455 --> 00:37:26,351
Are you okay?

662
00:37:40,988 --> 00:37:42,988
I’m fine. I'll go get my stuff.

663
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:00,885
You can stay here in the meantime.

664
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,772
I’ll move out right after I find a new place.

665
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:06,768
Hey,

666
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:08,175
you don't have to rush it.

667
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,402
It's Rung’s old room. No one uses it.

668
00:38:13,553 --> 00:38:17,292
Besides, we don't know when that bastard of yours will go crazy again.

669
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:19,978
What if he wants to pick a fight?

670
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:22,130
He's not mine anymore.

671
00:38:22,787 --> 00:38:24,879
I can't be with a guy who physically assaults me.

672
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:39,099
Damn it.

673
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:45,018
That's good.

674
00:38:53,785 --> 00:38:54,650
Thank you so much.

675
00:38:55,785 --> 00:38:56,529
Oh, please.

676
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,021
No touching words needed.

677
00:38:58,632 --> 00:39:01,391
It’s not a problem looking after just one friend.

678
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:12,734
Actually…

679
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:17,043
Not just one.

680
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,972
What do you mean?

681
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:30,460
I’m…

682
00:39:35,314 --> 00:39:36,546
I'm two months pregnant.

683
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:46,037
Shit.

684
00:39:46,037 --> 00:39:46,733
Are you serious?

685
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:58,293
What are you going to do?

686
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:00,961
What am I going to do?

687
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:02,413
What can I do?

688
00:40:02,612 --> 00:40:03,896
The father is a scumbag.

689
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:08,000
I'll just raise it on my own.

690
00:40:08,414 --> 00:40:09,471
It's my kid after all.

691
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:14,349
Can I help you with anything?

692
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:19,756
Can you go get me a beer?

693
00:40:20,481 --> 00:40:21,397
Drink my troubles away.

694
00:40:22,823 --> 00:40:24,988
Hey. Don't do that.

695
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,769
I'm joking.

696
00:40:28,275 --> 00:40:30,081
You're kind enough to let me stay here.

697
00:40:31,774 --> 00:40:33,383
I don't need a beer.

698
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:36,892
I don’t want my child to be a drunkard like its mother.

699
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:42,961
Hang in there.

700
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,792
Do you have a first aid kit?

701
00:40:56,612 --> 00:40:57,852
Don't worry about me.

702
00:40:58,496 --> 00:41:00,314
All I need is a band-aid.

703
00:41:00,755 --> 00:41:01,545
It's above the fridge.

704
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:05,240
By the way, Mhok,

705
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,037
how's your work going?

706
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:24,900
What the hell?

707
00:41:26,004 --> 00:41:26,892
Sorry.

708
00:41:28,093 --> 00:41:29,215
Hey! What the f*ck!

709
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,140
Hey! What’s wrong with you?

710
00:41:33,678 --> 00:41:34,652
I’m sorry.

711
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,939
That song requested by the table full of badminton players was for Coach Aek.

712
00:42:00,939 --> 00:42:02,329
Please give it up for the coach.

713
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:04,711
Whoo-hoo!

714
00:42:14,638 --> 00:42:15,515
Hey.

715
00:42:16,638 --> 00:42:18,991
Don't worry. I already told them a bit about you.

716
00:42:20,977 --> 00:42:22,269
Who else is here?

717
00:42:25,857 --> 00:42:32,105
Ta, Boom, Nhong, Khaw, and Noomnim.

718
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:33,179
Friendly people.

719
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:35,256
Okay.

720
00:42:35,379 --> 00:42:36,086
Okay?

721
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:36,738
Okay.

722
00:42:36,738 --> 00:42:37,250
Come on.

723
00:42:39,271 --> 00:42:41,271
Ta-da! Look who's here.

724
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:43,604
Long time no see.

725
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,427
Hello, Coach Aek.

726
00:42:48,427 --> 00:42:50,069
This way.

727
00:42:51,184 --> 00:42:52,476
Hello, Coach.

728
00:42:52,476 --> 00:42:53,095
Hi.

729
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:54,093
You're funny.

730
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:57,451
I'm so glad you're here, Day.

731
00:42:57,677 --> 00:42:59,677
Enjoy the party, okay?

732
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:00,313
Yes, sir.

733
00:43:00,313 --> 00:43:01,890
Let's welcome your friend here.

734
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:05,993
How have you been?

735
00:43:07,232 --> 00:43:09,940
Give him a glass.

736
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,151
How could you call this a party? These are all you ordered?

737
00:43:12,151 --> 00:43:13,136
It will keep coming.

738
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:19,206
Here, Day.

739
00:43:19,206 --> 00:43:20,096
I put ice cubes in it for you.

740
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:21,329
He can’t see.

741
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:25,254
Day, you want anything?

742
00:43:25,254 --> 00:43:26,167
Some French Fries?

743
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:28,625
What do you like?

744
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:29,438
Do I have to feed you?

745
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:31,594
You guys don't have to take care of me that well.

746
00:43:32,004 --> 00:43:32,846
You're making me shy.

747
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,504
Sorry. We are just not used to it yet.

748
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,761
Hey, don't apologize.

749
00:43:38,764 --> 00:43:43,104
Actually, you guys can just act normal like you always do.

750
00:43:43,606 --> 00:43:46,068
I'll let you know if I need any help.

751
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,942
Yell at him like we always did.

752
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:50,821
He’s the same guy, Day the asshole.

753
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:55,583
If I'm not an asshole, I can't be friends with you guys.

754
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:58,414
Sharp tongue.

755
00:43:58,414 --> 00:43:59,912
That hurts.

756
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:03,151
Day, can you drink though?

757
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:07,160
My eyes are bad, but my liver is still great.

758
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:09,013
I’ll have it neat, please.

759
00:44:09,141 --> 00:44:10,959
Wow!

760
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:11,993
Let's cheers.

761
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:13,205
Come on.

762
00:44:13,206 --> 00:44:15,206
To our blind friend!

763
00:44:20,986 --> 00:44:21,961
Cheers!

764
00:44:22,146 --> 00:44:24,495
That bad mouth must belong to Nhong.

765
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,464
I'm not mad.

766
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:27,828
Yeah!

767
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:34,268
Day, easy there.

768
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:38,254
You're with me tonight, not your Mhok.

769
00:44:39,312 --> 00:44:40,399
Stop talking.

770
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:41,712
Where's your glass?

771
00:44:41,925 --> 00:44:43,094
Drink with me.

772
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:43,637
Come on.

773
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:45,685
Gosh, you're a badass.

774
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:47,812
Nope!

775
00:44:48,305 --> 00:44:49,951
This way, baby.

776
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:54,138
Hey, you're visually impaired now. How do you watch porn?

777
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:00,455
This shitty question must come from Khaw.

778
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:05,307
My eyes are not great, but my ears work fine.

779
00:45:06,718 --> 00:45:08,102
My imagination is superb.

780
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,425
Are you okay?

781
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,064
I am.

782
00:45:31,288 --> 00:45:32,238
Take one step up.

783
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:37,044
We're here.

784
00:45:37,044 --> 00:45:38,557
I need to pee.

785
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,591
Me too.

786
00:45:40,591 --> 00:45:41,325
Oh.

787
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:43,517
Should I go in there with you?

788
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,102
No.

789
00:45:45,256 --> 00:45:46,556
This is easy.

790
00:45:46,881 --> 00:45:48,327
Bathrooms are the same everywhere.

791
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:50,617
Are you sure?

792
00:45:50,617 --> 00:45:51,407
Yes.

793
00:45:51,407 --> 00:45:52,967
Just go. I'll be fine.

794
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:54,592
Be careful. It's on your right.

795
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:03,772
What the hell?

796
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:05,836
Sorry.

797
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:21,957
What the f*ck?

798
00:46:22,841 --> 00:46:24,964
Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?

799
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:27,809
I'm sorry.

800
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:29,124
You alright, man?

801
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:30,803
I'm so sorry.

802
00:46:46,153 --> 00:46:47,014
Sorry, guys.

803
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:48,338
My friend is drunk.

804
00:46:48,857 --> 00:46:50,518
Just take him home.

805
00:46:56,726 --> 00:46:58,387
Day, it's me.

806
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:02,468
Are you okay?

807
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,341
Um.

808
00:47:04,485 --> 00:47:05,637
Using the bathroom?

809
00:47:09,146 --> 00:47:10,487
On your right.

810
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,506
I'll be right outside.

811
00:47:12,856 --> 00:47:13,730
Okay.

812
00:47:17,705 --> 00:47:18,606
Day!

813
00:47:19,222 --> 00:47:20,690
This way.

814
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:22,743
Who's he?

815
00:47:24,251 --> 00:47:25,480
Do you guys know him?

816
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,662
Day!

817
00:47:26,662 --> 00:47:28,406
Damn you. You kept me waiting.

818
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:30,801
- Mhok.
- Hi.

819
00:47:35,317 --> 00:47:37,317
Excuse me. Can I have this chair?

820
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,456
You can sit here.

821
00:47:41,456 --> 00:47:42,255
Thanks.

822
00:47:44,218 --> 00:47:44,961
Sit down.

823
00:47:44,961 --> 00:47:46,557
I told you to wait.

824
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:49,276
I couldn't see you, could I?

825
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:50,712
I forgot. Sorry.

826
00:47:51,927 --> 00:47:54,404
Day, who's that?

827
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:55,738
Introduce him to us.

828
00:47:56,628 --> 00:47:57,743
He's my caretaker.

829
00:47:58,236 --> 00:47:59,121
His name is Mhok.

830
00:48:01,033 --> 00:48:02,096
Hi.

831
00:48:02,096 --> 00:48:04,080
He's hot like you said, Gee.

832
00:48:04,804 --> 00:48:05,831
What?

833
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:09,960
Gee told us that your caretaker was hot.

834
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,898
He really is.

835
00:48:10,898 --> 00:48:12,383
Gee likes you.

836
00:48:12,647 --> 00:48:13,730
Nim!

837
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,447
I don't like him like that.

838
00:48:15,447 --> 00:48:16,291
Can I like him then?

839
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:18,148
You’re slutty.

840
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:31,269
Your facial expression tells me you don’t believe that.

841
00:48:32,815 --> 00:48:33,953
I don't.

842
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:35,009
I’m not lying.

843
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:37,487
You might be handsome,

844
00:48:38,036 --> 00:48:39,143
But only your voice.

845
00:48:44,028 --> 00:48:44,862
Hey.

846
00:48:45,231 --> 00:48:46,520
I'm not showing off or anything.

847
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:51,431
A couple of people at the table next to ours are checking me out

848
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:55,996
Guys.

849
00:48:57,065 --> 00:48:59,735
My caretaker here is a singer.

850
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:01,645
I knew it.

851
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,749
That kind of hotness belongs to club singers.

852
00:49:04,749 --> 00:49:06,790
You’re a singer, right?
I think I saw you before.

853
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:08,184
No.

854
00:49:08,184 --> 00:49:10,064
He sings really well.

855
00:49:10,744 --> 00:49:12,251
He just likes to keep a low profile.

856
00:49:12,374 --> 00:49:13,495
Get him on stage.

857
00:49:14,361 --> 00:49:16,823
Bro, please don't be shy.

858
00:49:16,994 --> 00:49:17,901
Sing for us.

859
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:19,240
One song. Come on.

860
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,255
Please.

861
00:49:20,368 --> 00:49:22,368
As a farewell gift for our coach.

862
00:49:22,368 --> 00:49:23,524
Please.

863
00:49:23,768 --> 00:49:24,585
Good job.

864
00:49:26,784 --> 00:49:28,429
Will you, please?

865
00:49:29,472 --> 00:49:31,591
Sing for us, Mr. Handsome.

866
00:49:43,183 --> 00:49:46,630
If I sing, you will admit that I’m hot, right?

867
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:49,447
Do you have the guts?

868
00:49:50,648 --> 00:49:51,631
Do you?

869
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:58,499
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

870
00:49:59,171 --> 00:50:00,671
Do you dare?

871
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:05,829
Guys, there’s someone from the badminton gang joining me on stage.

872
00:50:05,829 --> 00:50:07,109
A round of applause, please.

873
00:50:10,996 --> 00:50:12,165
Thank you.

874
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:18,488
Actually, I don't sing that well.

875
00:50:20,783 --> 00:50:22,352
But someone challenged me.

876
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:24,862
And I don't like to give in.

877
00:50:27,126 --> 00:50:29,126
This song is sent to the badminton players' table.

878
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:32,216
Please enjoy.

I think he’s peeking at you.

896
00:52:13,186 --> 00:52:15,525
Stop stirring things up, Gee.

897
00:52:15,525 --> 00:52:17,637
What? Damn you.

898
00:52:17,765 --> 00:52:19,488
I’m not stirring up anything. It’s true.

There.

900
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,418
He can’t stop smiling.

00:52:24,524 --> 00:52:25,397
Really?

902
00:52:25,397 --> 00:52:26,524
Yeah.

903
00:52:28,351 --> 00:52:33,799
Set aside his savageness, I think he’s fine.

904
00:52:35,156 --> 00:52:38,664
He doesn't look right for a caretaker at all.

905
00:52:41,243 --> 00:52:42,991

Slow down.

924
00:53:59,077 --> 00:54:00,080
This is your bed.

925
00:54:23,475 --> 00:54:24,825
Day, you want some water?

926
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:26,873
No.

927
00:54:29,776 --> 00:54:31,130
Can I crash here tonight?

928
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,240
I already called and told Night.

929
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,858
Why?

930
00:54:39,614 --> 00:54:41,614
Well, you're dead drunk.

931
00:54:41,816 --> 00:54:43,828
I'll stay and help out in case something happens.

932
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:46,199
Who's drunk?

933
00:54:46,692 --> 00:54:47,835
I'm not.

934
00:54:51,228 --> 00:54:52,071
Come on.

935
00:54:58,043 --> 00:54:59,939
Can I just spend the night though?

936
00:55:01,287 --> 00:55:03,287
Give me a chance to sleep in the AC room.

937
00:55:08,753 --> 00:55:09,892
It's up to you.

938
00:55:12,385 --> 00:55:13,246
Thanks.

939
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:16,445
Get up. You stink. Go take a shower first.

940
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:19,806
Please.

941
00:55:20,422 --> 00:55:21,635
Can I not take a shower?

942
00:55:22,393 --> 00:55:23,421
Just change.

943
00:55:25,053 --> 00:55:26,117
Okay, fine.

944
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:17,422
Your shirt.

945
00:56:19,515 --> 00:56:20,674
Let me help.

946
00:56:42,406 --> 00:56:43,317
You need anything else?

947
00:56:48,981 --> 00:56:50,316
Take off my watch.

948
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:57,992
Done.

949
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,838
I'm going to sleep now.

950
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:10,641
Um.

951
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,833
Let’s take photos.

952
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:39,842
Mhok.

953
00:57:39,842 --> 00:57:41,075
Come join us.

954
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,813
Come on.

955
00:57:44,783 --> 00:57:46,362
Come here.

956
00:57:47,873 --> 00:57:48,671
Right here?

957
00:57:48,671 --> 00:57:49,789
Yes, right here.

958
00:57:51,126 --> 00:57:53,557
One, two, three.

959
00:57:54,102 --> 00:57:54,692
One more.

960
00:57:54,692 --> 00:57:56,631
One, two, three.

961
00:57:56,631 --> 00:57:57,659
Yeah!

962
00:58:01,535 --> 00:58:02,396
Yeah!

963
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:05,430
One, two, three.

964
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:06,843
Yeah!

965
00:58:32,423 --> 00:58:34,054
Have you seen his face before?

966
00:58:35,456 --> 00:58:37,456
Don't you want to know what I look like?

968
01:00:57,151 --> 01:00:58,156
Wake up!

969
01:00:58,156 --> 01:01:00,044
It’s raining!

970
01:01:00,044 --> 01:01:01,156
Please, Phi.

971
01:01:01,156 --> 01:01:02,628
Wait a minute.

972
01:01:03,728 --> 01:01:05,728
What did you just call me?

973
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:08,163
I won’t leave until you say it one more time,

974
01:01:08,714 --> 01:01:09,751
‘Phi.’

975
01:01:09,956 --> 01:01:11,631
I don’t want any more big brother.

976
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:15,415
Why are you wearing so much perfume?

977
01:01:15,415 --> 01:01:16,832
This is suspicious.

978
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:19,927
Are you going to eat at home for the rest of your life?

979
01:01:20,561 --> 01:01:23,485
What if I eat out and make a mess?

980
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:26,460
Baby, no matter how messily you eat, you're still cute.

981
01:01:26,552 --> 01:01:30,491
I always bring my lovers here when they’re upset.

982
01:01:30,491 --> 01:01:31,111
Day.

983
01:01:32,027 --> 01:01:33,227
Where the hell have you been?
