00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:21,716
Hey, Day!

5
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:23,646
What brings you here?

6
00:00:24,488 --> 00:00:26,231
Night told me you’re studying abroad.

7
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:27,727
Why didn’t you tell me you’re back?

8
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:28,642
I’m blind.

9
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:32,447
Have you seen his face before?

10
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:34,778
With these eyes, how can I see him?

11
00:00:34,778 --> 00:00:37,115
Not only is his voice handsome,

12
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:39,022
but so is his face.

13
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:39,704
Wait.

14
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:41,206
You played men's doubles?

15
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:44,841
What about the fact that you cheated on me?

16
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:45,787
Is it all me, too?

17
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:48,651
Keng, you son of a bitch.

18
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:50,068
Get lost!

19
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:50,926
What the f*ck are you doing?

20
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:53,110
You can stay here in the meantime.

21
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,384
I'm two months pregnant.

22
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:57,506
who's that?

23
00:00:57,506 --> 00:00:58,721
Introduce him to us.

24
00:00:58,721 --> 00:00:59,954
He's my caretaker.

25
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:01,192
His name is Mhok.

26
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:04,233
Gee told us that your caretaker was hot.

27
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:05,195
He really is.

28
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:10,003
Can I crash here tonight?

29
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:11,823
Why?

30
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:14,473
Well, you're dead drunk.

31
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,612
I'll stay and help out in case something happens.

32
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,219
Wake up! It’s raining.

33
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,126
It’s pouring.

34
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:55,919
What the–

35
00:01:56,526 --> 00:01:58,526
Gosh, I got water in my mouth.

36
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:06,000
Phi, you’ve just proved I was right when I called you an asshole.

37
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,742
Wait, wait, wait.

38
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,349
What did you just call me?

39
00:02:14,732 --> 00:02:15,834
What, Mister?

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,602
That’s not what I just heard.

41
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,368
What was it?

42
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:22,849
Call me that again.

43
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:24,336
No.

44
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:26,775
I don’t want any more big brother.

45
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:29,635
Yeah?

46
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:31,595
What do you want me to be then?

47
00:02:33,924 --> 00:02:34,734
Well.

48
00:02:35,664 --> 00:02:36,600
A caretaker.

49
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:38,934
Why?

50
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:41,213
Just go.

51
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:43,160
I'm going to take a shower.

52
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,888
Leave.

53
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:46,800
I said leave.

54
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:48,227
I'm not leaving.

55
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:52,037
I'll go after you call me that again.

56
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:53,199
Phi.

57
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:56,739
Or what?

58
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:00,326
Listen to you.

59
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,113
You actually want me to stay, huh?

60
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:04,871
Hey.

61
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:09,280
It's up to you.

62
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:10,863
I can be here all day.

63
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:16,201
Fine.

64
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:18,239
Whatever you say, Phi.

65
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:20,063
Phi Mhok.

66
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:23,190
Are you happy now?

67
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:26,021
I didn't quite hear that.

68
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,878
Can you say it again?

69
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:28,897
Just go.

70
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:30,414
I already did what you asked.

71
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:31,879
Go.

72
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:34,805
That's all you needed to do,

73
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:36,015
Nong Day.

74
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:39,169
Leave.

75
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,586
Can I borrow a shirt?

76
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:44,279
Okay?

77
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:46,187
Just take the one you want.

78
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:49,957
Out of bed.

79
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:50,953
Fine.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,775
Day, I'm making you soup.

81
00:04:07,992 --> 00:04:09,348
I'll make you the bread once I'm done.

82
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:10,583
That's okay.

83
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,492
I'll do it myself.

84
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:12,328
Hm?

85
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,034
I'll spread the jam myself.

86
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:14,782
Really?

87
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,312
Well then, let me see.

88
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:20,895
Let’s see if the chef's son got skills.

89
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:23,335
Let me show you.

90
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:29,500
Phi.

91
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:31,548
Do you want the jam?

92
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:32,374
Yes, I do.

93
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,362
How about this?

94
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,614
Good.

95
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,014
But go a little to the left.

96
00:04:43,155 --> 00:04:44,038
Okay.

97
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,000
You will also get the taste of my hand.

98
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:52,843
Done.

99
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,597
Let's see.

100
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:57,309
Hey, that's quite good.

101
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:59,191
You've got skills.

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,542
Of course.

103
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:15,606
Hey.

104
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,050
I turned it off last night.

105
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:24,587
Oops.

106
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,884
Phi, is my phone malfunctioning?

107
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:28,567
Notifications keep popping up.

108
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,418
Can you check?

109
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:30,736
Here, let me check it for you.

110
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,048
It's not malfunctioning.

111
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,542
People from last night posted photos and tagged you.

112
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:39,615
Really?

113
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:40,571
Yes, photos from the party.

114
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:42,754
Let me read the caption for you.

115
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:46,661
‘Holy shit! Day’s made a comeback.’

116
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,633
‘You’re wicked as always, Day.’

117
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:00,972
‘I’m jelly! I want to be taken care of by Phi Mhok too.’

118
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:02,885
Oh, please.

119
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:05,604
You must have added that latter one yourself.

120
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:06,696
It's true.

121
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:08,696
If you don't believe me, you can read it using an app.

122
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:09,824
You making it up?

123
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:16,109
(‘I’m jelly! I want to be taken care of by Phi Mhok too.’)

124
00:06:17,398 --> 00:06:18,196
Fine.

125
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:20,741
You didn't add it.

126
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:21,838
Right.

127
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,394
You should post something too.

128
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:25,698
Your friends had missed you.

129
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:28,743
What should I post all of a sudden?

130
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,660
Photos of anything.

131
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:32,914
Really?

132
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:36,514
This can work. Your bread.

133
00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:37,726
Your breakfast.

134
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:38,561
This one?

135
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:39,330
Let me help.

136
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:41,674
Hold it here.

137
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:43,529
Turn on the camera.

138
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:47,335
You'll be the one taking.

139
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:49,114
Go ahead.

140
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:49,781
The frame is good?

141
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:50,982
Yes. Tap the shutter button.

142
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:51,978
One, two, three.

143
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:54,476
Let me see.

144
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,492
Is it good?

145
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:56,698
It's nice.

146
00:06:57,676 --> 00:06:58,654
The caption…

147
00:06:59,121 --> 00:06:59,716
Caption?

148
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:00,924
My bread-fast.

149
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,225
Hold on.

150
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,000
My bread-fast.

151
00:07:06,535 --> 00:07:07,260
Post it.

152
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:11,031
I just did.

153
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:11,739
Let me see.

154
00:07:13,593 --> 00:07:14,832
Yes. Good job.

155
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,911
(‘Day, who’s the other guy?’)

156
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:25,220
Come on.

157
00:07:25,473 --> 00:07:26,395
The fun is ruined.

158
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,001
(‘Day, aren't you coming to cheer for your friend?’)

159
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:38,341
Wait!

160
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:41,238
Gee has a game today.

161
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:43,704
Can you check? Is it right?

162
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,424
I think so. She checked in at a badminton court five minutes ago.

163
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:54,048
If this was a normal situation,

164
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:55,835
I'd be right on the bleachers for her.

165
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:58,511
We can make it a normal situation.

166
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,213
Do you want to go, Nong Day?

167
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,144
Phi Mhok here is going to take care of you.

168
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:06,982
Let's eat first.

169
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:09,227
Here’s your soup.

170
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:10,688
You eat the bread I made first.

171
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:11,188
Sure.

172
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:13,051
You eat the soup I made.

173

Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

174
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:53,314
Oh, wow.

175
00:08:53,455 --> 00:08:55,402
It's like I’m reading to my own kid or something.

176
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,826
Just do it.

177
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,347
Come on. Read.

178
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:00,505
I'm listening.

179
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:01,767
Quickly.

180
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,483
Last Twilight: Until The Last Light Goes Out.

181
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:18,000
Once upon a time, there was a kid named Mee.

182
00:09:18,762 --> 00:09:20,762
Mee was an ordinary child just like the others.

183
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:27,955
Until one day, a wicked wizard put a curse on her, causing her body to gradually fade away.

184
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,716
Mee was really sad.

185
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:36,632
She only stayed inside her room and refused to meet anyone.

186
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:40,314
However, one day, Mee couldn't stand her loneliness any longer.

187
00:09:41,036 --> 00:09:43,290
She decided to step outside her house.

188
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:52,065
Day, we're at the court.

189
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:58,137
Should we go on the bleachers?

190
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:00,490
Let's go.

191
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:04,704
Hello, Coach.

192
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:05,408
Hi, Mhok.

193
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:07,557
- Hello, Coach.
- It's Coach Aek.

194
00:10:07,557 --> 00:10:09,514
I'm glad you're here.

195
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:10,507
Let's root for Gee.

196
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:11,603
- Sure.
- Of course.

197
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:17,590
Mee went to the playground where she used to play with her friends.

198
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,846
However, no one could see Mee that day.

199
00:10:56,397 --> 00:10:58,397
Whoo-hoo!

200
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,150
Gee has just walked in.

201
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,208
How does she look?

202
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,743
I think she looks very confident.

203
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,204
She's trying to play it cool.

204
00:11:12,954 --> 00:11:14,447
It's a sport psychology.

205
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:15,643
To intimidate the opponent.

206
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:18,461
You know what?

207
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:22,504
When we were unknown players, we didn't have anyone cheering for us.

208
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:23,898
We were each other's support.

209
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:28,794
When we lost, we cried together with arms around each other's shoulders.

210
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,468
Oh, how I miss it.

211
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:38,476
I won't get to see those pictures again.

212
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:50,828
Hey, since we're here, I'll be your sports commentator.

213
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:52,184
Okay?

214
00:11:52,635 --> 00:11:53,391
Mhm.

215
00:11:58,043 --> 00:12:00,043
They're in the court now.

216
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:06,882
Gee is wearing a blue shirt, blue shorts, and light blue sports shoes.

217
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:09,133
Her badminton racket is…

218
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:11,255
bright green.

219
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,188
Why don't you just tell me her lips and eye colors too since you’re so specific?

220
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,274
A rally begins.

221
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:28,433
- Gee hits it.
- She hits it.

222
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:32,880
Yeah!

223
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,544
Oh.

224
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:34,597
It was a drop shot.

225
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:36,578
Gee earns the point.

226
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:39,279
Now that was too little information.

227
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,505
They hit and hit and hit.

228
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:44,149
What's the fun in that?

229
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,222
Well.

230
00:12:47,538 --> 00:12:48,918
I don't know how to play badminton.

231
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,615
I have no idea how to comment.

232
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,673
Gee prefers backcourt games.

233
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:59,599
She moves her opponent to the left and right.

234
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:08,819
Once her opponent is tired, she will do her drop shot.

235
00:13:11,234 --> 00:13:13,234
Yeah!

236
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,157
Wow, as if you can see.

237
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:25,662
I'll just listen to you instead.

238
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:43,994
I think her opponent can read her strategy.

239
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:45,652
The game is tighter now.

240
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,958
Gee isn't built for long games.

241
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:52,452
She becomes slower towards the end.

242
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:19,279
The deciding point.

243
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:10,535
Gee did it.

244
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:12,348
She won.

245
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:28,322
For Mee, even though no one saw her,

246
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:35,509
seeing everyone’s smiles and laughter was worth stepping out of her house.

247
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:45,158
You did so great.

248
00:15:45,355 --> 00:15:47,662
I was almost knocked off my game.

249
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:49,121
Even so, you are great.

250
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:51,802
- Thank you so much.
- You don't have to tell me. She's smiling so widely her eyes become smaller.

251
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:53,540
Bye.

252
00:15:53,832 --> 00:15:54,719
Gee is right in front of you.

253
00:15:56,804 --> 00:15:57,776
Ahem.

254
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,973
Day!

255
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:04,619
Ow!

256
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:05,987
Gee.

257
00:16:05,987 --> 00:16:07,241
You're all sweaty.

258
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:08,744
What? You can't stand a little sweat?

259
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:11,530
Gee.

260
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:15,066
Congrats.

261
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:17,600
Thanks a lot for coming.

262
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:19,690
I thought you wouldn't come.

263
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:22,070
Thank Phi Mhok.

264
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:24,000
He urged me to come.

265
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:26,119
You're awesome.

266
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:27,878
Thank you.

267
00:16:28,895 --> 00:16:29,882
What did you just call him?

268
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:31,541
Phi.

269
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:32,490
Why?

270
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:35,138
Last night, the pronoun was still polite and distant.

271
00:16:36,618 --> 00:16:37,646
What's up?

272
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:41,097
Should we Blame the Stars for this?

273
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:43,955
Damn you.

274
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:46,054
Blame the Stars, my ass.

275
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:47,523
Blame you.

276
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:48,337
What?

277
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:50,084
You're suddenly blushing.

278
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:52,001
I won't come to your next match.

279
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:55,452
No, I'm kidding.

280
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:56,483
I'll bring him.

281
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,002
You're awesome.

282
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,000
Since you're here,

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,594
how about we hit that Clay Hot Pot restaurant nearby?

284
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:03,743
Come on. I'm starving.

285
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:04,935
It's so hard to eat.

286
00:17:04,935 --> 00:17:06,407
Look at my eyes.

287
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,809
Let your Phi feed you.

288
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:09,943
Easy solution.

289
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:13,436
Should we go now?

290
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:15,174
Day.

291
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:21,534
Where have you been?

292
00:17:21,534 --> 00:17:22,404
August.

293
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:24,450
Gee, who is this?

294
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:26,269
August.

295
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:27,594
I asked, where the hell have you been?

296
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:28,532
Hey!

297
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:30,000
Calm, would you?

298
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:35,456
Phi Mhok, let's go home.

299
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:38,626
Phi Mhok, let's go.

300
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,268
Take me home.

301
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,825
Who is he?

302
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:57,356
August.

303
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,487
My badminton partner.

304
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:38,553
Who is he?

305
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:41,995
August.

306
00:18:43,276 --> 00:18:44,098
My badminton partner.

307
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:46,885
Come on.

308
00:18:47,148 --> 00:18:48,231
Let's take a photo.

309
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:50,959
Arms around each other's shoulders.

310
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,469
You're a team now.

311
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:54,402
Good.

312
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:55,142
Right.

313
00:18:56,362 --> 00:18:57,313
Done.

314
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,832
You can go now.

315
00:19:12,071 --> 00:19:13,015
Come on.

316
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:14,503
Give it a try.

317
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:16,950
Your playing style matches his.

318
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:18,925
And the rest already have their partner.

319
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:29,603
Yes, Coach.

320
00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:48,205
20-15.

321
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:51,698
Sorry.

322
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,602
I'm sorry. I…

323
00:21:06,428 --> 00:21:08,428
[Badminton Club]

324
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:28,814
Hey.

325
00:21:33,777 --> 00:21:35,041
You’ve practiced all night?

326
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:38,230
Mhm.

327
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:51,066
Take it.

328
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:58,273
They were sold in pairs.

329
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:13,880
Thanks.

330
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:17,108
You're wearing it now?

331
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,755
Take a shower first. You are messy.

332
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:22,957
It's okay. I'm wearing it now.

333
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:23,792
Fine.

334
00:22:24,504 --> 00:22:25,216
Let me help.

335
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,589
I look cool, don't I?

336
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:36,381
You do.

337
00:22:36,745 --> 00:22:37,985
But a bit less than I do.

338
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,695
You're pretty tough.

339
00:22:46,154 --> 00:22:46,985
That’s quite right.

340
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:51,956
After that day, we started to win.

341
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:54,089
We got to the finals.

342
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:55,131
We conquered championships.

343
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:56,774
We were enlisted on the national team.

344
00:22:57,737 --> 00:22:59,290
We were sent to compete in important matches.

345
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:07,412
Day, what's wrong?

346
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:11,502
Day, what's the matter?

347
00:23:12,286 --> 00:23:13,481
Day, tell me what's wrong.

348
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:14,347
Who would have guessed

349
00:23:15,057 --> 00:23:16,476
it’d be the last day

350
00:23:17,123 --> 00:23:18,341
I got to see him?

351
00:23:26,326 --> 00:23:27,029
Day.

352
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:30,383
Day.

353
00:23:31,937 --> 00:23:34,742
Day, calm down. Take it easy.

354
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:39,687
Like the doctor said, we'll get the eye donation one day.

355
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:41,458
Got it?

356
00:23:43,598 --> 00:23:44,186
Hm?

357
00:23:44,186 --> 00:23:48,616
Mom, don't tell anyone that I can't see.

358
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:51,456
I promise.

359
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:52,427
I promise you.

360
00:23:52,983 --> 00:23:54,178
Calm down.

361
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:59,503
Once I get the donation, everything will get back to normal.

362
00:24:05,382 --> 00:24:06,373
But today,

363
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:08,972
I must accept that

364
00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:16,867
we’ll never get back to the way we used to be no matter what.

365
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:23,526
Are you hungry?

366
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:30,198
That's your best consolation?

367
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:34,726
That's all I could come up with.

368
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,067
Someone like me.

369
00:24:40,384 --> 00:24:41,043
Come on.

370
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:43,770
You made me the bread this morning.

371
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:46,098
It's my turn to show you my skills.

372
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,629
How bold of you to compete with my mom.

373
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:02,956
Well, I just think maybe the judge has some love scores for me.

374
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:05,038
He does.

375
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:07,125
It’s below zero.

376
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:09,784
I'm freaking starving.

377
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:10,521
Will you hurry up?

378
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:22,329
Okay, taste this.

379
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:27,804
Fried Rice?

380
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:32,340
No.

381
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:34,339
It's called False Rice.

382
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:37,990
How come?

383
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,133
Here's the story.

384
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:48,300
I grew up with my big sister, just the two of us.

385
00:25:49,943 --> 00:25:53,217
One year, on her birthday, I didn't have any money to buy her a present.

386
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:56,027
So I made her Fried Rice out of anything left in the fridge.

387
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:58,697
But I’d never done it before.

388
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,101
I used newly cooked rice to fry and it came out too mushy.

389
00:26:02,173 --> 00:26:03,614
So she called it False Rice.

390
00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:08,543
Here. Your False Rice is ready, sir.

391
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:20,562
How is it?

392
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:23,788
Not bad

393
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,882
That's it?

394
00:26:26,636 --> 00:26:28,748
Come on. I put in so much effort.

395
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:32,194
If you want compliments from Chef Mhon’s son,

396
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,189
you must do better.

397
00:26:35,308 --> 00:26:36,816
Yes sir, Mr. Customer.

398
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,242
I'll practice and do better next time.

399
00:26:45,277 --> 00:26:46,004
Oh.

400
00:26:47,836 --> 00:26:49,780
You've never told me about your big sister.

401
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:08,219
Her name is Rung.

402
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:10,214
She died.

403
00:27:15,263 --> 00:27:16,180
Phi, I'm sorry.

404
00:27:16,895 --> 00:27:17,576
I didn't know.

405
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:20,114
Hey, it's fine.

406
00:27:25,012 --> 00:27:25,750
You know what,

407
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:27,906
she asked me to cook for her again.

408
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:31,940
But I said

409
00:27:32,522 --> 00:27:33,605
maybe some other day.

410
00:27:37,818 --> 00:27:41,383
Who would have thought that some other day would never come?

411
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:52,960
Exactly.

412
00:27:56,364 --> 00:27:57,141
Here.

413
00:28:03,445 --> 00:28:04,503
I changed it for you.

414
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,022
If you want to keep it, handle it with care.

415
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:14,165
So when you pick it up to look at it, it won't cut your fingers.

416
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,206
Dude, I have to go.

417
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:41,089
Sure.

418
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,432
See you.

419
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:45,199
Please do the roll call for me next time.

420
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:45,941
I'm skipping.

421
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:46,837
Hey, he's here.

422
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,208
See you, man.

423
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:05,958
Why are you here?

424
00:29:08,238 --> 00:29:09,122
You got some time?

425
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:11,164
Can we talk?

426
00:29:20,078 --> 00:29:21,720
Why did you choose to just disappear?

427
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:23,968
I was your partner.

428
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:25,550
That's the reason.

429
00:29:27,957 --> 00:29:29,827
I was scared you would partner with someone else.

430
00:29:54,906 --> 00:29:58,949
I guess you already knew why I disappeared.

431
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:02,704
Yeah.

432
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:05,017
But I don't get it.

433
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:07,437
Why did you choose to just disappear?

434
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:09,916
I was your partner.

435
00:30:10,335 --> 00:30:11,419
That's the reason.

436
00:30:14,023 --> 00:30:15,703
I was scared you would partner with someone else.

437
00:30:23,564 --> 00:30:27,386
I am sorry for wasting your time.

438
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:33,332
I thought I would recover.

439
00:30:37,194 --> 00:30:38,405
But now…

440
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,188
that won't be the case.

441
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,531
Here.

442
00:30:49,796 --> 00:30:50,913
Find yourself a new partner.

443
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:08,189
Keep it.

444
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,828
I’ve decided to play singles.

445
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:19,834
I don't want to partner up with anyone else

446
00:31:22,468 --> 00:31:23,408
but you.

447
00:31:37,907 --> 00:31:38,917
It's okay.

448
00:31:39,907 --> 00:31:41,094
I'll always be here for you.

449
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:54,507
But you told me you didn't like to run around the court by yourself.

450
00:31:55,068 --> 00:31:56,748
It's a good new experience.

451
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:01,414
Now when I play, I still think of you.

452
00:32:10,668 --> 00:32:11,603
May I?

453
00:32:12,668 --> 00:32:13,314
Of course.

454
00:32:22,978 --> 00:32:24,461
Do you remember that match in Singapore?

455
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,932
We agreed to find something to eat after the match.

456
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:29,504
I do.

457
00:32:29,996 --> 00:32:32,054
My mom even booked us a VIP dining room.

458
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:34,162
What a shame.

459
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:36,673
Are you busy today?

460
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:38,668
Should we go get something to eat?

461
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:45,290
I'd love to.

462
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:47,969
But I got something to do today.

463
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:48,955
I have to hurry back.

464
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:51,156
Let's do it some other day.

465
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:52,827
Okay.

466
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:54,659
Phi Mhok.

467
00:32:55,644 --> 00:32:56,405
Yeah.

468
00:32:57,658 --> 00:32:58,622
Let's go home.

469
00:32:59,139 --> 00:32:59,855
Already?

470
00:33:04,322 --> 00:33:05,348
I'm taking off then.

471
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:06,888
Goodbye, Day.

472
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,241
See you.

473
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:14,321
Hey, you're available today.

474
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:15,335
Why don't you go with him?

475
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,674
I've never eaten out with someone else.

476
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:23,512
You went to a party and drank alcohol.

477
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,839
That doesn't count.

478
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:27,737
I just…

479
00:33:28,229 --> 00:33:30,077
I don't want to do anything stupid in front of him.

480
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,644
August.

481
00:33:36,136 --> 00:33:37,560
Phi, what are you doing?

482
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,804
Be quiet.

483
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:43,402
Day is wondering if you're free this Saturday.

484
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,033
I am.

485
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:46,495
Okay.

486
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,370
Phi Mhok.

487
00:33:50,277 --> 00:33:51,184
That's it.

488
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:55,178
Let’s go.

489
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,714
You didn't even ask me.

490
00:34:07,053 --> 00:34:07,839
Or what?

491
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:11,638
Are you going to eat at home for the rest of your life, young master?

492
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,145
Hm?

493
00:34:14,646 --> 00:34:16,080
I'm not ready.

494
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:19,811
What if I make a mess in front of him?

495
00:34:21,202 --> 00:34:22,513
You can practice.

496
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:23,876
You've got a lot of time.

497
00:34:24,048 --> 00:34:24,839
Right?

498
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,487
Mhm.

499
00:34:33,384 --> 00:34:36,590
Here. Start with the first dish, spaghetti.

500
00:34:39,322 --> 00:34:41,248
I bet you're enjoying this.

501
00:34:44,254 --> 00:34:47,116
The second one, fried rice.

502
00:34:47,914 --> 00:34:49,914
You just want to tease me, don't you?

503
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,361
The last one, clear soup.

504
00:34:57,999 --> 00:34:59,999
You just want to see me make a fool of myself.

505
00:35:07,015 --> 00:35:11,428
Do you realize you have eaten three dishes without making a mess at all?

506
00:35:12,474 --> 00:35:13,735
It's no problem.

507
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,643
Well, well…

508
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:19,647
Because I'm in my house.

509
00:35:20,762 --> 00:35:22,836
Imagine I'm out.

510
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:25,401
I have no idea how many people will look.

511
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,514
Do you want to find out, Day?

512
00:35:48,502 --> 00:35:49,469
Hey.

513
00:35:49,863 --> 00:35:51,955
Do you want me to take your dirty clothes?

514
00:35:52,477 --> 00:35:53,935
I'm doing my laundry and…

515
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:56,927
Oh, wow.

516
00:35:57,452 --> 00:35:59,452
Look at you all dressed up.

517
00:35:59,818 --> 00:36:01,030
What is going on here, sir?

518
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:03,401
I'm taking him out to eat.

519
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:12,106
This is suspicious.

520
00:36:14,698 --> 00:36:17,166
I'm just taking him to practice eating out.

521
00:36:17,624 --> 00:36:19,361
He's meeting up with his friend for a meal.

522
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:21,843
Ah!

523
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:26,801
And do you really need to wear so much perfume?

524
00:36:27,944 --> 00:36:29,550
Well, the place we're going is fancy.

525
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:31,081
I need to look good, don't you think?

526
00:36:32,304 --> 00:36:33,694
Ah, is that so?

527
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,338
That's all?

528
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:37,736
Come clean, Mhok.

529
00:36:37,736 --> 00:36:38,801
I don't think you're telling the truth.

530
00:36:38,801 --> 00:36:40,112
What are you talking about?

531
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:43,170
Yeah? What's up?

532
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:44,841
- Just go.
- What's going on?

533
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:46,582
You can go.

534
00:36:46,877 --> 00:36:47,653
Mhok.

535
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:48,731
Leave.

536
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:49,833
Mhok.

537
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:50,617
Damn you.

538
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:05,778
We have arrived, Day.

539
00:37:12,252 --> 00:37:13,920
Hello. Welcome.

540
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:20,863
This place is nice.

541
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,954
It's good that I dressed up today.

542
00:37:27,523 --> 00:37:28,532
Are you wearing perfume?

543
00:37:30,674 --> 00:37:31,423
Do you like it?

544
00:37:34,446 --> 00:37:35,721
I can feel that you look good, but…

545
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,124
it doesn't suit you.

546
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,575
Did someone trick you into wearing it?

547
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:44,502
We're at the table.

548
00:37:44,502 --> 00:37:45,431
The chair is in front of you.

549
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:49,006
Wow. You just killed the mood.

550
00:37:49,491 --> 00:37:50,876
We're in a fancy restaurant.

551
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:52,845
Can you give me dinner vibes?

552
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:54,063
You're not at home.

553
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:56,295
You want dinner vibes?

554
00:37:56,763 --> 00:37:57,483
Mhm.

555
00:37:58,645 --> 00:37:59,437
Okay.

556
00:38:03,475 --> 00:38:05,175
Baby, just wait right here.

557
00:38:07,904 --> 00:38:09,061
Walk slowly.

558
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:11,480
Sit down, baby.

559
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,619
Okay?

560
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:15,074
That's enough.

561
00:38:15,262 --> 00:38:16,647
You're exaggerating.

562
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:18,005
Just go have a seat.

563
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:20,614
What?

564
00:38:20,737 --> 00:38:22,689
Didn't you just say you wanted dinner with a lover vibes?

565
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:27,619
Menu, please.

566
00:38:37,244 --> 00:38:40,992
Can you please wait a moment while my boyfriend is deciding?

567
00:38:44,186 --> 00:38:45,069
Of course.

568
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:47,590
Phi Mhok.

569
00:38:47,947 --> 00:38:48,877
What are you doing?

570
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,246
What do you want to eat?

571
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:54,693
I'll read you the menu.

572
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:57,961
Enough already.

573
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:58,698
You're giving me goosebumps.

574
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:00,779
Order whatever you want.

575
00:39:01,223 --> 00:39:02,393
I'll not complain anymore.

576
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:04,041
Baby.

577
00:39:04,214 --> 00:39:05,525
Stop it.

578
00:39:06,123 --> 00:39:07,704
Did I do something that upset you?

579
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:09,048
Drop it.

580
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:14,807
Let's start from the first dish, spaghetti.

581
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:18,973
Spaghetti?

582
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:33,409
It's good.

583
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:35,878
Day.

584
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,458
You don't have to be so tense when you eat.

585
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:41,690
Baby.

586
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:44,454
No matter how messily you eat, you're still cute.

587
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:45,431
Just eat.

588
00:39:47,868 --> 00:39:50,360
Please don't be in a relationship.

589
00:39:50,716 --> 00:39:51,710
I feel bad for your lover.

590
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:55,178
The next dish is…

591
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:57,814
Steak.

592
00:39:58,233 --> 00:39:59,398
That's your knife.

593
00:39:59,954 --> 00:40:01,634
Let's put the spoon here for now.

594
00:40:02,893 --> 00:40:03,958
Now try that, Day.

595
00:40:16,638 --> 00:40:17,586
Are you okay?

596
00:40:19,728 --> 00:40:23,242
When it comes with side dishes, it's hard to eat.

597
00:40:23,994 --> 00:40:26,708
I just don't remember where everything is.

598
00:40:27,872 --> 00:40:28,919
They are all over the plate.

599
00:40:29,756 --> 00:40:30,463
Day.

600
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:34,881
Try to imagine your plate as a clock face.

601
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:38,034
Okay.

602
00:40:38,034 --> 00:40:39,705
The steak is at the center.

603
00:40:41,504 --> 00:40:42,696
Your salad is at 10 o’clock.

604
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:46,321
Your mashed potato is at 2 p.m.

605
00:40:47,687 --> 00:40:48,366
Hey.

606
00:40:49,687 --> 00:40:51,201
Where did you learn this trick?

607
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,367
My preparation is far more than just putting on perfume.

608
00:40:57,554 --> 00:40:58,588
Now you're bragging.

609
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:00,164
Try it.

610
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:02,938
Fine.

611
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:03,851
Am I cutting the meat?

612
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:07,729
Hold your fork like this. You’re on a date.

613
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:08,809
Right.

614
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:10,681
How would I know that?

615
00:41:17,706 --> 00:41:18,894
What is it?

616
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:20,750
It's too long.

617
00:41:25,576 --> 00:41:27,052
And the last one.

618
00:41:28,184 --> 00:41:28,974
A cake.

619
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:30,916
A cake?

620
00:41:31,047 --> 00:41:31,791
Right.

621
00:41:32,062 --> 00:41:32,752
Whoa.

622
00:41:32,752 --> 00:41:33,513
Give it a try.

623
00:41:33,814 --> 00:41:39,321
I think if you could eat steak, which is hard, you can eat cake just fine.

624
00:41:40,238 --> 00:41:41,475
Just fine, huh?

625
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:43,924
This is the hard one.

626
00:41:45,204 --> 00:41:45,880
Why?

627
00:41:48,282 --> 00:41:50,681
The eating part isn't that hard.

628
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:03,896
Let me guess.

629
00:42:04,585 --> 00:42:07,721
You are looking at the cream on my mouth.

630
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,156
I just don't want to look bad in front of people.

631
00:42:13,363 --> 00:42:15,068
This is not bad, Day.

632
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:19,281
To be honest, I think you're so damn cute right now.

633
00:42:24,445 --> 00:42:25,608
Cute how?

634
00:42:26,593 --> 00:42:27,775
You should eat too.

635
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:28,571
Here.

636
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:30,266
I'll feed you.

637
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:37,615
You're just pretending to struggle.

638
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:40,194
I know you want me to feed you.

639
00:42:41,528 --> 00:42:43,241
You're all pretending.

640
00:42:43,568 --> 00:42:45,273
Here you go. Open your mouth.

641
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:47,181
You open your mouth.

642
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:48,700
Give it. I'll feed you.

643
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:53,611
Day. We just dropped it everywhere.

644
00:42:53,611 --> 00:42:55,515
And my mouth is a mess now.

645
00:42:56,463 --> 00:42:59,423
In that split second, Mee didn’t realize

646
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,521
that stepping outside of her dark room into the sunlight

647
00:43:03,116 --> 00:43:07,553
could gradually make her fading body become tangible again.

648
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:14,957
It's even messier now.

649
00:43:17,565 --> 00:43:18,158
Hey.

650
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:20,156
You can leave me here.

651
00:43:20,761 --> 00:43:23,106
I'll ask August to take me home.

652
00:43:53,443 --> 00:43:54,214
We’ve arrived.

653
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,612
Night is pretty generous.

654
00:43:58,612 --> 00:44:00,014
He let us take his car.

655
00:44:00,153 --> 00:44:01,532
He didn't even ask where we were going.

656
00:44:03,213 --> 00:44:05,803
Actually, Mom bought me this car.

657
00:44:06,615 --> 00:44:07,870
Hmm.

658
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:10,160
He takes very good care of your car though.

659
00:44:13,146 --> 00:44:14,929
You've been fooled by him too?

660
00:44:19,418 --> 00:44:20,433
Let's go.

661
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,064
Hey, let me help.

662
00:44:23,064 --> 00:44:24,797
Hold on. I'm coming to your side.

663
00:44:29,984 --> 00:44:30,810
Get up.

664
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:44,831
Day, we are entering the place.

665
00:44:46,295 --> 00:44:47,161
Yes.

666
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:48,792
The door.

667
00:44:58,394 --> 00:44:59,281
Let's take the couch.

668
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,439
See? He hasn't come yet.

669
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,610
I told you we didn't have to hurry.

670
00:45:10,646 --> 00:45:11,390
Hey.

671
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,236
You can leave me here.

672
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:16,389
I'll ask August to take me home.

673
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:25,319
Yeah, sure.

674
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,021
Will you be okay on your own?

675
00:45:27,487 --> 00:45:28,206
Mhm.

676
00:45:31,374 --> 00:45:32,342
Okay.

677
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:47,980
Here's your water, sir.

678
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:49,724
Thank you.

679
00:47:42,982 --> 00:47:44,060
August?

680
00:47:45,939 --> 00:47:46,861
It's me.

681
00:47:59,265 --> 00:48:00,326
He hasn't come yet?

682
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,664
I called but he didn't pick up.

683
00:48:08,664 --> 00:48:10,664
He's probably stuck in the traffic.

684
00:48:13,402 --> 00:48:14,657
It’s just how it is.

685
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,120
He's always late when we meet up.

686
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:49,169
Come on.

687
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:50,391
Come with me.

688
00:48:52,324 --> 00:48:53,255
To where?

689
00:48:53,752 --> 00:48:54,821
Just come.

690
00:48:55,504 --> 00:48:56,263
Let's go.

691
00:49:12,201 --> 00:49:13,176
Mind the door.

692
00:49:26,594 --> 00:49:28,159
Nice weather.

693
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:29,094
Yes.

694
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:30,641
Want to know where we are?

695
00:49:31,265 --> 00:49:32,296
I do.

696
00:49:32,513 --> 00:49:34,973
Then you must see it for yourself.

697
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:37,001
Hey, wait.

698
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:39,380
- Come on, Day.
- Don't leave me.

699
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,156
I'm right here. Just keep walking.

700
00:49:41,156 --> 00:49:42,491
Quickly.

701
00:49:42,786 --> 00:49:44,134
Chop-chop.

702
00:49:44,821 --> 00:49:45,939
Come on.

703
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,954
Are we there yet?

704
00:49:47,954 --> 00:49:48,696
What?

705
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:49,539
Are we there yet?

706
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:50,421
A bit further.

707
00:49:50,671 --> 00:49:52,174
Where does this lead?

708
00:49:54,298 --> 00:49:55,863
It leads to me right here.

709
00:50:01,293 --> 00:50:03,293
We're on the Memorial Bridge.

710
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,008
Ah.

711
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:11,942
When I was working as a technician, I came here a lot at night.

712
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,290
In front of you, there's another bridge.

713
00:50:13,503 --> 00:50:16,342
It’s the green bridge where people like to come and take photos.

714
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:19,201
You can see the Wat Arun from here.

715
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:23,205
It’s so beautiful.

716
00:50:24,106 --> 00:50:26,200
It's in the evening and the lights are on.

717
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:45,501
So.

718
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:46,989
You're smiling now, huh?

719
00:50:47,899 --> 00:50:49,899
Stop teasing me, Phi Mhok.

720
00:51:39,226 --> 00:51:41,692
Day, we’re at Pak Khlong Talat Flower Market now.

721
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,841
It’d be great if you could choose perfumes as well as places to visit.

722
00:51:55,722 --> 00:51:59,555
Usually, when my lovers were upset with me, I would take them here.

723
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:04,082
When they saw a bunch of flowers, they all felt better.

724
00:52:06,655 --> 00:52:08,127
Why are you telling me this?

725
00:52:10,729 --> 00:52:12,046
Are you feeling better?

726
00:52:20,902 --> 00:52:23,399
(Mee walked past a colorful flower field.)

727
00:52:23,826 --> 00:52:27,348
(A bright-colored flower was the one to greet her.)

728
00:52:27,442 --> 00:52:31,803
(It's when Mee realized that the curse was gone.)

729
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:01,220
Ah.

730
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:02,999
I know this flower.

731
00:53:04,316 --> 00:53:05,402
Hydrangeas.

732
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,354
Rung loved it.

733
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:08,339
Hold on.

734
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,926
If I'm not mistaken, this flower represents

735
00:53:12,704 --> 00:53:14,083
a heartless person.

736
00:53:17,276 --> 00:53:18,344
It's pretty accurate.

737
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:22,771
It has one more meaning.

738
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,102
It’s used to say thanks.

739
00:53:26,442 --> 00:53:27,550
Like,

740
00:53:28,761 --> 00:53:33,753
thanks for understanding and accepting my decisions.

741
00:53:40,168 --> 00:53:43,410
Do you know what flower that I like?

742
00:53:47,723 --> 00:53:49,071
Ah…

743
00:53:51,249 --> 00:53:52,272
Roses?

744
00:53:52,955 --> 00:53:54,212
No.

745
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,128
Carnations?

746
00:53:58,842 --> 00:53:59,874
No.

747
00:54:01,761 --> 00:54:02,829
Flamingo flowers?

748
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,122
Orchids?

749
00:54:07,229 --> 00:54:08,701
Are you going to get it right ever?

750
00:54:11,933 --> 00:54:12,860
What is it then?

751
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,939
I like sunflowers.

752
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:20,542
They're right in front of you.

753
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,308
Here.

754
00:54:26,178 --> 00:54:28,435
The flower that you like.

755
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:33,838
There are plenty of beautiful flowers.

756
00:54:34,118 --> 00:54:35,370
Why sunflowers?

757
00:54:38,631 --> 00:54:43,923
Sunflowers refuse to stay in the dark.

758
00:54:45,258 --> 00:54:48,097
They always look for sunlight.

759
00:54:49,876 --> 00:54:53,025
That's probably why I like them.

760
00:55:04,584 --> 00:55:05,932
You're pretty deep.

761
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:12,377
Do you want it? I'll buy it for you.

762
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,401
It's okay.

763
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,972
Even if you do,

764
00:55:24,805 --> 00:55:26,187
I can't see it.

765
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:30,163
Let it be with someone with good vision.

766
00:55:31,292 --> 00:55:32,795
It should be happier.

767
00:55:34,427 --> 00:55:35,256
Okay.

768
00:55:37,073 --> 00:55:38,244
This way.

769
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:39,574
This way, Day.

770
00:55:39,574 --> 00:55:41,455
Can you set it to landscape, Phi?

771
00:55:41,455 --> 00:55:42,275
Sure.

772
00:55:45,177 --> 00:55:45,939
Smile.

773
00:55:46,503 --> 00:55:48,006
One, two, three.

774
00:55:51,939 --> 00:55:53,162
Strike a pose.

775
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:01,860
Done.

776
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,674
Is it good?

777
00:56:02,836 --> 00:56:03,731
It's good.

778
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:12,913
Hey.

779
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,701
Can I ask you a favor?

780
00:56:25,651 --> 00:56:26,345
Excuse me.

781
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:29,453
Did anyone come here and look for that blind man over there?

782
00:56:29,577 --> 00:56:30,588
I have no idea, sir.

783
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:32,074
Oh, right.

784
00:56:32,074 --> 00:56:32,841
Thank you.

785
00:56:33,214 --> 00:56:34,158
Thank you.

786
00:56:42,312 --> 00:56:43,046
Day.

787
00:56:46,126 --> 00:56:47,081
How was it?

788
00:56:47,205 --> 00:56:48,224
I asked.

789
00:56:50,614 --> 00:56:51,587
No one came.

790
00:56:56,836 --> 00:56:57,646
Forget it.

791
00:57:03,363 --> 00:57:04,648
But I got you something else.

792
00:57:06,605 --> 00:57:07,475
What?

793
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:11,764
This.

794
00:57:14,808 --> 00:57:16,520
In case somebody could use a drink.

795
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,780
You even know that I don't want to go home yet.

796
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:36,193
Look.

797
00:57:36,721 --> 00:57:38,606
We practiced dining out so hard

798
00:57:38,787 --> 00:57:40,663
just to end up drinking beer just the two of us.

799
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,138
How sad.

800
00:57:45,466 --> 00:57:47,093
I was stupid

801
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,620
to think he really wanted to see me.

802
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,257
When, actually,

803
00:57:53,882 --> 00:57:55,509
he only said yes out of courtesy.

804
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,174
Why would you think that?

805
00:58:03,024 --> 00:58:06,515
Actually, he didn't want to partner with me.

806
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:11,032
But the coach matched us.

807
00:58:13,137 --> 00:58:15,013
It's like an arranged marriage.

808
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:19,812
But what was expected from us wasn't children, but championships.

809
00:58:34,108 --> 00:58:35,456
It's funny how, sometimes,

810
00:58:36,982 --> 00:58:42,585
we put our future in the hands of someone we barely know.

811
00:58:44,498 --> 00:58:46,498
I tried to befriend him,

812
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:52,696
asked for his name, what he liked, and what he didn't like.

813
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:56,972
When he's mad, I had to make it up to him.

814
00:58:57,533 --> 00:59:01,583
Because if I didn't, his anger would lead to us losing competitions.

815
00:59:22,081 --> 00:59:26,970
I know I said he should partner with someone else,

816
00:59:30,098 --> 00:59:31,446
but deep down

817
00:59:34,649 --> 00:59:35,904
I'm glad that…

818
00:59:37,585 --> 00:59:39,305
he hasn't found himself a new partner.

819
00:59:50,627 --> 00:59:52,285
If this wasn't about badminton,

820
00:59:53,532 --> 00:59:55,284
I would presume you're talking about your ex.

821
00:59:58,176 --> 00:59:59,073
Phi.

822
01:00:00,409 --> 01:00:04,276
Today when I was in that restaurant,

823
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,046
I felt like a heartbroken man.

824
01:00:20,055 --> 01:00:22,055
I guess I really like him.

825
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,939
It's such a shame.

826
01:00:43,805 --> 01:00:45,246
I should have told him sooner.

827
01:00:46,353 --> 01:00:48,353
When I was still able to see his face.

828
01:01:09,568 --> 01:01:10,322
Day.

829
01:01:13,459 --> 01:01:14,829
Actually, I…

830
01:01:29,514 --> 01:01:30,737
Stunned, aren't you?

831
01:01:31,394 --> 01:01:33,052
To know that I like August.

832
01:01:54,936 --> 01:01:56,128
I finished the beer.

833
01:02:02,235 --> 01:02:03,079
Come on.

834
01:02:03,452 --> 01:02:04,391
Let's go home.

835
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:06,269
Screw him.

836
01:02:22,734 --> 01:02:23,709
Day.

837
01:02:34,846 --> 01:02:36,101
Honestly,

838
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:39,939
I'm still not okay.

839
01:03:15,939 --> 01:03:17,939
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

840
01:03:18,499 --> 01:03:20,344
There is a running race next month.

841
01:03:20,344 --> 01:03:21,438
Would you like to join, young man?

842
01:03:21,477 --> 01:03:23,943
We can't see. How are we supposed to run, Master?

843
01:03:23,943 --> 01:03:26,119
Just pair up with someone with good vision,

844
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:27,572
so they can guide you the way.

845
01:03:28,459 --> 01:03:29,550
Do you like it?

846
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:30,708
I do.

847
01:03:34,854 --> 01:03:36,133
Would you like to have dinner with me?

848
01:03:36,133 --> 01:03:37,599
As your what?

849
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:40,239
What status do you want, Nong Day?

850
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:41,843
You're such a handsome man.

851
01:03:42,259 --> 01:03:43,389
You realize that?

852
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:44,734
And you've become a lot more handsome too, Phi.

853
01:03:46,983 --> 01:03:48,579
I came to see Day.
