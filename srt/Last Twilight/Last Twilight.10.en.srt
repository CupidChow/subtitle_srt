4
00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:19,694
Day.

5
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:22,071
It’s your dad.

6
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:23,375
Dad?

7
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:26,266
My dad left my mom for another woman.

8
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:29,480
She had to beg for food from someone else.

9
00:00:29,703 --> 00:00:32,442
If I could turn back time, I’d do just anything to make up for that.

10
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:34,185
I missed you.

11
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:35,974
I missed you, too.

12
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:37,959
I always have.

13
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:40,801
Did you get a chance to see the real last twilight?

14
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:44,266
The Last Twilight cover, the one with the beautiful mountain,

15
00:00:44,387 --> 00:00:45,618
it was taken at Veha Mountain.

16
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:46,800
It’s in the district nearby.

17
00:00:47,303 --> 00:00:48,180
Tomorrow…

18
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,259
can you take me to that Last Twilight mountain?

19
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:58,825
All I'm seeing now is gray clouds.

20
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:00,880
You deserve to see something better than this, Day.

21
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:01,922
I'm seeing it now.

22
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:03,739
This is it.

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,611
The last image I want to see.

24
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:16,502
Day.

25
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:29,558
Come with me.

26
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:39,508
Day.

27
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:50,537
Come here.

28
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:57,851
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

29
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:05,307
Alright.

30
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:16,079
The patient’s eyes show no response.

31
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:19,550
The implication of that result is...

32
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:22,001
I'm completely blind, aren't I, doctor?

33
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,676
I am sorry.

34
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:27,599
I am sorry, ma'am.

35
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:33,737
Day.

36
00:03:49,257 --> 00:03:50,567
It’s okay, Mom.

37
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:54,092
I’m okay.

38
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:26,801
Night, take your little brother to his room.

39
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:29,104
I will have a word with Mhok.

40
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:32,904
Mom.

41
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,033
Can you talk some other day?

42
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:36,323
It's been a long day.

43
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,163
Night.

44
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:42,159
Yes, Mom.

45
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:44,717
Let's go.

46
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:01,355
The last image that Day saw,

47
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,127
what was it?

48
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:19,388
It’s the sunset.

49
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:23,322
Was it beautiful?

50
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,899
It was very beautiful.

51
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:31,929
It's a shame.

52
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:33,761
You should have seen it, Mrs. Mhon.

53
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:53,531
At first,

54
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,162
I thought you wouldn’t last long.

55
00:05:58,427 --> 00:06:01,191
But somehow you managed to get Day out of his room.

56
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:05,620
Yes.

57
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:14,070
Do you recall what I told you to do on your first day of work?

58
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,997
My sole responsibility is to provide Day safety.

59
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,041
But you put him at risk.

60
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:40,400
Just because you can get him out of his room doesn't mean you can take him anywhere.

61
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:44,766
At the end of the day, Day is still my son.

62
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:04,042
It's my fault.

63
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,677
I…

64
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:13,127
I'd like to quit.

65
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:27,572
Go say goodbye to Day first.

66
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:36,853
Thank you.

67
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,304
Day, it's me.

68
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:10,474
What did Mom say?

69
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:35,875
She asked about the last image that you saw.

70
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:40,005
What did you say?

71
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:44,163
We went up the mountain to see the last light together.

72
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:46,924
And it was very beautiful.

73
00:09:04,874 --> 00:09:06,184
Please keep it safe.

74
00:09:13,508 --> 00:09:14,486
What do you mean?

75
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:19,307
Take it with you.

76
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,880
Tomorrow bring it here and read it to me again.

77
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:23,608
Day.

78
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:32,115
It's come to an end.

79
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:38,828
It's time you find yourself a new book.

80
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:45,395
No.

81
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:46,676
It's not the end yet.

82
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:48,088
I'm going to talk to Mom.

83
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:10,344
I made a choice.

84
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,178
And I have prepared for this

85
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,670
since the day we decided to leave.

86
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:22,850
Do you get it?

87
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:29,135
Then why didn't you try to stop me?

88
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,740
And if I told you not to be angry with your mom,

89
00:10:37,214 --> 00:10:38,524
would you be able to do that for me?

90
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:25,556
Mom, think this through.

91
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:27,474
Do you want him to lock himself behind his door again?

92
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,174
I'm losing him no matter what I choose to do.

93
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,401
At least I feel more comfortable knowing he's inside his room.

94
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:50,234
I'm sorry for everything I've done.

95
00:11:57,794 --> 00:11:58,531
Mom.

96
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:01,543
Day!

97
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,727
Do you want to know

98
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:15,606
what the last image that I saw was?

99
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:19,927
It’s Phi Mhok's face.

100
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:22,216
Do you get it now?

101
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:24,740
To me,

102
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:28,722
he isn't just a caretaker.

103
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,442
He's more.

104
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:50,662
I'm sorry.

105
00:12:56,286 --> 00:12:58,212
You have totally gone over the line with my son.

106
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:00,766
Get out of my house.

107
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:03,102
Mom!

108
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,405
I came to speak with you about a new caretaker.

109
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,576
So you think I can't take care of myself?

110
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:47,354
Didn’t you say you wanted other people to see me as a normal person?

111
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:25,144
Day, it's me.

112
00:14:27,252 --> 00:14:28,408
Are you hungry?

113
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,242
We have Garlic Pepper Pork with Rice and Clear Soup today.

114
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:33,429
Oh.

115
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:35,604
Have you seen my slippers?

116
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:36,970
I have.

117
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,742
They were dirty so I had them washed for you.

118
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:42,159
But I replaced them with a new pair.

119
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:45,363
Have you seen them yet? Where are they?

120
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:47,713
It's okay. I'll look for them myself.

121
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:50,785
Sure. Your food is on the desk.

122
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:52,613
Yes.

123
00:15:12,738 --> 00:15:13,655
All done.

124
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:15,847
Here.

125
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:18,486
And don't you ever bring it back to me again.

126
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:19,733
Sure.

127
00:15:20,288 --> 00:15:23,244
By the way, I fixed the glove compartment for you.

128
00:15:23,614 --> 00:15:26,942
Take good care of the car so Rung can rest in peace.

129
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,904
Thank you.

130
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:35,380
So Porjai told me you quit the caretaker job.

131
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:36,815
Mhm.

132
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,873
Have you thought of what to do with your life from now on?

133
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,496
I'm still a little lost, actually.

134
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:50,496
I don't know.

135
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:52,265
Right.

136
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,628
But don't take it too slow.

137
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,342
You still need to pay for gas.

138
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:02,760
Here's your key.

139
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:08,005
Thank you so much.

140
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:11,010
I'll see you around.

141
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:12,433
Goodbye.

142
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:13,310
Taking off now.

143
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:07,356
Hello, Phi Mhok.

144
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,338
(You free to talk?)

145
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:10,815
Of course.

146
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:14,907
But don't be surprised if the call gets cut off.

147
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:18,379
The new caretaker lost my phone charger.

148
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:22,580
That sounds familiar.

149
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:25,662
Should I be paranoid?

150
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:28,702
No one can stand me like you can.

151
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:31,456
Sweet talk. What do you want?

152
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,179
You can't give it to me even if I say it.

153
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:39,008
Why don't you try me?

154
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:45,208
I want you by my side right now.

155
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:51,630
The Moon is beautiful tonight, Day.

156
00:17:52,224 --> 00:17:53,642
(You wanna step out and see it with me?)

157
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:58,382
As if I can see it at all.

158
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:01,128
You can. Trust me.

159
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,156
(There you go. Do you see it now?)

160
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:20,039
Where? How can I possibly see it?

161
00:18:20,823 --> 00:18:22,130
But I see something.

162
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:24,783
An orange T-shirt.

163
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:26,739
Shorts.

164
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:28,279
A confused-looking man.

165
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,038
Hey, where are you?

166
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,995
Phi Mhok.

167
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:43,995
I got my car back.

168
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:49,266
That means you can take me out on a ride.

169
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:53,212
I'd love that.

170
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,302
It won't be for long. Trust me.

171
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:00,942
Mom will come round.

172
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:06,642
Mhm.

173
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:08,428
Hope so.

174
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:18,573
Phi.

175
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,011
I have to go. The battery is dying.

176
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:22,292
Okay.

177
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,185
Sweet dreams.

178
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:27,270
Sweet dreams.

179
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:05,325
Day.

180
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,161
Mom.

181
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:12,032
How long have you been here?

182
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:15,346
Long enough to hear everything.

183
00:20:19,548 --> 00:20:20,660
Why are you in my room?

184
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:25,318
I came to speak with you about a new caretaker.

185
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,577
Just stop.

186
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,196
Whatever you're doing is pointless.

187
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:35,923
I should be the one saying that exact sentence to you.

188
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:38,535
Why?

189
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,020
I don't get it.

190
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:44,034
Because Phi Mhok is a guy?

191
00:20:46,902 --> 00:20:52,982
Do you really think I don't know that you had a crush on August before?

192
00:20:58,108 --> 00:20:58,999
Day.

193
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:03,698
I just want to find a person who can really take care of you.

194
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:09,219
And what makes you think he can't do just that?

195
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:13,283
Take care of you with the salary I give him?

196
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:16,894
What if one day I'm not here?

197
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:18,850
Who will take care of you then?

198
00:21:24,094 --> 00:21:26,649
So you think I can't take care of myself?

199
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:36,583
Didn’t you say you wanted other people to see me as a normal person?

200
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:43,938
Then why can't I make decisions for myself?

201
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:50,034
Or maybe…

202
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:54,097
you never see me as a normal person.

203
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:01,955
Day.

204
00:22:04,618 --> 00:22:08,984
As long as you're under my care,

205
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,422
you need to listen to me.

206
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:18,812
Give it to me.

207
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:24,429
Once we get you a new caretaker, you can have it back.

208
00:22:25,662 --> 00:22:26,504
Mom.

209
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,197
Gosh! What are you doing?

210
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,030
Damn. It's hot.

211
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:56,320
What are you doing? You're setting the house on fire.

212
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,861
It's good you're here.

213
00:22:57,901 --> 00:22:59,208
I want your opinion on this.

214
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:02,737
How are you still in the mood for cooking?

215
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:05,178
What do you expect me to do?

216
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:09,234
Go out there and find a job.

217
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:13,299
She'll never hand her son to a jobless man.

218
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:22,323
I went everywhere and ended up with the same result.

219
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:26,576
Once they learned I was in prison, they turned me down.

220
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,854
And those who accepted me would pay ridiculously low.

221
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:37,102
Even if I work my freaking ass off, I'll never be able to take care of Day.

222
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:40,612
Wait.

223
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:46,687
The restaurant I work for is looking for a cook.

224
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:47,735
You should apply.

225
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:50,892
No. Why should I?

226
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,060
I'm a technician. What would I do there?

227
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,487
Give it a go first.

228
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:56,507
At least they pay a reasonable wage.

229
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:02,423
Nah.

230
00:24:03,865 --> 00:24:05,081
I don't want to be laughed at.

231
00:24:06,622 --> 00:24:08,733
I’ve felt embarrassed enough.

232
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:11,748
Damn you.

233
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:13,662
You could persuade Day to go running till he earned the medal.

234
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:17,534
But when it comes to your own business, you're such a wimp.

235
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:20,138
Let me try this.

236
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:22,426
See if it's worth setting the house on fire.

237
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,665
Hey.

238
00:24:29,358 --> 00:24:30,513
It's good.

239
00:24:30,513 --> 00:24:33,140
You apply for the job at my restaurant right now.

240
00:24:35,713 --> 00:24:36,687
It's so good.

241
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:42,672
Damn it.

242
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,803
It's me.

243
00:24:57,392 --> 00:24:58,865
Mom changed the Wi-Fi password.

244
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,103
I brought you food.

245
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:23,533
I'll leave it by the door next time.

246
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:26,995
But I just thought today was special.

247
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,256
This is all I can help you with.

248
00:25:58,842 --> 00:25:59,899
(Mom.)

249
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:01,813
(Cut him some slack.)

250
00:26:02,355 --> 00:26:04,105
Just do as I said.

251
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:09,417
No matter how many caretakers you bring in,

252
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,457
he won't change his mind.

253
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:15,068
And who forced me to do this?

254
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:19,072
So it's my fault?

255
00:26:20,248 --> 00:26:23,496
If you had taken care of your brother well enough, he wouldn't be like this.

256
00:26:30,777 --> 00:26:31,746
I'm sorry…

257
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,471
(...that I’m incapable of taking care of him.)

258
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:36,151
(I don't want your apologies.)

259
00:26:36,463 --> 00:26:40,432
I want you to help find a new caretaker.

260
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:05,342
Sorry, dude.

261
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:08,132
There is a lot going on in my house.

262
00:27:11,515 --> 00:27:13,293
Can you help run the club for the time being?

263
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:18,518
I'll help once everything here is sorted.

264
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:20,807
I’m sorry.

265
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,037
I will help with that from here.

266
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:29,364
Sure.

267
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,931
Again, sorry.

268
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:36,276
Hey, I gotta go.

269
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:38,468
I'll take a look at the account.

270
00:27:38,468 --> 00:27:39,453
Okay. Thank you.

271
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:44,214
Why did you come down?

272
00:27:45,027 --> 00:27:46,277
What do you need? I’ll grab it for you.

273
00:28:08,628 --> 00:28:09,822
Hold on.

274
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:12,119
The noodles are all mushy.

275
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,930
You didn't touch it so I brought it back down.

276
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:21,574
You can have mine. I'll eat yours.

277
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:35,349
Why didn't he send me the file?

278
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:42,174
Why don't you heat it up?

279
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:44,172
You wanna look cool?

280
00:28:54,137 --> 00:28:55,335
I don't want to look cool.

281
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,245
I just like to eat it this way.

282
00:29:05,547 --> 00:29:09,100
But you heated this one up so hot it burns my tongue, damn it.

283
00:29:10,872 --> 00:29:12,193
I thought it had already cooled down.

284
00:29:12,942 --> 00:29:13,871
Sorry.

285
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,128
Fine. I know.

286
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:20,549
I forgive you.

287
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,340
For everything.

288
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:54,352
Thanks.

289
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:07,445
Hey.

290
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:10,266
I met Dad.

291
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:15,866
He said I had his eyes. Is that true?

292
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:19,450
Lots of people say that.

293
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,741
You're a daddy's boy and I'm a mama's boy.

294
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:24,188
Yeah?

295
00:30:26,046 --> 00:30:27,727
Why does she only pamper me?

296
00:30:29,732 --> 00:30:33,063
Because you're a crying baby.

297
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:35,504
You cried a lot as a kid, remember?

298
00:30:38,131 --> 00:30:39,549
You were even whinier than me.

299
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:42,556
You're wrong.

300
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:44,668
You cried a lot more.

301
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:46,680
I always pranked you.

302
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:49,893
Asshole.

303
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:50,912
You wanna share mine?

304
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:54,600
You want me to spoon-feed you?

305
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:01,119
Isn’t it still hot?

306
00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:02,953
A little.

307
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:13,662
It's Christmas next week.

308
00:31:13,662 --> 00:31:17,841
It’d be so nice if my boyfriend was there to support me.

309
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:19,202
Who knows?

310
00:31:19,507 --> 00:31:20,959
If you're a good boy,

311
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:23,475
Santa might show up at your door.

312
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:47,369
(Hello.)

313
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:51,500
Come on, Phi.

314
00:31:51,841 --> 00:31:53,126
Took you so long to answer.

315
00:31:53,604 --> 00:31:54,930
Did you forget about me already?

316
00:31:57,063 --> 00:31:57,987
Sorry.

317
00:31:57,987 --> 00:31:59,381
I've been busy.

318
00:32:01,726 --> 00:32:02,611
Are you out?

319
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:06,429
No, I'm home.

320
00:32:07,974 --> 00:32:08,956
That's probably the TV.

321
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,908
Come on now.

322
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,850
You're not someone else's caretaker, are you?

323
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:17,904
Promise not to laugh if I tell you.

324
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:21,635
I'm currently working at the restaurant where Porjai works.

325
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:29,923
I just knew that washing dishes was a prerequisite for becoming a cook.

326
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:32,665
I wash so many dishes that my fingers are pruney.

327
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:34,799
I haven't got a chance to work with a pan yet.

328
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:38,032
Why did you keep it from me?

329
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:41,331
I didn't want to.

330
00:32:44,955 --> 00:32:48,227
I just wanted to be a cook first so that I could brag about it to you.

331
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:50,653
Wait for me, Day.

332
00:32:51,476 --> 00:32:55,914
I'll make your mom believe that someone like me can take care of you.

333
00:32:56,338 --> 00:32:56,948
Hmm?

334
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:01,902
Fine.

335
00:33:02,644 --> 00:33:04,035
On one condition.

336
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:05,981
You must answer my calls.

337
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,457
This is my new number. Save it.

338
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:11,765
Sure.

339
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,578
What should I save as your contact name?

340
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,350
That's up to you.

341
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,847
Mhok, take care of these too.

342
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:20,391
Sure.

343
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:23,294
Day, I gotta go.

344
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:24,696
I'm getting back to work.

345
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:26,413
Bye bye.

346
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:27,100
I miss you.

347
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:28,325
Bye.

348
00:33:43,144 --> 00:33:47,953
[Little Day, Big Mhok’s Boyfriend]

349
00:33:56,544 --> 00:33:57,170
Hold on.

350
00:33:58,283 --> 00:33:59,127
We should take a selfie.

351
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,180
Mom’s order.

352
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:04,340
We're done with the check-up.

353
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:06,538
The next doctor's appointment is next month.

354
00:34:07,864 --> 00:34:10,447
Look at me right now. Are you scared I'll run away?

355
00:34:11,192 --> 00:34:15,789
Well, the last time you ran from me, your sight wasn't much better than this.

356
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:18,622
Hey.

357
00:34:19,745 --> 00:34:21,822
I'm sick of Mom's food.

358
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,438
Can we stop by somewhere and grab something to eat?

359
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:27,030
Sure.

360
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:28,119
Really?

361
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:29,053
What do you want to eat?

362
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,450
Uh…

363
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:32,785
At Mhok's restaurant?

364
00:34:33,765 --> 00:34:34,459
Hey!

365
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:36,096
The news travels fast.

366
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,764
I cannot take you there.

367
00:34:38,764 --> 00:34:40,086
But someone can.

368
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:41,378
There.

369
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:42,589
Walking right toward you.

370
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:46,549
Day.

371
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:50,286
Phi Mhok, what are you doing here?

372
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,816
I took Porjai here for her prenatal care.

373
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,886
Wow. Small world.

374
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,423
What a happy coincidence.

375
00:34:58,777 --> 00:35:00,353
Wait. You called last night and set this up.

376
00:35:01,934 --> 00:35:02,829
Hey!

377
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,024
Wait a minute.

378
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:06,719
When did you two get so close?

379
00:35:08,851 --> 00:35:09,871
Whatever.

380
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:11,388
Don't worry about that.

381
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:13,866
I set this up for you.

382
00:35:13,907 --> 00:35:16,331
It's your job to take it from here.

383
00:35:24,779 --> 00:35:26,461
Your visa lasts until 7:00 tonight.

384
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:29,571
Don't be late again.

385
00:35:30,392 --> 00:35:31,510
I won't dare.

386
00:35:32,585 --> 00:35:33,366
We’re gonna go now.

387
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:36,124
Come on.

388
00:35:48,676 --> 00:35:49,749
Thank you.

389
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:52,292
You're welcome.

390
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,278
I'm tired of seeing those two as well.

391
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:56,909
I’d rather spend time taking care of my girl.

392
00:36:01,095 --> 00:36:02,539
Are you going to the OB-GYN Department?

393
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:04,003
I'll walk you.

394
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:06,567
It's okay.

395
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:07,837
Go see your girl.

396
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:09,438
This is my girl.

397
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:15,894
Who is?

398
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:21,422
Fern.

399
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,740
Hi, Night.

400
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:29,034
I brought you a patient.

401
00:36:29,246 --> 00:36:30,180
Of course.

402
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,129
Please take her to the department.

403
00:36:32,129 --> 00:36:32,798
Absolutely.

404
00:36:32,798 --> 00:36:34,904
This way, please.

405
00:36:34,904 --> 00:36:36,570
Slowly, please.

406
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,250
How many months?

407
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:39,401
Seven.

408
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,903
Please take care of her.

409
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,057
That's my child.

410
00:36:47,211 --> 00:36:48,575
Are you serious?

411
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,840
Since when?

412
00:36:52,048 --> 00:36:52,807
Just do it.

413
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:55,744
You can't see anymore. Why do you still need a check-up?

414
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,113
You're right.

415
00:36:57,457 --> 00:36:59,611
But the doctor insists on regular check-ups.

416
00:36:59,872 --> 00:37:02,667
So I'll be ready if someone donates their eyes.

417
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:06,945
Then I'll be your guide dog while you wait for that.

418
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:09,835
Where do you want to go today?

419
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:10,665
Woof, woof.

420
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:12,880
Why are you asking me?

421
00:37:13,516 --> 00:37:16,411
You asked me out on a date. You figure it out.

422
00:37:18,494 --> 00:37:19,323
A date?

423
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:20,823
Yeah.

424
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:25,848
Otherwise, what do you call it when two people in a relationship go out together?

425
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,812
What should we call it?

426
00:37:29,845 --> 00:37:30,842
How about this?

427
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:33,604
Let’s call it ‘You wanna check out Jasmines at my house?’

428
00:37:35,773 --> 00:37:37,170
Not with that intention.

429
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,874
Where are we going?

430
00:37:38,915 --> 00:37:40,173
That's harsh, Little Day.

431
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,027
Day, feel this one.

432
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:45,436
It's a pop-up book.

433
00:37:45,436 --> 00:37:46,695
Open it.

434
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:48,789
It’s this animal.

435
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,852
A rabbit?

436
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:53,317
Right?

437
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:54,646
That’s the correct answer!

438
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:57,527
How did they make it?

439
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:00,694
It’s awesome.

440
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:02,544
Wow!

441
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,352
This one is spectacular.

442
00:38:05,173 --> 00:38:05,986
Feel it.

443
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,444
I think you might like this painting.

444
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:39,857
There’s a mouth in the center,

445
00:38:39,857 --> 00:38:41,539
a heart on the lips,

446
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:44,050
and surrounded by a bunch of sunflowers.

447
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:45,243
Yeah?

448
00:38:45,243 --> 00:38:45,801
Yeah.

449
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:06,993
Hmm?

450
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:08,788
Why are you touching my lips?

451
00:39:09,498 --> 00:39:10,477
Are you looking at me?

452
00:39:13,975 --> 00:39:14,837
No, I’m not.

453
00:39:18,762 --> 00:39:20,126
You think you’re the only one who can do that?

454
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,290
I don’t.

455
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:25,521
See if there are people.

456
00:39:29,253 --> 00:39:30,250
No one here.

457
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:55,876
Why don’t you try pink?

458
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,647
Pink gradient.

459
00:39:57,647 --> 00:39:59,924
Day, there's some kind of workshop in front of us.

460
00:39:59,924 --> 00:40:00,690
Wanna check it out?

461
00:40:00,822 --> 00:40:01,598
Yeah.

462
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:02,849
Hey!

463
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,434
Day. Mhok.

464
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:05,414
What brought you guys here?

465
00:40:05,414 --> 00:40:08,987
- Honey, it's Day and Mhok.
- Master Aon. Phi Pla. Hi.

466
00:40:08,987 --> 00:40:09,882
Hi.

467
00:40:09,882 --> 00:40:10,710
Master?

468
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,518
Day?

469
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:12,966
Where are you?

470
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:20,873
I missed you.

471
00:40:20,873 --> 00:40:21,549
I missed you too.

472
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:22,335
How are you doing?

473
00:40:22,335 --> 00:40:23,222
I'm doing great.

474
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:25,891
What are you doing here, Master?

475
00:40:26,746 --> 00:40:29,673
I received a request to teach blind people how to paint at this workshop.

476
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:31,276
Cool, huh?

477
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:32,759
Come on.

478
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:35,250
I couldn't even paint well even when my sight was fine.

479
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:38,498
You don't believe that we can?

480
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:40,798
Then you must try.

481
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:44,223
Are you guys interested? We have some seats available.

482
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,658
Are you?

483
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:46,923
I am.

484
00:40:48,247 --> 00:40:49,850
Come on then.

485
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:50,575
Grab your seats.

486
00:40:51,086 --> 00:40:56,410
Okay. We'll be wearing blindfolds to better comprehend blind people.

487
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,787
Here.

488
00:40:57,986 --> 00:40:59,986
Master, you said we're going to paint.

489
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:04,730
Well, to taste the food, we must activate our taste buds first, right?

490
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,320
The same goes for this.

491
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,205
We must activate our imagination.

492
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:09,154
Right.

493
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:09,756
Cover your eyes.

494
00:41:09,756 --> 00:41:10,745
Wear your blindfold.

495
00:41:10,745 --> 00:41:12,031
Okay.

496
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:12,742
Music.

497
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:15,696
Dance along a little.

498
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,365
Don't be afraid.

499
00:41:17,365 --> 00:41:19,248
Let the music consume your body.

500
00:41:19,248 --> 00:41:20,821
Be free.

501
00:41:20,821 --> 00:41:23,052
Put your hands up if you want.

502
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:25,302
Hands up.

503
00:41:25,494 --> 00:41:26,810
You’re not dancing, Phi.

504
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,876
I’m dancing.

505
00:41:28,757 --> 00:41:30,254
Your body isn’t moving.

506
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,822
Mhok, come on.

507
00:41:32,822 --> 00:41:35,718
Yes, Mhok. Let’s dance.

508
00:41:35,977 --> 00:41:37,500
Just dance.

509
00:41:42,506 --> 00:41:43,870
Good.

510
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,449
Clear your mind.

511
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:47,105
Set it free.

512
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,963
Yeah!

513
00:41:49,476 --> 00:41:50,914
Go!

514
00:41:50,914 --> 00:41:51,900
Harder.

515
00:41:53,064 --> 00:41:54,112
You can paint now.

516
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,196
Your art paper is right here.

517
00:41:55,531 --> 00:42:00,658
These are special paints with unique scents so you can tell the difference.

518
00:42:01,944 --> 00:42:05,587
And how can we tell which color it is?

519
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,950
Hey, you don't have to know that.

520
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:11,419
You just smell the color and see what feeling it gives you.

521
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:15,433
Now, try it.

522
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:30,410
This one smells like cleanliness.

523
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:34,699
Remember that feeling.

524
00:42:34,939 --> 00:42:37,370
Mhok, I'm going to let you take it from here.

525
00:42:37,696 --> 00:42:38,649
Of course, Master.

526
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:41,233
Pla.

527
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,415
Pla, honey.

528
00:42:42,892 --> 00:42:43,687
Yes, honey?

529
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:45,222
Let's go. I'm done here.

530
00:42:45,222 --> 00:42:46,997
Alright. Let's check out that table.

531
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:47,781
Come.

532
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,731
That side.

533
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,250
Ready for the next color?

534
00:43:04,463 --> 00:43:05,356
How is it?

535
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,011
This one feels like…

536
00:43:09,177 --> 00:43:10,690
a sour fruit.

537
00:43:11,978 --> 00:43:13,819
Just thinking of it makes my mouth water.

538
00:43:15,213 --> 00:43:16,206
Can you guess what color it is?

539
00:43:17,717 --> 00:43:18,724
It's…

540
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:20,278
yellow?

541
00:43:21,868 --> 00:43:22,655
Not telling you.

542
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,117
Next color.

543
00:43:29,244 --> 00:43:31,580
Ooh!

544
00:43:33,218 --> 00:43:35,218
This one kind of reminds me of you.

545
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,864
What? Warm and nice?

546
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:39,101
Nope.

547
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:41,470
Evil and untrustworthy.

548
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:43,867
I knew you were going to say that.

549
00:43:45,377 --> 00:43:46,874
I'm kidding.

550
00:43:53,517 --> 00:43:54,378
Hey.

551
00:43:58,913 --> 00:44:00,218
Move on to the next color.

552
00:44:00,748 --> 00:44:01,973
This color is quite special.

553
00:44:02,927 --> 00:44:03,691
Smell it.

554
00:44:07,171 --> 00:44:12,170
This one has a refreshing and cheerful vibe to it.

555
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,530
It reminds me of the morning sun.

556
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:19,249
Hold on.

557
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:21,308
The scent is familiar.

558
00:44:22,474 --> 00:44:23,803
How is it not?

559
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:25,330
It's your favorite, Day.

560
00:44:27,314 --> 00:44:28,477
Try it if you don't believe me.

561
00:44:37,752 --> 00:44:39,013
I knew it.

562
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:41,347
You always get me this.

563
00:44:42,273 --> 00:44:43,929
Well, I want my boyfriend to be refreshed.

564
00:44:45,436 --> 00:44:46,629
Refreshed, huh?

565
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:49,185
Very much so.

566
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:51,095
Now let's start painting.

567
00:44:51,971 --> 00:44:53,441
What do you want to paint today?

568
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:58,086
Aon suggested anything close.

569
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,629
I can think of one.

570
00:45:01,629 --> 00:45:02,364
What?

571
00:45:07,554 --> 00:45:09,554
Found it.

572
00:45:15,362 --> 00:45:16,288
Make sure I look handsome.

573
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:17,733
Of course.

574
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:20,852
Okay.

575
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,332
Hey!

576
00:45:33,491 --> 00:45:34,689
What are you doing, Day?

577
00:45:36,532 --> 00:45:38,532
I don't remember what your nose looks like.

578
00:45:38,532 --> 00:45:39,959
That was intentional.

579
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:41,178
It was not.

580
00:45:41,178 --> 00:45:42,304
I'm serious.

581
00:45:42,483 --> 00:45:43,715
Let me check.

582
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:45,319
You’re so dead.

583
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:46,051
Don’t.

584
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:47,158
Phi Mhok.

585
00:45:47,396 --> 00:45:49,730
Don’t!

586
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:52,390
It's not 7:00 yet. Our visa hasn't expired.

587
00:45:53,644 --> 00:45:54,864
Let me take you home, Day.

588
00:45:55,644 --> 00:45:58,410
It's okay. Just call me a cab.

589
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:00,685
Or Mom might find out.

590
00:46:02,672 --> 00:46:04,837
So how was the first date with me?

591
00:46:05,075 --> 00:46:05,856
Did I pass the test?

592
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:08,195
Hmm…

593
00:46:09,568 --> 00:46:10,826
I need to think about it.

594
00:46:14,245 --> 00:46:15,930
It's Christmas next week.

595
00:46:16,379 --> 00:46:18,776
I'll be working in the cooking position for the first time.

596
00:46:20,446 --> 00:46:24,672
It’d be so nice if my boyfriend was there to support me.

597
00:46:29,283 --> 00:46:30,260
Who knows?

598
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:34,356
If you're a good boy, Santa might show up at your door.

599
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:38,207
Are you coming?

600
00:46:39,982 --> 00:46:40,612
No.

601
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:44,666
Are you coming?

602
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,783
I don’t know.

603
00:46:49,671 --> 00:46:50,403
Are you coming?

604
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,424
Maybe.

605
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:00,246
Will you please come, sir?

606
00:47:01,923 --> 00:47:02,890
Still not sure.

607
00:47:11,025 --> 00:47:12,011
You coming or not?

608
00:47:18,874 --> 00:47:19,756
Hey, it's me.

609
00:47:21,902 --> 00:47:22,718
How do I look?

610
00:47:23,062 --> 00:47:26,339
Listen. Mom wants to talk to you.

611
00:47:57,103 --> 00:48:01,783
Three, four, five.

612
00:48:02,406 --> 00:48:03,345
This is it.

613
00:48:03,961 --> 00:48:05,746
Striped long sleeves.

614
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:14,307
It's me.

615
00:48:16,103 --> 00:48:17,038
Good.

616
00:48:17,038 --> 00:48:17,962
Can you help?

617
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:25,195
Where's the front?

618
00:48:36,653 --> 00:48:37,552
How do I look?

619
00:48:38,653 --> 00:48:39,513
Good.

620
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:44,710
Listen. Mom wants to talk to you.

621
00:48:54,116 --> 00:48:56,036
She is preparing a special Christmas dinner for you.

622
00:49:01,603 --> 00:49:03,144
Day.

623
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:04,348
Have a seat.

624
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,040
You said there was an event to get to.

625
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:11,058
I canceled it.

626
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:14,289
It's a family day. Who would want to work?

627
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:24,756
I've been totally swamped with work this year

628
00:49:24,817 --> 00:49:27,460
and left you with lots of my frozen food.

629
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:30,707
But I made you a freshly cooked meal tonight.

630
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,138
You can feel it.

631
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:38,194
Merry Christmas, my son.

632
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:48,550
But I wasn’t a good kid this year.

633
00:49:54,401 --> 00:49:57,688
Well, I wasn't exactly a lovely mother either.

634
00:50:03,423 --> 00:50:06,013
Let's eat before the food gets cold.

635
00:50:06,013 --> 00:50:09,118
Here. It's your favorite.

636
00:50:09,118 --> 00:50:10,585
Try it.

637
00:50:16,242 --> 00:50:17,492
Be careful. It's still hot.

638
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:21,903
Let me blow it first.

639
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:26,175
Try it.

640
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,270
Eat all you can.

641
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:36,990
Mom, I'm meeting with some friends. I'm gonna take off.

642
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:40,604
Hey, where are you going?

643
00:50:41,715 --> 00:50:43,286
It's a family day.

644
00:50:52,322 --> 00:50:54,831
It's Beef Stew.

645
00:50:55,544 --> 00:50:56,767
Your favorite.

646
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:14,871
I thought…

647
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:19,470
everyone forgot

648
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:22,829
that Beef Stew is my favorite.

649
00:51:26,311 --> 00:51:27,658
How could I forget?

650
00:51:29,802 --> 00:51:30,750
You're my big brother.

651
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:36,308
Night.

652
00:51:39,417 --> 00:51:40,742
Eat with us first.

653
00:51:42,344 --> 00:51:44,156
You love Beef Stew too.

654
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,290
Let me get it for you, son.

655
00:51:57,639 --> 00:51:58,174
Here.

656
00:51:58,174 --> 00:51:59,371
It's your favorite.

657
00:52:00,155 --> 00:52:01,470
Try it.

658
00:52:02,156 --> 00:52:03,540
See if you still find it good.

659
00:52:12,111 --> 00:52:12,959
So?

660
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:15,708
It's good.

661
00:52:18,036 --> 00:52:20,036
Then eat, son.

662
00:52:31,097 --> 00:52:34,008
Let me get a piece of this steak for you, Night.

663
00:52:42,745 --> 00:52:44,209
Is someone crying?

664
00:52:46,865 --> 00:52:48,463
No. I'm not crying.

665
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:53,150
A crying baby.

666
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:55,901
Still as good as when you were a kid?

667
00:52:55,901 --> 00:52:56,917
Yes, always good.

668
00:53:00,863 --> 00:53:01,748
Eat more.

669
00:53:01,748 --> 00:53:03,533
Can you pass me the salad?

670
00:53:03,855 --> 00:53:04,790
Yep.

671
00:53:48,044 --> 00:53:49,470
It’s all mushy.

672
00:53:56,865 --> 00:53:57,793
Mom!

673
00:53:58,671 --> 00:54:00,403
It's all over your mouth.

674
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:01,877
Oops!

675
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:06,190
It's so messy.

676
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:07,470
You’re messing it up.

677
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:08,048
Hey!

678
00:54:08,852 --> 00:54:10,870
I told you it wasn't easy.

679
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,264
Let me cover your eyes.

680
00:54:19,273 --> 00:54:20,067
Hey!

681
00:54:20,651 --> 00:54:22,230
I told you I could do this.

682
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,062
Mom!

683
00:54:40,689 --> 00:54:41,565
Mhok.

684
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:43,037
I'm headed home now.

685
00:54:44,075 --> 00:54:46,075
Of course. I can clear the rest.

686
00:54:46,206 --> 00:54:47,268
Right. Thanks a lot.

687
00:54:47,268 --> 00:54:48,856
My kid is waiting to celebrate with me.

688
00:54:48,856 --> 00:54:50,858
- Sure. Goodbye.
- Bye. See you.

689
00:54:52,068 --> 00:54:52,942
Merry Christmas.

690
00:55:27,262 --> 00:55:28,538
[Little Day, Big Mhok’s Boyfriend]

691
00:55:39,515 --> 00:55:41,113
If you called to order food,

692
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:43,872
please know that the restaurant is closed.

693
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,314
(I'm sorry, Phi.)

694
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:49,043
(Change of plan. I’m celebrating with Mom.)

695
00:55:50,078 --> 00:55:51,435
(Please don't be mad.)

696
00:55:53,764 --> 00:55:54,509
No.

697
00:55:55,313 --> 00:55:56,193
I understand.

698
00:55:58,008 --> 00:56:00,222
I'll be a better boy next year.

699
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:02,435
Maybe Santa will be nicer to me.

700
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:06,364
(Let's say Santa is listening.)

701
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,719
(What would you ask from him?)

702
00:56:10,702 --> 00:56:11,959
Um…

703
00:56:15,523 --> 00:56:19,470
I probably ask for you to be by my side right now.

704
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:25,642
(The Moon is beautiful tonight. Don't you think?)

705
00:56:27,114 --> 00:56:28,524
(Step out and take a look.)

706
00:56:42,606 --> 00:56:43,519
Day.

707
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:46,724
Merry Christmas.

708
00:56:53,045 --> 00:56:53,897
What about your mom?

709
00:56:55,264 --> 00:56:57,511
I told her I'd go celebrate it with Gee.

710
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,252
And I took a cab here.

711
00:57:02,796 --> 00:57:03,938
But…

712
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:07,351
I guess I've come to the wrong place.

713
00:57:13,511 --> 00:57:14,841
You've come to the right place.

714
00:57:15,884 --> 00:57:18,500
I reserved you the best table, Mr. Customer.

715
00:57:19,488 --> 00:57:20,416
Please come in.

716
00:57:27,951 --> 00:57:28,786
Have a seat.

717
00:57:30,743 --> 00:57:31,720
Can you get this?

718
00:57:45,376 --> 00:57:47,376
I thought I was ditched.

719
00:57:49,538 --> 00:57:51,833
Does this restaurant let their customers sit all alone?

720
00:57:59,641 --> 00:58:01,239
If I sit with you,

721
00:58:01,746 --> 00:58:03,350
it won't be as an employee here anymore.

722
00:58:03,707 --> 00:58:05,117
What do you want to be then?

723
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,878
I want to be having dinner with my boyfriend.

724
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,504
Can we do that?

725
00:58:20,238 --> 00:58:21,200
I guess we can.

726
00:58:22,126 --> 00:58:23,376
We practiced it before.

727
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:35,802
I cooked all of this.

728
00:58:42,807 --> 00:58:44,164
You're making me nervous.

729
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:50,155
Since I started cooking, the top chef's son has never given me compliments.

730
00:58:55,689 --> 00:58:56,441
What's wrong?

731
00:58:56,602 --> 00:58:57,528
Is it bad?

732
00:58:58,019 --> 00:58:58,772
No.

733
00:59:00,019 --> 00:59:08,261
But I think there's one negative feedback on this dish.

734
00:59:09,628 --> 00:59:10,353
And that is?

735
00:59:14,216 --> 00:59:16,216
You should've made it a long time ago.

736
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:21,487
Alright.

737
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:24,467
If you like it, eat all you want.

738
00:59:25,951 --> 00:59:27,090
And don’t tense up.

739
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:31,171
You're still cute no matter how messily you eat.

740
00:59:33,766 --> 00:59:36,034
Just eat and stop talking.

741
01:00:12,633 --> 01:00:14,633
I think I get what you said now.

742
01:00:15,377 --> 01:00:16,217
What is it?

743
01:00:16,994 --> 01:00:22,308
A moment so good that you want to live in it forever.

744
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,470
It is real.

745
01:00:26,955 --> 01:00:28,312
Didn't know you were a romantic.

746
01:00:31,633 --> 01:00:34,150
You haven’t even got Santa's present yet.

747
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:35,747
Hey!

748
01:00:36,122 --> 01:00:37,088
Really?

749
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:40,267
Does that mean I'm a good boy?

750
01:00:41,445 --> 01:00:42,593
You are a good boy.

751
01:00:44,067 --> 01:00:44,919
Close your eyes.

752
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:49,813
Don't peek.

753
01:00:52,544 --> 01:00:53,635
Are your eyes closed?

754
01:00:53,956 --> 01:00:55,053
They are.

755
01:00:56,943 --> 01:00:57,951
Open your eyes.

756
01:00:58,807 --> 01:01:00,619
Ta-da.

757
01:01:01,296 --> 01:01:03,216
You like it? Is it pretty?

758
01:01:03,883 --> 01:01:05,670
I painted it myself.

759
01:01:07,136 --> 01:01:10,030
You will think of me when you wear it.

760
01:01:14,575 --> 01:01:15,373
Day.

761
01:01:20,975 --> 01:01:22,910
I'm the one who asked him to come, ma’am.

762
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:30,055
The hospital called.

763
01:01:30,232 --> 01:01:31,589
We got the eye donation.

765
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,121
It’s as if I won the lottery jackpot.

766
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,786
The chance is less than 1%

767
01:02:07,025 --> 01:02:08,945
It’s going to be okay, Mrs. Mhon.

768
01:02:08,945 --> 01:02:10,391
Did Mom say something to you?

769
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:13,830
I just want someone who can literally take care of Day.

770
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:18,014
Being a boyfriend and a caretaker are different.

771
01:02:18,381 --> 01:02:23,008
Don’t you think it’s my fault that I can’t take care of you?

772
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:25,283
Are you excited?

773
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:25,966
Yes, Doctor.

774
01:02:25,966 --> 01:02:27,524
Let’s open your eyes now.

775
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,152
Slowly.
