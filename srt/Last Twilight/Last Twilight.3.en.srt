Who’s that?

5
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:21,080
It’s me.

6
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:22,920
Your new caretaker.

7
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,123
Where is my phone charger?

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,869
Leave.

9
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:26,148
- Leave my room.
- Hold on.

10
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:27,480
- Go.
- What?

11
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:28,728
Give yourself time.

12
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:32,200
It isn’t easy to spend time with someone with no visual impairment.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,957
What's your vision like?

14
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:36,522
If I look close enough, I can blurrily see.

15
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:37,793
How close?

16
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:38,634
One span.

17
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:40,238
Hi, Day.

18
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:41,632
When did you get back from the States?

19
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:43,902
Hey!

20
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:44,648
Day.

21
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:47,240
I didn't know you'd be here.

22
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,072
At least you have money, a house, a family who cares about you.

23
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:52,249
You wanna trade then?

24
00:00:52,913 --> 00:00:56,160
Give me your eyes and take everything I have.

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,802
Out of nowhere, he just blindfolded himself.

26
00:00:58,277 --> 00:00:59,855
He’s slept and eaten here.

27
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:00,859
You want to be blind?

28
00:01:01,388 --> 00:01:02,680
I just want to understand.

29
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,277
You think you’d understand me by doing this?

30
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:07,308
No more loneliness, Little Day.

31
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:22,229
It’s completely healed.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,817
I told you I’m fine.

33
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:27,057
Just a small wound.

34
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:29,201
Here.

35
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:34,178
Are they comfortable?

36
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:37,814
They’re so-so.

37
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,382
Should we get started then?

38
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:48,790
Ow!

39
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:50,881
It suddenly hurts.

40
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,385
Oh, please.

41
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:57,253
Don’t be such a baby.

42
00:01:58,044 --> 00:01:59,166
And I’m sleepy.

43
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:01,281
I’ll just go to sleep.

44
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:06,000
Hey! Wake up.

45
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:08,899
You said if I lasted longer than a week, you’d do it.

46
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:10,961
Hey.

47
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:14,768
Or I’ll just carry you.

48
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,296
Okay.

49
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:18,126
I’m getting up.

50
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:18,626
Okay.

51
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:20,614
I’m up.

52
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:21,235
Up.

53
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:22,104
Okay.

54
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,231
It doesn’t hurt anymore?

55
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:26,341
The pain is just gone.

56
00:02:29,342 --> 00:02:30,799
Start with these.

57
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:32,250
Throw away what you don’t use.

58
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,128
Okay.

59
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:35,063
Here’s the first one.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,200
Hey. This is my phone charger.

61
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:39,843
This one?

62
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:40,942
It is.

63
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:42,140
You use it a lot.

64
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,357
Put it in the top drawer.

65
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,648
This one.

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,605
My earphones.

67
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,193
Right.

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,407
Where will you keep it?

69
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,229
The second drawer from the top.

70
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:57,873
Memorize it.

71
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:01,080
Let's get your clothes organized now. Sort them by colors.

72
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,320
That way, it's easy for you to find.

73
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:06,426
Oh, shit.

74
00:03:07,994 --> 00:03:08,883
Hey.

75
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:11,367
Are you sure you’re a badminton player, not a model?

76
00:03:11,523 --> 00:03:12,980
You have a closet full of clothes.

77
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,424
Well, I like to dress up.

78
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:16,330
Yeah? You do?

79
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:18,727
You don’t dress up when you’re with me.

80
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:19,897
You just wear whatever.

81
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:22,585
And why do I need to dress up for you?

82
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:23,586
Well.

83
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:24,687
No reason.

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,707
Ready?

85
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,256
We’re gonna have a test.

86
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,959
Phone charger.

87
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,064
That’s right.

88
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,276
Earphones.

89
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:35,603
Here.

90
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:38,320
That’s a speaker.

91
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:40,971
Well, it can make noise too.

92
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:42,409
It can.

93
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:43,532
But you can’t put it in your ear.

94
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:49,029
I can use it like this.

95
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,161
Sunglasses.

96
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:58,510
Can you find them?

97
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,234
Where are they?

98
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:07,282
What?

99
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:08,676
What are you doing?

100
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:11,359
Whose sunglasses are these?

101
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,144
Mine.

102
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:13,330
I wear them to work.

103
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,225
Let me see.

104
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:17,480
Are they mine?

105
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,322
They’re mine.

106
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:20,560
Stop hassling me.

107
00:04:24,736 --> 00:04:26,404
Whoa. These are mine.

108
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,138
Are you sure?

109
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,222
Of course, I am.

110
00:04:30,222 --> 00:04:30,876
Look.

111
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:35,351
Definitely.

112
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:39,477
Hey, your green shirts are on the fourth shelf.

113
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:41,420
Okay.

114
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:53,053
Oh please, little bro.

115
00:04:53,445 --> 00:04:54,619
Don’t force it.

116
00:04:56,388 --> 00:04:58,388
Big bro, I didn’t ask for your opinion.

117
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,680
Don’t butt in.

118
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:10,573
That’s my hand.

119
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:11,820
Sorry.

120
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,622
Long sleeves in cream.

121
00:05:16,231 --> 00:05:17,447
No.

122
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:19,633
I think it’s a white shirt with cartoon printing.

123
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,133
You can kick me if I’m wrong.

124
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:22,583
Game on.

125
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,710
You become quiet.

126
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:29,840
Where should I kick you?

127
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:31,679
Relax, young man.

128
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:32,696
Keep the foot to yourself.

129
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:34,850
That was practice.

130
00:05:35,272 --> 00:05:36,661
The next one is real.

131
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:38,938
Bring it on. I’m ready.

132
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:40,835
Are you done?

133
00:05:41,197 --> 00:05:42,000
Hold on.

134
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,696
Hey.

135
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,000
This is interesting.

136
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:54,989
You have a spaceman costume?

137
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,999
This one.

138
00:05:57,712 --> 00:05:59,350
Are you sure it’s mine?

139
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:02,687
Hey.

140
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,160
What is this?

141
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:07,492
It’s an inflatable dinosaur costume.

142
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,196
There are two of them.

143
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:13,401
How come you even have them?

144
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,007
Ah!

145
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:17,277
They’re party costumes for the badminton club.

146
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,800
‘Back in Time’ theme.

147
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:19,875
Wow.

148
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:20,964
So far back.

149
00:06:22,155 --> 00:06:23,371
Do you want to keep them?

150
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,051
I doubt you can still wear them.

151
00:06:27,313 --> 00:06:29,870
We will see about that.

152
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,382
Does it fit?

153
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:46,640
Yes, it does.

154
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:48,329
Come on.

155
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,190
Add more feelings, will you?

156
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:56,845
Rawrrr!

157
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,910
You happy now?

158
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,708
You can't even see. What are you laughing at?

159
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,814
I’m gonna kick you.

160
00:07:07,616 --> 00:07:12,360
Though I can't see, I remember how funny this costume was.

161
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:15,181
Yeah?

162
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:17,560
You want it to be funnier?

163
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:22,206
Come on.

164
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:23,579
Hey, slow down.

165
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:24,655
The stairs.

166
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:25,155
Oh, shit.

167
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:25,655
Sorry.

168
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:27,035
Watch the stairs.

169
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:27,907
Come on.

170
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,052
One more step.

171
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,108
- People can see us.
- Keep walking.

172
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:33,483
See what?

173
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:34,456
It's your house.

174
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:35,322
No one will see this.

175
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:39,075
You're in front of your house now.

176
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,353
What?

177
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:41,111
Ready?

178
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:41,753
For what?

179
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,580
One, two, three.

180
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:46,933
Hey.

181
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,645
Hey, where are you?

182
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:52,909
Where are you? Show yourself.

183
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:58,240
You wanna play this, huh?

184
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:12,000
Are you pranking me?

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,184
I'm not.

186
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:20,272
Come on, Day.

187
00:08:23,815 --> 00:08:25,302
Look at you falling already.

188
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:26,667
You can’t fight me.

189
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,600
You’re a noob.

190
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,473
Let's fight.

191
00:08:30,294 --> 00:08:31,359
Where are you at?

192
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:31,949
Come.

193
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,837
Hey!

194
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:37,509
You're tough, huh?

195
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,778
I surrender.

196
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:59,309
I surrender. Hey!!

197
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Let go.

198
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:13,611
Tired already?

199
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,407
How are you?

200
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,997
Tired.

201
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:25,545
That was good.

202
00:09:26,694 --> 00:09:28,567
I haven't felt tired like this in a long time.

203
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:39,967
Oh, hey.

204
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:41,578
Can you help me with something?

205
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:42,462
Sure.

206
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:48,399
Here.

207
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,717
Can you help take photos?

208
00:09:53,422 --> 00:09:55,663
Aon told me to keep taking photos.

209
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:58,724
So that when I eventually receive the eye donation, I can look back at them.

210
00:10:04,408 --> 00:10:06,000
You wanna look back at my face, huh?

211
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:08,440
Oh, please. That's enough.

212
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,605
Let me just do it alone.

213
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm kidding.

214
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:14,048
Give it here. I’ll take it for you.

215
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:19,394
Pose.

216
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:20,757
The camera is already set on you.

217
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:21,541
Where is it?

218
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,675
Okay.

219
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:29,203
One, two, three.

220
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:32,626
One, two, three.

221
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,427
How do I look?

222
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,120
Handsome?

223
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:39,269
Nice.

224
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:44,560
It's hot out here.

225
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:03,977
Hey.

226
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:04,477
What?

227
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:05,064
Mom’s home.

228
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,174
Take me back to my room right now.

229
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:09,317
Mom’s home.

230
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:10,416
Alright, calm down.

231
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:12,311
Come on.

232
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:13,873
Don't let her see me like this.

233
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:14,976
Come on then.

234
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,625
Watch the stairs.

Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

236
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:00,501
The traffic was horrible.

237
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:01,905
Night.

238
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:03,760
Can you get me a glass of water?

239
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,664
Sure, Mom.

240
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,271
Hi, Day.

241
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:08,088
What are you doing downstairs?

242
00:12:12,183 --> 00:12:13,145
Hi. Mom.

243
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:15,631
Why didn’t you ask Mhok to come get whatever you wanted?

244
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,492
I eat downstairs now.

245
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:22,726
Eating in the bedroom attracts ants.

246
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:27,204
Day, here’s your American Fried Rice.

247
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:29,233
Sauce?

248
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:30,894
It’s fine.

249
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:31,858
I’ll get it myself.

250
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:40,777
Hello.

251
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:04,853
Sit down.

252
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:33,268
Oh, Mom.

253
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:36,000
I requested an interruption of study on Day’s behalf.

254
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:40,280
But his professor will not approve it unless Day requests it himself.

255
00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:41,487
Yeah?

256
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,239
When will that be, Day?

257
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,541
You know I don’t want to go.

258
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:48,547
Why not?

259
00:13:48,914 --> 00:13:51,155
It should be done in no time. I’ll take you.

260
00:13:51,818 --> 00:13:52,608
No.

261
00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:59,051
Day, if you don't go, everything you've studied will be wasted.

262
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:00,862
Come with me. I’m taking you.

263
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:03,282
So?

264
00:14:04,705 --> 00:14:06,886
You're speaking as if I’m returning to university.

265
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:10,249
I'm going to be in this state for a long time.

266
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,720
Day, where are you going?

267
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:19,340
Day.

268
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:22,548
Eat first.

269
00:14:23,616 --> 00:14:25,857
Day, don’t go yet. Eat first.

270
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:28,999
Day.

271
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:45,360
Hey, it’s me.

272
00:15:08,518 --> 00:15:09,824
I saw it on your phone.

273
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:13,670
You don’t want to go because you don’t want to meet your friends, right?

274
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:23,602
Hey.

275
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,496
Why don’t you keep in touch with them?

276
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,558
I think they want to see you.

277
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,625
My university friends,

278
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:40,731
when we ate together,

279
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,008
we’d always split the bill equally.

280
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:46,437
Until one day,

281
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:49,731
one of our friends’s family went bankrupt.

282
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,840
We all felt pity for him.

283
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:58,899
We didn’t let him chip in ever again.

284
00:16:01,846 --> 00:16:02,831
I just…

285
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:06,229
don’t want to be like him.

286
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,796
Come on.

287
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:17,472
If they are real friends,

288
00:16:17,472 --> 00:16:18,642
there’s nothing to be afraid of.

289
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:21,050
Come on.

290
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:23,793
You should be the one who gets him the most.

291
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,269
Why?

292
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:29,792
When you were in prison,

293
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,826
did any of your friends come visit you?

294
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:37,336
Just you.

295
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,138
Damn right.

296
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:42,685
And you broke up with me in front of the correctional officer.

297
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:44,560
How coldhearted you were, Mhok!

298
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,619
I don’t know.

299
00:16:50,162 --> 00:16:51,693
I guess I was just afraid.

300
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,701
I felt like my life was worthless.

301
00:16:55,883 --> 00:16:57,220
All I saw in people’s eyes was insult.

302
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:00,000
That’s why I didn’t want to drag anyone down with me.

303
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,582
Here I am.

304
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:04,835
It was a long line.

305
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:07,655
That’s why I’m in heaven with him now.

306
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,604
I can only carry two glasses.

307
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:11,800
Sorry.

308
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:15,706
Keng, this game is difficult.

309
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:16,671
Can you play it for me?

310
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:18,108
I sure can.

311
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:19,936
Watch me.

312
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:20,746
Yep.

313
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,131
So sweet that I wanna puke.

314
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:25,336
What? We’re just in love.

315
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:28,500
Porjai.

316
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,845
You can bring your boyfriend but you can’t let him play.

317
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:32,014
You’re cheating.

318
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:33,329
What?

319
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:34,376
Who’s cheating?

320
00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:40,130
Hubby and wifey are counted as one.

321
00:17:42,112 --> 00:17:43,220
What the heck are you saying?

322
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:44,853
Look.

323
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:46,327
Ta-da.

324
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,503
Damn!

325
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:49,958
Since when?

326
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:52,320
Why didn’t you tell me?

327
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:54,000
It’s not official yet.

328
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:56,222
I need to save up a bit more.

329
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,959
Once I’m ready, you’ll be the first to get my invitation card.

330
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:01,786
Sounds good?

331
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:07,987
You’re great.

332
00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:12,345
Crap. I’m losing money again.

333
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:17,595
Thank you for your contribution to our wedding, sir.

334
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,701
Hey, it’s me.

335
00:18:25,118 --> 00:18:26,229
Your breakfast is ready.

336
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:36,909
Why are you in the uniform?

337
00:18:37,512 --> 00:18:38,965
I’m quitting university once and for all.

338
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,273
So we don’t have to talk about this again.

339
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:47,720
Hey.

340
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,298
Hm?

341
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:50,070
Can you help me with something?

342
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:51,303
Sure.

343
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:52,939
Taking pictures?

344
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:54,335
No.

345
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:56,760
Can you…

346
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:05,433
Lean forward.

347
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:06,124
Okay.

348
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:10,618
You seem tense.

349
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:14,160
You said you’re a technician who can do anything.

350
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:17,790
I can do anything, alright.

351
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,360
It’s whether the customer likes my work or not.

352
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,667
Damn! You’re a knockout.

353
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:37,078
You like it?

354
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:39,839
I can’t see it.

355
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:41,217
You tell me.

356
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,626
You like it?

357
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:52,773
It’s alright.

358
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,110
Just alright?

359
00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:05,174
When your mom hired me, she didn’t say I had to do your hair too.

360
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:09,374
Let’s go. We’re done.

361
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:11,314
We are?

362
00:20:11,465 --> 00:20:12,227
Um.

363
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,258
Come on. You look good.

364
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,422
Okay.

365
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,058
I'm looking for a book.

366
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,732
It's a novel.

367
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:32,600
Called Last Twilight.

368
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,483
I know a second-hand bookshop.

369
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,074
It's at Chatuchak Market.

370
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:36,929
Interested?

371
00:20:37,313 --> 00:20:38,440
Chatuchak?

372
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,829
Whoa.

373
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,468
Decent vibes.

374
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:12,312
Not for a tech college student like me.

375
00:21:14,615 --> 00:21:16,448
Can I have my sunglasses?

376
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:19,934
Here.

377
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,533
Where are we going?

378
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:25,933
The chancellor’s building.

379
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:27,429
We’re right in front of it.

380
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:28,672
Then this is it.

381
00:21:29,964 --> 00:21:30,650
Wanna get in now?

382
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:34,434
Stairs.

383
00:21:40,105 --> 00:21:41,192
How have you been, Day?

384
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:42,446
Long time no see.

385
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:45,820
I heard you wanted some time off and focus on badminton for now.

386
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:51,448
I’m here to quit, sir.

387
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:07,244
I’m going blind.

388
00:22:10,102 --> 00:22:13,595
At first, I thought it was going to be better.

389
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,905
But now…

390
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,195
My only hope is to get new eyes.

391
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:24,495
I'm sorry.

392
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:26,808
I knew it.

393
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:31,846
Someone like you wouldn't just disappear unless it's necessary.

394
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,095
Are you signing the approval for me?

395
00:22:41,164 --> 00:22:41,813
Yes.

396
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:43,759
I am.

397
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:45,119
But

398
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:48,064
I'm allowing a break only.

399
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:54,145
But I don't know when I'm going to get the surgery.

400
00:22:55,316 --> 00:22:56,612
That’s right. You don't know.

401
00:22:57,588 --> 00:22:58,985
It might happen tomorrow.

402
00:22:59,454 --> 00:23:00,057
Right?

403
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:01,036
Who knows?

404
00:23:03,275 --> 00:23:04,129
But, sir.

405
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:05,066
Day.

406
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:07,500
Listen to me.

407
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,448
Can I please tell you a story?

408
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:16,249
You know.

409
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,891
I recently found out I have liver lesions.

410
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,051
We must live with hope, Day.

411
00:23:34,932 --> 00:23:35,737
How about we do this?

412
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:38,680
You and I…

413
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:42,429
fight this together.

414
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,514
Okay?

415
00:23:53,071 --> 00:23:54,261
Okay, sir.

416
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:07,797
The stairs.

417
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:09,018
Two more steps.

418
00:24:15,618 --> 00:24:16,118
Hey.

419
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:18,983
Since we are at your university,

420
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,677
why don’t you give me a tour?

421
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:30,341
There's a place I want to go.

422
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:42,047
What are you looking for?

423
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:45,227
I'm looking for a book.

424
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:47,915
Can you go ask her for me?

425
00:24:48,512 --> 00:24:49,315
What?

426
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:51,009
Why don't you do it yourself?

427
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:52,827
You're the one with the details.

428
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:57,589
Please help me.

429
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,149
The class was dismissed so late.

430
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:02,930
Gee, are you going to Coach Aek’s party?

431
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:05,261
I don't know. But everyone in the badminton club goes.

432
00:25:05,261 --> 00:25:06,036
What about August?

433
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:07,614
No idea.

434
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:10,057
Let's grab something to eat. I'm starving.

435
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:12,277
Let's go. That class was forever.

436
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:23,910
They're gone.

437
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:31,448
They’re really gone.

438
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:39,776
I get you now.

439
00:25:41,226 --> 00:25:42,098
I'll go ask the librarian for you.

440
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:43,715
What book do you want?

441
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:47,576
It's a novel.

442
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:50,480
Called Last Twilight:

443
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,278
Until the Last Light Goes Out.

444
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:55,908
Last Twilight.

445
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:57,619
Okay.

446
00:25:58,382 --> 00:25:59,124
Wait here.

447
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,978
Hello. How can I help you?

448
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:14,768
I'm looking for a book called Last Twilight.

449
00:26:18,298 --> 00:26:19,417
Sorry. We don't have it here.

450
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:21,748
Thank you.

451
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,109
Hey.

452
00:26:28,642 --> 00:26:29,347
They don't have it here.

453
00:26:31,363 --> 00:26:32,578
It's probably rare.

454
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:34,697
- Yeah?
- Um.

455
00:26:35,907 --> 00:26:36,760
That's okay.

456
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:45,393
Seriously, do you love reading that much?

457
00:26:47,326 --> 00:26:48,033
I do.

458
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:50,329
I’m a Faculty of Journalism student.

459
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,626
It’s just normal to read a lot.

460
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:55,263
Actually,

461
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:59,246
I want to open my own tiny bookstore.

462
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:02,364
But…

463
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,917
And who said books were only for reading?

464
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,172
Hm?

465
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:36,201
Hey.

466
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,338
Which one do you like?

467
00:27:39,445 --> 00:27:40,344
I'll borrow it for you.

468
00:27:44,522 --> 00:27:45,318
It's okay.

469
00:27:46,022 --> 00:27:47,738
I don't like people reading to me that much.

470
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:49,321
The feeling isn't right.

471
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,585
Then why did you ask me to read to you that day?

472
00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:56,243
You like to hear my voice or what?

473
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,322
No.

474
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:03,520
You know what?

475
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:08,079
Ever since I became blind, I've had this superpower.

476
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:12,110
I can tell what kind of person you are just by listening to your voice.

477
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:16,877
What kind of person am I?

478
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:20,702
(Read my lips.)

479
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:22,448
(You're an asshole.)

480
00:28:27,148 --> 00:28:28,099
Is that clear?

481
00:28:29,613 --> 00:28:30,662
It is clear, boss.

482
00:28:33,856 --> 00:28:34,485
Hey.

483
00:28:34,805 --> 00:28:36,555
Is there still a vending machine on the right?

484
00:28:39,703 --> 00:28:40,317
There is.

485
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:41,576
Are you thirsty?

486
00:28:42,578 --> 00:28:44,112
It's my favorite vending machine.

487
00:28:46,947 --> 00:28:47,818
You want something to drink?

488
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:49,353
We're here in front of it.

489
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,060
That's funny.

490
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,153
I can't see. How can I get a drink?

491
00:28:53,282 --> 00:28:54,749
It's all fine.

492
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,217
It's like picking a mystery box.

493
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:58,312
Let's do it. It's on me.

494
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:00,845
Go for it.

495
00:29:08,507 --> 00:29:09,968
They're all in the same color.

496
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:16,900
Did I get a green tea?

497
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,261
If you want to know, smell it.

498
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:31,730
It smells nice.

499
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,300
Honey?

500
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:34,876
Honey lemon green tea.

501
00:29:44,431 --> 00:29:46,239
Just a taste that I missed.

502
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:49,416
At least something good happened today.

503
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,482
Hey.

504
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:56,877
Why do you want that book?

505
00:29:58,556 --> 00:29:59,633
Aon recommended it.

506
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:02,204
He said it suited me.

507
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,395
I needed to read it in my lifetime.

508
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:11,448
I know a second-hand bookshop.

509
00:30:12,472 --> 00:30:14,472
They have every book in this country.

510
00:30:14,627 --> 00:30:15,338
Interested?

511
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,651
It's at Chatuchak Market.

512
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,518
Chatuchak?

513
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,865
Come on. Since you are already out.

514
00:30:22,986 --> 00:30:23,849
And you also have me.

515
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:24,410
Nothing to be afraid of.

516
00:30:31,862 --> 00:30:32,597
What do you say?

517
00:30:32,853 --> 00:30:33,499
Wanna go?

518
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,133
If they don't have it, we’re gonna have a problem.

519
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:42,062
Should we go?

520
00:30:42,489 --> 00:30:43,079
Let's.

521
00:30:48,591 --> 00:30:49,823
Nice weather today.

522
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:58,955
This is the first time I've been in a fitting room with someone else.

523
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:01,888
Do you think I have before?

524
00:31:04,575 --> 00:31:05,248
Hey.

525
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,385
Here’s the screen.

526
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:30,152
Here?

527
00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:30,716
Yeah.

528
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,090
This station?

529
00:31:39,061 --> 00:31:40,282
I don't know. Take a look yourself.

530
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,451
I got it.

531
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:44,833
This one, right?

532
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:45,483
Insert the coins.

533
00:31:49,852 --> 00:31:51,852
Hey, we’re going down the escalator.

534
00:31:52,356 --> 00:31:53,332
Take a step with me.

535
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:54,107
Okay?

536
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:58,159
Three, two, one. Go.

537
00:32:00,248 --> 00:32:01,545
We should have taken a taxi.

538
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,785
Come on. Don't you know taxis in Bangkok?

539
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:07,207
“I just ran out of gas. I can't take you.”

540
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:08,883
“I need to return the car.”

541
00:32:09,563 --> 00:32:10,152
Right.

542
00:32:10,152 --> 00:32:11,280
This is what works best right now.

543
00:32:14,903 --> 00:32:15,952
We're inside the car.

544
00:32:23,713 --> 00:32:24,577
Where are you going?

545
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:27,117
To ask for your seat.

546
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:28,753
That's okay.

547
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:31,968
My eyes don't work well but my legs do just fine.

548
00:32:38,186 --> 00:32:40,712
Stay close to me. That's all I need.

549
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,662
So I can tell where you are.

550
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:49,146
Okay.

551
00:33:14,183 --> 00:33:14,944
Hey.

552
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:16,472
Have we arrived yet?

553
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:18,516
Let me see.

554
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:24,086
There are a bunch of people with elephant pants and lots of shops.

555
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:26,937
So yes, we have arrived at Chatuchak.

556
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:27,934
Yeah?

557
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:30,090
Should we go inside?

558
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:36,529
I want to shop.

559
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:41,669
Take one step up.

560
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:47,561
On your right, they're selling jeans and shorts.

561
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:49,936
Want to take a look?

562
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:52,060
I want some shirts.

563
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,362
Shirts?

564
00:33:53,772 --> 00:33:55,207
Just right in front. They're selling shirts.

565
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,066
Come on.

566
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:56,881
Let's go.

567
00:33:57,062 --> 00:33:58,003
Watch your step.

568
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,302
I think this clothes rack is for you.

569
00:34:08,998 --> 00:34:10,575
Please have a look.

570
00:34:10,575 --> 00:34:12,069
Buy one get one free.

571
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:17,102
Look at you.

572
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,244
You’ve never shopped for clothes before or what?

573
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:24,072
Ever since I was like this, I haven't.

574
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:28,099
I think this one is pretty.

575
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:48,361
Hey.

576
00:34:49,177 --> 00:34:51,550
I think this one fits you.

577
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,401
Plain color. Thin fabric. You can wear it at home.

578
00:35:00,629 --> 00:35:01,738
Are you trying to prank me?

579
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:06,605
The word ‘asshole’ I just said, I really meant it.

580
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:08,894
Too bad.

581
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:09,933
How did you know?

582
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:12,481
Oh, please.

583
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:13,870
Look.

584
00:35:14,188 --> 00:35:15,408
The color is so bright.

585
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:17,230
I can see it from Mars.

586
00:35:18,094 --> 00:35:19,044
Who would wear this?

587
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:20,366
Take it back.

588
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,458
But it's really nice.

589
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:23,278
How about you try it on?

590
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:24,629
No.

591
00:35:24,629 --> 00:35:26,856
Try it on first. It's pretty.

592
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:28,185
Take this one too.

593
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:29,714
Buy one get one, she said.

594
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:43,842
Ah…

595
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:48,899
This is the first time I've been in a fitting room with someone else.

596
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:51,745
Do you think I have before?

597
00:35:53,127 --> 00:35:54,463
Here. Hold this.

598
00:36:05,153 --> 00:36:05,753
Here we go.

599
00:36:11,258 --> 00:36:12,072
Is it on the right side?

600
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:13,338
It is.

601
00:36:20,202 --> 00:36:20,821
Done.

602
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,312
How do I look?

603
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,204
Are you sure you want this one?

604
00:36:28,495 --> 00:36:30,232
The printing is…

605
00:36:30,232 --> 00:36:30,969
Ah.

606
00:36:31,634 --> 00:36:33,078
The seller told me.

607
00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:34,190
Why?

608
00:36:34,823 --> 00:36:36,221
I think it suits me.

609
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:37,548
Not good?

610
00:36:40,103 --> 00:36:40,828
Good.

611
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,573
I’ll take this one then.

612
00:36:45,026 --> 00:36:45,606
Okay.

613
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:47,796
Let me change back.

614
00:36:54,502 --> 00:36:55,152
Hold this.

615
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,563
Here, let me help.

616
00:37:12,636 --> 00:37:13,381
Excuse me.

617
00:37:56,513 --> 00:37:57,085
Hey.

618
00:37:59,396 --> 00:38:00,079
Hm?

619
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:04,816
I think I’m gonna wear that last one.

620
00:38:09,981 --> 00:38:10,655
Sure.

621
00:38:25,963 --> 00:38:26,560
Hey.

622
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:29,050
It’s buy one get one free.

623
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:30,937
Can I have the other one?

624
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:34,770
Sure.

625
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:36,794
But I'm choosing it for you.

626
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:39,599
Okay.

627
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:44,892
Do I look good now?

628
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,352
Yes, you do.

629
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:49,431
Please.

630
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:51,491
This shirt is pink like Pink Milk.

631
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:52,687
Who would want to wear it?

632
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:54,464
Whatever.

633
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:56,705
I already bought it for you. Wear it.

634
00:38:57,584 --> 00:38:58,768
It's going to ruin my bad-boy image.

635
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,762
Hey, Mhok.

636
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:01,927
You're back to selling clothes?

637
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:02,696
Hi, bro.

638
00:39:02,696 --> 00:39:03,643
No.

639
00:39:04,137 --> 00:39:05,031
We're in front of the bookshop.

640
00:39:06,232 --> 00:39:08,267
Bro, I'm looking for a book.

641
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:10,056
It's a novel.

642
00:39:10,622 --> 00:39:11,400
What's it called again, Day?

643
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:13,549
Last Twilight.

644
00:39:13,957 --> 00:39:14,832
Do you have it here?

645
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,745
Last Twilight?

646
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:17,701
Do you?

647
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,612
I think I have one but it's going to take a while to find it.

648
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:26,609
Do you want to come back later?

649
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:27,392
I'll keep it for you.

650
00:39:30,762 --> 00:39:31,387
Alright, then.

651
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:36,296
Nah! No later.

652
00:39:36,296 --> 00:39:37,127
We want it today.

653
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:38,757
We won't leave until we find it.

654
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:39,501
What?

655
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:40,542
Let’s go hunt, Day.

656
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:43,286
Where is it? Lead the way.

657
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:44,276
Today?

658
00:39:44,276 --> 00:39:44,906
Yes.

659
00:39:44,906 --> 00:39:45,530
We will search.

660
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,923
Why so eager?

661
00:39:46,923 --> 00:39:48,867
Try looking at the back.

662
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:49,867
The back.

663
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:51,985
Yes. Keep walking. I'll help you.

664
00:39:52,285 --> 00:39:53,356
Slow down.

665
00:40:08,427 --> 00:40:09,508
Have you found it, Mhok?

666
00:40:09,735 --> 00:40:10,767
I have not.

667
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:14,911
Day, do you know what the book looks like?

668
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:20,592
Aon said there's a sunset on its cover.

669
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:22,743
Ah. Okay.

670
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:25,424
Where is it?

671
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,483
Please have a look, ma’am.

672
00:40:29,353 --> 00:40:31,262
Just let me know which one you like.

673
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,017
This one is good, too.

674
00:40:57,424 --> 00:40:58,563
It's one of the best sellers.

675
00:41:28,882 --> 00:41:29,976
I think this is it.

676
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,469
Yeah? Let me see.

677
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:37,646
You guys found it?

678
00:41:37,646 --> 00:41:39,624
Last Twilight. Hey! You’ve found it.

679
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:41,696
Let me see.

680
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,539
Yes!

681
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:46,097
This this the one.

682
00:41:46,391 --> 00:41:47,442
You’re good.

683
00:41:47,442 --> 00:41:48,989
Mhok, shame on you.

684
00:41:49,595 --> 00:41:50,437
On you, too.

685
00:41:52,884 --> 00:41:54,314
Holy crap.

686
00:41:55,403 --> 00:41:56,139
Is it the wrong one?

687
00:41:57,022 --> 00:42:00,733
No, but the last page is missing.

688
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:02,896
The former owner must have torn it.

689
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:04,241
What?

690
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:06,901
How will we know the ending then?

691
00:42:09,682 --> 00:42:11,818
That's okay. I'll take this one.

692
00:42:12,412 --> 00:42:15,152
By the time I finish it, I think I can already find a new one.

693
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:16,831
Are you sure?

694
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,832
Fine, it’s your call.

695
00:42:21,186 --> 00:42:22,015
Let me hold it.

696
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,296
How much is it?

697
00:42:25,573 --> 00:42:28,275
I usually sell it at 350 baht.

698
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:29,882
But you are Mhok’s friend.

699
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,294
You get a special price, 500 baht.

700
00:42:32,432 --> 00:42:34,273
Haha. That's hilarious.

701
00:42:34,273 --> 00:42:35,037
You're funny, bro.

702
00:42:35,037 --> 00:42:36,696
He owes me 200 for booze.

703
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:39,554
Okay then. Let's say 300.

704
00:42:40,038 --> 00:42:40,690
Okay.

705
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:42,386
You wait here.

706
00:42:42,766 --> 00:42:43,731
I’ll get some water for you.

707
00:42:45,424 --> 00:42:47,003
Excuse me. Please get out of the way.

708
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,613
Make the way, please.

709
00:42:49,613 --> 00:42:50,615
Move.

710
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:19,330
So is your new tee comfortable?

711
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:21,635
A lot more comfortable.

712
00:43:23,748 --> 00:43:24,770
Hey.

713
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:25,862
Do we still have that drink?

714
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:35,512
Here. I opened the lid for you.

715
00:43:44,445 --> 00:43:45,421
Should we go get more drinks?

716
00:43:45,421 --> 00:43:46,445
There’s a shop right out front.

717
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:49,545
Are there lots of people?

718
00:43:50,315 --> 00:43:51,363
I’m kinda tired.

719
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,158
Let’s do this.

720
00:43:59,853 --> 00:44:00,866
You wait here.

721
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:02,285
I’ll get some water for you.

722
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:03,629
Here?

723
00:44:03,629 --> 00:44:05,098
Yes. Is that okay?

724
00:44:06,027 --> 00:44:07,436
It's fine. You're standing on the sidewalk.

725
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:09,481
Not many people here.

726
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:10,613
I'll be right back.

727
00:44:10,613 --> 00:44:11,544
Rest here.

728
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:28,487
What do you want to eat tonight?

729
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:30,668
What do you want?

730
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:32,618
Should we buy two?

731
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:34,738
Are you sure?

732
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,839
But I wanna eat something else tonight.

733
00:44:37,337 --> 00:44:39,337
Keng, you're always like this.

734
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:43,150
Hey!

735
00:44:47,683 --> 00:44:48,417
Who is she?

736
00:44:51,685 --> 00:44:52,907
My little sister.

737
00:44:53,876 --> 00:44:54,854
What's your problem?

738
00:44:56,146 --> 00:44:57,278
Little sister, my ass.

739
00:44:57,706 --> 00:44:59,885
Does Porjai know you're such a dick?

740
00:45:00,648 --> 00:45:02,049
What a mouth!

741
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:05,512
You f*ck off.

742
00:45:09,338 --> 00:45:10,483
Keng, you bastard!

743
00:45:28,068 --> 00:45:30,068
Excuse me. Please get out of the way.

744
00:45:34,494 --> 00:45:36,152
Make the way, please.

745
00:45:36,152 --> 00:45:37,358
Move.

746
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:14,618
Keng, stop it.

747
00:46:16,517 --> 00:46:18,517
Keng, stop it.

748
00:46:40,184 --> 00:46:40,684
Let go!

749
00:46:40,684 --> 00:46:41,892
Keng, that's enough.

750
00:46:41,892 --> 00:46:42,968
I said let go.

751
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:44,084
Keng, don’t.

752
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,607
People are staring.

753
00:46:48,002 --> 00:46:48,976
Enough.

754
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:49,935
What the heck is this?

755
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:53,938
You guys ruined my stuff.

756
00:46:53,938 --> 00:46:55,022
Who's going to pay for these?

757
00:46:56,659 --> 00:46:57,775
Who will take responsibility?

758
00:46:58,862 --> 00:47:00,520
Are you okay?

759
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,381
My products are all damaged.

760
00:47:04,729 --> 00:47:05,788
Day.

761
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:16,263
Sir, this is all I have.

762
00:47:16,263 --> 00:47:17,045
Sorry.

763
00:47:25,915 --> 00:47:27,915
Hey. Are you okay?

764
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:29,170
Let me help you.

765
00:47:30,698 --> 00:47:31,928
This way.

766
00:47:34,475 --> 00:47:35,876
This way.

767
00:47:42,752 --> 00:47:43,840
You're safe over here.

768
00:47:44,093 --> 00:47:45,181
Goodbye.

769
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:47,340
Excuse me.

770
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:48,444
Mister.

771
00:48:34,985 --> 00:48:35,659
Day!

772
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:39,066
Day.

773
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:41,877
Day.

774
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:44,913
Day.

775
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,074
Day!

776
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:12,406
Excuse me.

777
00:49:12,406 --> 00:49:13,666
My friend is…

778
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:41,392
Day!

779
00:49:43,217 --> 00:49:43,942
Day!

780
00:49:46,342 --> 00:49:46,965
Hey.

781
00:49:46,965 --> 00:49:47,772
Mhok.

782
00:49:47,977 --> 00:49:49,977
I'm over here.

783
00:50:23,965 --> 00:50:25,378
Thank you, guys.

784
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,558
Day.

785
00:50:28,812 --> 00:50:29,874
Where have you been?

786
00:50:31,123 --> 00:50:32,003
Where have you been?

787
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:35,945
I'm sorry. I really am.

788
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:37,520
You’re okay now.

789
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:40,130
I'm right here. Okay?

790
00:51:10,357 --> 00:51:11,138
Mom.

791
00:51:12,357 --> 00:51:13,776
He will be back.

792
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,834
Day, your mom is waiting for you.

793
00:51:28,577 --> 00:51:30,292
Why didn't you answer my calls?

794
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:35,039
What happened?

795
00:51:36,446 --> 00:51:37,212
Day.

796
00:51:37,925 --> 00:51:39,073
Are you alright?

797
00:51:39,989 --> 00:51:40,882
I am.

798
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:44,954
Don’t come tomorrow.

799
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:47,795
Day, I'm finding you a new caretaker.

800
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,772
Mom.

801
00:51:49,915 --> 00:51:51,659
I went to the U to drop out.

802
00:51:52,005 --> 00:51:57,338
I’m home late because I asked him to take me to Chatuchak to buy a book.

803
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,143
And do you realize that he looks like he just got into a fight?

804
00:52:09,344 --> 00:52:10,916
I met someone I know along the way.

805
00:52:11,297 --> 00:52:12,461
We got into a little fight.

806
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,181
A little?

807
00:52:15,153 --> 00:52:20,831
Do you think I didn't do a background check on you before hiring you?

808
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:22,729
Do you want me to describe all that?

809
00:52:23,545 --> 00:52:24,329
Mom.

810
00:52:25,545 --> 00:52:26,419
What?

811
00:52:26,982 --> 00:52:28,013
What are you talking about?

812
00:52:38,203 --> 00:52:42,591
I was sentenced to prison for assault and battery.

813
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:54,099
So?

814
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:57,036
How does that concern my caretaking?

815
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:04,805
I don't know what condition he's in right now.

816
00:53:06,387 --> 00:53:10,839
All I know is he's the only one who doesn't feel pity for me.

817
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:16,018
He doesn't make me feel like I'm disabled.

818
00:53:17,508 --> 00:53:19,508
Like those other caretakers you hired before.

819
00:53:25,613 --> 00:53:26,566
Do you get it now, Mom?

820
00:53:31,755 --> 00:53:32,688
Mhok.

821
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,383
Please take me back to my room.

822
00:53:54,172 --> 00:53:54,889
Mom.

823
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,852
Excluding what happened today, he's been the best caretaker so far.

824
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:14,617
I was drinking with my friends.

825
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,312
Some guys showed up to pick a fight.

826
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:18,809
So I…

827
00:54:18,809 --> 00:54:21,338
I told you I didn't want to know.

828
00:54:25,884 --> 00:54:26,858
Can you come here?

829
00:54:39,116 --> 00:54:40,147
Face me.

830
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,683
Ow!

831
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:49,879
Does it hurt?

832
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,128
You said it was a fight.

833
00:54:55,823 --> 00:54:57,167
I didn't think it was this bad.

834
00:54:58,546 --> 00:54:59,498
I'm fine now.

835
00:55:01,209 --> 00:55:01,972
Oh.

836
00:55:02,787 --> 00:55:03,656
What you just said…

837
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:09,748
Thank you.

838
00:55:19,089 --> 00:55:20,405
I wasn't helping you.

839
00:55:21,726 --> 00:55:25,750
I just don't want to remember that my first trip outside got my caretaker fired.

840
00:55:48,734 --> 00:55:49,936
Your stuff is on the table.

841
00:55:50,687 --> 00:55:52,972
If we are done here, I'll be leaving.

842
00:55:54,778 --> 00:55:55,632
Hold on.

843
00:55:58,768 --> 00:56:00,057
Can I ask you a favor?

844
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,381
What?

845
00:56:04,947 --> 00:56:06,743
Can you read me the back cover of the book we bought?

846
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:10,358
I usually read in stores before buying books.

847
00:56:11,441 --> 00:56:12,339
Sure.

848
00:56:23,111 --> 00:56:25,225
Hello. My name is Mee.

849
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:28,432
I'm about to fade away.

850
00:56:29,925 --> 00:56:34,804
According to the myth, only sunshine can break the curse.

851
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,932
Or perhaps I'm just having a nightmare.

852
00:56:39,783 --> 00:56:40,938
Who knows?

853
00:56:41,451 --> 00:56:46,530
Tonight, when I close my eyes, all of this will just vanish.

854
00:56:58,507 --> 00:56:59,509
Good night.

855
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:04,966
What did you say?

856
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:06,543
What?

857
00:57:06,919 --> 00:57:08,919
It was written on the back.

858
00:57:10,144 --> 00:57:11,520
I guess the old owner wrote it.

859
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,569
Why?

860
00:57:14,066 --> 00:57:15,752
Do you think I just told you good night?

861
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,642
You're done reading. Go home.

862
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:22,866
Okay.

863
00:57:24,348 --> 00:57:25,438
I'm taking off then.

864
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,637
Here, your book.

865
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:04,533
[Good night.]

866
00:58:13,162 --> 00:58:14,335
Disappointed?

867
00:58:18,176 --> 00:58:19,606
I told you to leave.

868
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:24,219
Did you leave yet?

869
00:58:31,118 --> 00:58:32,138
Good night.

870
00:58:32,685 --> 00:58:34,685
That was from me.

871
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:36,178
No one wrote it.

872
00:58:40,076 --> 00:58:41,591
I told you to go.

873
00:59:12,765 --> 00:59:13,515
(Please.)

874
00:59:13,715 --> 00:59:15,678
(This shirt is pink like Pink Milk.)

875
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:16,883
(Who would want to wear it?)

876
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:18,491
(It's going to ruin my bad-boy image.)

877
00:59:30,238 --> 00:59:32,238
Directed by Noppharnach Chaiyahwimhon

878
00:59:32,511 --> 00:59:33,703
Are you interested in Mhok?

879
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:34,511
Huh?

880
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:36,023
Hi, Day.

881
00:59:36,258 --> 00:59:38,009
Night told me you're studying abroad.

882
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,258
Have you seen his face before?

883
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:42,778
Not only is his voice handsome,

884
00:59:43,351 --> 00:59:44,218
but so is his face.

885
00:59:44,218 --> 00:59:46,121
Look whose name is on this?

886
00:59:46,418 --> 00:59:47,391
You played men's doubles?

887
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:50,538
Um.

888
00:59:50,538 --> 00:59:53,591
I think he's peeking at you.

889
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:57,338
Aw! Can’t stop smiling, can you?

890
00:59:59,993 --> 01:00:01,418
Can I spend the night here?
