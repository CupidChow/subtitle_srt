(Half a month later)

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,640
You look great.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,320
Yeah?

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,000
Mrs. Gu.

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
Come here, Jia.

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,920
Mommy.

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,760
Be good, call her Auntie.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,040
Auntie.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,120
Good girl.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,560
You plan to tutor for the Gu family?

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,120
Chenda doesn't need me anymore.

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
So, Jeff,

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,640
I hope you can recommend me
to the Gu family.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,480
Wange,

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,360
with your talent,

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,680
you could easily work
in other design fields.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,080
Too much has happened lately.

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,320
Tutoring is less demanding.

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,080
It suits my current situation better.

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,000
Wange,

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,960
was Jia well-behaved in class today?

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,480
She's always been well-behaved.

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,240
Let's go study.

35
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Is this new tutor reliable?

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,240
Absolutely.

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,320
Jeff recommended her.

38
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,640
She's patient and meticulous.

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,760
But her background isn't the best.

40
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,560
Yunru,

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,320
I heard you went to
the Middle East recently.

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,760
Were you looking for...

43
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,880
It's been over twenty years.

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
Nian has always been by your side.

45
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,080
We

46
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,640
should focus on moving forward.

47
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,520
It's nothing.

48
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,760
Just spilled some water.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,160
I have clothes.

50
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,240
Let me take you to change.

51
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,280
Is this appropriate?

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,000
Sure.

53
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:36,880
Okay.

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,840
Let me help.

55
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,960
Okay?

56
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,120
- Let's go.
- Go.

57
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,760
Mrs. Gu, this dress is stunning.

58
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,760
I'm glad you like it.

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,440
Wange, a beautiful girl like you

60
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,200
must have many suitors.

61
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,440
Not really.

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,920
I'm too busy with work.

63
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,200
Mrs. Zhang has a son,

64
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,480
cultured and refined.

65
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,880
I think

66
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,200
you two would make a good match.

67
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,360
Mrs. Gu,

68
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,360
I'm so clumsy.

69
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,720
I can't get this zipper up.

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Could you help me?

71
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,640
Of course.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,240
(This is...)

73
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,840
Mrs. Gu,

74
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,920
what's wrong?

75
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,680
Oh!

76
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,800
Wange,

77
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,680
the scar on your back

78
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,800
is unusual.

79
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,200
From childhood?

80
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,080
I had it since I was little.

81
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,080
Luckily, it's on the back,

82
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,120
so it's not troublesome.

83
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,120
Right.

84
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,320
Not troublesome.

85
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,160
Done.

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,800
Wange,

87
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,320
about introducing

88
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,160
Mrs. Zhang's son

89
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,320
to you,

90
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,240
consider it a joke.

91
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,960
You're pretty

92
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,400
and knowledgeable.

93
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,640
In the future,

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,400
greater opportunities await you.

95
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,480
Thank you.

96
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,480
By the way,

97
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,200
where are your parents now?

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,640
My... My mother passed away long ago.

99
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,160
And my father runs
a small business in Rong City.

100
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,720
(Birthmark on the back,)

101
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,480
(and similar age.)

102
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,280
(Jeff mentioned she's adopted.)

103
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,280
(Could she...)

104
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,360
Mrs. Gu,

105
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,040
this dress is too expensive.

106
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,440
I'll return it later.

107
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,720
Keep it.

108
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,800
As long as you like it.

109
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,120
Mrs. Gu, I'll take my leave.

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,400
Alright.

111
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,120
What's wrong?

112
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,280
Tired?

113
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,600
Yunru,

114
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,880
there's something I need to tell you.

115
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,640
What?

116
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,240
Earlier, I accompanied Wange

117
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,440
to change clothes.

118
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,080
I noticed a plum blossom birthmark
on her back.

119
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,840
Really?

120
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,440
Before hiring her as a tutor,

121
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,640
I investigated her background.

122
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,520
She was adopted from an orphanage.

123
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,000
Both her age and birthmark match.

124
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,840
Do you think she could be...

125
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,760
Mrs. Zhang,

126
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,920
I'm scared.

127
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,680
Don't worry.

128
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,280
Let me check.

129
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,480
Heavens,

130
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,200
please bless us.

131
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,080
What's wrong?

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,603
(Orphanage Admission Records)

133
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,840
It's Siya.

134
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,480
Yes... she's my daughter.

135
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,240
Hello?

136
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,920
Wange.

137
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,400
Jia has been quite rebellious lately.

138
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,040
Are you available tomorrow?

139
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,520
We might need you to come over again.

140
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,680
Sure.

141
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,560
Wange,

142
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,440
this is

143
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,000
the matriarch of the Zhou family.

144
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,400
I didn't get to introduce you last time.

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,760
Mrs. Zhou.

146
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,160
Here's the thing.

147
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,600
Mrs. Zhou

148
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,160
has a niece about Jia's age.

149
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,960
Since Jia's grades improved

150
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,240
under your tutoring,

151
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,400
Mrs. Zhou would like

152
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,760
to invite you to tutor her niece too.

153
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,280
Wange,

154
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,000
Yunru,

155
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,960
go ahead.

156
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,400
I'll go check on Jia.

157
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,840
May I call you Wange?

158
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,120
Of course.

159
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,000
I heard you're a designer
from Alice Design Institute.

160
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,960
Design studies must be challenging.

161
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,800
Not really.

162
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,520
Passion makes the effort worthwhile.

163
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,040
You're so lovely.

164
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,680
How could your family

165
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,640
let you travel alone?

166
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,440
They trust me.

167
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,440
I'm not a kid.

168
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,928
I can look after myself.

169
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,000
The records show

170
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,600
you came from an orphanage.

171
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,560
Wange, don't take offense.

172
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,240
Our family has had past troubles,

173
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,680
so we're being extra cautious.

174
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,720
If I've overstepped,

175
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,920
I apologize.

176
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,840
Not at all.

177
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,320
Thorough vetting is understandable.

178
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,560
I shouldn't be asking this, but...

179
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,400
have you ever considered

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,640
finding your birth parents?

181
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,800
No.

182
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,560
Why not?

183
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,840
Maybe because I'm grown now.

184
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,320
The time I needed parents
the most has passed.

185
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,280
Through all the hard times,

186
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,920
I managed well on my own.

187
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,200
Since they chose to abandon me,

188
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,160
there's no reason for me

189
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,400
to long for them anymore.

190
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,360
If they didn't want to do it,

191
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
but were forced to?

192
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,520
That means

193
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
our familial bond wasn't meant to be.

194
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,600
Since we've both managed well
without each other,

195
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,160
why disrupt

196
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,760
each other's lives now?

197
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,840
(Mr. Zhou)
Is she really Siya?

198
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,360
Yes.

199
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,160
You don't trust my judgment?

200
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,160
All these years,

201
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,480
losing Siya has been a thorn

202
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,520
piercing my heart.

203
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,880
If you hadn't made
so many enemies early on,

204
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,360
none of this would've happened!

205
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,440
I hate you!

206
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,120
And I hate myself more!

207
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,440
It's not that I don't trust you.

208
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,360
I've already spoken to Father.

209
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,720
They'll return next week.

210
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,360
If this is true,

211
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
I promise you

212
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,280
I'll bring Siya home.

213
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,080
What?

214
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,280
Are you doubting me?

215
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Could I be so heartless

216
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,240
as to not care about my own daughter?

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,640
Whether you care or not isn't the point.

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,800
Regarding this,

219
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,560
I only ask that you keep it secret.

220
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,440
Haven't we learned enough
from past lessons?

221
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,040
Don't let anyone
disturb her life casually.

222
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,640
We owe her too much.

223
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,800
Don't let the Zhou family
become her burden.

224
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,360
Do you know

225
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,360
what Siya replied
when I asked if she wanted to

226
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,080
reunite with her birth parents?

227
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,200
What did she say?

228
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,920
She said

229
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:43,040
the time when she
needed her real parents

230
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,960
has already passed.

231
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,680
She doesn't need them now.

232
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,520
What?

233
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,680
Doesn't she know yet?

234
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,520
That's why I need you to promise me.

235
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,920
Don't let anyone approach her

236
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,200
with unnecessary explanations.

237
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,920
She's her own person first,

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,200
and our daughter second.

239
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,320
Alright, stop crying.

240
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,280
I've been on the train all day.

241
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,040
Add some lily petals to my bathwater.

242
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,560
Never mind.

243
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,440
Rose petals instead.

244
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,080
Remember to light
the new rattan incense.

245
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,120
Why still stand there?

246
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,440
Hurry up!

247
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,240
Yes, Miss.

248
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,520
Mom.

249
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,480
Mom, why aren't you resting yet?

250
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,800
Waiting for me?

251
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,240
Mom, is Grandpa coming back soon?

252
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,480
What's up?

253
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,840
My piano skills have improved recently.

254
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,360
I want to play for him.

255
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,080
It's too late.

256
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,000
Have a rest.

257
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,320
(Mom seems off.)

258
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,040
(What happened while I was away)

259
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,240
(from Rong City?)

260
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
Madam, the tutor has arrived.

261
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,400
Hello, Mrs. Zhou.

262
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,600
Hi, ma'am.

263
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,440
You're here.

264
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,960
This is my niece I mentioned,

265
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Jing.

266
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,640
Jing, this is Wange.

267
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,440
Hello.

268
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,120
You're so pretty,

269
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,600
just like Auntie!

270
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,440
Thank you, Jing.

271
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,760
What do you know about beauty?

272
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,960
But

273
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,520
I must say this girl

274
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,240
resembles Yunru

275
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,360
when she was younger.

276
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,920
I heard your conversation from outside.

277
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,680
What's got you all so cheerful?

278
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,360
You continue.

279
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,600
I'll fetch some fruits.

280
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,440
Go ahead.

281
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,000
Let's go.

282
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,320
Come on.

283
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
Are you Zhang Wange?

284
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,600
Yes.

285
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,120
I've heard

286
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,760
you graduated
from Alice Design Institute?

287
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,040
Yes.

288
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,120
But from what I understand,

289
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,720
the future of jewelry design

290
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,440
is rather uncertain.

291
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,200
Have you considered

292
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,120
changing your field of study?

293
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,640
No.

294
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,240
Every industry has its ups and downs.

295
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,440
During low periods,

296
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,440
there's potential

297
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,680
for restructuring.

298
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,944
Not afraid of error?

299
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,320
Trial and error

300
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,880
is essentially the evaluation
of the present.

301
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,480
For most people,

302
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,720
life can offer

303
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,840
only one path.

304
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,200
Well said.

305
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,120
Wange,

306
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,200
let me show you around.

307
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,320
Go ahead.

308
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,920
Let's go.

309
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,560
What were you discussing?

310
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,680
This young lady

311
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,640
is intelligent and modest

312
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,200
without any arrogance.

313
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,440
That genuinely surprised me.

314
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,440
Ultimately,

315
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,280
you still don't believe she's Siya.

316
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,320
What makes you say that?

317
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,160
It's not about disbelief.

318
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,800
But family recognition
can't tolerate any mistakes.

319
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
You know, after all these years,

320
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,080
most claimants are imposters.

321
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,720
One misstep could cause turmoil.

322
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,160
I won't allow anyone

323
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,840
to exploit this matter

324
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,920
for personal schemes.

325
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
What've you been up to?

326
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,280
I couldn't reach you.

327
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,240
What's the matter?

328
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,880
Your grandpa wants to see you.

329
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,040
What's his excuse this time?

330
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,760
No excuse.

331
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,440
He misses you.

332
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,240
Don't worry.

333
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,560
I didn't tell him about your injury.

334
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,400
Fine.

335
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,360
I should go.

336
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,200
Grandpa.

337
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,040
(Wan Yuhan)
Lu Ye.

338
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,000
Yuhan?

339
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,560
Why did you come here?

340
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,080
Lu Ye, let me tell you,

341
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,960
I've made many new friends
on my journey here.

342
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,720
Next time I visit Rong City,

343
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,760
we can hang out together.

344
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,440
Good.

345
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,080
Lu Ye,

346
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,200
when I return to the capital,

347
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,480
could you escort me back?

348
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,120
Yuhan.

349
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,640
Don't waste your time on me.

350
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,960
Lu Ye,

351
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,960
actually, Master He

352
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,320
has always hoped our families...

353
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,520
Yuhan,

354
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,440
our police department

355
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,240
has many decent young men.

356
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,440
Remember Zhao Qing?

357
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,600
He subtly asked about you.

358
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,560
Enough.

359
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,240
I don't need you matchmaking.

360
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,400
Lu Ye,

361
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,600
is it because

362
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,040
there's already someone you like?

363
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,920
Lu Ye.

364
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,360
Stop loving me.

365
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,680
Lu Ye.

366
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,280
Lu Ye, I'll keep waiting for you.

367
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,280
Yuhan,

368
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,120
about nurturing feelings,

369
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,640
I don't know about others,

370
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,880
but I can't.

371
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,440
Take care.

372
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,280
I'm sorry.

373
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,760
Lu Ye!

374
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,800
(One week later)
Wange.

375
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,600
Mrs. Zhou.

376
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,160
Stay for lunch.

377
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,000
What would you like?

378
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,240
I'll have boiled pork slices

379
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,640
and spicy crayfish.

380
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,880
Both dishes are extremely spicy.

381
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,880
I need the spice!

382
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,120
Fine.

383
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,400
I need the spice.

384
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,880
I'll have them prepare it.

385
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,680
Mrs. Zhou,
