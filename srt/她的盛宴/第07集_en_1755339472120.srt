=Episode 7=

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,680
How did this happen?

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,480
Why are you here?

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,520
Came to check on you.

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,960
You were in a car accident.

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,560
I can't just ignore it, can I?

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,760
How thoughtful of you.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,680
I thought you only

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,480
cared about Song Yanzhou.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,680
What about you?

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,160
You claimed to have a girlfriend,

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,560
but when trouble hit,

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,960
she barely visited you.

24
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,200
Considering we grew up together,

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,440
I'll say a few more words.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,720
Wake up and wise up.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,400
Don't think just because
Mr. Pei obeys your every whim,

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,680
you can act recklessly.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,280
Today it's a car accident.

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,000
Who knows what'll happen tomorrow?

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
Always having others clean up your mess.

32
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,040
You're such a troublemaker.

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,120
Can you stop talking?

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,640
I know I'm unwelcome.

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,080
So why are you here?

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,280
Stop moving around.

37
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,480
What's that smell?

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,120
Get out.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,760
What did you say?

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,280
I said get out.

41
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,520
Didn't you hear me?

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,320
Pei Xun, you'd better not regret this.

43
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,320
The nurse is outside.

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,920
Shout if you need anything.

45
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,480
Don't move.

46
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Get out.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,960
I said get out.

48
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,040
Didn't you get what I mean?

49
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,440
Have some water.

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,840
Why are you here?

51
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,600
Came to see you after work.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,400
Pei Xun, I don't owe you anything.

53
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,720
Then why are you here?

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,680
Because you helped me.

55
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,840
You helped me when I was harassed

56
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,480
and even found me a job.

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,080
I didn't know how to repay you.

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,800
This time,

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,240
let's call it even.

60
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,680
(If you knew it was my scheme,)

61
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,040
(you'd be so disappointed.)

62
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,080
Surgery's scheduled
for tomorrow morning.

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,280
If visible light responses
occur after that,

64
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,760
it shows recovery potential.

65
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,880
If not,

66
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,360
the success probability

67
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,280
drops to about 30%.

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
Please prepare mentally.

69
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,240
Understood. Thank you, doctor.

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,720
When I was ten, I caught chickenpox.

71
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
The fever wouldn't break.

72
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,400
My adoptive father

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,920
wouldn't spend money on hospital.

74
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,400
He thought I wasn't his real child

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
and I wasted his money.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,080
So he left me alone

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,120
to die as fate decided.

78
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,800
(I burned with fever for three days.)

79
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,840
(My mind was foggy.)

80
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,000
(But I remember)

81
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,280
(one thought repeating.)

82
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,280
(I must survive.)

83
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,240
I truly didn't want to die.

84
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,480
Even a lowly life matters.

85
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,920
Later, I caught rainwater
with my hands outside,

86
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,440
soaking a cloth to cool my forehead.

87
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,520
And I survived.

88
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,280
You're tenacious.

89
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,200
Maybe.

90
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,240
Poor families adopt children

91
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,360
just for extra labor.

92
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
Girls? Even simpler.

93
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,920
Marry them off when old enough

94
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,040
and get a dowry.

95
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,920
But look at me now.

96
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,480
I'm living well, right?

97
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,000
(If back then,)

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,960
(I hadn't given her manuscript
to Zhou Nian,)

99
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,560
(she might've had her own exhibition.)

100
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,680
Your starting point

101
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,440
is like others' unreachable finish line.

102
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,240
If surgery succeeds,

103
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
you regain sight.

104
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,160
If it fails,

105
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,960
you'll still live comfortably,

106
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,840
remaining the most carefree

107
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
blind person alive.

108
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,080
Your way of comforting

109
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,040
is unique.

110
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,360
Hand.

111
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,760
(Thank you.)

112
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,320
(Zhang Wange.)

113
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,880
Mr. Song,

114
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,920
Jeff, assistant to Karen Pieno,

115
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,640
is waiting.

116
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,200
You'll do it.

117
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,840
What?

118
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,400
Avoiding me?

119
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,880
No.

120
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Are you taking care of Pei Xun
these days?

121
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,720
Yes.

122
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,480
There's a meeting.

123
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,960
Come with me.

124
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,000
It'll be after-work hours.

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,400
I promised Pei Xun I'd be with him.

126
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,080
He has so many caregivers.

127
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,960
Can't do without you?

128
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:42,144
(Chenda Capital)

129
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,440
These are some completed drafts

130
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,520
from Miss Zhou Nian.

131
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,240
Take a look.

132
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay.

133
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,200
(Same old predictable designs.)

134
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,360
They seem overly flashy
without substance.

135
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,320
(Jeff, Karen Pieno's assistant)
Exactly.

136
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,080
Our perspectives align remarkably.

137
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,120
We've communicated multiple times.

138
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,320
But every revision
only brings minimal changes.

139
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,120
What if you join as a consultant

140
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,160
for this design team?

141
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,680
I object.

142
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,600
Jeff,

143
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,320
this is utterly unprofessional.

144
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
Chenda values this project highly.

145
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,400
Yet you want to insert

146
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,120
this unqualified outsider into the team?

147
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,560
Is this some childish game to you?

148
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,080
Miss Zhou Nian,

149
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,800
she's no unqualified outsider.

150
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,840
Miss Zhang Wange

151
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,920
majored in jewelry design

152
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,760
and possesses exceptional talent.

153
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,600
With her acute sense of aesthetics,

154
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,680
I believe

155
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,440
her participation in this jewelry design

156
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,360
will be perfectly fine.

157
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,560
Does she have any works?

158
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,920
Has she made any impact in design?

159
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,560
Using someone like her

160
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,880
is an insult to my expertise.

161
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,720
In my view,

162
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,560
honor only represents the past.

163
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,360
It isn't the sole measure
of one's worth.

164
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,560
Enough.

165
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,160
I'll discuss this directly with Karen.

166
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,280
Jeff,

167
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,360
let me remind you

168
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,080
this company belongs to the Song family.

169
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,960
My fiancé happens to own it.

170
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,320
(Still resorting to the same tactics.)

171
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,840
Mr. Song.

172
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,080
Mr. Song.

173
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,200
What is it?

174
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,000
Mr. Song, here's the situation.

175
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
During my discussion with Jeff,

176
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,560
we found our perspectives
aligned unexpectedly.

177
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,640
So he invited me to join

178
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,800
as design consultant.

179
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,680
Please review

180
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,240
some of my previous

181
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,560
relevant designs.

182
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,440
Take a look.

183
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,800
(Scheming fool, Zhang Wange.)

184
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,400
(You took my money,)

185
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,960
(yet won't leave Chenda)

186
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,640
(and now steal my project?)

187
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,400
Not bad.

188
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,360
Any objections?

189
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,560
Yanzhou,

190
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,640
she can't join the design team.

191
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,120
What is your concern?

192
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,520
From what I've seen,

193
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,320
the design concepts are well-structured,

194
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,120
no different from a professional's.

195
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,640
But she is an assistant,

196
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,680
not a designer.

197
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,960
Therefore,

198
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,640
she's a consultant,

199
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,280
but not a lead designer,

200
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,080
to join the team.

201
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,520
(Zhou Nian,)

202
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,440
(I'm truly looking forward)

203
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,560
(to seeing how you'll maintain)

204
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,640
(this stolen glory.)

205
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,480
Your father will return soon.

206
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,320
Something happened in the capital.

207
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,640
He couldn't leave.

208
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,640
I understand.

209
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,240
He's busy.

210
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,560
Despite his commitments,

211
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,880
he always worries about you.

212
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,000
He's called me multiple times inquiring.

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Kidding me?

214
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,000
His own son is lying here,
yet he called you?

215
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,960
Is it maternal instinct?

216
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,680
So calling you means comforting me?

217
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,120
By the way,

218
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,040
how's it going with Miss Zhou?

219
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,240
Nothing particular.

220
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,000
Hello.

221
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,000
Is this your girlfriend?

222
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,560
Time to remove the bandages.

223
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,120
Pei Xun, relax.

224
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,120
I've even prepared
assistive glasses for you.

225
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,400
I need to brief you
on care instructions.

226
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,240
Please come with me.

227
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,120
I'll be right back.

228
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,720
Healed?

229
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,320
I can tell

230
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
you seem really happy today.

231
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,760
I entered Chenda's design department.

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,400
Though it's just administrative work.

233
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,800
But being able to do what I love

234
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,560
makes me happy.

235
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,400
Maybe someday I can pick up a brush

236
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,400
and start drawing again.

237
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,200
Congrats.

238
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,520
Yanzhou.

239
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,600
Yanzhou.

240
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,760
What's wrong?

241
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,360
Last time I got angry,
you didn't even try to comfort me.

242
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,120
That wasn't the first time.

243
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,320
Yanzhou,

244
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,880
are you free later?

245
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Let's go visit Pei Xun together.

246
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,880
It'll be

247
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,000
after-work hours.

248
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,640
I promised Pei Xun I'd take care of him.

249
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,520
Your father cares about you.

250
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,720
Stop causing trouble
after being discharged.

251
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,040
Care? What care?

252
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,840
I'm tough.

253
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,240
Never mind half-dead in abyss,

254
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,640
even fully dead,

255
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,360
the King of Hell would toss me back.

256
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,360
Ma'am.

257
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,560
Oh, Yanzhou and Nian.

258
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,240
How have you been lately?

259
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,200
Thanks for your concern.

260
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:14,920
We're good.

261
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,080
Where was the promised dinner yesterday?

262
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,760
The restaurant

263
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,760
was closed.

264
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,000
She had urgent work.

265
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,920
Things don't always go as planned.

266
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,880
Wange,

267
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,760
I want water.

268
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,240
Zhang Wange,

269
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
I need water.

270
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,360
Xun.

271
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,000
Why bother Wange for water?

272
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,120
I'll go. Let me handle it.

273
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,200
It's okay.

274
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,840
Let's go take a walk outside.

275
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,600
Mr. Song,

276
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,320
you occupying Wange's private time

277
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,640
isn't good for our relationship.

278
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,720
What?

279
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,640
Her private time

280
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,880
must be spent serving Master Xun?

281
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,520
I need her.

282
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
And she's willing.

283
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,600
What should we do?

284
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,280
Here.

285
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,000
It's hot!

286
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,640
Hot water helps your recovery.

287
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:56,640
(The Next Day)

288
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,520
Xun,

289
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,120
why did you discharge early?

290
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,560
Got things to do.

291
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,080
Xun, don't be impulsive.

292
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,440
The connections and resources
your mother left you

293
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,040
are enough for a fresh start.

294
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,640
Mr. Zheng,

295
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,840
there are things I must do.

296
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,040
Pei Qishan is ruthless.

297
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,520
Given time,

298
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,200
if he realizes you know the truth,

299
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,360
he won't show mercy
just because you're blood-related.

300
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,480
Perfect.

301
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,640
I'd hate if he showed mercy.

302
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,920
What's your plan?

303
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,560
(Debts must be repaid.)

304
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,640
