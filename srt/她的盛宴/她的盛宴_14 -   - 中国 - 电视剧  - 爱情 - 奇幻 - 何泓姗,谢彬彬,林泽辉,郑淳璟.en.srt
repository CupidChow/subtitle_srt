Two bottles of Shaoxing wine.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,800
Okay.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,400
Coming.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,640
I think you don't like Shaoxing wine.

17

Enjoy.

18

I didn't like it before,

but I like it now.

Can't I?

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,120
Take it.

22
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,000
Sure.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,800
Cheers.

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,840
Pei Xun, I'm not drunk.

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,600

You wouldn't dare.

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,160
Try me.

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,480
Ever thought about hiring a driver?

31

32
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,200
but also

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,560
whatever you want.

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,360
Where can I find such a guy?

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,656
You can have one if you want.

41
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,400
(If I can survive,)

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920

No.

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,000
No.

47
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,320
He's good-looking.

48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,960
No?

49
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,960
No.

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,840
He's got a nice figure,

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,440
can protect you,

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,600
maybe a rising star.

53
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,464
No.

00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,640
What's wrong with you, Zhang Wange?

55
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,800
Why so picky about hiring a driver?

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,880
Actually, you do want something,

57
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,880
but just don't want me.

Lu,

67
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,880
what's wrong with people nowadays?

68
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,160
Why so insane?

69
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,000
Now Sun is dead,

70
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,480
and we lost Meng's clues too.

71
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,880
With so many people,

72
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,960
they must find a hiding place.

73
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,880
Keep investigating.

74
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,800
Don't overlook any suspicious clue.

75
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,880
Yes.

76
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,760
By the way, Lu.

77
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,120
A tip just came from the capital.

78
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,320
What is it?

79
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,640
Pei Xun is dead.

80
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,520
How?

81
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
He's gone?

82
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,480
Yes.

83
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
The last bullet pierced his left chest.

84
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,000
And the best time for rescue
has now passed.

85
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,360
I'll publish the news tomorrow

86
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,440
that the capital was in turmoil,

87
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,120
and Pei Xun

88
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
died tragically in an accident.

89
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,600
You really

90
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,040
do things flawlessly.

91
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,440
But who sent you

92
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,680
that letter?

93
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,080
Any leads on the sender?

94
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:09,920
(Pei Xun discovers his identity.)

95
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,720
No leads at all.

96
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,520
The paper and envelope materials

97
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,560
are common.

98
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,920
The possible sources are too broad.

99
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,440
Maybe it's from someone with a grudge.

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,240
Let it go.

101
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,440
He's already dead.

102
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,200
Let bygones be bygones.

103
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,400
Actually, you should thank him

104
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,400
for warning you in time

105
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,680
about Pei Xun's murder plan.

106
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,040
Otherwise,

107
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,800
you wouldn't have escaped.

108
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,080
Seems like

109
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,400

110
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,200
stirred up.

111
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,000
Grandpa.

112
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,680
You're back.

113
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
Your acquisition of Weina Jewels

114
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,840
went very well.

115
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,120
I'll monitor the progress.

116
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,440
To be honest,

117
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,320
you're more capable
than your eldest brother.

118
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,720
When he first joined Song Group,

119
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
he ruined two projects in a row.

120
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,080
But what could I do? He's my grandson.

121
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,360
I only let him reflect on his mistakes.

122
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,600
Though gaining power

123
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
isn't necessarily a good thing.

124
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,160
It breeds improper thoughts.

125
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,360
Now you're making such a scene.

126
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Do you want to cancel the engagement
with the Zhou family?

127
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,720
Yes.

128
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,480
How generous you are.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,800
Used such a destructive trick?

130
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,000
You and Zhou Nian

131
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,800
might not be meant for each other.

132
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,800
And we don't

133
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,280
necessarily need the Zhou family.

134
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,880
When I was in the capital

135
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,760
dining with Director Lin,

136
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,080
his daughter Lin Xin

137
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
mentioned you once.

138
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,600
Meet her when you're free.

139
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,520
Let my second brother do it.

140
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,680
He's going to the capital
for leg treatment anyway.

141
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,760
I think Lin Xin wouldn't look down on

142
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
a cripple.

143
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,880
Such a trivial matter

144
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,760
isn't worth your anger, Grandpa.

Do you think controlling the group

makes you powerful?

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,880
Trying to secretly send

151
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,240
that woman away?

152
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,520

for so long,

I advise you to leave Rong City.

Wherever you go,

165
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,200
you must thrive with your skills.

166

If you run,

170
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
a mental incompetency verdict
will be issued,

171
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,120
and you'll be taken by force.

172
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,320
Don't even consider informing anyone.

173
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,480
Master Song has prepared everything.

177
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,880
will only be even worse.

178
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,480
So, where do you send her?

179
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,120
This vast world

180

is full of vistas to explore.

and see the world.

183
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,000
That'll cure her of grand ambitions.

You used a bullet to
get your eldest brother killed!

191

You owe this to the Song family!

194
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
You knew it all along?

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,680
Yes.

196
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,160
You secretly tampered

197
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
with the gun,

198
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,800
getting your eldest brother killed.

199
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,800
Had I known you'd betray

200
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,240
the family like this,

201
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,240
I'd have given the evidence
to the police.

202
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,200
Then do you know

203
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,480
that eldest brother

204
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,360
tried killing me thrice
to marry into the Zhou family?

205
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,320
So you knew it all along,

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,080
yet you let it happen

207
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,640
and allowed us

208
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,760
to hurt each other?

209
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,360
Is this the family bond you want?

210
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,520
The Song family

211
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,880
can have one heir.

212
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,520
To prevent divided authority,

213
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,760
I had no choice.

214
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,600
Then you shouldn't have let me be born!

215
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,040
Why not strangle me

216
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,080
in my cradle?

217
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,840
Yanzhou.

218
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,120
Who are you?

219
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,200
I've spent seven years cultivating you.

220
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,200
Think you're irreplaceable?

221
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,400
Think the Song family
can't function without you?

222
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,720
This man here is

223
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,240
Song Zhihang.

224
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,560
His education and upbringing
rival yours completely.

225
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,240
All he needs
is an opportunity and a title.

226
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,280
Grandpa.

227
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,280
The Song family has truly rotten

228
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,200
from the roots

229
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,760
under your control.

230
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,840
What are you waiting for?

231
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,200
Stop him!

232
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,800
Song Yanzhou.

233
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,520
Stop it now!

234
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,880
Song Yanzhou.

235
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,520
Do you want to see

236
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,080
that woman's corpse?

237
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,160
(Mr. Song.)

238
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,360
(Your harmonious family
must be blissful, right?)

239
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
(But that's not true.)

240
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,720
(Without family, I could imagine)

241
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,360
(and anticipate.)

242
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,880
(But now my family is here.)

243
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,200
(They're using me as a puppet
and draining me completely).

244
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,560
(They won't stop
until they've drained me.)

245
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,320
Stop.

246
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,320
Song Yanzhou.

247
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
Want to escape?

248
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,280
Everything you have now

249
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,080
is all given by the Song family.

250
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,520
Look at those
fighting for money and power.

251
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
But you were born

252
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,800
in a position others can't reach.

253
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,560
You do not appreciate it,

254
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,880
but betray us.

255
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,440
Can't even control a woman.

256
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,600
What a loser!

257
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,920
Mr. Song.

258
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,200
Master Song does everything
for your own good.

259
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,640
For my own good?

260
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,400
Break my legs,

261
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,440
give me crutches,

262
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,640
and then lecture me

263
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,720
that without him,

264
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,440
I can't even walk.

265
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,400
So I should be grateful?

266
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,680
At the train station,

267
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,920
did you let her escape on purpose?

268
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,680
I...

269
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,080
