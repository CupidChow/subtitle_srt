17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,160
Today,

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,960
this household

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,200

This will pass.

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,240
No, it won't.

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,760
Don't be sad.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,400
Everything's ruined.

00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,640
How could that be?

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,480
You're in the bloom of youth.

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,760
After this blows over,

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,680
everything will get better.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,840
It never will.

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,840
Never again.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,720
They... they...

33
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,800
They all say I'm disgusting.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,480
My uncle

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,960
and aunt... they've abandoned me.

36
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,440
Alright.

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,960
This isn't your fault.

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,920
No decent person would think
you're disgusting.

39
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,160
I once had a sister.

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,560
She went through something even worse.

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,960
- (They locked her in a dark room,)
- Let me go!

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,200
- (torturing her day and night.)
- Let go!

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,280
Let go of me!

44
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,840
But she escaped

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,320
to a new city

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,720
and built a good life.

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,080
Really?

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,680
Really?

49
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,480
Yeah.

50
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,280
Of course it's true.

51
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,160
I...

52
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,040
You can overcome this too.

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,160
Okay.

54
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:02,960
Okay.

55
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,520
(Yes,)

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,640

57
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,200
Zhang Wange,

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,080

59
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,760
Feeling unwell?

60
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,360
I'm fine.

61
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,960
Rest assured,

63
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,520

66
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,120

67

I've been removed
from Chenda's design department.

72

Don't be upset.

73
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,080
Mr. Jiu,

74
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,360
I truly want to marry Yanzhou.

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,840
Rest assured,

76
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,320
I'll deliver everything you desire

77
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,880

78
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,200
I will eliminate all obstacles for you.

79
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,000
Knowing your fondness for
ancient blue-and-white vases,

80
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,680
I recently acquired one

81
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,040
and want to present it.

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,120
Despite your busy schedule,

83
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,600
you still found time
to procure this vase.

84
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,160
Has Yanzhou visited you recently?

85
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,560
(Master Song, Song Yanzhou's grandfather)
He's keeping himself occupied.

86
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,760
From what I hear,

87
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,480
Yanzhou's secretary is capable.

88
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,480
She's become his right hand now.

89
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,960
How could he keep occupied?

90
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,160
I suspect

91
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,000
it's just an excuse.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,880
I'll have Nian lecture him next time.

93
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,440
He does need a talking-to.

94
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,520
Wange,

95
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,880
this is Mu Jingting.

96
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,400

97
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,640
to assist Mr. Song.

98
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,400
Hello.

106
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,600
We're likely around the same age.

107
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,400

108
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,920

111
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,200

112
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,880
First,

113
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,360
I'd like to understand
Mr. Song's work habits.

114
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,400
Mr. Song

115
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,120
strictly separates professional
and personal matters.

116
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,720
To put it simply,

117
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,320
speak less and work more.

118
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,920
Any documents sent over

119
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,080
must be perfectly clear.

120
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,960
No biased language is allowed.

121
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,680
When Mr. Song gets drunk
at social events,

122
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,240
is it also you who takes him home?

123
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,200
No.

124
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
Social galas and business banquets

125
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,920
are usually handled by Fang Cheng.

126
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,760
Okay.

127
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,720

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,120
Okay.

194
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,080
Also regarding Master Song,

195
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
you should visit more frequently.

196
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,200
(Apparently,)

197
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,000
(she remains unaware about)

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,280
(my expulsion from Chenda.)

199
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,280
Grandfather.

200
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,280
Any work difficulties lately?

201
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,600
No.

202
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,480
I wouldn't trouble you
with trivial matters.

203
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,440
But I heard

204
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,800
back at Lanhai Bay,

205
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,240
you entered a hotel suite

206
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,760
and never came out.

207
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,040
Fang Cheng told you?

208
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,320
Fang Cheng works for you.

209
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,440
He wouldn't dare.

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,600
But actions

211
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,400
leave traces.

212
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,680
Who might want to frame you?

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I had numerous contacts that night.

214
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,480
The assistant who helped you upstairs...

215
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,600
It wasn't her.

216
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,800
You youngsters overlook

217
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,480
the fundamental principle.

218
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,400
After such incidents,

219
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,880
the biggest beneficiary
is the prime suspect.

220
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,080
Warfare permits deception.

221
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,720
Dismiss that assistant.

222
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,200
On what grounds?

223
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,800
You wouldn't wrong

224
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,240
anyone without evidence.

225
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,480
You've got it all wrong.

226
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,440
Your marriage with Zhou Nian
is inevitable.

227
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,120
Why not

228
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,760
avoid unnecessary complications?

229
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,160
Grandfather,

230
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
I know what I'm doing.

231
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,360
(He's clearly concerned
about Zhang Wange.)

232
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,240
Old He's grand birthday celebration
is in a few days.

233
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,720
All major families
from Rong City will attend.

234
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,640
Take Zhou Nian with you.

235
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,720
Consider it giving
her proper recognition.

236
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,280
Yes, Grandpa.

237
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,200
(Attending together)

238
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,080
(means acknowledging our relationship.)

239
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,640
Who let you in?

240
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:21,728
(He Renlai, Lu Ye's father)

241
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,960
You're injured?

242
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,200
Does this concern you?

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,040
This was poorly executed.

244
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,360
You nearly got killed.

245
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,240
Consider yourself lucky to be alive.

246
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,160
At least your master's training
wasn't wasted.

247
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,480
If you can't speak civilly,

248
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,640
you might as well leave now.

249
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,640
I thought you had the courage

250
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,800
to investigate this case

251
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,920
because you were prepared

252
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,520
to risk everything.

253
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,480
But you?

254
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Worrying about dignity,

255
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,160
and bumbling around.

256
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
Had you consulted me earlier,

257
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,240
it wouldn't have come to this.

258
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,280
Consult with you?

259
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,960
Just to be manipulated?

260
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,880
I'm still your father.

261
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,800
I'd never

262
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
turn against you

263
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,600
and hurt you.

264
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,440
But remember.

265
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,480
Hand over all the materials
from your previous investigations to me.

266
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,760
Hand them over to you?

267
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,560
Fine.

268
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,760
Then

269
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,160
what will you do?

270
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,440
That's none of your concern.

271
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,680
Your grandfather's is unwell.

272
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,840
Find time to visit him.

273
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,440
(Who bought this?)

274
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,360
(He Jiu from Beizhou.)

275
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,040
(Just some respectful gestures.)

276
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,000
Next time, find a better excuse.

277
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,640
Mr. Song,

278
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,000
bringing her to such an occasion today

279
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,720
is highly inappropriate.

280
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,440
What's inappropriate about it?

281
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,200
Master Song has always wanted you

282
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
to announce engagement

283
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,720
to Zhou Nian at the He family banquet.

284
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,200
Bringing her now

285
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,320
would only create ambiguity

286
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,360
and confusion.

287
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Having two women present
at the same event

288
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,920
would fuel speculation.

289
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,720
Have you forgotten

290
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,920
who you're working for now?

291
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,440
Should I send you back

292
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,680
to Grandfather immediately?

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,920
I wouldn't dare.

294
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,800
It fits well.

295
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Fang Cheng,

296
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,640
who's hosting tonight's cocktail party?

297
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,720
It's not a cocktail party.

298
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,160
It's just a pretext.

299
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,600
What do you mean?

300
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,840
Have you heard of He Renlai?

301
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,040
He Renlai?

302
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,000
The capital director,

303
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,000
who's made quite a name in Rong City.

304
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,880
Right.

305
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,640
His father's birthday

306
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,640
wasn't meant to be a grand affair.

307
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,240
- Happy birthday!
- Those catching wind

308
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,840
have set the stage for him.

309
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,640
Congratulations!

310
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,440
Given the director's unique position,

311
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,720
the banquet had to be organized
under others' name.

312
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,440
(Therefore, tonight's event)

313
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,240
(is essentially a grand
celebration for Master He.)

314
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,600
Wange.

315
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,280
Fang Cheng, go handle your business.

316
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,040
Don't worry.

317
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,680
I won't go where I shouldn't.

318
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,360
Alright, wait here for me.

319
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,600
I'll make some rounds.

320
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,760
If you get hungry,

321
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,680
have something to eat.

322
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,800
Don't worry.

323
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,760
Yanzhou,

324
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,800
you're the most promising
among the younger generation.

325
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,520
Not at all.

326
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,920
Perhaps you should come visit my place
when you have time.

327
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,120
Let us show you some hospitality.

328
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,160
I definitely will.

329
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,080
However,

330
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,400
don't just focus on your career.

331
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,320
You should prioritize family more.

332
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,400
Grandpa.

333
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,320
You're here, Lu Ye.

334
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,480
(There's been talk about
an illegitimate child in the He family.)

335
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,840
(But we've never seen him
all these years.)

336
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,360
(Seems like)

337
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,720
(Master He plans to acknowledge
him publicly now.)

338
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
I'll take my leave then.

339
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,680
Okay.

340
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,080
Grandpa,

341
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,960
that He Jiu who gave you
the vase last time...

342
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,040
Don't ask about him anymore.

343
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,480
Next month,

344
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,600
I'll have you transferred back to here.

345
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,880
No deal.

346
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:38,960
You...

347
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,400
You brat!

348
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,560
Are you gambling with your career?

349
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,240
What career do I even have left?

350
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,200
I used to get into fights frequently

351
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,040
and did plenty of shameless things.

352
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,760
I think it's pretty good now.

353
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,400
Raging harms your health.

354
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,160
Do you still hate him?

355
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,720
Not really.

356
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,320
No point in that.

357
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,360
He abandoned me for over a decade.

358
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,640
Didn't even visit when my mother passed.

359
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,760
Now that his son's dead
and with no heir,

360
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,240
he suddenly wants me back.

361
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,040
He's being

362
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,120
pretty shrewd.

363
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,080
Enough. I have other matters.

364
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,880
Don't fake illnesses next time.

365
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,160
Don't you fear it might come true?

366
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,800
How dare you!

367
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,160
The man in the yellow coat

368
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,000
is Director He's illegitimate son.

369
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
Wasn't he Director He's nephew?

370
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,080
Director He's wife only has one brother,

371
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,320
who fathered a daughter.

372
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,440
How could he have a nephew?
