=Episode 23=

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,800
What's wrong?

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,000
What happened?

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,720
Mom's not going to make it.

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,400
I told my brother before

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
not to tell her about Siya.

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,000
But he wouldn't listen.

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,240
My sister said

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,120
Mom

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,000
has reached the end of her strength.

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,280
She... she wants to see Siya
one last time.

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,920
Siya,

23
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,400
your grandma's ill.

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,960
She...

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,360
She wants to see you one last time.

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,960
Siya,

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,160
please, I beg you.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,080
You don't have to acknowledge us yet,

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,460
but she's been worrying
about you all these years.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,640
This might very well be

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,720
your last chance to see her.

32
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,600
Siya.

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,040
Siya's here.

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Siya.

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,360
Siya.

36
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,760
Grandma.

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,760
I'm here.

38
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,080
Are you Siya?

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,880
Grandma,

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,160
I am.

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,880
I'm late, Grandma.

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,640
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,280
Thank heavens,

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,240
you're alive.

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,320
But

46
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,000
I have to go now.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,680
No!

48
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,640
- No.
- I can't stay with you anymore.

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,000
No, Grandma.

50
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,280
This is what I

51
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,040
saved for you.

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,280
All these years,

53
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,440
I kept many other things for you,

54
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,720
just for you.

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,520
You must live well.

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,440
Grandma.

57
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,120
Grandma.

58
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,304
Grandma.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,646
- Mom!
- Grandma!

60
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,520
- Mom!
- Grandma, what's wrong?

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,560
- Mom.
- You can't leave, Grandma!

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,640
You haven't seen me
start my own family yet!

63
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,320
You need to vet my choices.

64
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,080
All these years,

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,800
I've been so lonely outside.

66
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,560
My judgment's terrible.

67
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,120
If anyone does me a tiny favor,

68
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,760
I'll think they're being kind

69
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,600
and follow them!

70
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,280
What should I do?

71
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,960
Grandma, don't leave me.

72
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,400
I've always had it rough.

73
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,920
My adoptive father treated me badly.

74
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
And those people...

75
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,720
They've always bullied me.

76
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,200
I finally found my family.

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,880
Grandma.

78
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,320
Grandma, you have to stand up for me!

79
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,720
You can't go, Grandma.

80
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,480
I'm not leaving.

81
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
Grandma.

82
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,440
Mom. Mom!

83
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,120
Mom! Mom! Mom!

84
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,640
- Mom.
- Mrs. Zhou.

85
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,160
Grandma

86
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,680
is still breathing.

87
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,720
She's okay.

88
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,920
She's with us.

89
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,760
Her condition is stable for now.

90
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,600
We'll need to monitor her.

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,040
It's a miracle.

92
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,440
In all my years,

93
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,720
I've never seen this.

94
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,040
Indeed,

95
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,960
medical experience

96
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,680
can't cover every condition.

97
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,560
Next,

98
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,920
we'll give her a full examination.

99
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,800
(Mo Ran,)

100
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,040
(do you hear it?)

101
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,200
(Grandma's okay.)

102
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Thank you, doctor.

103
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,280
Mom.

104
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,400
Your mother has always been

105
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,560
stiff-tongued but soft-hearted.

106
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,480
Her granddaughter
was missing for decades.

107
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,520
Now the girl's back.

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,320
She hasn't even begun making amends.

109
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,600
How could she rest peacefully

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,496
by leaving now?

when she gets back?

131
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,080
Mom, we'll all treat her well

132
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,760

for blindness.

135
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,040
Siya

136
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
clearly didn't come here willingly.

137
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,480
She willingly stays to care for me

138
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,520
because of her inherently kind
and tender heart,

139
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,200
not because of her family lineage.

140
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,440
Mom.

141
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,520
I was

142
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,440
already half gone.

143
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,640
It was her

144
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,320
who made me conscious.

145
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,520
If you don't claim her, I do.

146
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,680
She'll stay under my care,

147
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,960
and I'll ensure

148
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,000
she's well provided for.

149
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,920
Mom,

150
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,400
how could you say this?

151
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,600
Half my life, I've searched for her.

152
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,040
How could I not love her?

153
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,200
Regarding Nian's apology,

154
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,400
proper procedures must be followed.

155
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,480
The honors stolen from Siya

156
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,280
must be returned.

157
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,800
We must never let Siya suffer injustice.

158
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,560
We have cherished her
as a treasure for years,

159
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,080
caring for her meticulously.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,240
That's more than enough.

161
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,760
Nian is already an adult.

162
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,960
We could simply

163
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,720
find an apartment for her anywhere.

164
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
There's no need

165
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,880
to bring her back.

166
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,080
This way, Siya won't

167
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,880
have to see her frequently

168
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,080
and feel upset.

169
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,720
By publicly acknowledging Siya's return,

170
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,040
(you've shown the world)

171
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,360
(her lineage has been
thoroughly verified.)

172
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,800
(She should return soon.)

173
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,520
(After all,)

174
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,000
(her future standing)

175
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,200
(depends on your attitude.)

176
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,920
(Any kind of rift)

177
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,400
(will make Siya)

178
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,720
(feel embarrassed)

179
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,560
(and uncomfortable with us.)

180
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,040
(Understood, Mom.)

181
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,600
(I'll never allow Siya)

182
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,400
(to face any disrespect.)

183
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,320
(Such circumstances will not occur.)

184
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,760
Hello?

185
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,840
Wange,

186
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,880
Grandma will be discharged tomorrow.

187
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,360
She wants to see you again.

188
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,360
I understand.

189
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,040
You see,

190
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,920
good fortune often hides misfortune.

191
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,880
Back then,

192
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,680
if we hadn't hosted

193
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,880
that grand celebration,

194
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,200
you might not have caught
malicious attention

195
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,400
and wouldn't have been taken.

196
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,680
Your mom

197
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,000
heard about children
being trafficked to Licheng.

198
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
She insisted on investigating there.

199
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,600
When she arrived,

200
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,120
a plague broke out.

201
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,000
She developed recurring fevers
after returning.

202
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,040
I thought I'd lose both
my granddaughter and daughter

203
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,280
to death's grasp.

204
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,040
I nearly didn't survive
that ordeal either.

205
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,040
After all these years,

206
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,000
I'd almost forgotten

207
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,760
about that.

208
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,200
I know you've endured

209
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,960
much hardship out there.

210
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,760
Your mother and I

211
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,120
even made solemn vows.

212
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,640
Even if

213
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,000
you were

214
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,920
disabled or impaired,

215
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,520
or otherwise,

216
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,520
we

217
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,120
would welcome you home.

218
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,800
Yet you've grown so remarkably.

219
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,640
You forged your path through thorns.

220
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,960
I'm proud of you.

221
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,160
Siya.

222
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,680
Siya.

223
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,080
I'm sorry.

224
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,120
We're sisters.

225
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,360
Don't kneel before me.

226
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,520
No.

227
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,760
If you don't forgive me,

228
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,800
I won't rise.

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,720
She already told you to rise.

230
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,480
Get up.

231
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,080
Are you trying to embarrass her?

232
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,872
No.

233
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,480
Three years ago,

234
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,720
I plagiarized your design draft.

235
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,840
At that time,

236
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,080
Wang Wenzhong

237
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,680
was also my external tutor.

238
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,200
He told me

239
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,280
he had a student's discarded draft

240
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,440
that showed great talent.

241
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,160
I was stuck in a creative rut,

242
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,840
so I selfishly used it.

243
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,600
I

244
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,240
really didn't mean to do it.

245
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,720
Rest assured,

246
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,920
I've already

247
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,040
organized a press conference.

248
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,960
I'll clarify everything

249
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,520
and return all the honors

250
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,800
that rightfully belong to you.

251
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,600
Siya,

252
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,640
I don't ask for your forgiveness.

253
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,680
I just hope

254
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,920
you'll speak to me.

255
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,160
Even if it's just

256
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,040
scolding or reprimanding me.

257
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,440
(Their acknowledgment of me)

258
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,800
(indicates no way out for her.)

259
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,800
(She chooses to retreat strategically.)

260
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,200
(Not a bad move indeed.)

261
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,200
Mom,

262
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,760
I've agreed to move out.

263
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,240
My only wish is

264
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,320
that you and Grandma

265
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,600
will allow me

266
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
to visit occasionally

267
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,920
when I get homesick.

268
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,560
I truly can't bear

269
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,200
the thought of never seeing you again.

270
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,280
Enough.

271
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,840
Frankly speaking,

272
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,160
Nian grew up pampered since childhood.

273
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,680
Let alone kneeling,

274
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,000
she hasn't even properly bowed!

275
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,440
Mistakes require taking responsibility.

276
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,720
You only see her grievances.

277
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
But have you considered

278
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,440
how Siya

279
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,640
suffered alone

280
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,320
all these years?

281
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
Everyone who hurt me

282
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,520
left scars

283
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,600
in my heart.

284
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,440
I don't seek revenge,

285
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,440
but wish to never cross paths

286
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,400
with them again.

287
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,960
As long as they stay away,

288
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,280
the pain will fade.

289
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,600
You claimed

290
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,280
you'd do anything

291
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,120
for my forgiveness,

292
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,000
yet you took no real action.

293
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Kneeling,

294
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,880
crying,

295
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,560
and making scenes

296
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,600
are just another form of

297
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,640
emotional blackmail.

298
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,920
You don't need my forgiveness,

299
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,960
but just self-absolution.

300
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,320
(Your retribution hasn't come.)

301
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,960
(I won't give you)

302
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,640
(any chance to manipulate family pity.)

303
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
But I truly realize my mistake!

304
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,800
I...

305
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,800
Siya's speaking

306
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,120
of actions over intentions

307
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,920
reminds me of my younger self.

308
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,520
I plan

309
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,240
to host all prominent families

310
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,160
on my 75th birthday celebration

311
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,120
and formally introduce you to them.

312
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,400
I want all people to see

313
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,280
how radiant and accomplished

314
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
my long-lost

315
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,800
granddaughter is.

316
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,160
From now on,

317
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,080
no one will dare belittle you.

318
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,440
As for those

319
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,760
who wronged you before,

320
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,320
I will help you

321
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,640
get justice.

322
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
Child,

323
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,600
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

324
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,600
Could you call me "Grandpa" just once?

325
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,880
Thank you, Grandpa.

326
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,760
Okay.

327
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,640
Wonderful.

328
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,040
Never imagined

329
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,320
I'd live to see this day.

330
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,680
Zhang Wange,

331
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,680
you did this on purpose.

332
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,480
You make me lose everyone around me.

333
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,840
My friends,

334
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,800
my lover,

335
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,320
and my family.

336
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,040
Siya,

337
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,960
you must fully embrace being

338
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,560
the Zhou family's young mistress.

339
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,080
Should anything go wrong,

340
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,720
I'll be more devastated than anyone.

341
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,320
No need for your concern.

342
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,480
You should worry about yourself.

343
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,120
(Zhou Nian,)

344
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,880
(your status as the adopted daughter)

345
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,760
(hasn't been taken away yet, has it?)

346
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,560
You know what needs

347
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,560
to be done now that you're out?

348
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,000
Miss Zhou,

349
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,040
you know, without money,

350
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,440
I can't survive.

351
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,320
Thank you, Miss Zhou.

352
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,600
Back then, Zhang Wange

353
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,520
framed you to suffer
eight years in prison.

354
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,320
Explain the whole story

355
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,120
thoroughly to her parents.

356
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,920
Her parents

357
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,560
will compensate you properly.

358
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,000
Really?

359
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,640
Of course.

360
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,080
(I plan to host all prominent families)

361
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,720
on my 75th birthday celebration

362
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,960
and formally introduce you to them.

363
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
I want all people to see

364
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,320
how radiant and accomplished

365
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,240
my long-lost

366
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,640
granddaughter is.

367
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,080
From now on,

368
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,000
no one will dare belittle you.

369
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,240
As for those

370
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,000
who've wronged you before,

371
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,280
I will help you

372
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,560
(get justice.)

373
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,720
(If Grandpa knew she's been)

374
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,200
(so vicious since childhood,)

375
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,280
(he'd never favor her again.)

376
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
(I retrieved your gun for you.)

377
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,040
(If you lose your life,)

378
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,200
(how can you protect anyone?)

379
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,840
Zhao Qing.

380
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,280
When did you arrive?

381
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,640
Just now.

382
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,200
Is something wrong?

383
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,440
Lu,

384
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,200
Gao Jianping got bailed out.

385
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,880
