00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,080
(Lu Ye, Captain Detective of Rong City)
Officer.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,160
My daughter went missing two days ago.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,040
(Back home,)

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,960
(she became mentally disoriented.)

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,760
(She kept talking to herself,)

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,440
(wandering the streets like a ghost.)

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,480
I feel

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,280
she's been possessed by something evil.

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,040
She didn't respond to calls.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,640
(Her body kept convulsing,)

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,360
(and her breathing was rapid.)

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,080
Once when she came home,

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,080
she was covered in purple powder.

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,760
She kept mumbling something about...

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,360
Yes, Corn Poppy.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,040
(Purple Corn Poppy.)

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,200
(Missing girls.)

28
00:01:33,255 --> 00:01:34,304
(Zhao Qing,
Captain Detective of Rong City)

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,960
Lu.

30
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,600
Didn't you find the one
you're looking for

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,880
on the list of missing persons?

32
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,760
(Zhang Wange, where are you?)

33
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,840
Lu.

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,240
I've found it.

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,920
Records show over a decade ago,

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,480
the Corn Poppy appeared in Rong City.

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,400
According to informants,

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,000
(the Corn Poppy is mainly circulating
in brothels.)

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,680
(When girls take it
and the drug takes effect,)

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,520
(they become pliable puppets.)

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,880
(During withdrawal,
they'll obey like pets.)

42
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,920
(It gives them hallucinogenic effects.)

43
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,360
(They could go insane and even die.)

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,120
(Wealthy merchants and officials)

45
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,360
(use the drug to manipulate
each other for profit.)

=Episode 1=

47
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,920
Shen, cheers.

48
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,480
My girls here

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
are professionally trained.

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,080
Do whatever you want with them.

51
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,360
Girls! Come in now!

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,560
Move inside.

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,280
Keep moving.

54
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,360
Come on in.

55
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,320
Come.

56
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,280
Master Meng.

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,800
These are the prettiest girls

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
I could find for you.

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,600
If you're unsatisfied...

60
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,560
(Zhang Wange?)

61
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,880
I can't help.

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,360
(Lu Ye?)

63
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,840
(Zhang Wange.)

64
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,600
I need to talk to you.

65
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,720
Well,

66
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,200
I like you.

67
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,960
Lu Ye,

68
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,720
I don't seek wealth or status,

69
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,480
but my partner should
be a business elite

70
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,120
or an accomplished scholar.

71
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,800
Never some street thug.

72
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,840
I'm leaving.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,320
Lu, are you satisfied?

74
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,200
Yes.

75
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,120
The girl next to

76
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
the one in purple.

77
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,440
Come on.

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,160
Take good care of this gentleman.

79
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,040
Come on.

80
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,280
Don't you know the rules?

81
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,040
What's your name?

82
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,320
Rose.

83
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,920
Rose?

84
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,680
Aren't you drinking with Lu?

85
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,160
It's getting late.

86
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,000
You help Lu upstairs to the guest room.

87
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,680
Sir, I'll take my leave.

88
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,200
Okay.

89
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,960
Follow him.

90
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,720
Yes.

91
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,160
Why are you doing this?

92
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,480
Why ask, sir?

93
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,640
I need to earn a living wage.

94
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,040
Zhang Wange.

95
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,168
You wanted to be a painter!

96
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,680
Why are you here?

97
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,520
Is it strange?

98
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,560
I do this job to survive.

99
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,600
People must meet basic needs.

100
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,440
Don't move.

101
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,440
Someone's outside.

102
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,080
Relax.

103
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,520
No matter what happens,

104
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,560
stay silent.

105
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,040
Go.

106
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,360
Tell Master about this.

107
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,840
Sorry about this.

108
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,200
It was urgent.

109
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,240
I didn't mean to offend you.

110
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,960
(So, he's married.)

111
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,000
Why do all men

112
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
apologize after getting out of bed?

113
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,440
Leave with me.

114
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,560
This place isn't right for you.

115
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,200
Remember.

116
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Stay hidden in the room.

117
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Don't go outside.

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,800
Zhang Wange.

119
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,040
Zhao Si will take you away later.

120
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,680
You'd better behave yourself.

121
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,600
You hear me?

122
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,640
So noisy.

123
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,720
Prepare to die!

124
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,600
Zhang Wange!

125
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,480
Someone! Get a doctor!

126
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,920
Lu Ye.

127
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,280
Don't save me.

128
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
Why?

129
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,160
So, you're a policeman.

130
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,720
Yes.

131
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,680
I am a policeman.

132
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,680
So, don't worry.

133
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,440
You will be okay.

134
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,200
You'll be fine.

135
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,920
(I've been living a meaningless life.)

136
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,280
(Thank you)

137
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,720
(for ending this miserable life.)

138
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,480
(Wasn't I shot?)

139
00:12:16,256 --> 00:12:17,920
(Work ID: Screenwriter)

140
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,960
(Rongjie News Agency?)

141
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,840
(Three years back in time?)

142
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
(It's Rong City.)

143
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,920
(I'm home.)

144
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:12,928
(Wanguan House)

145
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,320
Mom.

146
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,520
Mom.

147
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,880
(Mom.)

148
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,200
(I still came back too late.)

149
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,800
(It was him. He attempted to harass me.)

150
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,400
Zhang Wange.

151
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,920
He's evil!

152
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,800
They saw you attack me.

153
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,000
You'll rot in jail!

154
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,800
I swear!

155
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,920
Chief Editor,

156
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,400
please forgive her ignorance.

157
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:48,800
Mom.

158
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,680
Wange is still young.

159
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,360
Get up.

160
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
I did nothing wrong.

161
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
A prison sentence would ruin her life!

162
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,080
Mom.

163
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,200
I need to see Pei Xun.

164
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,640
Help me find Pei Xun.

165
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,440
Mr. Pei,

166
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,680
Zhang Wange wants to see you.

167
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,040
(Just confess,)

168
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,760
(and she'll suffer less.)

169
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,080
All the girls are here.

170
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,120
Take that one.

171
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
(She'll be the first test subject
for the Corn Poppy.)

172
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,880
Zhang Wange.

173
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,600
You deliver this.

174
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
Okay.

175
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,120
Chief Editor wants to see you.

176
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,040
Alright.

177
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,320
(I really traveled back
three years ago.)

178
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,920
(Let the changes begin now.)

179
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,280
Why are you standing so far away?

180
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,480
Here's another manuscript.

181
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,760
Revise it.

182
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,800
Alright.

183
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,320
Wange,

184
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,320
I believe you're smart enough

185
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,240
to know which choice

186
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,800
will make your life easier.

187
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,840
Let go.

188
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,920
Don't be mad.

189
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,920
Put this aside.

190
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,920
Let go!

191
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,040
Let go!

192
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,640
Your mother asked me to look after you.

193
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,920
You're a young girl.

194
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,760
Let go of me!

195
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,800
Why work so hard?

196
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,680
What do you say?

197
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,440
Stop pretending.

198
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,960
Stop acting like a graduate
from a top college.

199
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,680
How dare you!

200
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,920
Stop pissing me off!

201
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,320
I said I'd fire you for poor work ethic.

202
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,480
She came in trying to seduce me!

203
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,760
You're twisting the truth!

204
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,480
How dare you glare at me!

205
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:50,195
(Pei Xun,
the Second Son of the Pei Family)

206
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,760
Zhang Wange.

207
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,560
Why do I always find you
in such a sorry state?

208
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,040
Not getting up?

209
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,200
(Pei Xun.)

210
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,600
Pei Xun.

211
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,920
Why did you give my painting
to Zhou Nian?

212
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,600
Answer me!

213
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,080
Say something!

214
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,360
Thank you.

215
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,960
No need to waste words on scum like him.

216
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,480
Who are you?

217
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,400
How dare you hit me!

218
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,600
Get out of the way!

219
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,000
Mr. Pei, what brings you here?

220
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,560
Mr. Pei?

221
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,520
Take him away!

222
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,280
I apologize, Mr. Pei.

223
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,680
Behave!

224
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,320
Please spare me.

225
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,000
Thank you. I'm glad you are here.

226
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,280
You're welcome.

227
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,080
After all, I'm the second son
of the Pei family.

228
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,200
Hello.

229
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,400
Mr. Pei, I've encountered some trouble.

230
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,960
You know anyone at the police station?

231
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,440
Mr. Pei.

232
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,120
Miss Zhou invites you
to tonight's banquet for her fiance.

233
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,920
(A banquet?)

234
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,600
Lu.

235
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,080
Recently, many families have reported

236
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,920
missing girls.

237
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,440
By the way,

238
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,000
since I helped you so much,

239
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,360
how do you thank me?

240
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,800
How would you like me to thank you?

241
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,080
Be my date

242
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
and join me for dinner.

243
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,920
Okay.

244
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,920
Lu.

245
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,560
What's wrong?

246
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,000
Nothing.

247
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,720
Let's go.

248
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,200
(Since you were born,)

249
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,080
(your life)

250
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,280
(has been doomed.)

251
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,160
(This is my painting.)

252
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,800
Pei Xun.

253
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,400
Why did you give my painting
to Zhou Nian?

254
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,040
(Your theft)

255
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,160
(made my life miserable.)

256
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,760
(From now on,)

257
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,320
(I'll take back)

258
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
(what belongs to me.)

259
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,840
Go with me

260
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,520
next time.

261
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:41,960
You'll see.

262
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,640
Really?

263
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,200
Sorry, guys, I'm late.

264
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,640
Pei Xun, you're so late.

265
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:51,322

266
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,840
Who is this lady?

267
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
Do you want to tell him?

268
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,960
