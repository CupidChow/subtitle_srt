Sir, this is for you.

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,240
Lu.

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,280
A letter.

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,760
A letter?

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,240
A little beggar delivered it.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,000
(Wanle Club)
The missing people seems to be here.

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
This batch of girls
looks quite charming.

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,200
Before shipping them off,

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,200
why don't we three have some fun?

20
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,200
Sure.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,280
As usual?

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,920
As usual.

23
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,040
Who are you?

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,160
The missing girls are here.

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,080
Escort them safely.

26
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,480
Yes.

27
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,120
Lu.

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,120
We found a female corpse
in the backyard.

29
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,360
And...

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,000
What?

31
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,280
She's naked.

32
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,120
Lu.

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,600
Lu! Lu, stop it!

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,160
We have to interrogate him.

35
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,960
If he's dead,
we can't explain to the chief.

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,280
What to explain?

37
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,320
During arrests,

38
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,520
injuries are normal.

39
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:06,636
=Episode 4=

40
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,040
Mr. Pei.

41
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,160
How about we play that old game?

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,800
Boring.

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,000
With a beauty here,

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,200
why would it be boring?

45
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,920
Didn't you say

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,280
women are like clothing?

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,560
Why cherish a piece of clothes?

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,360
Seriously?

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,680
How about this?

50
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,400
If I win this round,

51
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,440
have your girl

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,760
give me a kiss.

53
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,360
Consider it lending me some luck. Deal?

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,800
Dare not?

55
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
I reject.

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,000
Since your bet involves me,

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,960
I'll be the one betting with you.

58
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,560
You?

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Do you know how?

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,080
Happen to know a bit.

61
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,360
Fine. Losers accept defeat.

62
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,600
If you lose,

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
don't cry

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,000
and refuse to kiss me.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Of course, if I lose,

66
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,360
I'm all yours.

67
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,560
Deal.

68
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,960
You really know how?

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,320
Zhang Yi grew up

70
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,640
playing billiard.

71
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
If I said I don't,

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,960
would you two end this game?

73
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,960
Just one round.

74
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,840
After you.

75
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,720
Are you fooling me around?

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,760
So, what do you want?

77
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
Money? Whatever.

78
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,840
Or I can

79
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,280
give you a kiss instead.

80
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,680
Since you lost,

81
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,440
how about barking like a dog?

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,800
Zhang Wange, are you insane?

83
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,160
Dare not?

84
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,160
Just barking like a dog.

85
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,880
You said losers accept defeat.

86
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,400
Zhang Wange.

87
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,040
You're taking it too seriously.

88
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,400
How about

89
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,480
you give him

90
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,640
a kiss?

91
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,000
You!

92
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,760
Don't try to hold justice

93
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,400
if you can't help him yourself.

94
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,800
You and Pei Xun
bet with me as collateral,

95
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,200
without even asking me.

96
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,000
I won't be your gaming chip.

97
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,800
Next time,

98
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
pick someone

99
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,040
who doesn't take it seriously.

100
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
It'll save you trouble.

101
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,680
Zhang Wange.

102
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,160
Zhang Wange.

103
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,560
Don't be mad.

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,840
He was joking.

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,160
But I don't find this funny.

106
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,680
I can placate you,

107
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,960
but don't push your luck.

108
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,840
(The Pei family's downfall is coming.)

109
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,320
(Pei Xun, it's time for you to suffer.)

110
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,280
Wange.

111
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,360
Mr. Song's fiancée is here.

112
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,920
Prepare one more cup of coffee.

113
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,360
Okay.

114
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,280
Yanzhou.

115
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,520
Your fiancée is right in front of you.

116
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
How can you still focus on work?

117
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,720
Isn't your exhibition debut imminent?

118
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,400
Don't you go back and prepare?

119
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,040
I just want to spend more time with you.

120
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,320
Why are you so unromantic? Workaholic.

121
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,000
This is a workplace.

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,800
Yanzhou.

123
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,320
I heard you've invited

124
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
the renowned

125
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,560
Mr. Karen Pieno

126
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,680
in this jewelry design

127
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,480
project.

128
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,720
His design style

129
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,840
is always unique

130
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
and inspired.

131
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,160
I really admire him.

132
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,840
Yanzhou, you know.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,160
I've always been

134
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
passionate about jewelry design.

135
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,920
I've even attempted

136
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,200
multiple independent creations.

137
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,040
How about letting me

138
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,760
take charge of

139
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,320
the design project

140
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:49,920
this time?

141
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,520
Okay?

142
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,600
The design concept isn't finalized yet,

143
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,160
but decisions require
careful consideration.

144
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,200
If you have draft designs,

145
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,640
you can submit them first.

146
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,720
I'll have the team review.

147
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,000
Why are you so rigid?

148
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,880
With our relationship,

149
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,240
can't you bend the rules for me?

150
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,080
Yanzhou.

151
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,600
Mr. Song.

152
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,240
Your meeting
with Mr. Gao of Weina Jewels

153
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,680
is scheduled for 10:00 PM tonight

154
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,600
at Lanhai Bay.

155
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,720
Don't try to hold justice

156
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,280
if you can't help him yourself.

157
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,960
You!

158
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,800
Did you study jewelry design?

159
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,800
Yes.

160
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,800
Join me for tonight's meeting.

161
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,640
Okay.

162
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,600
Miss Zhang.

163
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,440
Yanzhou barely ate

164
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,400
anything this morning.

165
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,080
Could you please
go to the café next door

166
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,960
to buy two cakes?

167
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,840
Thank you.

168
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,280
No need for formalities.

169
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,440
It's my duty.

170
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,160
Zhang Wange.

171
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,320
Have a chat.

172
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:37,824
Okay.

173
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:39,640
Go ahead.

174
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,200
What will it take for you to leave?

175
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,880
If I said

176
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,480
I want you to admit your plagiarism

177
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,000
and publicly apologize, would you dare?

178
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Plagiarism?

179
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,160
So what?

180
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,120
Are you planning
to bring up the past again?

181
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,000
Or do you think

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,640
that joining Chenda

183
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,880
gives you power over me?

184
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,040
Zhang Wange.

185
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,920
You're being naive.

186
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,920
Right.

187
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,240
You're now Rong City's chief designer.

188
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,520
You have numerous creations,

189
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,680
and host many exhibitions.

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,320
What are you afraid of?

191
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,680
Does my

192
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,640
very presence

193
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
make you remember

194
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,560
you're a thief?

195
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,840
Shut up!

196
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,840
Zhang Wange.

197
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,200
Are you going to go against me?

198
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,040
I guarantee

199
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,280
you won't even know

200
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,160
how you'll end up.

201
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,880
(As expected,)

202
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,960
(evildoers will never feel remorse.)

203
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,360
Go against you?

204
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,800
I just want to do my job well

205
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,040
and assist Mr. Song in small matters.

206
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,880
If there's nothing else, Miss Zhou,

207
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,040
I'll take my leave.

208
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,240
You approach Yanzhou

209
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,760
to get back at me, right?

210
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,720
Miss Zhou, you got me wrong.

211
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,920
I've never thought to get back at you.

212
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
After all,

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,720
rotten fruits

214
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,600
will fall to the ground on their own.

215
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,280
It's a karma.

216
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,440
I don't need to do it myself.

217
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,720
(Zhang Wange!)

218
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:32,800
(The World)

219
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:48,160
(Chenda Jewels Banquet)

220
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,560
Miss Zhang,

221
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,240
this is my newly hired assistant,

222
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,400
Zhang Wange.

223
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,560
All upcoming business

224
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,960
will be managed by her.

225
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,280
Thank you.

226
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,680
Hope you'll

227
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,000
work well.

228
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,400
Miss Zhou.

229
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,240
(Zhang Wange.)

230
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,400
(I have plenty of tricks)

231
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,880
(to ruin your reputation again.)

232
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,200
Come here. Come on.

233
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,720
Chat with her.

234
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,240
Miss Zhang,

235
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,680
thank you in advance for...

236
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,000
Miss.

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,480
This is from that gentleman.

238
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:46,944
(Tang Qi)

239
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,360
Hello.

240
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,120
Mr. Song

241
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,720
seems to be out of wine.

242
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,200
Mr. Song.

243
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,040
To the success

244
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,920
of our collaboration.

245
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,080
(Zhou Nian.)

246
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,440
(The trap you carefully set)

247
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,880
(boosts my plan.)

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,520
Mr. Song, are you alright?

249
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,880
Tell Fang Cheng to call a doctor.

250
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,680
Alright.

251
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,040
Don't let anyone know.

252
00:14:11,872 --> 00:14:12,760
Where's Yanzhou?

253
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,200
Wasn't he

254
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,400
with you?

255
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:22,784
Do you like it?

256
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,640
Why are you here?

257
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
Where's Zhang Wange?

258
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,800
She...

259
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,160
She was just there.

260
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,040
Where is she now?

261
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,400
Don't panic. I'll go look for her.

262
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,640
The drug I used is potent.

263
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,600
She can't go far.

264
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,160
(Yanzhou and Zhang Wange are missing.)

265
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,440
(Could it be...?)

266
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,000
Mr. Song, what's wrong?

267
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,040
What's wrong, Mr. Song?

268
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:30,760
Mr. Song, I'm not your fiancée.

269
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,872
I'm Zhang Wange.

270
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:32,800
Song...

271
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,400
(Zhou Nian,
you lit the torch in the maze)

272
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,600
(that showed me the shortcut.)

273
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,440
(How dare someone
bring this kind of thing here?)

274
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,480
He is Tang Qi.

275
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,160
He put the drug

276
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,240
in the wine.

277
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:13,280
Who's behind it?

278
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,080
It was...

279
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,000
Miss Zhou.

280
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,600
You'd handle it.

281
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,280
I am innocent!

282
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,400
It wasn't me!

283
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,200
I am innocent!

284
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,680
Spare me!

285
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,720
I beg you, please!

286
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,520
I don't want to die!

287
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:30,080
(Chenda Capital)

288
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,480
Where's she?

289
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,040
She...

290
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,200
Wange submitted her resignation.

291
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,680
Mr. Song.

292
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,320
Zhang Wange.

293
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,920
Zhang Wange.

294
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,320
Open the door!

295
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,080
I know you're inside.

296
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,960
Let's talk.

297
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,600
Mr. Song.

298
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,080
I've already resigned.

299
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,200
But I didn't approve it.

300
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,520
Thus, the resignation is invalid.

301
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,880
What do you want?

302
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,240
About last night,

303
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,600
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,040
Nothing happened between us last night.

305
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,800
I'll go to work.

306
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,600
I'm really curious

307
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,040
about your purpose

308
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,240
for coming to Chenda.

309
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,000
Whatever it is,

310
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,240
we're simply

311
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,800
using each other to get what we need.

312
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:18,040
