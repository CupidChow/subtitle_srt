00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,880
(I could find for you.)

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,760
(Zhang Wange!)

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,600
Who is

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,960
this lady?

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,440
Zhang Wange.

19
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,600
Pei Xun.

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,320
Come with me.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,840
You know my history with Zhang Wange.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,000
Why did you bring her here?

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,960
What history?

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,560
You mean three years ago,

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,160
your internationally famous debut work

26
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,240
was actually plagiarized.

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,720
Or

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
you, a chief designer

29
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,920
in Rong City, have less talent

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,280
than some college student?

31
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,720
Shut up!

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,240
Stop throwing tantrums here.

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,400
What if Zhang Wange hears

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,640
and gets back at you?

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,600
If your fiance knew

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,200
your work was just stolen,

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,400
do you think he'd still marry you?

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,360
Pei Xun.

39
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,240
What exactly do you want?

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,520
Are you

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,520
using this childish trick
to get back at me?

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Yanzhou, you're finally here.

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,240
(Your internationally famous debut work)

44
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,720
(The previous life)
was actually plagiarized.

45
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,240
Shut up!

46
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,000
You know my history with Zhang Wange.

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,720
Why did you bring her here?

48
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,320
Pei Xun.

49
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:01,320
(Song Yanzhou,
Chairman of Chenda Capital)

50
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,400
(Song Yanzhou?)

51
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,320
(So, he's Zhou Nian's fiance.)

52
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,560
Sorry, something urgent held me up.

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,000
Song Yanzhou.

54
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,960
I heard you took over Chenda Capital.

55
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,120
You're well-informed.

56
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,600
Before your return, everyone said

57
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,080
that you would inherit Song Group.

58
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,160
You never play by the book

59
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,600
and took over Chenda instead.

60
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,400
People must wonder

61
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,800
if Master Song

62
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,920
doesn't like you.

63
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,920
Whatever.

64
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,960
It's true, anyway.

65
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,040
Yanzhou, is the takeover going smoothly?

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,400
Too many old-timers make things hard.

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,120
I need to bring in fresh blood.

68
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,360
How rare! An unapproachable man

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,920
(You Rui)
is taking care of a lady.

70
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Nian.

71
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,720
(Zhang Yi)
You're impressive.

72
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,120
Song Yanzhou, a stone-faced guy,

73
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,480
ignores everyone else.

74
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,000
How do you tolerate him?

75
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,680
He doesn't ignore people.

76
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,160
Stop asking.

77
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,800
Couples need privacy.

78
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,480
Pei Xun.

79
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,680
How did you two meet?

80
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,840
We...

81
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,640
Let go!

82
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,680
Come with me.

83
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,360
Stop pretending.

84
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,520
Let go of me!

85
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,840
Who did this?

86
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,640
Well,

87
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,680
Master Xun.

88
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,840
Sorry.

89
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,440
Sorry.

90
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,320
Miss.

91
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,200
Your name?

92
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,720
Don't let Master Xun
help you for nothing.

93
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,040
I'm Zhang Wange,

94
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
a student at Alice Design Institute.

95
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
You study design?

96
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,920
Yeah.

97
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,320
(So, from that moment on,)

98
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,240
(you planned to use me?)

99
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,360
A hero saved a beauty.

100
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,520
Good for you. Cheers.

101
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,640
(Pei Xun.)

102
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,600
(Zhou Nian.)

103
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,080
(Thieves shouldn't live gloriously.)

104
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,200
(It's time to have my revenge.)

105
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,320
Is it okay to leave early?

106
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't worry about it.

107
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,520
Do you want to eat something?

108
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,000
Actually, I'm hungry.

109
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,400
I mean,

110
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,680
at the party,

111
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,840
I felt shy.

112
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,280
Okay.

113
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,520
(Pei Xun, in this chess game,)

114
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,800
(I'm making the first move
with black pieces.)

115
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,920
Mr. Pei, let me toast you.

116
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,720
The first glass

117
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,520
is to thank you for helping me
in the restaurant that day.

118
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,240
The second glass

119
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,440
for what happened at the agency today.

120
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,560
You witnessed the same situation again.

121
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,680
I can't help wondering

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,960
why you always encounter the same thing.

123
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,760
Playing hero is out of date.

124
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
I don't know.

125
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,480
I think

126
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,720
no woman

127
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,280
wants to experience such things.

128
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,040
(Without a good family or ability
as armor,)

129
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,240
(she's like a rose without thorns.)

130
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,520
(Everyone wants to pluck it at will.)

131
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,480
The third glass...

132
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,280
Pei Xun,

133
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,600
thank you.

134
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,200
(Thank you and Zhou Nian.)

135
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,920
(Thank you both)

136
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,480
(for staining my life
with indelible marks.)

137
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:28,440
(Thank you for making my life)

138
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,280
(crash down)

139
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,280
(and sink into the mire.)

140
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,320
You lost your job.

141
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,960
What's your plan?

142
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,480
Just find a new job.

143
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,760
Jobs are always available

144
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,160
in this big city.

145
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,560
Just move on.

146
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,040
Of course.

147
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,480
At least, I encountered you again.

148
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,560
So, I'm already lucky enough.

149
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,840
Put me down.

150
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,160
I want more drinks.

151
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,600
I want more drinks.

152
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,600
Stand still.

153
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,880
Stand still.

154
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,840
Stand still.

155
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,760
I feel terrible.

156
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
So, you can't drink more.

157
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,800
Why?

158
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,360
Why am I always the one
being trampled underfoot?

159
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,360
Why?

160
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,560
Why do I always have bad luck?

161
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,240
Why?

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Pei Xun.

163
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,040
Help me.

164
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,960
Please.

165
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Hmm?

166
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,040
Pei Xun.

167
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,760
What can I help you with?

168
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,200
Help me.

169
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,040
Pei Xun, help me.

170
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,080
Pei Xun.

171
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,920
Helping you

172
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,480
means helping myself.

173
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,880
What's up?

174
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,600
Pei Xun.

175
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,480
Miss Zhou.

176
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,120
Pei Xun, have you gone mad?

177
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,440
Cut ties with Zhang Wange!

178
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,480
Why should I listen to you?

179
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,040
(Zhou Nian, the first move of this game)

180
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,320
(is to sow discord between you,
Song Yanzhou, and Pei Xun.)

181
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,480
(I'll make the one you love
and the one who love you)

182
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,800
(abandon you.)

183
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,960
What are you waiting for?

184
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,240
Come have breakfast.

185
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,200
Hmm.

186
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,520
Thanks.

187
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,520
Why was I at your place last night?

188
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't remember?

189
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,280
You forgot you vomited all over me?

190
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,480
I'm sorry

191
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,760
for troubling you.

192
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,720
It's alright.

193
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,720
I kept my soiled clothes unwashed.

194
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
You wash them later.

195
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,600
Alright.

196
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,720
Did I cause you

197
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,080
any other troubles?

198
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,640
Pei Xun.

199
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,800
Not really.

200
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,680
Good then.

201
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,440
What's new?

202
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,800
Job ads.

203
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,400
(If I place her)

204
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,960
(in his company,)

205
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,080
(it should be interesting.)

206
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,440
Want to join Chenda Capital?

207
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,280
Can I?

208
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,160
If yes, how will you thank me?

209
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,520
(He took the bait as expected.)

210
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,520
(Chenda Capital)

211
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,040
Mr. Song, here's the thing.

212
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,200
The Xinhua Pharmaceuticals
just called me,

213
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,000
saying that Hongying Capital
signed the contract

214
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,400
at 20 percent above market price

215
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,600
with them.

216
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,400
Mr. Song, they went back on their word.

217
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
I didn't anticipate this situation.

218
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,240
When did Xinhua contact you?

219
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240
Half an hour ago.

220
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,480
How long has Hongying Capital

221
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,800
been in talks with Xinhua?

222
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,680
Well...

223
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,040
Mr. Yang.

224
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,720
You've been a project manager

225
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,800
for a long time, right?

226
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,880
Mr. Song, rest assured,

227
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,200
I'll get to the bottom of this.

228
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,600
One day. You have one day.

229
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,840
Otherwise, you're dismissed.

230
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,600
Understood.

231
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,800
(A complete overhaul)

232
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,480
(can't be achieved overnight.)

233
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,160
(I need fresh talent.)

234
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,400
I heard your company is hiring.

235
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,000
Let me recommend someone.

236
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,400
Who?

237
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,320
Zhang Wange.

238
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,720
The girl I brought

239
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,520
to the party.

240
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,640
Are you using me

241
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,480
to please your girl?

242
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,920
Of course not.

243
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,400
I'm just making the introduction.

244
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,680
Her ability will determine the outcome.

245
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,480
Fine. Let her come to Chenda
for an interview.

246
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,160
(Zhang Wange.)

247
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,120
(Zhou Nian.)

248
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,928
(Chenda Capital)

249
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,200
(Zhou Nian.)

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,120
(From now on,)

251
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,240
(you're my dream.)

252
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,400
(I'll paint you)

253
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,080
(into my manuscripts.)

254
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:08,485
(Fang Cheng, Secretary of Song Yanzhou)

255
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,600
Hello.

256
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,161
(Employment Application Documents)

257
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,640
Are you Zhang Wange?

258
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,680
Yes.

259
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,000
Zhang Wange.

260
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,600
Observe that man ahead.

261
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,800
He likes coffee,

262
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,720
indicating

263
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,520
that he values refined living.

264
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,400
Moreover, he's left-handed

265
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,128
as he habitually holds newspapers
with his left hand.

266
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Congrats, Zhang Wange.

267
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,200
I hope we can work well together.

268
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,600
So, I'm hired?

269
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,400
Yes.

270
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,320
Thank you.

271
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,720
Thank you.

272
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,520
Zhang Wange.

273
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,640
Can't you understand?

274
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,400
If this painting stays with you,

275
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,200
nobody will know it.

276
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,080
However,

277
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,760
I can

278
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,600
make it well-known.

279
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,080
Therefore,

280
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,320
sometimes, the artist's name

281
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,040
matters less

282
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,840
than their status.

283
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,200
What beautiful hands!

284
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,080
What a pity that you'll
never paint again with them.
