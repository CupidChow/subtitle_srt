Mr. Lu,

are you sure you want her to see

00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120

61
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,320
No.

Impossible!

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,120
How can you be so sure?

68
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,120
I saw her at Lanhai Bay that day.

69
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,000

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,080

72
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,600
to look for her?

73
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,480
Yes.

74
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,200
Fine.

75
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,320
I have things to do.

76
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,120

Thank you for saving Mo Ran.

80
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,400
I saved her

81
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,920
because I don't want you to lose

82
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,120
another person important.

83

85
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,680
You saw me at Lanhai Bay.

86
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,640
Right.

87
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,920
Tell me!

88
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,200
What did you see?

89
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,800
I didn't see anything.

90
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,240
Why did you lie to him?

91
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,520
Because I trust you.

92
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,280
You have reasons

93
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,520
for whatever you do.

94
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,240
Master Jiu,

95
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,720
Master Qi

96
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,920
failed the mission.

97
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,680
Where is she now?

98
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,600
Lu Ye let her

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,080
stay in a woman's place.

100
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,800
Lu Ye again!

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
Seems she defected long ago.

102
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,480
Otherwise, Lu Ye wouldn't risk his life.

103
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,480
Several strongholds in Rong City

104
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,920
were discovered one after another,

105
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,880
which is probably related to her.

106
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,000
Bring her back,

107
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,240
even if just her corpse.

108
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:50,960
Yes.

109
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,160
Before meeting him,

110
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,920
I was just an orphan.

111
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,680
One day,

112
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,400
he told me

113
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,120
under his protection,

114
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,320
no one would bully me again.

115
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,200
I worked hard to learn opera

116
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,280
and served him.

117
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,720
Maybe what I did

118
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,120
was not good enough.

119
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,920
Now he's abandoned me.

120
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,560
Is that person Sun Er?

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,680
Thank you, Wange.

122
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,400
Thanks for keeping my secret.

123
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,760
I'll leave here tomorrow.

124
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,920
Where to?

125
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,200
(I want to ask him why.)

126
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,840
Since they want me dead,

127
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,400
they won't give up easily.

128
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,200
If I stay here,

129
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,960
you'll be in danger.

130
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,600
If so, you mustn't leave.

131
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,120
Mo Ran,

132
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,080
I want you to live.

133
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,800
Look carefully.

134
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,200
Recognize them?

135
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,520
No.

136
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,040
Fine.

137
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,040
Let me jog your memory.

138
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,600
These men

139
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,240
were about to kill Mo Ran

140
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
when my team caught them.

141
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,440
Tell me,

142
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,760
if I turn you over now,

143
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,880
could it be...

144
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,120
You!

145
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,160
No!

146
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,560
Don't hand me over.

147
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,200
Okay, tell me.

148
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,880
Do you know them?

149
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,160
They work for Master Jiu.

150
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,560
He Jiu?

151
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,480
Yes.

152
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,840
Why would he want Mo Ran dead?

153
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,160
Mo Ran works for Master Jiu too.

154
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,840
She's one of his secretly
trained assassins.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,240
Sun Er

156
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,400
was also killed by her.

157
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,920
What about Meng Lixian?

158
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,800
Perhaps she

159
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,640
messed up his plan.

160
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,600
She was killed by Pei Qishan.

161
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,400
All his funding comes from
the Meng family.

162
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,800
When Meng Lixian refused to aid He Jiu,

163
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,600
he had her eliminated.

164
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,640
Mr. Lu,

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,400
I-I swear I know nothing!

166
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,080
You figured

167
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,640
it out yourself!

168
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,120
So I'm right.

169
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,040
Mr. Lu,

170
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I've told you everything.

171
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,760
All I did for Master Jiu
was to get some women.

172
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,120
Other matters weren't my concern!

173
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,480
(So the missing girls)

174
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,520
(was He Jiu's doing?)

175
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,800
Please don't turn me over!

176
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,040
What did I promise you?

177
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,800
Trash.

178
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,240
Lu Ye!

179
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,600
You dare trick me?

180
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,640
He Qidong didn't inform you, did he?

181
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,280
Don't act all righteous!

182
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,120
The people you captured before

183
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,800
were actually Master Jiu's gifts

184
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,520
to boost your career.

185
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,520
Say that again.

186
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,840
What?

187
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,480
You can't believe it

188
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,040
or won't believe it?

189
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,080
If not,

190
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,200
go ask He Qidong.

191
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,040
(I need to settle some matters.)

192
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,680
(Wait for me.)

193
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
(I'll help you search)

194
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,600
(for that friend you lost.)

195
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,120
I've already found her.

196
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,400
Wange.

197
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,200
Mo Ran is suspicious.

198
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,600
It's not Sun Er's remnants after her,

199
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,600
but He Jiu.

200
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
She works for He Jiu.

201
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,160
Impossible!

202
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,200
She doesn't serve He Jiu!

203
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,640
Do you really know her

204
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,960
or know He Jiu?

205
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,520
You don't understand at all.

206
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,400
I know everything about her.

207
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,240
Right,

208
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,640
I don't know

209
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,320
why you're shrouded in secrets.

210
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,320
You're standing right before me,

211
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,240
yet why does it feel

212
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
we're worlds apart?

213
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,040
Zhang Wange,

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,720

What I must face now

219
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,320
is an abyss.

220
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,840

You've been with me for over a decade.

00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,320
I keep no useless people.

That useless person

232
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,280
hadn't even felt

Corn Poppy's effects

235

So they

236

were all your test subjects?

Failed subjects.

241
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,560
The club is just a facade.

242
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,840
I want control

They weren't from powerful families!
