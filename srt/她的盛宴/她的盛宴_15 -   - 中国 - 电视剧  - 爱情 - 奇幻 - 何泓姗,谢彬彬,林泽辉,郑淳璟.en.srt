(Personnel Transfer Order
of Rong City Police Office)

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,800
(Personnel Transfer Order)
What does this mean?

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,360
This is an order from higher-ups.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,480
Every district has quotas

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,560
for people with 5 years of service
and a third-class merit citation.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
After deliberation,

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,000
our department

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,760
has decided

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,720
to transfer you there

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,720
once you recover.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,400
But my witness just started

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
showing improvement.

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,360
But this is

26
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,480
an order from higher-ups.

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,320
Fine, I'll go.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,760
But at least let me finish

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,120
the case I'm working on.

30
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,400
The department

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,240
can't function without you?

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,480
Many would crave this opportunity!

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,080
If I were ten years younger,

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,240
I'd be transferred.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,800
Did he have a hand in this?

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,760
Who?

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,560
He Renlai?

38
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,920
Lower your voice!

39
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,080
Documents like these

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,840
require signatures
from higher authorities.

41
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,280
Does this count?

42
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,920
Fine.

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,040
I understand.

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,080
That woman brought from Beizhou

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,160
will be discharged soon.

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,960
Could you help me pick up that painting?

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,400
Hello,

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,880
this is mine.

51
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,080
I heard someone was killed last night.

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,360
Who was it?

53
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,280
Not sure.

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,400
Seems like a young girl.

55
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,400
How terrifying.

56
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,840
Absolutely horrifying!

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
How could someone
be killed in a hospital?

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,760
You're in the bloom of youth.

59
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,480
After this is over,

60
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,040
everything will get better.

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,360
Really?

62
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,192
Yes.

63
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Of course it's true.

64
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,920
Yeah.

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,600
Okay.

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,400
Miss,

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,680
could you teach me?

68
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,560
Of course.

69
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,760
I'll teach you later.

70
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,360
Thank you.

71
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,200
How could they do such a thing

72
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,520
in a hospital?

73
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,680
Wange.

74
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:15,360
- Wange!
- Taoyue!

75
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,024
Taoyue!

76
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,200
- Taoyue!
- Calm down.

77
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,640
Taoyue!

78
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,712
You need to calm down.

79
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:20,640
- Calm down
- Taoyue!

80
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,760
Taoyue is dead.

81
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
She's already dead!

82
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,680
How could this happen?

83
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,480
How could this happen?

84
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,400
She's dead.

85
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,440
But wasn't she...

86
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,440
Wasn't she your witness?

87
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Shouldn't you have protected her?

88
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,520
Why did it end like this?

89
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,200
Answer me!

90
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,840
Answer me, Lu Ye!

91
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,440
Answer me!

92
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,560
Answer me!

93
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:55,168

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,640
This place in the painting

- Yes.

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,480
don't match what I submitted.

any clues

142
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,440

They take no action.

146
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,920
I will.

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,568

00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,960
Where's the case file and the warrant?

152
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,360
Lu.

153
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,600
The chief said

154
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,400
if you refuse the transfer,

155
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,400
you won't deal with any cases.

156
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,344
He didn't hand it over? Alright.

157
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,520
I'll investigate.

158
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,408

160
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,320
Why interfere with my transfer?

161
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,720
I'm doing this for your own good.

162
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,240
Director He,

163
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,320
stop meddling in my business

164
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,680
in Rong City.

165
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,920
You are

166
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,680
still so reckless.

167
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,440
I'm just securing your career.

168
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
That's why I think

169
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,680
you need this transfer.

170
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,800
It's my own business.

171
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,040
I'll handle it myself.

172
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,120
But is this transfer order for my sake

173
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,280
or for your own benefit?

174
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,400
Sending me to the capital for years

175
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,840
is just to build your power base.

176
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,240
If you're so ambitious,

177
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,040
you can groom your own loyalists.

178
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,200
Lu Ye!

179
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,360
I'm over fifty and earned my position.

180
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,680
Using legitimate methods

181
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,400
to clear my child's path

182
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,680
isn't criminal.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,760
Like you said,

184
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,480
it's for your own child.

185
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,200
Am I your son?

186
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,920
When you stopped investigating culprits
poisoning my mom with Corn Poppy,

187
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,040
I ceased being your son.

188
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,720
Director He,

189
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,520
stop these self-destructive schemes.

190
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,248

191
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,200

192
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,760
he still resents you.

193
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,040
I knew it.

194
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,240
More fiery than his mother.

195
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,840
That's a good thing.

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,592
Go.

197
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,240
Monitor ones who approach him.

198
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:02,080
Yes.

199
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,760
Breaking news!

200
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,040
(Rongjie News Agency)
Pei family upheaval in Rong City!

201
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
After two sons

202
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,560
died successively in Rong City,

203
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,200
Pei Qishan has been gravely ill.

204
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,680
Water.

205
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,600
Water.

206
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,040
You...

207
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,760
Father,

208
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,080
I'm here.

209
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
How are you?

210
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,240
Am I

211
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,560
a human or ghost?

212
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,800
Of course I am a human.

213
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,240
I am still alive.

214
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,400
My two brothers are gone.

215
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,480
So now only

216
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,000
I will attend to you.

217
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,160
The doctor said

218
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,920
you'd avoid emotional agitation.

219
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,160
Though not caring about Ms. Tang,

220
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,880
you should consider your only son,

221
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,040
right?

222
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,920
Was it you...

223
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,800
Was it you...

224
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,600
What?

225
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,320
Are you asking
if I killed my two brothers?

226
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,520
They got off too easily.

227
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,200
I wanted to leave

228
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,440
a memento for you.

229
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,480
Unfortunately,

230
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,520
not even tissue remains could be found.

231
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,280
So, Dad,

232
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,360
you need to stay alive.

233
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,880
Because you're my only remaining family.

234
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,600
You...

235
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,880
You'll face retribution!

236
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,120
Retribution!

237
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,320
The housekeeper serving Pei Qishan
for nearly ten years

238
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,400
said, before I made my move,

239
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,760
a secret letter arrived at his estate.

240
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,160
So,

241
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,400
your plan was leaked in advance?

242
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,280
Any leads on who did it?

243
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,000
Only a handful knew
about this operation.

244
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,480
All of them died on the same day.

245
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,920
After your mother's accident,

246
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,120
someone sent me an anonymous letter,

247
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,720
claiming Pei Qishan was responsible.

248
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,280
Could these two incidents be

249
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,640
the work by a single person?

250
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,640
He has been lurking behind you,

251
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,720
monitoring your every move.

252
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,720
Xun,

253
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,160
this shadow runs deep.

254
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,560
What about Miss Zhang by your side?

255
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,640
It's not her.

256
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,440
I'm just asking casually.

257
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,480
When you were injured in that car crash,

258
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,240
she stayed by your side.

259
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,760
No matter what,

260
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,320
I couldn't suspect her.

261
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,520
Mr. Zheng,

262
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,680
return to England.

263
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,640
The domestic situation
is becoming murkier.

264
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,480
Just dealing with
these scheming individuals

265
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,640
is exhausting enough.

266
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,920
Before finding whoever harmed you,

267
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,560
I can't rest easy.

268
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,240
Where are you going?

269
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,600
