1
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,999
WALKING ON THIN ICE

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
DRUG USE ISN’T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

3
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:45,348
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,999
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

5
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:17,067
Honey.

6
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,430
Dad?

7
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:52,000
Honey! Honey!

8
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:55,417
Honey!

9
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:57,167
Dad...

10
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:00,709
Honey...

11
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,751
Look at me, Honey.

12
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,033
Now it finally feels fair.

13
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:33,918
From now on,
life will feel like hell.

14
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:36,224
Just as I feel.

15
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:58,481
Call 911. Hurry!

16
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,876
Honey, honey!

17
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,292
Honey, no!

18
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,125
It's okay.

19
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,999
Honey, wake up.
Look at me.

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,751
My dad is...

21
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:18,999
Haengbok-ro 32-gil...
Please come quickly!

22
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:22,918
- No, no!
- Dad!

23
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:26,999
Look at me.
Open your eyes, please...

24
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,542
Dad...

25
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,292
Honey...

26
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:32,986
Dad!

27
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:36,280
Don't die, please...

28
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:46,792
Dad!

29
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:58,834
EPISODE 12

30
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:00,751
PARK DOJIN
1979 – 2021

31
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:27,438
Honey...

32
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:36,792
PARK DOJIN
1979 – 2021

33
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:09,672
Lieutenant Park Bohee and
Mr. Park Dojin were killed.

34
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:14,865
- Park Dojin?
- Yes, Kang Eunsoo's husband.

35
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:19,100
Jang Taegu killed them,
and he's still on the run.

36
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,001
What are you saying?

37
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,908
So from now on,
tell me everything straight.

38
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,908
If you don't, I'll make sure
you never leave prison.

39
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,950
Thank you.

40
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:47,125
Be careful.

41
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:53,999
Mrs. Kang Eunsoo.

42
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:58,999
You're under arrest for drug trafficking.

43
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,042
You have the right to remain silent,

44
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,500
and the right to an attorney.

45
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:06,667
Anything you say can be used
against you in court.

46
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:07,780
Do you understand?

47
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:12,250
Mom...

48
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:13,999
It's okay, Sua.

49
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:39,626
Jang Taegu had an accident
in a mountain area outside Seoul.

50
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,999
There were traces of gunfire at the scene.

51
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:49,999
He claimed he'd been attacked
while meeting an informant,

52
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:53,334
but you drove down the same highway
leading to the crime scene.

53
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:55,918
The next day,
you replaced your bumper.

54
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,047
You two were with
Jang Taegu that night, weren't you?

55
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,209
Because all of you sold Vaka together.

56
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:06,042
EVIDENCE NO.1

57
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:23,667
Who filmed it?

58
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,292
Sua.

59
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,292
You should eat, okay?

60
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:47,325
Auntie, how could Mom
do such a thing?

61
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,834
Don't cry, don't cry.

62
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,375
That's enough.

63
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:02,125
You really look a lot
like your dad.

64
00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:05,459
Don't cry.

65
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:11,253
That's not important.

66
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,668
What's important is that
this proves both of you sold drugs.

67
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,999
You'll be facing a long sentence.

68
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:21,785
Jang Taegu tried to kill us.

69
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,093
He started shooting like crazy,

70
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,417
and she ran him over
trying to survive.

71
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:44,000
SOMEONE GOT HIT BY A CAR HERE.
PLEASE HURRY!

72
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:46,751
But we did call 911, didn't we?

73
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,634
How did the three of you start off?

74
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,463
I suggested it.

75
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:52,999
Wait...

76
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,665
I told her the police would never believe
she found the drug bag at home,

77
00:08:56,735 --> 00:09:01,083
and convinced her to sell it to make
money for her husband's treatment.

78
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:05,334
But she tried to quit halfway,
so I scared her into selling more.

79
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:06,887
What are you saying...

80
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:08,229
Just admit it.

81
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:11,395
No, I can't do this anymore.

82
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:15,292
I don't care what you feel inside.

83
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:20,584
Just don't get in my way
and do as you're told!

84
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:24,128
Maybe you started this,
but I'll be the one to end it.

85
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:27,918
You know Jang Taegu took money
from Phantom for intel, right?

86
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,000
The money-grubber.

87
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:32,912
When things got tight,
he screwed Phantom and threatened us.

88
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,334
He killed Hwang Donghyun too.

89
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:41,375
HE RAISED IT TO 200 MILLION.
HANDLE THIS ONE LAST TIME

90
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,999
I tricked her into
covering my bribes.

91
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:48,469
But you explained yourself later.

92
00:09:48,492 --> 00:09:52,375
Do you still trust me?
You think I'd give that money back?

93
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:56,292
She begged me to
turn ourselves in, like an idiot.

94
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:59,636
She was a complete fool.

95
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:01,751
No wonder your husband is dead.

96
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:05,898
Stop it!

97
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:11,359
Keep this up, and you'll never
see your daughter again.

98
00:10:15,302 --> 00:10:18,363
How could you?
How dare you?

99
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:21,996
Mrs. Kang, sit down.

100
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,292
Yes, take a seat.

101
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,042
Calm down and sit.

102
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:34,125
This is why I never
worked with civilians.

103
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,163
I told you everything.
Go easy on me, alright?

104
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,999
DECEMBER 8TH
TWON HOLDINGS IR D-DAY

105
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:22,292
DECEMBER 8TH

106
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,083
We've already put
a travel ban on him.

107
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,656
All exits are under surveillance,
but he's vanished.

108
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:37,500
Where the hell did Jang Taegu go?

109
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:41,045
If we lose him now,
he'll smuggle himself overseas.

110
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,626
Then we'll never be
able to catch him!

111
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:47,029
I'll find a way, no matter what.

112
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,651
How's your finger?

113
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,167
What did the hospital say?
No aftereffects, right?

114
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,959
Does that matter?

115
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:06,153
Of course it does.
You're an artist.

116
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:10,200
I delivered Mom's drugs,
didn't I?

117
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:14,253
And Dad died because of it.

118
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,891
I can't forgive either of us.

119
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,430
Not me or you.

120
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,751
No, Sua.

121
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,911
It's not your fault.
Not one bit.

122
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:30,999
It's all my fault.

123
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:32,999
I lost everyone I loved.

124
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:36,304
I never...

125
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:40,740
...want to see you again.

126
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:44,000
I came today to tell you this.

127
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:49,209
Sua... Sua... Sua!

128
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,542
Sua.

129
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:55,042
Sua, Sua.

130
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,584
Mrs. Kang.

131
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,542
Focus.
Stay with me now.

132
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:06,999
Mrs. Kang! Don't lose it!

133
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:53,967
It was about a week after
I joined the Drug Crimes Unit.

134
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,709
Parents who sold their children
for drugs were arrested.

135
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,918
It was really shocking.

136
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,999
But after a few months,
I found out it was pretty common.

137
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:04,959
What are you trying to say now?

138
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:07,626
I almost believed that you
blackmailed Kang Eunsoo

139
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,292
to sell the drugs.

140
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:12,959
In reality,
you want to take the fall

141
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,999
to save Kang Eunsoo.

142
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:17,661
And what if I won't let you?

143
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:19,943
You owe me one, Detective.

144
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:21,443
So I'm giving you a chance.

145
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,292
Lure out Jang Taegu.

146
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,500
By any means necessary.

147
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:33,453
Kang Eunsoo is being offered
the same thing right now.

148
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:36,626
Depending on your cooperation,
the charges may change.

149
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,000
The police have placed Inspector
Jang Taegu on the wanted list

150
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:43,999
on charges of corruption, false accusation
of a fellow officer, and murder.

151
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:48,250
Police confirmed that
Inspector Jang escaped after killing

152
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,041
his fellow officers
while being transported

153
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,999
to the Seoul Metropolitan
Police Agency.

154
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,023
his fellow officers
while being transported

155
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:54,000
to the Seoul Metropolitan
Police Agency.

156
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:58,959
Police are making every effort
to capture Inspector Jang,

157
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,334
distributing wanted posters
with his picture and description.

158
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,999
HOPE MOTEL

159
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,999
Nov 11th, 1 am.
Masan Port, white cargo ship.

160
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,626
Okay.

161
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,546
Go round and round...

162
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:57,375
Go round and round...

163
00:15:58,055 --> 00:15:59,765
Are we going to be okay?

164
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:02,433
If HQ finds out,
they'll be furious.

165
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:04,456
If higher-ups get involved,

166
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:08,375
Inspector...
I mean, Taegu will never show.

167
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:11,562
This is our case,
and we need to finish it.

168
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:15,196
If anything happens,
I'll take full responsibility.

169
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,042
You've changed, sir.

170
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:23,426
Yeah?
I hope in a good way.

171
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:27,693
If we lose him again,
we're all done. Stay sharp.

172
00:16:52,316 --> 00:16:54,570
Dad! Help me!

173
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:57,710
Dad! Dad!

174
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:02,327
If you want your son alive,
come now.

175
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:03,876
You know where this is, right?

176
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:01,606
Where's Mingyo?

177
00:18:03,588 --> 00:18:05,089
Bring my son back!

178
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:12,999
His mom took him.

179
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:26,792
I'm sorry, Mingyo.

180
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:29,709
Go now.

181
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:37,345
They're departing today.

182
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:50,177
Jang Taegu, drop your weapon.

183
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:55,716
We're monitoring
his son's house and school,

184
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:59,209
and his ex-wife's workplace.

185
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:01,092
But Taegu's too smart not to know that.

186
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:04,067
- So you're saying...
- Yes.

187
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,375
Lure him out.
By any means necessary.

188
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:13,776
Drop the gun!

189
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:29,276
Eunsoo.

190
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:34,031
Mrs. Kang, don't provoke him!

191
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:39,292
You don't deserve to raise a child.

192
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:42,159
You'll never see Mingyo again.

193
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:50,417
You'll rot in prison forever.

194
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:52,289
Step back, Mrs. Kang.

195
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:54,808
Mrs. Kang!

196
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:02,500
- Inspector!
- Jang Taegu, drop it!

197
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,500
Don't move!

198
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,375
Drop the gun, right now!

199
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:38,999
Eunyoung!

200
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:51,667
Open the door!

201
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:03,999
- Call for ambulance and backup!
- Yes, sir!

202
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,584
You've become a monster too.

203
00:25:36,176 --> 00:25:37,760
Eunsoo, are you okay?

204
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:41,014
Shit... Look at us.

205
00:27:16,626 --> 00:27:17,999
No!

206
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:47,042
No!

207
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:07,417
No!

208
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,167
Send a search team right now.

209
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:19,918
Hurry!

210
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:52,999
New inmate.

211
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,709
Hello.

212
00:29:57,876 --> 00:30:02,167
IF YOU EVER READ THIS LETTER,
COULD YOU WRITE BACK?

213
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:10,375
I HOPE YOU READ THIS.

214
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:16,876
I LOVE YOU, SUA...

215
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:26,375
YOU'RE MY MOST PRECIOUS GIFT.

216
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:35,999
HOW ARE YOU DOING AT SCHOOL?

217
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:55,834
I CAN'T WAIT TO HUG YOU AGAIN.

218
00:30:56,042 --> 00:31:00,125
ONE YEAR LATER

219
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,292
Hey, over here!

220
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:34,573
You got out sooner
than I expected.

221
00:31:34,831 --> 00:31:37,495
I won't lie,
I'm kind of feeling jealous.

222
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,779
Don't look at me like that.
I have no regrets.

223
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:46,061
Not even a little.

224
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:51,209
I made more money too.
You did all the work.

225
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:55,045
You really don't regret it?

226
00:31:56,163 --> 00:31:58,455
You had something
you absolutely had to do.

227
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:01,978
I just wanted for once...

228
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:04,999
to stop calculating and thinking,

229
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:09,646
and just do something for you.

230
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:12,999
You still have something left to protect.

231
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:16,000
You should hurry and go meet Sua.

232
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:24,423
If you cry now,
things will become really awkward.

233
00:32:32,437 --> 00:32:35,479
And again,
you still don't know me.

234
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:38,667
Do I look like someone
who sacrifices for others?

235
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:48,334
TWON GROUP - AI INDUSTRIAL PROJECT PLAN

236
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:52,000
Good afternoon. I'm Kang Hwirim,
Executive Director of TwoN Holdings.

237
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:01,500
The AI industrial complex project
was the biggest highlight at our last IR.

238
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:04,417
We hope today's presentation
meets your expectations.

239
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:07,918
The introductory video
was generated by AI.

240
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:08,918
Let's take a look.

241
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:16,744
A trillion-won Project
Designing the future of AI in InSan

242
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,667
Welcome.

243
00:33:24,834 --> 00:33:26,709
Firstly, the most essential component...

244
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:29,209
I guess I'm not the only one
who's nervous.

245
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:31,999
Here we develop AI algorithms,

246
00:33:31,999 --> 00:33:36,083
autonomous systems and robot testing,
AI tech development, and more.

247
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:38,999
All ready to be deployed directly into...

248
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:40,999
Vaka?
This is meth, right?

249
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:51,459
This is incredible!
Where did you get this?

250
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,959
- Block the screen!
- Block it now!

251
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,542
Turn that video off!
Turn it off!

252
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:17,959
Is the footage real?

253
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:19,042
Please confirm the video's authenticity.

254
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,999
Do you admit to drug use?

255
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,751
Is there any connection
with government officials?

256
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:24,500
Are you the person in the footage?

257
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:27,083
- Is that you in the video?
- It's you, isn't it?

258
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,796
Share your entire client list,
and we'll consider a reduced sentence.

259
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:05,108
Prosecutor, have you heard
of 'The Fisherman'?

260
00:35:05,249 --> 00:35:09,042
He's the drug distributor that
the police have been chasing for years.

261
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:15,751
I can give you even more.
So how about it?

262
00:36:05,918 --> 00:36:07,083
Is the footage real?

263
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,542
Please verify its authenticity.

264
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,083
Do you admit to drug consumption?

265
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,999
Are any government officials involved?

266
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:13,999
Could the video be manipulated?

267
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:21,876
I don't know how you got free,
but it won't be for long.

268
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:25,751
Malicious entrapment,
forced dosing, and video tampering.

269
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:27,876
If you confess to everything,
I'll ask for leniency.

270
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,999
- And if I refuse?
- You won't come out alive.

271
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,459
And your family won't be safe.

272
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,250
Your father has five guaranteed
completions next month.

273
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:37,722
I can delay it for you.

274
00:37:37,738 --> 00:37:40,834
Do you know how much
a two-week delay will cost?

275
00:37:40,912 --> 00:37:44,215
Your father's company
would go bankrupt within a month.

276
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:51,116
Is this how you did it before?

277
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:54,960
When you killed my friend
ten years ago,

278
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:56,768
and pinned it all on me.

279
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,167
It was an accident.

280
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:02,667
An unfortunate and unlucky accident.

281
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:07,292
Yeah, you did it,
and everyone else paid for it.

282
00:38:07,334 --> 00:38:10,250
Man, that was ages ago.

283
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:13,349
You forget too easily.

284
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:16,868
Too bad, though.
You failed at revenge.

285
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:17,845
Drugs?

286
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:21,292
Must I explain word by word?

287
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:25,125
If you wanted to take down
my family company,

288
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:28,999
you should've gotten
my gramps to do the drugs.

289
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:34,292
A fuck up by an executive
won't make people sell TwoN shares.

290
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:40,334
The stock dip after your stunt
was only a few thousand won!

291
00:38:41,346 --> 00:38:43,053
What a waste of time.

292
00:38:44,182 --> 00:38:47,223
I'm leaving.
Get ready to get screwed.

293
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:58,101
You know, you people are
always so optimistic.

294
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:02,642
You commit crimes
without any fear of paying the price.

295
00:39:02,766 --> 00:39:07,130
Do you think I did all that
merely to expose your drug addiction?

296
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,880
What happened was just a preview.

297
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:13,999
A TwoN heir's drug addiction
and indiscretion.

298
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:18,083
It's bound to draw attention
even if you don't know TwoN.

299
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,542
We got high
and ran into a problem.

300
00:39:20,584 --> 00:39:24,209
Nothing big, just a few candies.
Then one guy overdosed, right?

301
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,334
Cops came, and I thought
we were all screwed.

302
00:39:27,904 --> 00:39:29,999
But only the dog took the fall.

303
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:32,834
Only he ended up in jail.
Nice and neat.

304
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:34,042
Hope he's doing all right.

305
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:36,999
What if this soon-to-be forgotten gossip

306
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:40,999
escalates into a murder
committed by the company head?

307
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:43,083
Kang Hwirim,
Executive Director of TwoN Holdings,

308
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,999
has been found to be
linked to a past murder,

309
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,999
and police are set
to launch an investigation.

310
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:51,292
The situation further escalated
after allegations of corruption

311
00:39:51,334 --> 00:39:55,751
by Kang Gunam, Chairman of TwoN,
newly emerged.

312
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,459
Drug addict's company! Murder's company!

313
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,459
Down with TwoN! Down with TwoN!

314
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,999
Kang Gunam and his family
must step down!

315
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:07,167
Once public opinion worsens,
the government will step in.

316
00:40:07,478 --> 00:40:10,999
The same government that
promised a trillion won funding.

317
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:14,950
Bullshit. A decision like that
can't be canceled so easily!

318
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:19,254
That was my original plan.

319
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:21,930
But it doesn't matter anymore.

320
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:27,709
All that matters
is that people believe it.

321
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:29,209
Executive Kang...

322
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,709
The stock-backed loans you took...

323
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:39,999
If the share value drops, the collateral
gets sold at rock-bottom prices.

324
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,455
If the closing price drops 30%
and the lower limit holds for three days,

325
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:46,542
TwoN shares will plunge
below 100,000 won.

326
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:48,877
So that's what you were after!

327
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,250
Why do you think
I didn't blow it up all at once?

328
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:55,584
For a little fire to become a big one,
it needs to be fueled.

329
00:40:55,763 --> 00:40:59,375
The government is set to review
whether it will continue funding

330
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,209
the TwoN Holdings' projects,

331
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,000
with some of them
set to be scrapped entirely.

332
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:08,459
A source expressed worry
that TwoN Holdings may face

333
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,334
major liquidity issues
if government fundings are pulled out.

334
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:25,918
You need 30% shares
to form a defensive block.

335
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,709
If you're short by 1%,
or even 0.5%,

336
00:41:30,751 --> 00:41:33,375
your precious company
will change hands.

337
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,040
Who do you think holds that 0.5%?

338
00:41:40,918 --> 00:41:42,999
You bastard!

339
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:43,999
I'll kill you!

340
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:04,210
Come on, bark all you want.

341
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:06,999
Who knows?
Maybe I'll show you mercy.

342
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,221
Come on, please.
Let me talk to grandpa.

343
00:42:17,417 --> 00:42:19,959
He won't answer my calls!

344
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:23,500
I can make up for everything.
Just help me out here.

345
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:26,626
The public's attention is too high.
We can't move rashly...

346
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:28,999
Fuck you!
He can't abandon me!

347
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:31,999
Shut up and put grandpa
on the line. Fuck!

348
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:33,500
Fuck!

349
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,762
Hey! Where are you going?

350
00:42:55,045 --> 00:42:56,387
Look at yourself.

351
00:42:57,295 --> 00:42:58,586
I don't want to be here.

352
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:08,292
Hey! Hey!

353
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:09,417
Hey!

354
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:14,478
Seriously?
Are you mocking me too?

355
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:16,876
You're scaring me.

356
00:43:16,918 --> 00:43:20,146
I treated you well,
yet you betray me?

357
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:36,500
Stop pretending and get up.
Get up now!

358
00:43:56,999 --> 00:43:59,000
Grandpa, it wasn't me!

359
00:43:59,876 --> 00:44:02,999
Grandpa!
Grandpa, please save me!

360
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:04,626
Grandpa!

361
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,500
Grandpa!

362
00:44:12,542 --> 00:44:15,751
Kang Hwirim, who is under investigation
for drug use and mediation,

363
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,375
has been arrested
on charges of negligent injury.

364
00:44:18,876 --> 00:44:21,999
The victim has been identified
as Yoo Misun, Kang's girlfriend,

365
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,999
and a well-known influencer
with 2 million followers.

366
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:29,167
Police have also begun a reinvestigation
into the drug-related death

367
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:34,125
of a male at Kang's villa ten years ago,
following a recently found recording.

368
00:44:34,459 --> 00:44:38,999
TwoN's Kang Gunam, under suspicion
for evidence tampering and concealment,

369
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:40,999
rejected the allegations of all...

370
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,999
I offer my deepest apologies.

371
00:44:44,108 --> 00:44:47,108
What I can say for certain is that

372
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:50,834
this is solely an issue of
former Executive Director Kang Hwirim,

373
00:44:50,876 --> 00:44:56,999
and any allegations of my involvement
from ten years ago are absolutely untrue.

374
00:44:57,417 --> 00:45:03,792
TwoN will fully cooperate with the
investigation into the former executive...

375
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:07,209
TwoN Holdings' stock has plunged
as the company faces controversy,

376
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,999
fueling investor worries.

377
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:13,918
The crisis may weigh on
TwoN Group's overall stock,

378
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:16,375
attracting increased investor scrutiny.

379
00:45:38,306 --> 00:45:41,145
I told you,
sacrificing isn't my thing.

380
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:44,528
I went by your house,
but no one was there.

381
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:46,751
Are you staying here now?

382
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:49,984
Yeah.

383
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:52,147
How's your health?

384
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:55,351
Have you seen your family?

385
00:45:55,983 --> 00:45:59,101
Gosh, you haven't changed one bit.

386
00:46:00,437 --> 00:46:03,646
I came straight here
to give you this.

387
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:23,375
Thank you.
You made my plan succeed.

388
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:27,893
I got these by liquidating the shares.
There was quite a bit left.

389
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:29,999
I'm paying you back with interest.

390
00:46:31,709 --> 00:46:34,751
Have you seen Sua again?

391
00:46:40,287 --> 00:46:43,303
Is there anything I can help with?

392
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:45,349
If there's anything I can do...

393
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,626
Hurry, hurry!

394
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:01,209
Eunsoo! Get out of here!

395
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:06,999
Sua, are you okay?

396
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:10,918
Eunsoo, run!

397
00:47:14,182 --> 00:47:16,766
Keep this up, and you'll never
see your daughter again.

398
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:19,122
Your life is screwed.

399
00:47:20,895 --> 00:47:23,209
They still haven't found Jang Taegu.

400
00:47:23,434 --> 00:47:26,209
You know,
if you really want...

401
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,334
I don't want anything.

402
00:47:27,499 --> 00:47:31,152
I've already gotten plenty from you.
It's enough.

403
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,709
I should've never started.

404
00:47:35,751 --> 00:47:39,539
Still, I'm really glad I did it with you.

405
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:44,751
I hope you live well.

406
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:48,834
And put everything we did
all behind us.

407
00:47:57,061 --> 00:47:58,061
Kyung.

408
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:00,999
Be happy.

409
00:48:15,711 --> 00:48:19,076
Yes, I'll be happy.

410
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:21,375
So that you won't worry.

411
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,213
So you have to be happy too, okay?

412
00:48:26,876 --> 00:48:28,042
So I won't worry.

413
00:48:28,959 --> 00:48:29,999
Okay.

414
00:48:46,999 --> 00:48:48,125
I'll go now.

415
00:49:26,628 --> 00:49:28,378
Let's give up on Jang Taegu.

416
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:32,292
- It's been over a year.
- I'm giving up after today.

417
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,097
You said that last week.

418
00:49:35,459 --> 00:49:36,667
Hello?

419
00:49:36,709 --> 00:49:37,792
Yes, that's right.

420
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:40,701
Really?

421
00:49:42,385 --> 00:49:44,301
I think they found
Jang Taegu's body.

422
00:49:45,476 --> 00:49:47,310
Yes, we'll come right away.

423
00:49:54,314 --> 00:49:55,392
I'm sorry...

424
00:49:56,999 --> 00:49:58,365
...for deceiving you.

425
00:49:59,245 --> 00:50:03,271
Doing it with you made me
feel a little less guilty.

426
00:50:04,709 --> 00:50:05,918
I'm really sorry.

427
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:11,334
Whether we knew it or not,
we still did it.

428
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:14,876
How are you doing?

429
00:50:15,876 --> 00:50:17,352
The foster home is better.

430
00:50:17,384 --> 00:50:19,999
I can stretch my legs when I sleep,

431
00:50:19,999 --> 00:50:21,375
and my Mom's boyfriend isn't there.

432
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:24,999
By the way,
Jinhee's parents didn't divorce.

433
00:50:25,266 --> 00:50:26,802
They're moving to the countryside.

434
00:50:27,709 --> 00:50:28,751
I see.

435
00:50:29,387 --> 00:50:32,999
What happened between
you and your mom?

436
00:50:38,855 --> 00:50:40,398
Don't hate her for too long.

437
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,167
I kind of understand your mom.

438
00:50:45,287 --> 00:50:48,161
I just hope it hurts you less.

439
00:51:26,487 --> 00:51:27,826
Eunsoo?

440
00:51:35,573 --> 00:51:36,907
When did you get out?

441
00:51:38,077 --> 00:51:39,319
A little while ago.

442
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:48,139
Thank you for taking care of Sua.
Once I find a place to stay...

443
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,334
Your brother-in-law
refused her back then.

444
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,599
So now, I'm Sua's legal guardian.

445
00:51:54,104 --> 00:51:55,529
Sua agreed to it.

446
00:52:00,216 --> 00:52:03,747
I heard you took my husband
to the hospital that day.

447
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:08,459
And was it you that reported me?

448
00:52:09,903 --> 00:52:14,167
After everything, is that
what you're curious about?

449
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:20,271
Was I ever a friend to you?

450
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:24,816
Yes, I liked you so much
that I wanted to be you.

451
00:52:26,785 --> 00:52:28,050
Not anymore, though.

452
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:31,316
Don't come without contacting me.

453
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:32,751
Yeoju!

454
00:52:34,345 --> 00:52:37,584
Sua doesn't draw anymore.
Actually, she can't draw.

455
00:52:37,783 --> 00:52:39,918
Her bones healed,
but it still pains her.

456
00:52:39,959 --> 00:52:42,751
They say it's psychogenic.
And I'm not surprised.

457
00:54:14,928 --> 00:54:18,929
I admired how hard you worked
to better your life.

458
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:22,096
That's why I married you.

459
00:54:22,363 --> 00:54:23,504
I'll wait for you.

460
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:26,125
If people curse us,
we'll hear it together.

461
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:28,083
If they throw stones,
we'll take them together.

462
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:32,030
If the three of us are together,
we'll be okay.

463
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:38,292
Honey...

464
00:54:38,334 --> 00:54:40,626
I lost everyone I loved.

465
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:42,584
I never...

466
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:45,743
...want to see you again.

467
00:55:24,209 --> 00:55:25,584
Honey.

468
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:31,083
Honey.

469
00:55:49,626 --> 00:55:50,999
You've been through a lot.

470
00:55:55,297 --> 00:55:58,035
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

471
00:56:04,738 --> 00:56:05,738
Son.

472
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:11,108
Welcome home.

473
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:04,375
Welcome back, little brother.

474
00:57:50,055 --> 00:57:51,597
TO LEE KYUNG

475
00:58:38,828 --> 00:58:40,703
All set?

476
00:58:40,792 --> 00:58:43,083
- Yes.
- We'll depart then.

477
00:58:49,918 --> 00:58:51,334
55, HAENGBOK-RO 32-GIL

478
00:59:13,999 --> 00:59:16,125
That's one firm grip.

479
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:19,792
Damn, it won't come out.

480
00:59:20,334 --> 00:59:23,918
Considering the climate
and the lack of insect traces,

481
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:27,442
the time of death
was probably last winter.

482
00:59:27,626 --> 00:59:31,292
You rushed me, so I checked
dental records first. They matched.

483
00:59:31,918 --> 00:59:33,209
It's Jang Taegu, alright.

484
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:39,167
The body had a bulletproof vest on,

485
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:41,999
with no fractures in the sternum.

486
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:43,876
It's unlikely he died of a gunshot.

487
00:59:45,751 --> 00:59:47,389
So what's his cause of death?

488
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:51,083
Seeing the weapon mark
on the right femur,

489
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:54,088
it was likely sepsis or
massive bleeding from the wound.

490
00:59:54,138 --> 00:59:56,054
But proving it
from this state is difficult.

491
00:59:57,584 --> 01:00:00,250
He didn't let go of the bag
even upon death.

492
01:00:00,999 --> 01:00:04,042
I don't know if that's
tenacious or pathetic.

493
01:00:50,468 --> 01:00:51,910
I won, you bastards.

494
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:55,792
I won, you bastards!

495
01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:29,147
Mingyo.

496
01:01:31,115 --> 01:01:32,279
Daddy won.

497
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:37,542
Just wait.
Just a little bit.

498
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:39,654
I'll come get you.

499
01:02:32,876 --> 01:02:36,876
Do you really think I caused
that woman to go that far?

500
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:44,132
Wrong. That woman would've
eventually killed someone.

501
01:02:44,889 --> 01:02:47,349
It doesn't matter the cause.

502
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:52,339
Once it starts,
there's always a next step.

503
01:02:55,584 --> 01:02:59,999
That's what living is.

504
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:03,051
You and I are the same.

505
01:03:51,209 --> 01:03:52,876
Here are today's top stories.

506
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:56,999
The skeletal remains
found on Mount Suo were identified

507
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,834
as the former Inspector Jang Taegu.

508
01:03:59,876 --> 01:04:04,459
Jang was wanted for drug trafficking
and murdering fellow officers.

509
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,667
The location of the discovered body

510
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:10,417
is said to match
Jang's last known whereabouts.

511
01:04:10,667 --> 01:04:13,250
Police plan to continue the investigation

512
01:04:13,292 --> 01:04:17,626
to determine the precise
cause of his death.

513
01:04:30,959 --> 01:04:33,500
HANSEL AND GRETEL

514
01:04:46,751 --> 01:04:51,042
Gretel shoved the witch hard
into the oven.

515
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:55,667
- Can't you do it right?
- I'm sorry.

516
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,125
- Calves.
- Calves!

517
01:05:00,626 --> 01:05:02,250
I was the manager
at a massage parlor.

518
01:05:02,292 --> 01:05:03,792
Good, I'm counting on you.

519
01:05:04,584 --> 01:05:06,042
- The other leg.
- Sure.

520
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:32,959
Damn, it's too cold.

521
01:05:36,417 --> 01:05:37,667
Shit.

522
01:05:38,999 --> 01:05:41,999
Hey, rookie! Lie straight!

523
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,167
Freaking nutcase.

524
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:48,000
What the fuck!
Call the guard! The guard!

525
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:49,918
- Call anyone!
- Guard! Guard!

526
01:05:50,533 --> 01:05:51,436
Guard!

527
01:05:51,483 --> 01:05:54,999
The witch burned to death,
screaming terribly,

528
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:59,250
and the siblings returned
with her treasure and lived happily.

529
01:05:59,876 --> 01:06:03,542
I don't see any issues.
Let's proceed with the contract.

530
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:04,427
Okay.

531
01:06:06,417 --> 01:06:08,999
Where did the contract
from the developer go?

532
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:11,918
It's in my study,
next to the safe.

533
01:06:11,999 --> 01:06:12,999
Ah, okay.

534
01:06:12,999 --> 01:06:15,167
No, stay.
I'll bring it.

535
01:06:16,209 --> 01:06:17,209
Thanks.

536
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:21,338
Did they really live happily ever after?

537
01:07:02,959 --> 01:07:04,209
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

538
01:07:10,977 --> 01:07:11,935
What's wrong?

539
01:07:20,492 --> 01:07:21,451
Father?

540
01:07:47,161 --> 01:07:48,348
What is this?

541
01:07:53,084 --> 01:07:56,914
Why did you make
this agreement with TwoN?

542
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,292
JOINT CONTRACT. "NEVER DISCLOSE
AND KEEP SECRET PERMANENTLY."

543
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:07,918
What does all this mean?

544
01:08:08,999 --> 01:08:11,792
NOVEMBER, 2011...

545
01:08:12,999 --> 01:08:15,125
That's when Kyung's friend died.

546
01:08:17,076 --> 01:08:18,911
What is it?

547
01:08:22,045 --> 01:08:24,542
If I were the real murderer,

548
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:30,736
TwoN would never have offered
this contract, right?

549
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:33,035
Dad, don't tell me...

550
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:37,250
Did you agree to framing
Kyung for the murder?

551
01:08:38,101 --> 01:08:39,365
Say you didn't.

552
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:42,709
You didn't, right?

553
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:46,042
Kyung, this is...

554
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:47,792
Say you didn't!

555
01:08:49,544 --> 01:08:51,222
I had no choice back then.

556
01:08:51,918 --> 01:08:53,894
The company was
about to collapse.

557
01:08:53,925 --> 01:08:56,834
I couldn't let the whole family die
because of you.

558
01:08:57,604 --> 01:08:59,479
I had to make the better choice.

559
01:09:05,132 --> 01:09:06,968
Which was to sell me out?

560
01:09:06,999 --> 01:09:08,876
It's all in the past.

561
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:12,672
What's the point of
digging it up now?

562
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:15,044
What's the point?

563
01:09:17,417 --> 01:09:19,709
Do you know how
I've lived all this time?

564
01:09:20,334 --> 01:09:21,918
If I put everything back...

565
01:09:22,667 --> 01:09:24,417
If I make those bastards pay...

566
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,959
I thought you'd finally believe me.

567
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:33,334
Even when I wanted to
die from misery,

568
01:09:34,573 --> 01:09:36,989
that single hope kept me going.

569
01:09:39,413 --> 01:09:41,205
Are you really asking
what the point is?

570
01:09:43,709 --> 01:09:46,834
Who told you to do it?
I never told you.

571
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:50,542
Why were you there at that time?

572
01:09:50,742 --> 01:09:55,500
Why did you get entangled with them
and make my life this hard?

573
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:57,292
- Father!
- What?

574
01:09:58,876 --> 01:10:00,584
You little brat!

575
01:10:01,206 --> 01:10:03,999
So you abandoned me back then.

576
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:06,334
And all this time,
I didn't know.

577
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:07,584
Kyung!

578
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,375
Fine. Kill me.
Go on.

579
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:55,073
Kyung.

580
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:04,240
Kyung!

581
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:08,748
Kyung!

582
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,083
Good work.

583
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,834
Yes, thank you.

584
01:11:20,999 --> 01:11:24,841
Boss, I thought it was
1.8 million a month.

585
01:11:25,209 --> 01:11:27,999
Be grateful for what you've got.

586
01:11:30,513 --> 01:11:31,896
You're an ex-convict.

587
01:11:33,334 --> 01:11:35,250
If you don't like it, quit.

588
01:12:39,334 --> 01:12:43,876
Were the siblings okay
after shoving the witch into the oven?

589
01:13:13,334 --> 01:13:15,834
To my beloved daughter Sua.

590
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:22,999
Sua, as I write this letter,
snow is piling up silently outside.

591
01:13:23,459 --> 01:13:26,876
You always loved this season.

592
01:13:27,167 --> 01:13:32,167
I can picture you running around
in the piled-up snow.

593
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:35,417
I don't know where to begin.

594
01:13:35,684 --> 01:13:42,542
Not long after your dad collapsed,
I found the drug bag at home.

595
01:13:43,999 --> 01:13:45,209
I didn't know what to do,

596
01:13:45,626 --> 01:13:48,626
but I convinced myself in desperation

597
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,667
to do whatever it takes
to protect our family.

598
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,999
I know I don't deserve forgiveness.

599
01:13:57,793 --> 01:13:59,125
But my dear Sua,

600
01:13:59,626 --> 01:14:02,442
even if you never forgive me,

601
01:14:02,999 --> 01:14:05,751
I want you to forgive yourself.

602
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:08,999
So don't give up on anything.

603
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,751
I wish you'd no longer lose
what's precious to you.

604
01:14:14,542 --> 01:14:16,999
You will always be my daughter.

605
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,209
Don't forget that I'm always
thinking of you.

606
01:14:22,936 --> 01:14:24,936
You're never alone.

607
01:14:25,542 --> 01:14:29,000
I will love you until the end of time,

608
01:14:29,834 --> 01:14:33,000
and I will always wait for you.

609
01:14:49,792 --> 01:14:51,999
Watch where you're going!

610
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:54,250
Excuse me!

611
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:55,999
Sorry.

612
01:15:10,334 --> 01:15:12,500
Crazy bastard,
you wanna die?

613
01:15:18,542 --> 01:15:20,209
Fucking lunatic.

614
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,250
BRO

615
01:16:57,918 --> 01:17:00,999
Can a person who has once
crossed the line

616
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:04,792
truly resist crossing it again

617
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:07,999
when faced with the same situation?

618
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:03,876
SUA

619
01:19:12,999 --> 01:19:15,834
WALKING ON THIN ICE

620
01:19:46,292 --> 01:19:48,999
WE SINCERELY THANK ALL THE VIEWERS
FOR WATCHING "WALKING ON THIN ICE"
