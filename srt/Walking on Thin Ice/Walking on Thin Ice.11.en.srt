1
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,899
WALKING ON THIN ICE

2
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:39,999
WALKING ON THIN ICE

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
DRUG USE ISN’T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

4
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:45,348
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,999
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

6
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:50,381
I wish a bag of cash
fell from the sky.

7
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:53,709
PREVIOUSLY...

8
00:00:53,952 --> 00:00:55,748
Where did this come from?

9
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:58,338
- ...earned over 200 million won a month.
- 200 million?

10
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:00,607
I can do anything for my family.

11
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:01,881
No!

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,463
We're not losing the house.
And you're not dying.

13
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:06,493
Let's work together.

14
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:09,179
Let's be partners.
You and me.

15
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:14,083
There are countless dealers,
but there's no one safer than him.

16
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:15,459
100 million in two weeks.

17
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:17,999
Make it happen,
and we'll talk again.

18
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:18,999
Fine by me.

19
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,584
So, how was your first day?

20
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:28,657
I said, give me my money!

21
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:39,876
When I make 200 million,
I'm quitting.

22
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:45,195
How about we keep going?

23
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:48,626
Yeah, okay.

24
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:50,821
Someone's dead.

25
00:01:55,918 --> 00:02:00,463
Did you think we'd just earn
easy money and live happily ever after?

26
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:06,936
Don't kid yourself!

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,924
You're still a criminal!

28
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,583
James is the bad guy,

29
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:13,972
and not you, right?

30
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:16,975
I can't do this anymore.

31
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,375
I suddenly thought to myself.

32
00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:23,865
Comparing now and
before all this started...

33
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:27,407
Which one's worse off?

34
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:30,083
You're desperate for money,
aren't you?

35
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:37,667
If you're not going to bury me now,
let the fuck go of me.

36
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,128
Everything you love

37
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,500
and everything you wish to protect

38
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,858
will all be smashed by me.

39
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,375
Let's erase him.

40
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:01,325
For good.

41
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:07,667
EPISODE 11

42
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:09,959
HANSEL AND GRETEL

43
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:25,657
Eunsoo.

44
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:27,821
Ta-da!

45
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:36,223
Do you like it?

46
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,042
Are we moving

47
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,336
because you lent money to a friend?

48
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,959
When is Mom coming back?

49
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:52,250
Eunsoo.

50
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:57,999
You mustn't be poor at heart
even without money.

51
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:01,192
What's a poor heart?

52
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,882
Not sharing, taking others' things,
and hurting people.

53
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:11,882
Then do the landlady, my classmate,

54
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:14,999
and Daddy's friend
all have poor hearts?

55
00:04:18,563 --> 00:04:20,385
I don't like them.

56
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,166
So people with poor hearts are bad?

57
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,685
Yeah, that's right.

58
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:32,123
So, don't be like them.

59
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:35,792
Even if someone hurts you,

60
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,751
don't hurt them back.
Can you promise?

61
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,751
GRETEL PUSHED THE WITCH WITH FORCE
AND SLAMMED THE OVEN DOOR SHUT

62
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:51,490
Promise.

63
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:38,209
Huh? What?

64
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:40,520
Doctor! Doctor!

65
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:42,834
Doctor!

66
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:59,446
Fortunately, nothing's broken.

67
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,999
Did you tuck-and-roll or something?

68
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:11,417
How did I end up here?

69
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:13,626
Someone texted 911.

70
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:17,369
Thank God.
You'd have been dead otherwise.

71
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,330
Our team should go see a shaman.

72
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,918
Why so many misfortunes this year?

73
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:30,037
So, what got you there
alone that night?

74
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:39,907
A source tipped me off,
but I got jumped on the spot.

75
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:42,509
Oh, a source...

76
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:44,493
Who was the source?

77
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:46,667
You don't know him.

78
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,856
You'll have to tell us
during questioning.

79
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,273
You even fired your gun.

80
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:55,582
- Did you get the security footage?
- Yes.

81
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,999
But there were barely lights.
It was too dark to see.

82
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:03,120
We got one clip and
sent it for analysis.

83
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:05,464
But nothing useful yet.

84
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,626
DONGBU MUNICIPAL HOSPITAL

85
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:13,387
- How long have I been here?
- Two days.

86
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,050
What?

87
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:31,999
DRUG CRIMES UNIT

88
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:34,676
Where's my phone?

89
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:36,215
We couldn't find it.

90
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:37,761
And the car?

91
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,202
- Huh?
- My car!

92
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:45,948
Hold on.

93
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:49,500
Yeah.

94
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,417
Who came?

95
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:53,834
Hey, what's going on?

96
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:59,209
It's the man who saved the girl
from Hwang Junhyun.

97
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:00,586
What about him?

98
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:06,125
He's at the station now.

99
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:08,318
To make a statement.

100
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:18,334
GWANGNAM POLICE STATION

101
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:20,727
​Sir, you can't
discharge yourself like this.

102
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,865
Let Eunyoung and me handle it.

103
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:24,999
Don't take your concussion lightly.

104
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,454
You need to recover a bit more.

105
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,392
- Inspector?
- Sir?

106
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,356
Isn't he still recovering?

107
00:10:42,484 --> 00:10:44,734
Whatever. Get to work.

108
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,121
Glad you're safe.

109
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:07,113
Crazy bastard.

110
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:10,000
You're dying to go to jail, huh?

111
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:14,226
- Should I lock you up?
- Yes.

112
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:18,918
I'll turn myself in.

113
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,042
TWO DAYS AGO

114
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:40,865
Are you okay?

115
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,959
What about you?
Are you hurt?

116
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:02,167
Let's run.

117
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:07,292
We can't survive here
as long as that man's alive.

118
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:15,334
I still have things to do.

119
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:19,209
I'm not planning to run forever.

120
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,293
Snap out of it.
Is revenge more important than your life?

121
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:27,395
Yes!

122
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,055
That's right!

123
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:36,146
Since that day,
I haven't felt alive one bit.

124
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:38,667
Wanna know the truth?

125
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:43,375
I can't move on
because it still haunts me.

126
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:47,344
I lost everything
that was precious to me!

127
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:56,999
I'm not running.

128
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:02,083
No, don't!

129
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:07,185
You came this far
to prove you didn't kill.

130
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:09,187
You can't become a murderer now!

131
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,960
You were about to kill him yourself.

132
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,633
No, I was trying to save you.

133
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,556
Like you said,
he's still a cop.

134
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,459
People will find him.

135
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:23,999
If we let him live,

136
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:27,528
our families will die.

137
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:30,121
If that bastard doesn't die,

138
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,292
this will never end.

139
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:02,417
Damn it.

140
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,417
Just...

141
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:19,830
Turn yourself in.

142
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:28,951
You won't leave me alone,
and I have nowhere to run.

143
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:31,959
Might as well confess
and lessen my sentence.

144
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:38,712
Who knows? Maybe they'll show mercy
if I confess everything.

145
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,417
Confess everything?

146
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,814
About that night's accident.

147
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:48,334
Why you were there,
and who you were with...

148
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:53,442
I guess I'll have to start
by explaining our relationship.

149
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:56,500
Where should I begin?

150
00:14:57,073 --> 00:15:00,031
How about when you
sent me threat texts?

151
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:05,959
Or maybe with
Hwang Donghyun's death.

152
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:24,369
Are you threatening me?

153
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:30,716
I didn't know it would work.

154
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,599
I finally understand how you felt.

155
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:39,999
I'm seriously liking
your face right now too.

156
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:44,298
I really like the look in your eyes.

157
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,999
I feel a sense of achievement
and satisfaction, you know?

158
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:51,792
I could look at it all day.

159
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,649
Did they know each other before?

160
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:10,751
Don't flatter yourself.

161
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:14,000
Who'd believe a criminal like you?

162
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:18,500
I suppose so.

163
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:24,999
If it were only my words.

164
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:32,500
After a long investigation,

165
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:34,999
I was going to catch you
red-handed on the scene.

166
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:37,584
But you attacked me,
and I defended myself.

167
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:38,650
You look like shit.

168
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:42,918
If you'd listened,
and paid me 200 million every week,

169
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,751
you would've kept your life.

170
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:47,000
Cleaning this up
is a pain for me too.

171
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:53,584
This will help me get
a few believers, don't you think?

172
00:16:58,473 --> 00:17:01,999
You know, when this all surfaces,

173
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:04,677
you'll have to give up on your son.

174
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,150
Might never see him again.

175
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:14,766
You may not know, but we know you
just as well as you know us.

176
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:19,013
Turn myself in?

177
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:21,895
Are you kidding me?

178
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:25,186
That's basically suicide.

179
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:27,000
Not always.

180
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,827
You said it yourself.

181
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,710
If you grab someone's weakness,
it can become your own.

182
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,811
You think Jang Taegu's any different?

183
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:38,366
We just have to pretend.

184
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:42,830
Jang Taegu will never
let us turn ourselves in.

185
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,000
You probably know it best.

186
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:55,451
Who's going to lose the most
if I confess everything?

187
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:03,172
Ready to negotiate now?

188
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:24,856
- What?
- Didn't you hear me?

189
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:27,334
Drop the Park Sua case.

190
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:29,000
But...

191
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,704
She said she didn't know.

192
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,618
Besides, the other girl started it.

193
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:35,914
She'll only get a
level-one juvenile ruling.

194
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:37,738
Don't waste your energy on it.

195
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:40,390
Then why'd you tell me to tail her?

196
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:43,751
You said she might be tied
to the drug gang, and so...

197
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,918
Don't make me repeat myself.
Get out.

198
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:03,375
What?

199
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:04,999
I don't know.

200
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,459
I don't know what went on in there,

201
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,500
but I just got ordered
to drop the Park Sua case.

202
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:24,626
Fortunately, you didn't get infected.

203
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:27,500
But how did you even
get hurt like this?

204
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:33,500
Well, I just fell.

205
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,042
Oh! Hello, there.

206
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:03,597
I'll return all the Vaka
that you retrieved...

207
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:07,709
...from Kang Hwirim.
And we'll call it even.

208
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:09,876
You're offering me my own stuff?

209
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:13,741
If it were left in your car,
they'd have seized it already.

210
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,999
And you'd be under investigation.

211
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:18,083
Shouldn't you thank me?

212
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:20,500
Is this why you saved me?

213
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:25,999
Life for half the drug.
I think that's fair.

214
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:34,500
Let's end our beef here.

215
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,584
Don't bother us again.

216
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,667
You're lucky to have survived.
Hang onto it.

217
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,125
Make sure to clean things up.

218
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:54,292
I'm sure you'll do great.

219
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:01,292
How dare you...

I'm sorry, Father.

229
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,827
I couldn't live the way you told me to.

230
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:21,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
But once I'm there,

232
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:30,334
I'll try my best
to live as you said.

00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:06,542
DECEMBER 8
TWON HOLDINGS IR - D DAY

235
00:26:19,236 --> 00:26:20,876
It went as we planned.

236
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:24,918
Sua is in the clear,
and we split the drug fifty-fifty.

237
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:27,051
He can't touch us anymore.

238
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:32,880
You should've seen
Jang Taegu's face.

239
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:35,088
It felt so good.

240
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,876
Yeah, I wish I'd seen it.

241
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:47,167
I'll deliver the drug myself.

242
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:49,250
You hold onto them until then.

243
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:54,549
When will you be back from Japan?

244
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,626
We made a promise at the start.

245
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,054
I only need 200 million won.

246
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:14,459
The money we didn't send
to Jang Taegu is my cut.

247
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,042
The one billion from
Kang Hwirim is yours.

248
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:22,342
The day after tomorrow
is your D-day, right?

00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:06,334
YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO GOLD ART GALLERY.

258
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:11,792

Those bastards!

THE SPEED-DELIVERY
YOU REQUESTED IS COMPLETE

263
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:04,167
Mingyo!

264
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:10,083
We'll see you later, bye.

265
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:23,500
Oh, um... Daddy fell.

266
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:25,548
Mom will be here soon.

267
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:31,834
I just came to give you this.
I couldn't last time.

268
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,489
Daddy can give you things
like this every day.

269
00:30:36,582 --> 00:30:38,042
And fill your room with them.

270
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:47,045
Mingyo.

271
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:52,375
How about not going to the US
and living with Daddy?

272
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:00,827
Come here.

273
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:40,816
Jang Taegu seemed urgent for cash.

274
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:43,459
That means he cashed out his bitcoin.

275
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:46,999
I even checked his relatives' accounts,
but found nothing.

276
00:31:48,147 --> 00:31:51,875
Where did all that cash go?

277
00:31:56,626 --> 00:32:01,347
Keep looking.
I believe you're different from him.

278
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:20,125
Phantom appeared five years ago,

279
00:32:20,388 --> 00:32:22,417
and was on our radar for three years.

280
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:24,959
Did Taegu collude from the start?

281
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,000
At least 50 million per job.

282
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:32,918
If he took kickbacks for three years,
where did all that cash go?

283
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:38,999
Money...

284
00:32:40,362 --> 00:32:42,690
If I were him,
where would I stash it?

285
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:54,751
Are you really leaving like this?

286
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:02,854
Even after what Eunsoo did?

287
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,042
If you can't stop,
then I'll make you stop.

288
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:08,042
No!

289
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:12,834
I told you it'll be over soon.

290
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,167
She hurt you
and made you like this.

291
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,083
Aren't you angry at Eunsoo?

292
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:23,462
Me?

293
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:27,918
Do I have that right?

294
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,375
And whatever wrong she did,

295
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:35,999
she's family.

296
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:39,459
I never abandon family.

297
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:46,836
What about me?

298
00:33:49,186 --> 00:33:50,524
Are you my family?

299
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:57,584
Wasn't I until now?

300
00:33:57,873 --> 00:33:59,882
Then how could you
do that to Eunsoo?

301
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,000
RYU HYEONGSU
HAPPY BANK MANAGER

302
00:34:22,792 --> 00:34:25,999
That's how you took
Eunsoo's full-time position.

303
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:31,245
I kept quiet back then because

304
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:36,542
if Eunsoo lost her job
and her only friend,

305
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:39,792
I knew my wife
would've been devastated.

306
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:41,250
Do you understand?

307
00:34:44,107 --> 00:34:48,642
I'll take care of my family.
You stay out of it.

308
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:51,999
Stay away from Eunsoo and Sua.

309
00:34:53,354 --> 00:34:54,563
Dojin...

310
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,575
I won't see you out.

311
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:48,863
It's Eunsoo's fault.

312
00:35:53,631 --> 00:35:54,928
So why abandon me?

313
00:35:58,382 --> 00:36:00,522
Back then, I didn't know.

314
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:06,999
That the end of my story
would become someone else's beginning.

315
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:10,500
I'm Choi Gyeongdo from
Gwangnam Police Station.

316
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:11,459
Hello.

317
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,999
Inspector Jang downstairs
was injured and hospitalized.

318
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,999
Oh, dear.

319
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:17,334
Can you open the door
so I can get his clothes?

320
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,792
Sure, no problem.

321
00:38:50,054 --> 00:38:51,007
And?

322
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:55,999
Really?

323
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah, got it.

324
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:12,709
Why? What happened?

325
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:14,341
You know...

326
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,125
Our team needs to go
see a shaman.

327
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,834
We traced the burner phone
found in Sgt. Choi's drawer.

328
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:36,751
Every call was aligned with his location.

329
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:41,918
It was one of the pieces that
confirmed the suspicion about Sgt. Choi.

330
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,223
But at Sgt. Choi's request,

331
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:49,167
we checked the locations
of every other detective at those times.

332
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:53,245
And one person
was always with Sgt. Choi.

333
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:56,912
It was you, Inspector Jang.

334
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:04,292
CALL-DETAIL RECORDS

335
00:40:08,194 --> 00:40:09,295
We're on the same team.

336
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:12,255
Practically partners.
Of course, I was with him.

337
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:17,667
You used the burner phone
only when I was around.

338
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:21,000
So you can pin it on me.

339
00:40:23,918 --> 00:40:25,440
Watch your mouth.

340
00:40:25,816 --> 00:40:27,576
Hey, Choi Gyeongdo.

341
00:40:28,999 --> 00:40:33,599
I pulled you out of the trench
and put you in my team.

342
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,209
You're the one who betrayed me.

343
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:39,209
Betray you?

344
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:43,999
Hey, calm down.

345
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,792
I really respected you,
did you know that?

346
00:40:51,525 --> 00:40:53,739
I thought you were someone
worth following.

347
00:41:08,876 --> 00:41:10,999
Do I have to keep listening to this?

348
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:14,709
I don't think there's anything left
for me to explain.

349
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:18,160
Then what about the 800 million won
found at your house?

350
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:22,999
Investigation and search mean
sensing the discord in a space.

351
00:41:23,768 --> 00:41:25,311
That's what you always told me.

352
00:41:26,876 --> 00:41:28,292
So I found it.

353
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:32,429
In that shabby room,
the only new thing was the wallpaper.

354
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:36,487
You obviously didn't report it
as an asset.

355
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:40,354
How do you explain that?

356
00:41:43,651 --> 00:41:44,609
I can't.

357
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:48,639
If I had that kind of money,
why would I live there?

358
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:50,209
It's not my money.

359
00:41:50,515 --> 00:41:52,264
- Cut the crap.
- More importantly...

360
00:41:53,918 --> 00:41:55,396
Isn't that illegal entry?

361
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:57,959
The door couldn't have been open.

362
00:41:58,334 --> 00:41:59,999
Did you break a window
to get in?

363
00:42:01,189 --> 00:42:05,292
All the evidence
you collected is inadmissible.

364
00:42:05,334 --> 00:42:07,792
Maybe in court,
but not for the Internal Affairs.

365
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:11,500
Besides, I went there
on Detective Park's orders

366
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:14,250
to get your stuff for the hospital.

367
00:42:15,343 --> 00:42:17,372
The landlady herself opened the door.

368
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:44,542
Did you really think everything
would go your way?

369
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:49,999
The world doesn't work like that.

370
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:52,967
Mr. Jang Taegu.

371
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:02,709
I'm impressed.

372
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,292
You really took it up a notch.

373
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:09,584
I did learn from the best.

374
00:43:27,751 --> 00:43:31,584
Jang Taegu has been
officially listed as a suspect.

375
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:35,751
Shit...

376
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:43,243
The HQ wants him.
Transport him there yourself.

377
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:47,314
Yes, sir.

378
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:03,542
Just out of curiosity...

379
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:07,968
Three years ago,
when I first caught the Phantom underling,

380
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:11,930
they found cash in my trunk.

381
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,394
I got suspended because of that.

382
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:18,083
Was it you?

383
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:26,000
It was you...
Shit.

384
00:44:26,626 --> 00:44:27,999
I didn't even realize.

385
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:33,459
Hey, you borrowed
money from me all happy.

386
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:35,500
Now you feel wronged?

387
00:44:40,092 --> 00:44:41,885
I wonder if they're on the move.

What are you doing?
You can't come in!

393
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:18,250
Who are you people?

394
00:45:18,401 --> 00:45:19,281
What the...

395
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:20,999
Long time no see.

396
00:45:21,626 --> 00:45:24,792
I've been looking everywhere for you.

397
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:31,702
Damn, seeing your face
brings it all back.

398
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,959
Of you and your dad
begging me for forgiveness.

399
00:45:37,792 --> 00:45:41,999
You pleaded with me
to let you off that one time.

400
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,784
Turns out you and
your brother are rats.

401
00:45:46,999 --> 00:45:48,751
It must be a family thing.

00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:58,751

Wow, what a dream you have!

407
00:46:10,688 --> 00:46:12,056
Is she with you as well?

408
00:46:13,223 --> 00:46:15,140
Did you steal back the drug?

409
00:46:16,626 --> 00:46:19,459
- I have no idea what you're saying.
- Shut up.

410
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:23,626
Where's your brother?

411
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,999
Last class before the break, huh?

412
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:42,999
- Mr. Lee, we'll miss you.
- Seriously.

413
00:46:47,201 --> 00:46:48,991
BIG BRO

414
00:46:49,334 --> 00:46:50,584
Hold on.

415
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:54,656
Yeah.

416
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:57,083
Oh, Madam.

417
00:46:57,445 --> 00:47:00,375
You didn't have to.
You should've just come.

418
00:47:00,999 --> 00:47:03,999
It's under fifty thousand won,
please take it.

419
00:47:04,928 --> 00:47:07,929
Thank you.
By the way,

420
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:11,839
will Sua not be coming back
from Japan?

421
00:47:24,705 --> 00:47:26,792
Your case was all cleared.

422
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:30,959
Yujeong testified,
and the art tutor helped too.

423
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:37,209
I'm just going to say bye.

424
00:47:48,709 --> 00:47:49,918
This way.

425
00:47:51,584 --> 00:47:52,876
Keep going.

426
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,042
Surprise!

427
00:47:57,751 --> 00:47:58,709
Kang Hwirim?

428
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,375
Long time no see, James.

429
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,779
Or should I call you Lee Kyung?

430
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:08,867
Did you get taller in juvie?
I didn't recognize you.

431
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:12,792
- You...
- Wow, extraordinary.

432
00:48:12,834 --> 00:48:16,125
You have an impressive room.

I feel loved, you know?

437
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:47,999
So I want to return the favor.

438
00:48:48,876 --> 00:48:50,459
Hope you like it.

439
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:52,083
What?

440
00:48:53,552 --> 00:48:57,012
Mr. Lee Kyung.
Drug Crimes Unit.

441
00:48:57,356 --> 00:49:00,959
You're under arrest for drug trafficking.

442
00:49:01,876 --> 00:49:03,999
What do you think?
Do you like it?

443
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:08,417
I wish I could've seen your face.
Too bad I missed it.

444
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:11,876
Arrest him.

445
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:15,019
You lost again, dumbass.

446
00:49:16,459 --> 00:49:18,209
You have the right to remain silent.

447
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,542
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Hand me your phone.

448
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:24,250
Anything you say
can be used against you.

451
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:07,250
Clean it up.

452
00:50:50,526 --> 00:50:51,999
We'll be arriving any minute.

453
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:55,999
Be cooperative there,

454
00:50:57,999 --> 00:51:00,459
and pay for your crimes.

455
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:19,717
Gyeongdo was right.

456
00:51:21,403 --> 00:51:22,209
What?

457
00:51:22,278 --> 00:51:28,999
Things never happen as planned.

458
00:51:40,959 --> 00:51:42,000
Is that the art tutor?

459
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:04,999
Hey!

460
00:53:34,999 --> 00:53:36,868
What? Huh?

461
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,542
What!

462
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:22,666
Hey...

463
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,500
I know you're not fully recovered,

464
00:54:26,542 --> 00:54:29,709
but we're really out of time now.

465
00:54:30,712 --> 00:54:33,004
It's Japan,
so you'll get there fast.

466
00:54:35,521 --> 00:54:39,061
Deposit this before
you head to the airport.

467
00:54:40,999 --> 00:54:43,918
It'll cover treatment
and immediate living costs.

468
00:54:43,959 --> 00:54:47,360
I made it untraceable,
so don't worry.

469
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:49,792
What about you?

470
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:53,567
You're not coming?

471
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:58,447
I can't.

472
00:54:58,959 --> 00:55:00,106
Because of that tutor?

473
00:55:07,141 --> 00:55:07,999
Oh my God.

474
00:55:07,999 --> 00:55:10,876
Mr. Lee was a drug dealer?
For real?

475
00:55:10,918 --> 00:55:13,167
They say Jinhee's mom
was his client.

476
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:16,667
Wow, it's already in the news.
This is serious.

MIDDLE SCHOOL ART TUTOR
ARRESTED FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING

478
00:55:32,248 --> 00:55:34,999
If I get caught while coming along,

479
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:37,459
you and Sua may not
be able to depart.

480
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:43,111
Go with Sua first.
I'll follow you after I sort things out.

481
00:55:56,792 --> 00:55:58,292
I won't leave you behind.

482
00:55:58,334 --> 00:55:59,626
Honey!

483
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:03,083
You want me to live off the money
you made like this?

484
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,417
I can't.
I'd rather die.

485
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,959
How can you say that?

486
00:56:09,292 --> 00:56:11,751
Do you know
what I did to keep you alive?

487
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:13,459
That's exactly why!

488
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:18,864
Do you think I really wanted...

489
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:25,042
...to live despite
making you turn into this?

490
00:56:26,631 --> 00:56:28,716
Did you really think that?

491
00:56:29,044 --> 00:56:33,414
I hate myself for it, okay?

492
00:56:34,918 --> 00:56:41,003
If only I'd just died
on that hospital roof...

493
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:42,918
No.

494
00:56:43,709 --> 00:56:45,999
No, no.
It's not like that.

495
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:49,999
I did it because I need you.

496
00:56:50,999 --> 00:56:54,292
I couldn't bear the thought

497
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:57,250
of losing you from my life.

498
00:57:01,604 --> 00:57:03,446
That's why I did it.

499
00:57:05,983 --> 00:57:09,020
We can be a little greedy, right?

500
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,098
I never asked for anything ever.

501
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:16,125
All I'm asking for
is you, Sua, and our house.

502
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:24,709
Eunsoo.

503
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:30,282
Let's give it all up and leave.

504
00:57:32,768 --> 00:57:34,126
Don't be ridiculous.

505
00:57:34,999 --> 00:57:38,375
What about your treatment?
Where will we live?

506
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:40,417
We need at least this much money...

507
00:57:40,459 --> 00:57:41,999
We can do without it.

508
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:45,731
We've managed fine till now.

509
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:52,000
So let's leave it all behind.

510
00:57:52,999 --> 00:57:54,999
That's the only way it'll end.

511
00:57:57,141 --> 00:58:01,999
Let's give everything up,
pay for our sins, and go together.

512
00:58:02,465 --> 00:58:03,792
I'll wait for you.

513
00:58:04,626 --> 00:58:06,918
If people curse us,
we'll hear it together.

514
00:58:07,626 --> 00:58:09,751
If they throw stones,
we'll take them together.

515
00:58:11,269 --> 00:58:13,334
It'll be hard on Sua,

516
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:17,517
but if the three of us are together,
we'll be okay.

517
00:58:59,607 --> 00:59:00,897
Doctor...

518
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:05,857
I'm sorry.
I did all I could.

519
00:59:08,167 --> 00:59:09,876
What do you mean?

520
00:59:09,918 --> 00:59:13,375
Is Detective Park dead?
Is he really dead?

521
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:15,876
- I'm so sorry.
- Maybe there was a mistake.

522
00:59:17,459 --> 00:59:18,792
Please!

523
00:59:21,751 --> 00:59:24,999
You promised we'd catch
the culprit together!

524
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,959
Don't break your promise!

525
01:00:06,385 --> 01:00:07,963
Let's go turn ourselves in.

526
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:12,862
I'll be with you.

527
01:01:18,209 --> 01:01:20,999
Water. Give me water.

528
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:23,292
Who are you?

529
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,709
Going somewhere?

530
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:43,834
Who are you?

531
01:01:46,959 --> 01:01:49,042
Honey! Honey!

532
01:01:51,054 --> 01:01:52,972
I'm in a really bad mood.

533
01:01:54,653 --> 01:01:57,999
So just answer me straight, got it?

534
01:02:02,226 --> 01:02:03,393
Is that the money?

535
01:02:14,289 --> 01:02:15,308
Where's the drug?

536
01:02:17,999 --> 01:02:18,999
The drug!

537
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:26,959
Look, it's in a private safe.

538
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:30,459
Here's the address and passcode.

539
01:02:31,209 --> 01:02:32,834
Here.

540
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:50,626
I'm not lying.
Everything's there.

541
01:03:38,999 --> 01:03:40,292
But the numbers don't add up.

542
01:03:50,959 --> 01:03:52,042
Unfortunately,

543
01:03:54,834 --> 01:03:57,167
the thing I hate most
is unfairness.

544
01:04:22,938 --> 01:04:27,125
Why is Assistant Choi telling me
to cover up for her miscounting?

545
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:28,459
It sucks to be a temporary employee.

546
01:04:32,709 --> 01:04:34,375
No discrimination my ass.

547
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:36,999
They never even had lunch with us.

548
01:04:40,593 --> 01:04:41,552
You're right.

549
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:47,167
Guess Assistant Choi
doesn't even eat.

550
01:04:47,459 --> 01:04:50,918
- I need to go.
- Have some more. You haven't finished.

551
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,729
Enjoy your lunch.

552
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,834
2004 HAPPY BANK
FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT

553
01:05:00,459 --> 01:05:03,718
Gosh, am I going to fail again?

554
01:05:08,876 --> 01:05:10,211
Is this seat taken?

555
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:14,417
Ah, no.

556
01:05:21,664 --> 01:05:23,128
You're Eunsoo, right?

557
01:05:24,751 --> 01:05:25,847
EMPLOYEE KANG EUNSOO

558
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,667
Oh, yes.

559
01:05:27,709 --> 01:05:31,132
I'm in HR,
so I'm good with names.

560
01:05:31,209 --> 01:05:32,757
Oh, I see.

561
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:35,999
I've heard only
good things about you.

562
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:39,234
People say you're diligent
and hardworking.

563
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:42,584
Thank you.
It's about the only thing I'm good at.

564
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:44,619
And that's amazing.

565
01:05:45,406 --> 01:05:48,656
Working hard is the most difficult.

566
01:05:49,584 --> 01:05:50,999
Not everyone can do it.

567
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,918
Thank you.

568
01:05:59,093 --> 01:06:01,248
- Over here!
- Oh, yeah.

569
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:03,000
Hello.

570
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:07,459
Hi, nice to meet you.

571
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,205
I'll introduce you.

572
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:12,626
This is Section Chief Song.

573
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:15,448
- And this is Section Chief Kim.
- Pleasure to meet you.

574
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,751
And he's Section Chief Yuk.

575
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:21,862
I've heard a lot about you.

576
01:06:22,709 --> 01:06:23,959
You're very beautiful.

577
01:07:05,709 --> 01:07:08,542
