1
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,999
WALKING ON THIN ICE

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
DRUG USE ISN’T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

3
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:45,348
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,999
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

5
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:55,066
She takes all my money,
and now, sole custody too?

6
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,534
I need permission to see my son?

7
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,206
What kind of verdict is this?

8
00:00:58,237 --> 00:01:00,667
We did our best,
but the domestic violence...

9
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:03,667
No, I just pushed her once.
That's all!

10
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:08,206
Aside from that, unilaterally spending
marital assets was the decider.

11
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,626
In other words,
the money you blew on stocks.

12
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:12,417
I'll pay it back, damn it!

13
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,999
Smells like dog food.

14
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:43,834
Shit, what's the point
of locking them up?

15
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:49,326
Those drug dealers serve a short time
and come out to do it over.

16
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:52,751
Damn, look at his car.
It's my first time seeing it.

17
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:55,282
The world's really unfair, isn't it?

18
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:57,805
Officers, thank you for everything.

19
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,999
EPISODE 8

20
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,999
I'll just post it
in the kids' group chat.

21
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:23,334
That'll make it certain, right?

22
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,999
I see that your mother's your only family.
Should I contact her?

23
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:25,498
There's also the bail issue.

24
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:33,542
Crap, they said to start off
with personal stuff first...

25
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:38,571
I'm the type who can't bear
unsolved problems.

26
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,213
Please, wait.

27
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:04,485
At first, I thought you were
vishing or something, you know?

28
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:08,083
But the numbers kept bugging me,
like I'd seen them somewhere.

29
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,999
Because Oct 8th is the day
your gang member, Kim Bongnam, died.

30
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:18,417
And on Oct 16th, the drug you lost
was found at Medusa.

31
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:21,751
Nov 16th is the day
Hwang Donghyun died.

32
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:24,584
If it happens three times,
it's not a coincidence.

33
00:05:24,626 --> 00:05:25,999
IF IT HAPPENS THREE TIMES,
IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE

34
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:31,542
Someone I respect the most
told me that.

35
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:39,999
Anyway, maybe the first numbers
are deadlines or execution dates,

36
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,584
and the latter numbers
are the fees, you know?

37
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:46,203
Who's the money-grubber?

38
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:48,042
MONEY-GRUBBER

39
00:05:48,188 --> 00:05:50,824
The one that gives you
info like this.

40
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,250
Is it a cop?

41
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,083
DICTIONARY

42
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:24,250
Hey, there.

43
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:27,792
You're the money-grubber,
aren't you?

44
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:35,999
Wait...

45
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:44,042
It wasn't Miyeon.

46
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:53,125
You figured it out, well done.

47
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:57,292
You took Phantom's money,
leaked police intel,

48
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,999
and now that they're down,
you're squeezing cash out of us?

49
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:01,417
Yeah, that's right.

50
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,949
All you need to do is pay me
100 million a week,

51
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,542
and I'll watch your backs.

52
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:09,859
It's a win-win, right?

53
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,999
Don't get cocky.
I know you're a cop.

54
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:15,069
You're the one who's being cocky.

55
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:18,834
You're planning a revenge
on Kang Hwirim.

56
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:34,250
I really like the look in your eyes.

57
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:42,417
I feel a sense of achievement
and satisfaction, you know?

58
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:48,141
Still doesn't ring a bell?

59
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:49,918
Take a guess.

60
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,459
It was ten years ago.

61
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:09,874
It can't be...

62
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,500
- No way, you're...
- Finally catching on?

63
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:16,742
I looked at the report
from ten years ago

64
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:19,542
and tailed you a bit
until I figured it out.

65
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:25,250
I wasn't assigned to your case,
so maybe you don't recall.

66
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:27,999
I didn't recognize you at first, either.

67
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,944
You've grown a lot.

68
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:34,999
And changed too.
Both of us have.

69
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:49,740
I was waiting for the Phantom guys
to come out with the drug bag.

70
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:54,334
But they came out unconscious.

71
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,999
- That's when I saw the worth.
- What worth?

72
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:14,616
A college kid and a housewife.

73
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:18,459
Innocuous backgrounds,
full of experience, great at sales,

74
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,459
and bold to top it all off.

75
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,112
How did you know Hwang Donghyun
would plant his phone there?

76
00:09:27,323 --> 00:09:30,999
I didn't even know that the restaurant
was Phantom's hideout.

77
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:36,500
You killed Hwang Donghyun,
didn't you?

78
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:38,999
Shush.

79
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,459
You're meticulous too.

80
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,329
I am so good at reading people.

81
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:14,860
Nice recording.

82
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:21,083
You like playing with people,
don't you, James?

83
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:24,199
You know,
I enjoy doing that as well.

84
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:39,505
I bet you have tons of brushes.

85
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,834
You need to eat well to study hard.

86
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:45,626
- Looks delicious.
- Thanks, Yeoju.

87
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:48,167
- Meat won't make you fat.
- Thanks for the dinner.

88
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,751
- Help yourselves.
- Thank you.

89
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,918
- Sua, it's your favorite.
- I know, looks great.

90
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,292
Hey, Eunsoo!

91
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:00,167
Hurry, let's eat.

92
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:03,751
Come on.

93
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,209
Honey, is something wrong?

94
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,250
No, nothing.

95
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,792
Mom, this is really good.
Come on.

96
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,709
You like it?
Eunsoo, hurry up.

97
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:30,876
I made all of this at home.

98
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,626
Honey, I'm getting a call.
I'll call you back.

99
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:36,292
Gwangnam Police Station.

100
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,924
Ah, yes.

101
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:42,667
Yes, yes.

102
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,667
Yes, understood.
I'll come now.

103
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:52,667
Why does shit always happen
right before the clock-out?

104
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,292
- What's going on?
- I dunno.

105
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:56,999
An ER patient is
suspected of drug use.

106
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:59,492
It's our wedding anniversary.
What do I tell her?

107
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,486
Want me to go?

108
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:04,083
- Hey, Gyeongdo.
- Yes?

109
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,889
- You know I love you, right?
- No.

110
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,250
Well, now you do.

111
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,125
Thanks. I'll treat you
to something really good.

112
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,999
Thanks, man.

113
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:17,000
- Have a good one.
- Thanks, you too.

114
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,999
HAPPINESS HOSPITAL ER
SUSPECTED OF DRUG USE

00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:47,167
DK: 36 SANGURO, DONGJINGU, SEOUL
MUNGANG UNIV. 0.3 G

116
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,626
Where were you all day?

117
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:16,292
Something came up.

118
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:17,886
What's more important than this?

119
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,250
Do you know how mad Austin is?

120
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,834
He's furious for losing money
due to changes in the schedule.

121
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:27,674
Calm down,
it's just one variable.

122
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:32,209
Keep the meeting as is.
I'll contact you tomorrow.

123
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:42,388
A CHAEBOL 4TH-GEN OUTBURSTS
WITH MENTAL ISSUES

124
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:52,542
Who could it be?
M Electronics? C Group?

125
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:53,542
TwoN?

126
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:56,834
There was an article about
a new Executive Director.

127
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:59,459
If it's TwoN,
it has to be Kang Hwirim.

128
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,999
Better sell your TwoN Holdings shares.

129
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,999
KANG HWIRIM

130
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:24,292
Where are you?
Why won't you pick up?

131
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:26,959
Are you kidding me?
Answer the phone.

132
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:29,754
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up!

133
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:30,999
Answer!

134
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,999
I'm sorry, I'm sick.
I don't think I can come in.

135
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,999
- I'm sorry.
- Eunsoo, you can't just...

136
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:45,292
How could you do this?

137
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:48,534
Acting all perfect, bossing everyone,
pressuring our family!

138
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:51,104
All while you were doing drugs?

139
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:58,162
Keep your voice down.
This is a hospital.

140
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,779
What?
Are you embarrassed?

141
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:05,584
I'm the one embarrassed here.
How am I supposed to live?

142
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,751
Everyone around us knows!

143
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:13,083
Honey, honey!

144
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,471
Why are you here?

145
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,250
To laugh at me?
On my face?

146
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:07,381
This is all your fault!
If it weren't for you...

147
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:20,084
How is this my fault?

148
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,125
- What?
- Did I tell you to do it?

149
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:27,606
You made your own choices.
How is that my fault?

150
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:33,918
So what?
Are you saying you're innocent?

151
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,334
Stop making me crazy.
Give me my phone and get out!

152
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,238
You took it, didn't you?

153
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,281
Wouldn't it be dangerous
for you to have it?

154
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:04,999
As you know,
even if you did drugs,

155
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:08,375
if they can't prove where you got them,
you could be cleared.

156
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:11,500
Even if you say
you picked them up off the street,

157
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:13,959
the police can't disprove it.

158
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:18,370
But if they find the phone,
they'll know how you got them.

159
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:20,751
So what?

160
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,264
I'll take care of it.
And make sure it's never found.

161
00:19:28,592 --> 00:19:32,994
Did you take my drugs too?

162
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:35,209
The cops said
they couldn't find them.

163
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:41,018
You came to make a deal,
didn't you?

164
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:44,250
You'll get rid of
my drugs and my phone,

165
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:47,451
and in return,
I keep quiet about your affair?

166
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:53,834
Wow, I'm impressed.

167
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:56,478
How many twists are there?

168
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:58,999
I used to hate you, Eunsoo.

169
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:02,584
A woman with nothing
to show for herself,

170
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:06,292
pretending to be happy and all.
You looked pathetic.

171
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,999
But now, I don't hate you as much.

172
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:14,122
Now I know you're messed up too.

173
00:20:18,553 --> 00:20:19,553
You know what?

174
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,918
If I were you, I'd never!

175
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,834
- Hello.
- You're back again.

176
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:48,999
Yes, I heard Yang Miyeon
regained consciousness.

177
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:52,500
Oh, right this way.

178
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:08,751
ART CLASS TUTOR

179
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:19,959
Why do you never answer my calls?

180
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:24,584
I was just trying to kill some bugs.

181
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,666
It was really there.

182
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:34,754
You look serious.
Did you buy our company's stock too?

183
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:39,482
I guess you did.

184
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:43,083
Don't worry.
All the articles will be gone by today,

185
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,999
and the IR next month
will raise the stock prices again.

186
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:48,385
Next month?
It was supposed to be next year.

187
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:52,709
We moved it up because of yesterday.
Cover the noise with noise.

188
00:21:56,753 --> 00:21:59,211
You knew about
the IR presentation schedule?

189
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,334
You must've bought a lot.

190
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:07,465
So, did you bring it?

191
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:09,584
- Vaca?
- Yeah.

192
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:16,652
Fine, I'll supply it to you
anytime you want.

193
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,639
But throw me a few more
parties in return.

194
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,898
And maybe plug my NFT
while you're at it.

195
00:22:25,602 --> 00:22:27,226
You paint too?

196
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:30,261
So you want my friends, right?

197
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:33,709
I grow my client base,
and you get a steady supply.

198
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:34,999
It's a win-win.

199
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,751
Yes, sounds good.

200
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,500
But I need to lie low until the IR.

201
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:44,042
Too bad.

202
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:45,999
What about the Vaca?

203
00:22:48,398 --> 00:22:50,024
Aren't you going to lay low?

204
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:51,959
James!

205
00:22:52,782 --> 00:22:54,073
Give me Vaca.

206
00:22:59,417 --> 00:23:01,709
Try checking under the bed.

207
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:28,341
You really love this view.

208
00:23:28,396 --> 00:23:32,167
I showed you better places,
but you must be feeling this one.

209
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:33,745
Any special reason?

210
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:34,913
It was mine originally.

211
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:38,083
Lost it by mistake.

212
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:42,417
Oh, so you're getting it back.
Nice!

213
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:46,584
I worked hard for it.

214
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:06,000
Kang Hwirim still doesn't know
who you are, right?

215
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:10,095
You were cut off, kicked out,
and came all this way alone.

216
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:14,042
If one word from me
ruins your ten years of revenge,

217
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,999
wouldn't that be tragic?

218
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:30,209
So just do as I say.
If you want your revenge, that is.

219
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,375
Don't get cocky.

220
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:54,792
PERSONAL INFORMATION

221
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:00,459
PAYS 1.5 MIL WON MONTHLY CHILD SUPPORT.
CURRENT ASSETS: RENT DEPOSIT

222
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,959
We need to hurry with the plan.
I'll meet Austin myself.

223
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:20,334
We're running out of time...

224
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,999
Out of time? Who's Austin?

225
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:40,968
Why are you here?

226
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:43,390
Jinhee's mom.

227
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,299
Again with that?

228
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,744
She's not the blackmailer.
She was a client.

229
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:52,229
Our client!
She was DK!

230
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:56,697
Are you sure?
How did you not know earlier?

231
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,884
Because she never ordered it
to her home.

232
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:02,500
She had it sent to a spot
near the school.

233
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,000
What a pain in the ass.

234
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:09,209
We need to shut down operations.
The police have started investigating.

235
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,959
A cop came to the hospital today.
The one that came to my house.

236
00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:14,778
Who? Jang Taegu?

237
00:26:15,334 --> 00:26:17,258
No, the younger one.
He's...

238
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:20,229
Choi Gyeongdo?

239
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:23,364
How do you know his name?

240
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:28,238
Wait, then is he...
The cop is the blackmailer?

241
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,832
Kang Eunsoo is your responsibility.

242
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:34,042
She's our insurance.
Keep the drug on her.

243
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,999
If things go south,
we'll pin it on her.

244
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:40,542
Make sure she doesn't get
any funny ideas.

245
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:41,999
Got it?

246
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:46,417
No, I don't think so.

247
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:49,751
- Then who?
- If I knew, I wouldn't be here.

248
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:54,659
We can't shut down.
We owe that guy 100 mil every week.

249
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,999
First, open a new account.

250
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:59,959
Change the packaging
since the highlighter got exposed.

251
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,999
I switched to drop-off delivery.

252
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:05,751
Next, we need that
professor lady's phone.

253
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,858
I've got it.

254
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:13,161
Good. Without the phone,
there's no forensics.

255
00:27:13,177 --> 00:27:15,459
No proof of sale means
no warrant.

256
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,959
They can't reach us.

257
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:20,841
That's not very like you.

258
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,999
You hate creating risk.

259
00:27:24,758 --> 00:27:27,446
The situation's giving us no choice.

260
00:27:27,454 --> 00:27:29,469
We need to find the blackmailer first.

261
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:32,959
Then we can either
negotiate or blackmail back.

262
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,667
Business isn't the issue right now!

263
00:27:38,576 --> 00:27:42,659
Oh, I get it.
You want to quit, huh?

264
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:47,210
Why? Do you finally feel guilty
after seeing a fellow parent get screwed?

265
00:27:47,226 --> 00:27:50,000
But we can't go on living like this.

266
00:27:50,132 --> 00:27:54,320
The more we do this,
the more we ruin others.

267
00:27:54,343 --> 00:27:56,459
We were wrecked from the start!

268
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:01,386
Is this really because of that professor?

269
00:28:01,751 --> 00:28:04,667
Bullshit. You hated her
from the beginning.

270
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:08,999
What about Hwang Donghyun?
He tried to strangle you to death.

271
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:10,667
You actually feel sorry for them?

272
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:13,209
Has it made you feel any better?

273
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,233
Don't kid yourself!
You're still a criminal!

274
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,876
Humans are so fucked up.

275
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,357
One minute, they're
on their knees begging.

276
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:39,857
Next, as soon as they can breathe,
they flip on a dime.

277
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:45,235
I don't care what you feel inside.

278
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:51,000
Just don't get in my way
and do as you're told!

279
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,209
Maybe you started this,

280
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:57,000
but I'll be the one to end it.

281
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,792
BASTARD

282
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:27,584
Name, Yang Miyeon.
Professor of Law at Munggang University.

283
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:29,626
One of your guys took the case.

284
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,296
She's our client.
Handle it well.

285
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:37,187
You said you have our back.
Earn your pay.

286
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:52,000
GWANGNAM POLICE STATION

287
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:56,500
That professor was
MintCandy's customer?

288
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,584
Yes, that's what it looks like.

289
00:29:58,826 --> 00:30:02,542
In case you forgot,
MintCandy is dead.

290
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,598
It was Hwang Donghyun of Phantom.

291
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,700
He got killed for secretly selling drugs
behind Do Gyuman's back.

292
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:11,082
Is he back from the dead, or what?

293
00:30:11,122 --> 00:30:13,999
- No, it's not that.
- Then what?

294
00:30:14,148 --> 00:30:16,195
What if it wasn't Hwang Donghyun
to begin with?

295
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:21,815
Do Gyuman denied
killing Hwang, remember?

296
00:30:24,277 --> 00:30:27,709
They all say that.
All criminals say they're innocent.

297
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:32,160
But what if?
What if Hwang wasn't MintCandy,

298
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:34,334
and Do Gyuman didn't kill Hwang either?

299
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,375
It's not just Yang Miyeon.

300
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:42,709
Iksan, Jeonju, Busan, Incheon, Mapo...

301
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:46,323
They're all regions where
the candy-shaped meth was reported.

302
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,709
All after our case got closed.

303
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:52,626
I know that there are
tons of online drug dealers.

304
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,792
We can't say it's Phantom's meth
just because it looks similar.

305
00:30:56,209 --> 00:30:57,167
And yet?

306
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,999
Let the national lab
run a composition analysis.

307
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:04,201
If it's a different drug,
I'll drop it.

308
00:31:04,693 --> 00:31:08,959
But if it's the same,
our case isn't over.

309
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:13,751
The culprit holding the missing stash

310
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:17,962
might also be the one
who killed Hwang Donghyun.

311
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:30,930
- Who are the suspects?
- What? I, uh...

312
00:31:31,032 --> 00:31:34,501
Start with that.
Bring me something I can take upstairs.

313
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,864
Thank you, sir!

314
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:49,564
I don't want anyone but you
and Detective Park to know about this.

315
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,814
I think there's a spy in our team.

316
00:31:54,463 --> 00:31:55,088
What?

317
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:57,478
I found out while analyzing
Hwang's texts.

318
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,685
I'll put it in the report.

319
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,193
Gyeongdo.

320
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:08,443
Don't overdo it.

321
00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:13,744
If you burn out,
it's hard to get back up.

322
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:32,335
What a pity.

323
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:21,042
STUDY ABROAD TO SHINE

324
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,751
FIRST NOTICE OF PAYMENT DUE

325
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:36,709
Mom, blood!

326
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,209
Don't mind me and go to school.
You're late.

327
00:36:46,506 --> 00:36:47,959
No, but still...

328
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:50,069
It's okay, honey.
I'll clean it. You rest.

329
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:56,999
Sorry, I'll clean it up.

330
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:03,792
Just don't do anything.
What can you even do?

331
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:09,250
Both of you just leave me alone!

332
00:37:10,198 --> 00:37:11,583
Gosh...

333
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:11,209
The incident happened
sooner than planned,

334
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,709
and TwoN Holdings shares nosedived.

335
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:16,320
And I ended up losing money.

336
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:23,417
Funding TwoN Construction has drained cash
from the Holdings branch.

337
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:26,831
They'll likely seek a stock-backed loan.

338
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,686
If the price plunges,
TwoN shares will open at limit-down,

339
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:36,893
triggering forced sell orders.

340
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:41,854
That's when we strike.

341
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:47,834
Most importantly,
only we know about this.

342
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:50,072
Because I'm the one
who'll create the incident.

343
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:08,329
When's the D-day?

344
00:39:11,274 --> 00:39:15,459
On Dec 8th, they will hold
the IR presentation

345
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,426
which had been planned for next year,
to cover up the incident.

346
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:20,411
Kang Hwirim will host it.

347
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:26,000
Press and officials will attend to
hear about the one trillion won project.

348
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,500
When our operation begins that day,

349
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,999
40%...

350
00:39:32,626 --> 00:39:36,999
Actually, with just 1%,
we can take over TwoN.

351
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:43,709
And whether this plan succeeds or fails,
Austin, you lose nothing.

352
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,460
I received the money.
Did you take out a loan?

353
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,571
I sold my car.

354
00:40:20,857 --> 00:40:24,273
Just 4,000 more shares
and we'll hit the target stake.

355
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:28,751
- 4,000 shares?
- Yeah, 200 mil won to go.

356
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:33,489
I have everything else ready.
Can you handle it?

357
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:38,417
I'll figure it out before the IR.
Don't worry.

358
00:40:40,292 --> 00:40:41,290
I'll be off.

359
00:40:50,132 --> 00:40:51,410
You should drop by the house.

360
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:56,000
Mom's birthday is soon.

361
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:40,334
SEARCH IMAGE

362
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:53,083
Austin Kim

363
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:57,542
M&A consultant?

364
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:01,417
Why are you involved
with someone like this?

365
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:02,999
Wait...

366
00:42:17,626 --> 00:42:19,918
Seonjung Construction.

367
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:24,500
Seonjung Construction?

368
00:42:34,242 --> 00:42:35,433
They look similar.

369
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:38,999
I even cut ties with my own family.

370
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:43,042
BRO

371
00:42:57,334 --> 00:43:01,876
Finally, Eunsoo is back
to her usual self.

372
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,500
REGISTERED SUBJECT
HAS LEFT THE DESIGNATED ZONE

373
00:43:19,939 --> 00:43:22,334
- Seongyeol, I'll be back.
- What?

374
00:43:23,752 --> 00:43:25,919
- Where are you going?
- What? Where's she going?

375
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:28,409
Eunsoo, Eunsoo!

376
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:38,375
Do you know who painted these?

377
00:43:40,061 --> 00:43:42,646
He did.

378
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,167
If you buy a painting,

379
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:52,301
you get Vaca as a freebie!

380
00:43:54,584 --> 00:43:57,885
I sent everyone the link.
Check it out!

381
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:01,167
Awesome!

382
00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:03,959
You'll never get
a deal like this anywhere.

383
00:45:22,221 --> 00:45:23,876
What are you doing here?

384
00:45:23,918 --> 00:45:26,998
You're going up the social ladder
thanks to me, huh?

385
00:45:28,218 --> 00:45:29,427
This isn't the Joseon Dynasty.

386
00:45:30,626 --> 00:45:33,667
What difference is there?
Right?

387
00:45:35,084 --> 00:45:37,127
You once said the exact same thing.

388
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:40,083
I did? When?

389
00:45:41,334 --> 00:45:46,542
A long time ago.
You won't even remember.

390
00:45:57,999 --> 00:45:58,999
KANG HWIRIM

391
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:28,167
There you go!

392
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:46,959
Let's go around and dance together...

393
00:46:46,975 --> 00:46:48,042
Anyone home? Hello?

394
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:49,584
Anyone home? Hello?

395
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,108
Is your wife home?

396
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,713
I came by once before.

397
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:06,959
Uh, I'm a police officer.

398
00:47:57,876 --> 00:47:59,292
I paid for this myself.

399
00:47:59,948 --> 00:48:02,751
Do you make your own living?
Do you live alone?

400
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:05,124
Sometimes my mom
and her boyfriend come by.

401
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,686
My mom works at a bar.

402
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:14,268
I never talk about it,
but there's no point hiding from you.

403
00:48:16,404 --> 00:48:18,069
Nothing to be ashamed of.

404
00:48:18,626 --> 00:48:21,000
If a cashier is embarrassed
by a professor,

405
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:22,918
and a bar waitress
by a cashier,

406
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:25,999
then who's at the very bottom
of the pyramid?

407
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:31,459
Honestly, the most pathetic ones
are those who play along.

408
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:37,959
You really sound like your mom.

409
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,544
She was very cool
at the open class.

410
00:48:50,084 --> 00:48:54,669
The delivery part-time job...
Do you know what you carry?

411
00:48:55,876 --> 00:48:59,636
It changes every time.
I take whatever pops up in the chat.

412
00:48:59,918 --> 00:49:03,500
I peeked once,
and it was an adult toy.

413
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:05,709
- The long...
- No, don't say it.

414
00:49:05,882 --> 00:49:07,550
I haven't opened anything since.

415
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:10,334
Why? Interested?

416
00:49:12,374 --> 00:49:14,083
No, just curious.

417
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:16,626
How much does it pay?

418
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:18,709
What do you mean by that?

419
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:22,542
I've been cutting you slack
because I know you.

420
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:27,125
I gave you advances and rearranged
your shifts for your husband's sake.

421
00:49:27,669 --> 00:49:29,250
But this is too much.

422
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:32,792
You were late and absent
twice this week.

423
00:49:32,834 --> 00:49:36,292
I'm not being unreasonable.
You crossed the line.

424
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:42,844
I've always covered for others and
even picked up extra shifts when needed.

425
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:45,584
I also handled orders and payments
when you were busy.

426
00:49:45,626 --> 00:49:47,751
I did everything for you.

427
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,292
What I mean is...

428
00:49:52,334 --> 00:49:54,626
I guess we had our troubles.
Let's end it here.

429
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:57,459
I hope you find
a better job for yourself.

430
00:49:57,999 --> 00:50:01,876
I've worked here for five years,
ever since I quit the bank.

431
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:04,999
You know how hard
I've worked for you.

432
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:08,999
If I lose this job too,
I've got nowhere left to go.

433
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,999
- Isn't it cold today?
- Yeah, it's chilly.

434
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:15,999
- Want your receipt?
- Yes, please.

435
00:50:17,876 --> 00:50:20,709
I've deposited your pay.
You're done here.

436
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:24,780
Boss, please give me
one more chance. It's my fault.

437
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:28,792
Return the warehouse keys
and everything to Sungyeol.

438
00:50:29,131 --> 00:50:30,131
Please!

439
00:50:35,334 --> 00:50:38,209
Get the warehouse key from here...

440
00:50:46,584 --> 00:50:48,959
I'll get going now.
Thank you.

441
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:19,999
VISIT TO KANG EUNSOO'S HOUSE

442
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:22,667
SHE IS HWANG DONGHYUN'S COWORKER

443
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:25,292
SHE IS YANG MIYEON'S ACQUAINTANCE

444
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,626
Three coincidences...

445
00:51:56,999 --> 00:52:00,626
Hyuk told me you're still painting.

446
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:03,999
So you went to college after all.

447
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:05,375
He's graduating top of his class.

448
00:52:06,092 --> 00:52:07,296
It's still pending.

449
00:52:08,032 --> 00:52:08,858
Good.

450
00:52:16,218 --> 00:52:18,862
You've worked hard.

451
00:52:23,709 --> 00:52:25,045
Say what you want to say.

452
00:52:27,518 --> 00:52:29,268
Happy birthday.

453
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:35,292
Take it.

454
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:38,266
Yeah...

455
00:52:45,792 --> 00:52:46,999
Thank you.

456
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,918
Go on, eat.
You too.

457
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:53,999
Okay.

458
00:52:54,513 --> 00:52:56,751
- What are you doing?
- Yes...

459
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:57,959
Does it taste okay?

460
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:00,542
It's really good.

461
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:02,083
- It's delicious.
- Help yourself.

462
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:05,350
You too.

463
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:07,500
- Yeah.
- Good.

464
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:09,584
Mom made this especially for you.

465
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:14,999
I'll pour you a drink.

466
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,999
I need to use the bathroom.

467
00:54:32,053 --> 00:54:33,257
Oh, Dad.

468
00:54:34,273 --> 00:54:36,093
Didn't you say
you got some good wine?

469
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:40,500
Ah, right. I'll bring it.
Let's have a glass.

470
00:54:55,927 --> 00:55:00,334
If your ex-spouse takes your child
and remarries or emigrates,

471
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:02,334
you can file a custody modification.

472
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:07,042
What if she does both
without my consent?

473
00:55:09,227 --> 00:55:11,125
Can I bring my son back?

474
00:55:11,167 --> 00:55:13,999
- Well, that depends.
- Depends on what?

475
00:55:13,999 --> 00:55:16,792
Your proof of stable housing
and financial means.

476
00:55:16,834 --> 00:55:19,417
You must prepare and submit
the documents as soon as possible.

477
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:22,417
Before she leaves the country
with the child.

478
00:55:40,334 --> 00:55:44,459
You said you're okay now.
That's why I called him.

479
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:49,563
I thought I'd be fine,
but I guess I'm not fine after all.

480
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,876
It's been ten years.

481
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:54,209
Kyung had it hard himself.

482
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,999
It's all in the past.
Let's just forget it now.

483
00:55:56,999 --> 00:56:00,500
If I could do that,
I wouldn't be like this, okay?

484
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:03,667
- Honey!
- Kyung killed a person!

485
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,667
I'll go.

486
00:56:25,999 --> 00:56:26,999
Kyung...

487
00:56:28,292 --> 00:56:29,459
Kyung!

488
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:46,250
JAMES

489
00:56:51,584 --> 00:56:55,999
I want 200 million a week,
cash only.

490
00:57:51,292 --> 00:57:54,542
Huh? That detective's here again.

491
00:57:54,584 --> 00:57:56,167
Is he like family?

492
00:57:56,842 --> 00:57:59,966
Or the patient
is a very big criminal.

493
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:08,167
HWANG DONGHYUN'S MURDER...
IS IT DO GYUMAN? JAMES?

494
00:58:13,209 --> 00:58:17,000
OR KANG EUNSOO?

495
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:23,959
You're the only one
who knows the whole truth.

496
00:58:29,709 --> 00:58:33,626
HAPPY MART

497
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:55,542
TWON HOLDINGS
IR PRESENTATION D-DAY

498
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,375
Just 4,000 more shares
and we'll hit the target stake.

499
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:04,876
- 4,000 shares?
- Yeah, 200 mil won to go.

500
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:09,167
Secure the shares first.
Jang Taegu comes after.

501
00:59:11,537 --> 00:59:13,912
I do feel a bit bad for Eunsoo.

502
00:59:17,751 --> 00:59:18,999
No, it's your Dad's!

503
00:59:25,999 --> 00:59:29,491
Once the IR's over,
I'll return everything.

504
00:59:30,155 --> 00:59:31,667
Just hang in there a bit longer.

505
00:59:35,959 --> 00:59:37,709
TRANSFER

506

200 MILLION WON TRANSFERRED
TO GOLD ART GALLERY CO., LTD

507
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:48,959
I sent the money.

508
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:07,125
PARTNER

509
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:36,167
He raised it to 200 million.
Handle this one last time.

510
01:00:42,999 --> 01:00:44,667
I suddenly thought to myself.

511
01:00:46,192 --> 01:00:48,873
Comparing now and
before all this started...

512
01:00:53,902 --> 01:00:56,651
Which one's worse off?

513
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,417
Please select your desired transaction.

514
01:01:18,999 --> 01:01:20,999
CHECK THE AMOUNT TO SEND

515
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:28,792

01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,959
Please wait a moment.

518
01:01:33,999 --> 01:01:37,999
Please check your balance
and select your transaction.

519
01:01:43,999 --> 01:01:44,999
PARTNER

520
01:01:46,999 --> 01:01:49,999
The number you have dialed
is turned off.

521
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:51,999
Please leave a message after...

522
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:04,209
We extended the deadline
several times.

523
01:02:04,363 --> 01:02:05,894
We can't wait any longer.

524
01:02:05,933 --> 01:02:08,999
You haven't paid the balance,
so the contract is canceled.

525
01:02:09,999 --> 01:02:12,626
Please wait!

526
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:14,999
Madam!

527
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:40,918
One thing's for sure.
Every misfortune and every luck

528
01:02:41,229 --> 01:02:43,194
has its breaking point.

529
01:03:45,344 --> 01:03:47,093
Mr. Kang Hwirim?

530
01:04:05,999 --> 01:04:11,918
And I will not face it all alone.

531
01:04:23,116 --> 01:04:24,325
Where's Mom?

532
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:26,979
I don't know,
she left early morning.

533
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:34,999
Dad, I'm skipping breakfast.

534
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,709
- But I made it for you.
- See you later.

535
01:04:53,918 --> 01:04:55,834
What? You're here this early?

536
01:04:55,876 --> 01:04:57,918
Good morning.

537
01:04:57,959 --> 01:05:01,459
- I got the reinvestigation approved.
- Really?

538
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,709
I need a solid report
to convince the section chief.

539
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:09,250
Sir, could you please
review my report?

540
01:05:09,959 --> 01:05:12,250
- I'm not confident about it.
- Bring it here.

541
01:05:15,459 --> 01:05:17,751
Let's see... Kang Eunsoo?

542
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:21,667
She's the only one connected to James,
Hwang Donghyun, and Yang Miyeon.

543
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:47,834
- Where's my money?
- I need a little more time.

544
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:50,951
Are you screwing me over
with Kang Eunsoo?

545
01:05:53,999 --> 01:05:55,292
What's going on?

546
01:06:00,626 --> 01:06:03,542
Internal Affairs.
Is Inspector Jang Taegu here?

547
01:06:16,209 --> 01:06:17,751
You're both finished.

548
01:06:19,151 --> 01:06:24,568
I'll show you
just how far I can go.

549
01:06:36,834 --> 01:06:37,999
How are you here?

550
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:04,918
I told you, didn't I?

551
01:07:05,577 --> 01:07:07,250
I'm quick to notice things.

552
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:09,626
Guess you never took me seriously.

553
01:07:13,626 --> 01:07:16,999
I guess hitting the rock-bottom story
was of your own.

554
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:21,000
I thought you were a real cop.
I would've never imagined.

555
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:24,042
That you had another reason
to catch me.

556
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,589
Did you mess with the money?

557
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:35,667
Where's my money?

558
01:07:37,437 --> 01:07:39,186
You're asking the wrong question.

559
01:07:44,779 --> 01:07:46,237
How's that money yours?

560
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:48,882
I earned all of it.

561
01:09:36,999 --> 01:09:39,999
WALKING ON THIN ICE

562
01:09:42,584 --> 01:09:43,803
It wasn't me, really!

563
01:09:43,827 --> 01:09:45,292
I'll fix everything!

564
01:09:45,334 --> 01:09:47,088
I had a plan for both of us!

565
01:09:47,128 --> 01:09:48,169
It's too late!

566
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:53,083
A lady came to me,
saying she'd sell me everything.

567
01:09:53,245 --> 01:09:56,459
I told you
not to try so hard.

568
01:09:57,682 --> 01:09:58,766
Mom!

569
01:09:58,918 --> 01:09:59,831
Honey!

570
01:09:59,873 --> 01:10:01,873
What have you done?

571
01:10:02,455 --> 01:10:05,664
What you want is the drug, isn't it?

572
01:10:06,918 --> 01:10:08,025
Let's get rid of it.

573
01:10:08,619 --> 01:10:09,533
I'm

574
01:10:09,999 --> 01:10:10,834
Run!

575
01:10:10,876 --> 01:10:12,209
not giving up.
