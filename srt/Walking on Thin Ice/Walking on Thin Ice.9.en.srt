Drink!

10
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:07,918
Are you okay?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,167
Get out of the way!

12
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:34,959
Are you okay?

13
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:36,626
Get up.

14
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,999
Hey, stop right there.

15
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:44,959
You can't leave this place sober.
That's the rule.

16
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,959
Isn't that right?
Right?

17
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:49,834
Hey, have a drink.

18
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,999
Chug this,
and you can go home.

19
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:58,667
You can do it, come on.

20
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:05,125
Drink! Drink!

21
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,250
Wow! Seriously?

22
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:17,584
How is it? Huh?

23
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:20,083
Are you okay?

24
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:24,709
Hey.

25
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,667
Hey... Hey...

26
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,667
Hey!

27
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:50,125
You took the dead kid there,
and you supplied the drug too.

28
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:54,500
Everyone there said so.

29
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,834
Got it?
Just admit it.

30
00:04:12,382 --> 00:04:14,132
My fiancé's family called off

31
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:16,460
the engagement because
my brother is a murderer.

32
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:18,999
And TwoN said they're canceling
the joint contract

33
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:20,959
because you made
Kang Hwirim do drugs.

34
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:23,612
Our father's company is
about to go bankrupt.

35
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:25,674
Do you understand
what you've done?

36
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,893
Bro, it wasn't me. Really!

37
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:31,432
Then why did only you
and the dead kid have the drug?

38
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:35,612
You make me sick.

39
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,275
This is the last time I see you.

40
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:55,999
The 70th birthday celebration for
Twon Group's chairman Kang Gunam

41
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:58,999
was held at the TwoN Hotel
today afternoon,

42
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,999
where prominent business and
political figures made their appearance.

43
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:06,209
In particular, Kang Hwirim,
the chairman's eldest grandson,

44
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,792
returned from his studies abroad
to attend the event,

45
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:10,375
drawing high attention.

46
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:14,417
Some observers speculate
that Chairman Kang may be signaling

47
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,667
the beginning of a succession process
within the group.

48
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,959
A source at the event said
Chairman Kang

49
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,834
made no special mention of succession,

50
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:26,999
but his remarks emphasizing
family harmony stood out,

51
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:31,292
and the eldest grandson's return
seemed symbolic.

52
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,630
Meanwhile, Chairman Kang appeared
cheerful throughout the event,

53
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,125
greeting attendees personally,

54
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:40,000
and displayed a relaxed demeanor.

55
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:51,834
You haven't changed at all.

56
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:55,709
It's been six years,
and you're still saying it wasn't you?

57
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,334
I know you don't believe me.

58
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,227
I'll prove it. Just watch.

59
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:04,813
How? With your ludicrous plan?

60
00:06:05,203 --> 00:06:06,797
TwoN isn't a tiny local store.

61
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,167
Fine, let's say we bring on board
the corporate raider Austin,

62
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,667
bring in auditors, file objections,

63
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,395
and make timely purchases.

64
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:20,999
Still, for us to exercise
the shareholder proposal right,

65
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:24,918
we need at least 0.5%
of Twon Holdings shares.

66
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,876
- Do you know how much that is?
- 8 billion won.

67
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,584
Are you after
our father's company money?

68
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:45,584
If I were, I wouldn't have
come to see you.

69
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:52,077
So then what?
How will you get the money?

70
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:10,542
Don't worry.
I found a way to get it.

00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,626
What's going on?

76
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,709
Where are you?
Answer the phone.

77
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,709
It's not that important, go on.

78
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:42,751
Well, studying abroad requires a visa
and lots of admission paperwork.

79
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:45,097
It'll take some time,
but if you're in a hurry,

80
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,909
one option is to go abroad under a
language-study program and prepare there.

81
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:52,480
For that, you'll need an F1 visa.

82
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,022
Will the whole family be going together?

00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,667

He's basically my boss.

What?

92
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:17,458
He's a retailer

Are you screwing me over

00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,758
You're both finished.

97
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:33,918
I'll show you
just how far I can go.

98
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,792
Where's my money?

99
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:02,042
I told you,
it's not your money.

100
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,999
If I die, the drug disappears too.

101
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:11,500
You think there aren't other drugs?

102
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:15,225
It's the only one
that can be cashed right now.

103
00:12:15,514 --> 00:12:17,876
You're desperate for money,
aren't you?

104
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:22,374
I think we're not so different,
you know?

105
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:36,834
If I don't go downstairs in ten,
they'll call the police.

106
00:12:57,286 --> 00:12:58,494
You're a funny woman.

107
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:07,959
Did you think I'd come unprepared?

108
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:12,999
What you want is the drug, isn't it?

109
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,628
Then buy it—20 billion won.

110
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:20,042
That's a steal compared to its real value.

111
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,803
You're clueless, aren't you?

112
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:30,478
If I wanted the drug,
I would've taken it already.

113
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:33,518
You want no risk
and all the money, huh?

114
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,999
Well, not anymore.

115
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,682
Pay for what you get.

116
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:40,375
I could burn your house down.
Can you handle that?

117
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:44,091
That'd mean no more drug.
Can you handle that?

118
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:00,999
Yeah.

119
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:02,209
Sir, where are you?

120
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,083
It's a disaster,
the inspection team is here!

121
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:14,168
You'd better decide quickly
before I change my mind.

122
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,125
Are you crazy?

123
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,603
Have you forgotten?
He's the police!

124
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:43,236
He knows a thousand ways
to fuck us over for good!

125
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,502
Is that why you lied to me?

126
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,876
I had a plan for both of us!

127
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:51,751
If you had waited,
everything would've worked out!

128
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:52,999
Wait until when?

129
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:58,375
You said you'll catch the blackmailer
while I get the money.

130
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:02,435
I got fired from my job and spent
all of my husband's medical fees.

131
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:06,382
I worked sleeplessly, but couldn't even
earn my living expenses.

132
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:10,834
Everything I'm trying to protect
is falling apart.

133
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,292
And you teamed up with him
and deceived me!

134
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:19,334
You know what hurts me the most?

135
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:25,000
That you knew my situation
better than anyone.

136
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,696
Yet you betrayed me.

137
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,918
No, I didn't mean to betray you...

138
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,959
I guess I trusted you too much.

139
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:41,959
Shit. Out of all the people
in the world...

140
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:45,092
I trusted someone
who only cares for himself.

141
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:54,584
Eunsoo, let me explain.
I'll tell you what I had in mind.

142
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,751
It's too late!

143
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:27,417
December 1, 2021. Drug Task Force,
Inspector Jang Taegu.

144
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:29,959
We'll be questioning you about
Sergeant Choi Gyeongdo.

145
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:32,042
Is Inspector Jang Taegu here?

146
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,125
3 Hours Ago

147
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,792
He's not here right now.
What is it?

148
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:39,792
This is an inspection notice.
Who is Sergeant Choi Kyung-do?

149
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,626
- Yes, that's me.
- Please come with us.

152
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,292
The most recent Bitcoin transfer
by Phantom's Do Gyuman

153
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:06,999
amounts to roughly 40 million won.

154
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:12,999
As you can see, 40 million was withdrawn
from a borrowed account on Nov 29th.

155
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:18,709
And on that same day,
you withdrew cash from the bank.

156
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,999
This isn't what you think.
There's a misunderstanding...

157
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,500
You also have matching
text message records

158
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,999
with Do Gyuman's subordinate,
Hwang Donghyun.

159
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:33,709
11-MONTH PLAN, 1.6% FIXED RATE.
UP TO 40 MILLION

160
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:41,723
That's not mine.
It's not my money.

161
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:44,348
Even though it was found
on your desk?

162
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:45,465
What?

163
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:52,000
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

164
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:53,999
Phantom has another informant.

165
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:56,167
Ask Do Gyuman
about money-grubber.

166
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,999
He said they never met in person.

167
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:02,876
They did anonymous trades to avoid
cases like this, right?

168
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:06,083
I can explain everything.

169
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,125
Here's what happened...

170
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:10,710
I never did that.

171
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:13,834
How could I give
that kind of money to someone?

172
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:16,218
My housing deposit
isn't even worth 40 million.

173
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:20,584
No, he definitely gave me
10 million in cash first,

174
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:24,209
then lent me more through
another account for tax reasons.

175
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,643
Then is there anyone who saw or heard
Inspector Jang give you the money?

176
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,417
I knew he was struggling
with his loan payments,

177
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:37,599
but I never imagined
he'd take Phantom's bribe.

178
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:42,083
It's all my fault.
I should've watched over him better.

179
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:48,963
That means there's no witness
or physical evidence!

180
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:50,918
Look here.

181
00:18:51,334 --> 00:18:54,709
If you check the documents
Inspector Jang submitted,

182
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,292
he transferred the ownership
of his house

183
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:01,125
and his car to his ex-wife last year,

184
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,731
and most of his salary
goes toward child support.

185
00:19:03,786 --> 00:19:06,375
He denied everything you've said.

186
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:11,703
As of now, there's no evidence
to support your claim.

187
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,999
If what you say is true,

188
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:19,999
it means Inspector Jang
framed you on purpose.

189
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:23,792
Why would he do that
to his subordinate, huh?

190
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,601
For what reason?

191
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,792
Come on, give us an answer!

192
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,626
Should we clean it up?

193
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:02,999
IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT
KANG EUNSOO ACTED ALONE

194
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:09,578
Sergeant Choi.

195
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:12,626
Sergeant Choi?

196
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:17,125
It was him.
He was the one...

197
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,584
Bastard, where did you
hide the drug?

198
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:42,125
NAME: KIM MINWOO

199
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,451
We caught him using your drug.

200
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,250
NEXT PAYMENT DUE DATE: 11/25/2021
AMOUNT DUE: 2.3 MILLION WON

201
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:07,999
11-MONTH PLAN, 1.6% FIXED RATE.
UP TO 40 MILLION

202
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:14,167
55 Haengbok-ro 32-gil.
Green gate house, in the bedroom blanket.

203
00:22:15,312 --> 00:22:16,936
What's this, boss?

204
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,209
I don't really need big money.

205
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,999
I'll definitely pay you back.

206
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,083
Hey!

207
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,918
How could you?
Out of all people!

208
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,834
Think about your wife and child.

209
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:07,209
What did you do to my family?

210
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,886
Your accounts should be frozen by now.

211
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,542
If you want your severance,
you'd better act properly.

212
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:18,417
It's the better choice for your family.

213
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:32,388
- What are you two doing?
- Don't worry.

214
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,626
It's nothing.

215
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:37,928
I said it's fine.

216
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,145
I warned you.

217
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:06,751
I told you not to try so hard.

218
00:24:35,101 --> 00:24:38,792
Yes, counselor.
The documents will be ready tomorrow.

219
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:42,792
Of course. I'm just doing
some final corrections.

220
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:46,852
Yes, no problem.

221
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:51,584
NEWBIE

222
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,999
Hey, it's me.

223
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:02,250
If you don't make progress by today,
I'm clearing your desk. Got it?

224
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,334
Yes, sir.

225
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,139
Exams are over,
but don't stop studying.

226
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:31,053
- Maybe read a book.
- Ma'am, please...

227
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:34,999
And if you can reach
those absent today, let me know.

228
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:36,250
Yes, ma'am.

229
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:39,209
Good job on the exam.
Bye.

230
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:59,334
- Don't, stop it! Please!
- Let go!

231
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,125
Honey! Honey! Honey!

232
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:10,099
Honey! Honey!
Honey! Honey!

233
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:16,999
Why didn't you come today?

234
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,999
YOON JINHEE

235
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,542
JINHEE

236
00:26:58,334 --> 00:27:01,999
Jinhee, how long
will you skip school?

237
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:47,893
Are you okay, sir?

238
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,292
Let go!

239
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:21,626
Should I keep doing
what you asked for?

240
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,999
Yeah, but move it up a few days.

241
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,626
KANG HWIRIM

242
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,667
I could burn your house down.

243
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,417
Can you handle that?

244
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,626
It's okay, relax.

245
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:15,210
Mom, you came to pick me up?

246
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:18,240
Yeah. Well done
on finishing your exams.

247
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:26,834
You worked hard.

248
00:29:26,876 --> 00:29:29,999
- I think I did well.
- Really?

249
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:31,999
- What do you want to eat?
- Something tasty.

250
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:40,375
Eat this.

251
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:42,542
Stop playing.

252
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,999
- Apologize.
- I'm sorry.

253
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:52,709
YOU HAVE BEEN HIRED

254
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:57,250
Bro...

255
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,999
Argh, damn.

256
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:03,459
- You got it!
- For real?

257
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:04,876
Let me see.

258
00:30:04,925 --> 00:30:08,503
WE'RE PLEASED TO INFORM YOU
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN HIRED

259
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:12,432
Junhyun!

260
00:30:57,218 --> 00:30:58,552
Damn old geezer.

261
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,000
He threw an ashtray at me
for selling some stock.

262
00:31:01,823 --> 00:31:02,782
What are you talking about?

263
00:31:03,853 --> 00:31:08,269
I needed cash to buy your stuff,
so I sold some shares. Why?

264
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:13,459
- How much?
- Why? Will you buy them back for me?

265
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,682
Anyway, give me Vaka.
I'm out.

266
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,042
I don't have it on me.

267
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:33,146
Sorry, my bad.
I can't grip well these days.

268
00:31:35,202 --> 00:31:39,371
Too bad.
I'll have to call your partner.

269
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:40,583
My partner?

270
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,595
A lady came to me,
saying she'd sell me everything.

271
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:49,328
Turns out you've been
ripping me off.

272
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:53,004
I even bought your damn artwork.

273
00:31:53,114 --> 00:31:56,231
You're the one who said
money laundering via NFT was great.

274
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:58,523
Whatever, I don't give a shit.

275
00:32:00,403 --> 00:32:04,292
First one to bring me Vaka wins.
Got it?

276
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:26,999
How did Eunsoo find out about Hwirim?

277
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:29,999
I trusted someone
who only cares for himself.

278
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,542
SHOW HIDDEN APPS

279
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:41,500
LOCATION TRACKER

280
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,500
LINKED DEVICES - LEE KYUNG, KANG EUNSOO

281
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:55,568
I really underestimated this bitch.

282
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,375
BRO

283
00:33:04,865 --> 00:33:07,905
Bro, check TwoN Chairman Kang's
disclosure right now.

284
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:09,999
I think Kang Hwirim screwed up.

285
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:17,334
Why does he freak out
whenever I mention TwoN stocks?

286
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,999
You knew about
the IR presentation schedule?

287
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:22,083
You must've bought a lot.

288
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:34,751
- Listen to me.
- Yes, Director Kang.

289
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:37,042
Bring me our shareholder list.

290
00:33:57,959 --> 00:34:00,709
I did the rough grading,
and my average went up.

291
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:02,592
That's great, sweetie.

292
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:08,876
But Jinhee turned in a blank sheet.

293
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:11,584
She hasn't come to school for days.

294
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:15,626
I heard from girls living
in the same building

295
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,834
that her mom is getting fired,
and her dad is never home.

296
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,375
She's ghosting texts
and won't answer calls.

297
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:26,295
Honestly, I don't get it.

298
00:34:27,061 --> 00:34:29,646
I understand Jinhee's mom
did something bad,

299
00:34:30,292 --> 00:34:32,792
but it doesn't feel like
she's the only one at fault.

300
00:34:35,076 --> 00:34:37,933
If there's a drug user,
that means there's a seller.

301
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,059
Right, Mom?

302
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:56,417
Are you crazy?

303
00:34:56,544 --> 00:34:58,084
Can't you see the light?

304
00:34:58,691 --> 00:34:59,999
Are you blind or something?

305
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,626
Are you okay?

306
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,292
I'm sorry...

307
00:35:04,084 --> 00:35:06,193
This is all your fault!

308
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:07,999
Where's my money?

309
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:17,167
Mom?

310
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:19,315
What's wrong, Mom?

311
00:35:19,877 --> 00:35:25,542
Uh, I just... spaced out for a second.

312
00:35:26,077 --> 00:35:27,287
You've been really weird lately.

313
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:30,209
Is something going on?

314
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:36,182
Here.

315
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,209
Huh? This is...

316
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,834
It's the school you wanted to attend.

317
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,292
Your favorite painter studied there.

318
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:49,570
I can't just go because I want to.

319
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:52,584
If you could, would you?

320
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,083
Delivery job.
Wanna do it?

321
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:03,125
Mom, I forgot I had plans.
Let's talk at home.

322
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:06,999
With who? Hey, Sua!

323
00:36:07,626 --> 00:36:08,876
I'll see you later.

324
00:36:18,626 --> 00:36:20,375
I only found out today myself.

325
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:25,584
The problem is that Chairman Kang
bought twice what Hwirim sold.

326
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,999
0.07% costs at least
one billion won.

327
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:31,042
We barely stitched together 0.5%.

328
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:35,999
Even with Austin and the small holders,
we still can't top TwoN's stake.

329
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:39,983
Austin won't buy more
than what we first offered.

330
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:42,861
He says profit on price
is all he needs.

331
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:48,918
IR's around the corner.
We can't get a billion in time.

332
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:52,999
I can scrape up
100 to 200 million at most.

333
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:55,297
I even thought about pulling
Seonjoong Construction's funds.

334
00:36:56,077 --> 00:37:00,578
But if we touch that,
we'll lose our purpose.

335
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:04,792
- Listen, I'll find a way...
- Kyung.

336
00:37:07,496 --> 00:37:08,550
Let's give up.

337
00:37:08,584 --> 00:37:10,840
It was out of our league.

338
00:37:10,913 --> 00:37:14,956
You and I....
We both did all we could.

339
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:25,022
I have to go.
I need to be somewhere with Dad.

340
00:37:26,218 --> 00:37:31,125
After you left like that,
he worried a lot.

341
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:35,996
Even if you give up now,
he'll forgive you someday.

342
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:48,162
Oh, you're awake.

343
00:38:49,069 --> 00:38:51,386
Where did your guardian go?

344
00:38:52,653 --> 00:38:54,945
- Guardian?
- Your father.

345
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:58,167
He came as soon as we called.
He was out of breath.

346
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:02,584
Hey, where are you going?

347
00:39:03,729 --> 00:39:06,444
Dad! Dad! Dad!

348
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:10,526
I'm sorry!
I'll fix everything, I promise!

349
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:14,042
- Dad, I promise!
- Stay back.

350
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:15,959
Dad!

351
00:39:21,334 --> 00:39:24,834
Dad! Dad!

352
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:27,648
Dad!

353
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,083
Dad!

354
00:39:47,588 --> 00:39:48,622
No.

355
00:39:51,844 --> 00:39:52,786
I'm not giving up.

356
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,542

361
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:57,834
I'm home.

362
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:08,391
Mom?

363
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,292
Mom! Mom...

364
00:41:24,334 --> 00:41:25,167
Mom!

365
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:27,834
M-Mom, what's wrong?

366
00:41:27,876 --> 00:41:29,125
Mom!

367
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:42,224
Sir, did you hear everything I said?

368
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,042
Ah, yes.

369
00:41:45,083 --> 00:41:47,603
Please relay it to your guardian

370
00:41:47,634 --> 00:41:49,999
and come together when readmitting.

371
00:42:01,317 --> 00:42:03,591
Honey! Are you okay?

372
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:05,417
Honey!

373
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,107
Honey!

374
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,999
What's the condition?

375
00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:12,626
Unconscious from
an overdose of sleeping pills.

376
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:13,999
We'll proceed with gastric lavage.

377
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:17,834
Honey! Honey! Honey!

378
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:19,209
Honey!

379
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:20,792
Honey!

380
00:42:23,903 --> 00:42:25,695
Why are you asking these questions?

381
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:29,751
My wife has nothing to do
with Miyeon's case.

382
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:31,999
Mrs. Kang has no direct connection.

383
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:35,124
Are you implying
there's some indirect link?

384
00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:36,898
I'm curious about that myself.

385
00:42:47,045 --> 00:42:49,213
- Prep quickly.
- Yes, doctor.

386
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,999
Intubating.
Draw the curtain.

387
00:42:56,999 --> 00:42:59,792
Mom... Mom...

388
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:02,250
Will Mom be okay?

389
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:05,918
Will she die?
Is Mom going to die?

390
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:08,700
No one's going to die!

391
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:12,542
Go home and bring Mom's stuff.
Her clothes and her ID.

392
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:16,918
It's me... It's my fault...

393
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:17,918
Hurry!

394
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:53,607
She probably didn't know
she was pregnant.

395
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,597
I'm sorry.

396
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:23,000
Where are you? It's urgent.

397
00:44:23,042 --> 00:44:25,709
Is it true we're losing the house?

398
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:30,500
Honey, it hurts so much.
I'm bleeding like something's wrong.

399
00:44:34,918 --> 00:44:37,334
DONGBU CITY HOSPITAL

400
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:42,626
Patient Hwang Junhyun
has regained consciousness.

401
00:44:42,651 --> 00:44:43,983
Please come promptly.

402
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,000
You scared me!

403
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,209
STUDY ABROAD TO SHINE

404
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:17,999
You scared me more.

405
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:20,999
What brings you here?

406
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:24,417
I came to check on Dojin.
Wondering what the doctor said.

407
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:28,751
What's all this?
Are you going abroad?

408
00:45:32,805 --> 00:45:35,346
Seriously? All of a sudden?

409
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,837
For treatment?
You should've told me...

410
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:41,999
- Must I tell you everything?
- No.

411
00:45:43,194 --> 00:45:44,695
But you're my best friend.

412
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:47,786
Thanks for helping,
but this is a family matter.

413
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,042
What about the money?

414
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,883
You won't get insured in the US.
What about Sua?

415
00:45:55,883 --> 00:45:57,999
Back off.
It's my business.

416
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,191
My husband and my daughter.

417
00:46:01,073 --> 00:46:03,082
You should leave.
I'll call later.

418
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,626

INITIAL SETTLEMENT COSTS

421
00:47:28,459 --> 00:47:31,083
FINAL REQUIRED AMOUNT: 2 BILLION WON

422
00:48:05,584 --> 00:48:06,918
Where did it go?

423
00:48:08,276 --> 00:48:09,735
Where's Sua's stuff?

424
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:16,500
It's gone.

425
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:22,709
Oh, you're home.
You left the door open again.

426
00:48:22,751 --> 00:48:24,294
What did the doctor say?

427
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:25,852
What are you doing?

428
00:48:25,868 --> 00:48:31,292
Sua's passport is missing.
Didn't we renew it?

429
00:48:31,334 --> 00:48:32,999
Why do you need it?

430
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:34,665
To study abroad, of course.

431
00:48:34,688 --> 00:48:37,667
Abroad?
Is Sua going abroad?

432
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:44,375
Yeah, a great opportunity came up.

433
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:50,078
If we miss it, she can't go.
So I made a decision.

434
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,560
I don't think that's
the only decision you made.

435
00:48:58,751 --> 00:49:01,000
INVESTMENT IMMIGRATION:
ONE BILLION WON AFTER 5 YRS OF RESIDENCE

436
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:03,951
Investment immigration?
Two billion won?

437
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:06,792
Planning to leave for good?

438
00:49:07,189 --> 00:49:09,667
Is that why you told me
to get my medical records?

439
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:13,999
How will you get 2 billion?
Explain the police!

440
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,542
Why are they suspecting that
you're involved with Miyeon?

441
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:21,709
Why do we have to leave?

442
00:49:23,184 --> 00:49:24,893
What have you done?

443
00:49:30,999 --> 00:49:32,125
Uh...

444
00:49:47,876 --> 00:49:48,999
The day after tomorrow?

445
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:54,834
I wanted to take more time,
but we can't now.

446
00:49:55,250 --> 00:50:01,459
I booked a place and rental car
under your name,

447
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,000
and enrolled you and Sua
in a language school.

448
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:07,667
Be sure to attend the interview
to get the visa.

449
00:50:07,709 --> 00:50:09,961
- You can get treatment there...
- Stop!

450
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:17,410
Honey, you know
I've never been wrong.

451
00:50:17,584 --> 00:50:20,999
Can't you trust me just once more?

452
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:22,957
I'll explain everything later.

453
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:25,459
Explain now,
or I won't go anywhere.

454
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,417
No, just do as I say.

455
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:32,265
It's all for our family.

456
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:36,265
Just shut up and listen to me!

457
00:51:21,918 --> 00:51:23,918
Why wasn't I on this?

458
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:26,709
Why was I missing?

459
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:29,403
Thanks for helping,
but this is a family matter.

460
00:51:29,412 --> 00:51:31,328
My husband and my daughter.

461
00:51:47,999 --> 00:51:50,209
We're going to be rich, aren't we?

462
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,834
Of course.

463
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:55,569
And then,
I'll actually live here.

464
00:51:55,577 --> 00:51:57,959
When I do, I'll open a sauna.

465
00:51:57,999 --> 00:52:01,292
- Fine, you do that.
- Okay.

466
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,500
I want a house with 100 bathrooms.

467
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,626
100 bathrooms?

468
00:52:45,834 --> 00:52:46,999
SUA

469
00:52:53,542 --> 00:52:55,667
Why isn't she answering?

470
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:11,876
The number you have dialed
could not be reached.

471
00:53:22,584 --> 00:53:25,125
Alright, let's do the deal.

472
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:27,083
Meet now.

473
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:13,783

00:54:16,626 --> 00:54:18,125
PARTNER

475
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,918
The number you have dialed
could not be reached.

476
00:54:29,959 --> 00:54:31,999
Leave a message after the beep.

477
00:54:38,918 --> 00:54:39,542
KANG HWIRIM

478
00:54:40,999 --> 00:54:43,292

479
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:47,999
Yeah.

480
00:54:47,999 --> 00:54:50,876
Come now, and I'll buy from you.
Last chance.

481
00:55:28,545 --> 00:55:33,709
Let's trade here.

Excuse me!
Do you remember me?

486
00:56:45,677 --> 00:56:49,209
I was told Patient Hwang Junhyun
regained consciousness.

487
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,719
Where is he now?

488
00:56:50,758 --> 00:56:53,336
Ah, well...

489
00:57:08,918 --> 00:57:11,918
Thanks for helping.
I owe you a big time.

490
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:13,876
It's good money.
I had to accept the job.

491
00:57:15,584 --> 00:57:17,334
You're so clumsy.

492
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:20,984
How could you slip
on a steep road?

493
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,042
I wonder what this is.
It's not actual jelly, right?

494
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:29,125
Probably sleeping pills
or diet meds.

495
00:57:29,706 --> 00:57:31,268
As long as we get paid.

496
00:57:31,584 --> 00:57:34,561
How will you spend your cut?

497
00:57:37,069 --> 00:57:38,279
Secret.

498
00:57:56,999 --> 00:58:00,000
Good luck.
See you tomorrow.

499
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:01,747
Let's become rich and eat tteokbokki.

500
00:58:02,751 --> 00:58:04,042
- I'm off.
- Bye.

01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:04,250
I did it!

You made her that way!

I have a condition... James.

517

Run!

518
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:29,792
Maybe you and I
are not so different.

519
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:32,866
Mom, what will happen to me?

520
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,083
We can't let him drag us around forever.

521
01:06:35,498 --> 01:06:40,139
Anyone who touches
my daughter or my family...

522
01:06:41,792 --> 01:06:43,250
I will kill.
