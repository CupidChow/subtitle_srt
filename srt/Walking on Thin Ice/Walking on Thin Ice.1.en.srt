1
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,949
WALKING ON THIN ICE

2
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:44,940
DRUG USE ISN’T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

3
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:46,381
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

4
00:00:46,393 --> 00:00:48,149
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

5
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:03,950
From the beginning through to now,

6
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,909
it may all have been predestined.

7
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:31,899
Then versus now...

8
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,775
Which one's worse?

9
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,359
One thing's very clear.

10
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,818
Compared to back then,

11
00:01:54,476 --> 00:01:56,267
it's so much easier now.

12
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:54,849
EPISODE 1

13
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:57,933
It was announced that
full or partial restrictions

14
00:03:57,975 --> 00:04:00,768
will be in place
from 6 am to 11 am,

15
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:02,975
and citizens are requested to cooperate.

16
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:06,350
Darling, are you done washing?

17
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:10,184
With reports of cryptocurrency
investment fraud continuing daily,

18
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:13,184
authorities urged the public
to be cautious when investing.

19
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:15,975
Take a seat.
Let's eat.

20
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:18,559
Are you taking cooking classes?

21
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:23,059
Your Dad's been losing weight, okay?
He looks like a walking stick.

22
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,849
Will you cook the same
if I lose weight?

23
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,684
- Sure, but you never lose weight.
- Whatever.

24
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:28,849
Bon appétit.

25
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,850
You barely slept, right?

26
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:34,848
You kept tossing and turning.
Look how pale you are.

27
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:37,642
- You're worrying me.
- I'm fine.

28
00:04:37,684 --> 00:04:40,849
The bank people must think
you keep Dad up all night.

29
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,157
What? I'm fifteen.
It's a joke, okay?

30
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,059
Unbelievable.

31
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:57,017
Eat up.
We'll talk when you get taller.

32
00:04:57,059 --> 00:05:00,559
- You can have mine, beloved father.
- No chance.

33
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:02,392
This is way too much.

34
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:07,768
Bye, Mom.

35
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,559
Sua, hold on a second.

36
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:13,933
I didn't do makeup.

37
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:16,849
Schools aren't that strict anymore.

38
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,267
And there...

39
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:22,059
Alright, there we go.

40
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:26,081
All pretty now.

41
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:28,684
I love you.

42
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,142
- Yes, yes. I love you too.
- Love you.

43
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:35,849
- I have to go now.
- Okay, take care.

44
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,420
Hey, Sua!

45
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,849
- Bye bye!
- Yeah!

46
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:49,434
Oh! Hey there, sweetie!

47
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:54,849
That's for you.

48
00:05:56,476 --> 00:05:57,933
Hey, Sua!

49
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:02,892
How'd you recognize me so fast?

50
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:06,642
You're the only one
who wears a knee-length skirt.

51
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:09,849
And you're the only one
who rides a five-minute walk to school.

52
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:11,892
It's seven minutes.

53
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:17,726
Anyway, can't you shorten
that skirt by just an inch?

54
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:20,350
I'll show you the best place
to get it done.

55
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:21,392
Mom won't approve.

56
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:23,392
You're such a mama's girl.

57
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:26,517
What about you?
You always obey your mom too.

58
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:39,642
I do it because I'm scared.

59
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:41,517
But you love your mom.

60
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:44,043
Everyone loves their mom.

61
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,849
No, I don't.

62
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:48,017
How can you say that?

63
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:53,848
Hey! Why aren't you
answering the phone?

64
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:57,309
The cops are on us.
Grab the cash and get out, now!

65
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,892
The Phantoms are on us too.
We'll die if we get caught!

66
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:30,309
Wow, you're really something.

67
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,059
How can you be so accurate
without measuring the scale?

68
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,142
Is it because you were a banker?

69
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:38,849
Anyone can do it
after a month on the job.

70
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:43,267
Really? But I've been here six months...

71
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,848
Oh, by the way!

72
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:48,849
I heard your neighborhood's
getting redeveloped. Congrats.

73
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:53,267
That only concerns
real estate speculators.

74
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,392
It's got nothing to do
with people like me.

75
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:59,480
Look, I don't need billions.
My dream is to have a small place

76
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:01,358
to live with my family.

77
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:07,184
Wait, haven't you already achieved that?

78
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:09,152
You're living your dream.

79
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,210
OFF-SHAPE APPLES
15,900 WON FOR 3KG

80
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:19,017
Stupid cops!
They almost ran him over!

81
00:08:19,504 --> 00:08:20,587
Gosh, that was close.

82
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:26,601
You're done already,
even without Donghyun?

83
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:28,100
So how many kilos in total?

84
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:33,309
Well, 39 bundles at 3kg each,
so just under 120kg.

85
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,267
Amazing, you're a human calculator.

86
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,017
- And the order?
- Already done.

87
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,246
Mister, we have a delivery.
20kg of cabbage to Daepo Restaurant.

88
00:08:43,353 --> 00:08:46,060
- 20kg? Got it.
- Yes.

89
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:50,637
Oh, I put your takeaway
at the counter.

90
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:52,968
Aw, thank you!

91
00:08:54,966 --> 00:08:56,718
Hey, crackheads!

92
00:08:57,642 --> 00:08:58,892
Hurry up, quick!

93
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:01,975
Hey, stop-stop.
Put it down, put it down.

94
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,671
Stay away, bastard!

95
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:17,142
No, you don't.

96
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:30,913
Enough running already.

97
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:50,146
Stay put.

98
00:09:58,129 --> 00:09:59,630
Alright, alright, alright.

99
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:26,267
Damn, what a pain.

100
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,933
Mr. Crackhead, you have the right
to remain silent.

101
00:10:30,975 --> 00:10:32,848
You may hire a lawyer,

102
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:38,017
and anything you say
can be used against you in court.

103
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:41,087
College students?

104
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,243
Do your parents know?

105
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:47,337
That their kids wish
to become drug lords?

106
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:49,559
How dare you

107
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:53,059
show up here

108
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:55,504
to buy stolen drugs?

109
00:10:56,517 --> 00:10:57,517
Huh?

110
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:00,975
Damn, where is it?

111
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:03,392
Check outside too.

112
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,718
- Detective.
- Yeah.

113
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:10,476
From now on,
just stay in the office, okay?

114
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:11,768
You screw up every time!

115
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:14,434
If it wasn't for him,
we would've lost them all.

116
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:16,601
Forget it, alright?

117
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:21,003
You even quit med school
because blood scared you.

118
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,559
Sir, the money is right here.

119
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:29,601
- Sir.
- What?

120
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:31,559
They don't have any drugs.

121
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:34,849
Bastards, where's the drug bag?

122
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:49,892
Shit. These bastards
are driving me crazy.

123
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:52,726
Give me a break,
you Phantom bastards!

124
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:54,476
Junhyun, get closer.

125
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:56,809
Where the hell is he going?

126
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,267
- Stop the car!
- Shut your damn mouth!

127
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:01,849
You fucking traitor!
Stop right now!

128
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:03,849
Where are you going, bitch?

129
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,476
- Stop the car! Stop, you bastard!
- Screw you, damn Phantoms!

130
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:13,601
Kim Bongnam, that bastard!

131
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:38,506
Junhyun...

132
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,184
Time to fuck off.

133
00:12:57,849 --> 00:13:00,476
Argh, seriously?

134
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:10,152
No, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

135
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,476
Hey, hey! Get your ass out!

136
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:15,059
Fine, I'll give it back.
Here, here.

137
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,601
Get out!

138
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:18,267
Get the fuck out!

139
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:21,184
- Just smash it.
- Smash everything!

140
00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:26,517
Alright, alright.
Here.

141
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,225
Enough, enough, enough!

142
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,849
Shit. Put that down.
Hey, hey!

143
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,642
- Catch him!
- Stop, Bongnam!

144
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:41,350
- Stop that thief!
- The bag! Get the bag!

145
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:44,267
You're dead meat, bitch!

146
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,849
Stop right there!

147
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:51,850
Stop right there!
I said stop!

148
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:53,517
Shut the fuck up!

149
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,392
Hand over the bag!

150
00:14:14,517 --> 00:14:18,848
What's causing the recent surge
in drug crimes among people?

151
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:24,684
Today's guest is Lt. Song Jeongseon
from the Seoul Police Drug Crimes Unit,

152
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:27,118
and we'll be talking about
drug crimes among ordinary people.

153
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:31,379
Nearly 800 suspects were arrested
just last month alone.

154
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,768
It has literally spread
into our everyday surroundings.

155
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,517
What do you think is the cause?

156
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,142
Online distribution
has become more active.

157
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,350
Drugs now have much easier access.

158
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:46,601
Anyone can search online
and order drugs like food delivery...

159
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:48,267
SAERO GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL

160
00:15:31,726 --> 00:15:34,850
- Hi.
- Good afternoon.

161
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:40,017
You girls came way too early again.

162
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:43,642
And your makeup keep getting thicker.

163
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,184
Put just as much
effort into drawing, okay?

164
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:51,225
- Okay.
- Okay.

165
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:00,632
Ah, I thought I barely ate...

166
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,116
Honey, any antacids at home?

167
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:12,267
NOTICE OF FORCED SEIZURE OF MOVABLE ASSETS

168
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:15,048
What happened?

169
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:23,517
MORTGAGE LOAN

170
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:28,601
Crypto?

171
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:31,559
You even got a loan against the house?

172
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,684
How much?

173
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:36,559
Don't tell me you lost everything.

174
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:38,710
Say something!

175
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:44,199
I'm sorry.

176
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:47,892
Wha... What were you thinking?

177
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:50,933
Did I ever tell you
to earn more money?

178
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,848
Have I ever nagged you
for never being promoted?

179
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:56,100
Or for co-signing a friend's debt,

180
00:16:56,142 --> 00:16:58,933
or helping your brother buy his house!
Did I say anything?

181
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:02,681
I was okay with them
because it's in your nature to help.

182
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:06,949
All I wanted was just this...

183
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,184
To protect what we already have.
But how could you?

184
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:16,911
We're short on money
for the additional deposit as it is.

185
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:20,368
But now, our house is going up
for auction!

186
00:17:21,684 --> 00:17:23,142
Where will we live then?

187
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:25,251
What about Sua?

188
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:28,829
Are you even her father?

189
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,384
Are you really my husband?

190
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:39,614
Eunsoo, Eunsoo!

191
00:17:42,488 --> 00:17:44,905
For the first time,
I actually regret marrying you.

192
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:58,768
2014 HAPPY BANK FALL OUTING

193
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:10,017
So that's why you ran away?

194
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:16,587
Today, I just couldn't bear
to even look at him.

195
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,797
You'll let me sleep over, right?

196
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:25,849
Of course, I will.

197
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:31,017
Don't you dare go back
in a few hours to make breakfast.

198
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:34,726
Gosh, what am I gonna do?

199
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:39,267
I have no idea...

200
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:48,017
I'll look into employee loans tomorrow.

201
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:52,017
You'll be able to get twenty million won.

202
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:53,350
Thanks.

203
00:18:53,392 --> 00:18:55,517
Why did your husband do that?

204
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,984
He's not the type to invest recklessly.

205
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:01,267
I really don't get it.

206
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:37,623
Honey?

207
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,279
Sua?

208
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,642
Where did they go off to?

209
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:57,059
Mom, what's wrong?

210
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,100
Dad!

211
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,768
- Honey!
- What should we do?

212
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:06,892
Honey!

213
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:19,267
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma?

214
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:22,848
The tumor has invaded the vessels
around the pancreas.

215
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:25,093
Unfortunately,
surgery won't be possible.

216
00:20:25,202 --> 00:20:26,849
Things might have been better

217
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,184
if he started chemo
when he was diagnosed last May.

218
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,684
- But at this point...
- Last May?

219
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:35,726
Are you saying my husband knew?

220
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:40,120
Well, pancreatic cancer treatment
is expensive and risky.

221
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:44,309
There are many patients
who delay or don't tell their families.

222
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:49,017
Has he recently lost a lot of weight,
looked yellow in the face,

223
00:20:49,225 --> 00:20:51,933
or collapsed from
stomach pain like today?

224
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:02,850
If it spreads to his liver or brain,
there's virtually no hope.

225
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:08,601
He must be admitted right away
and get treated.

226
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:20,768
Eunsoo, I checked
the company loan status.

227
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:22,848
Your husband already took his at max.

228
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,933
He took it last summer,
didn't you know?

229
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:30,975
Hello? Eunsoo?

230
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:29,726
Oh my God...

231
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:35,517
Why would you make breakfast
in that condition?

232
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:42,559
You're driving me crazy here.
Dear Lord...

233
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:44,849
Gosh...

234
00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:57,684
I have to clean this up too?

235
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,726
PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA

236
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:09,849
PANCREATIC CANCER,
THE SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE CANCER

237
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:14,885
THE AVERAGE TREATMENT COST FOR
PANCREATIC CANCER IS ABOUT 62 MILLION WON

238
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:18,198
MUCH OF IT ISN’T COVERED
BY NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE

239
00:23:27,726 --> 00:23:31,849
Abdominal CT, MRI, PET-CT,
endoscopic ultrasound...

240
00:23:32,392 --> 00:23:34,292
Metal stent procedure,
and hemostatic

241
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:36,517
injections... That
totals to 1,031,500 won.

242
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:41,642
There's a discount for
severe cancer patients, right?

243
00:23:41,684 --> 00:23:42,849
It's already been applied.

244
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:53,892
- Paying in installments?
- Yes, six months.

245
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:06,251
I can give you your pay
in advance, don't worry.

246
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:08,809
- Thank you
- Hang in there.

247
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:11,809
I heard about Dojin,
but my situation's tight too.

248
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:17,059
I know it's a lot to ask,
but is there no way?

249
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,476
Sorry, I have a meeting to attend.

250
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:33,642
He has to start
chemotherapy right away.

251
00:24:34,392 --> 00:24:38,225
If you could help out
your brother a little,

252
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:42,017
it would mean a lot.
Just a little help...

253
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:44,892
Stay strong, Eunsoo.
I'll find a way...

254
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,551
Yes, stay strong.

255
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:04,848
Seriously?

256
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:06,100
Only a million won?

257
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:07,849
Wow...

258
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:11,559
His brother is about to die, and his
niece is about to become homeless!

259
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:15,142
They even took
the entire family inheritance.

260
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:19,059
You also gave them tens of millions of won
for their real estate purchase!

261
00:25:19,257 --> 00:25:21,849
How can they be so shameless?

262
00:25:27,517 --> 00:25:32,476
Hey! What about his school friends?
Don't they owe him a lot?

263
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:36,849
Same story.

264
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:43,476
Wow... Those shameless bastards!

265
00:25:43,517 --> 00:25:45,809
Hey, calm down.

266
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:49,017
I'm just so upset.
That's why!

267
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:54,309
He started small and was doing well.
So he got a loan to invest more.

268
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:58,439
To leave behind some money
in case he died.

269
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,309
That's not an excuse.

270
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,849
I just need 200 million.

271
00:26:03,787 --> 00:26:07,392
No more, no less.
Just 200 mil.

272
00:26:16,684 --> 00:26:19,954
I wish a bag of cash
fell from the sky.

273
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:26,075
What's this?

274
00:26:27,768 --> 00:26:31,350
Sorry, it's only a million won.

275
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:50,809
Your million is different
from my brother-in-law's...

276
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:53,434
I wanted to give you more.

277
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:56,199
But my brother's gym
went bankrupt, remember?

278
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,304
So you've been covering
his living expenses?

279
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:03,768
Yeah, I hate blood ties.

280
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:07,772
But he got a job recently though.
I was surprised.

281
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:11,100
But he's still a trash.

282
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:14,823
He wants me to work
part-time in a kitchen.

283
00:27:15,143 --> 00:27:16,726
And give him the money.

284
00:27:17,017 --> 00:27:18,100
Hey...

285
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,686
Do they give salaries in advance?

286
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,225
It's a club.
You're a mother, remember?

287
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,892
Come on, I can do anything
for my family.

288
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:51,267
The auction will proceed within two weeks.

289
00:27:51,732 --> 00:27:54,849
We'll inform you of
the exact date and time later.

290
00:28:02,267 --> 00:28:04,267
- Eat before you go.
- I don't want breakfast.

291
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:06,267
Sua!

292
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,726
Sua!

293
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,559
Delivery!

294
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:03,738
Who is it?

295
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:07,074
Oh, you answered.
I was about to leave this and go.

296
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:10,975
Great, it's best to eat
while it's still hot.

297
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:13,995
- Leave.
- Yup, have a good one.

298
00:29:38,601 --> 00:29:41,849
Sorry, I forgot the pickled radish.

299
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,309
Fucking bastard.

300
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:51,184
You annoying shit...

301
00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:00,849
Hey, Bongnam. Your phone's off, and
you don't use credit cards. But for what?

302
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:04,849
You used a delivery app to order, dumbass.

303
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,225
Oh, you guys are cops!

304
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:19,601
Wait, hold on a sec.

305
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:22,267
Don't come near me!
Stay away!

306
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:23,813
Stay away!

307
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:33,225
Ah, that tickles.
That tickles!

308
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:35,559
Eat this!

309
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,642
Wow, it's so damn high!

310
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,850
Hey, do you know who I am?

311
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:50,848
I'm Superman!

312
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,142
What a pain in the ass.

313
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:57,392
Ah, my leg's broken.

314
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:00,642
Bye, now.

315
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:02,726
Hey, Kim Bongnam!

316
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:04,849
Getting comfortable?

317
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,059
Gotcha!

318
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:19,975
Crazy bitch.

319
00:31:24,642 --> 00:31:25,849
Stop!

320
00:31:27,975 --> 00:31:30,017
Get him already!

321
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:37,559
DESIGNATED REDEVELOPMENT ZONE

322
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:46,059
My husband is Park Dojin.
He should have cancer insurance.

323
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:51,063
I'm sorry,
but he terminated it last fall

324
00:31:51,146 --> 00:31:53,146
and already took the refund.

325
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:57,282
No, that can't be.

326
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:02,726
Never mind, I must've forgotten.

327
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:09,517
What about my life insurance?

328
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:13,875
Yes...

329
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:18,185
Would you like to cancel it?

330
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,184
Oh, no.

331
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:25,849
How much is the payout
upon death again?

332
00:32:32,137 --> 00:32:33,585
It shows as 100 million won.

333
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:36,898
100 million...

334
00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:45,434
Ma'am? Ma'am?

335
00:32:45,892 --> 00:32:53,601
Oh, sorry about that.
I'll call you back, thanks.

336
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:59,142
Ouch...

337
00:33:01,517 --> 00:33:02,849
Argh...

338
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:04,849
Ah, that hurts...

339
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,350
Is anyone there?

340
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:22,183
Anyone home?

341
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,142
What is this about?

342
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:40,849
JANG TAEGU

343
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,849
Police, we need your cooperation.

344
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:07,476
- Not up there?
- We got nothing.

345
00:34:08,684 --> 00:34:09,768
Did you search properly?

346
00:34:11,142 --> 00:34:13,975
- Any signs?
- No, nothing.

347
00:34:17,476 --> 00:34:19,850
Split up and search.

348
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:21,933
You two go up there.
You're with me.

349
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:28,434
What was the house address again?

350
00:34:28,476 --> 00:34:30,850
33-gil? 34-gil?

351
00:34:30,892 --> 00:34:33,651
Bongnam, get your head straight!

352
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:35,849
What's wrong?

353
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:40,717
That man sure walks
like someone I know.

354
00:34:40,803 --> 00:34:44,975
32-gil 55.32-gil 55.
32-gil 55.

355
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,267
32-gil 55, 32-gil 55...

356
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:49,642
Bongnam!

357
00:35:13,469 --> 00:35:16,309
I'm sure there's
a bigger bag somewhere...

358
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,630
Jump!

359
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:40,049
Eat this, you damn cop.

360
00:35:52,768 --> 00:35:54,849
Bring it.
I'll smash your head open.

361
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:08,059
There you are.

362
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,017
Stop following me already.

363
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:19,323
Strike!

364
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,476
Little rat.

365
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,765
Bongnam, let's go home.

366
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:32,059
Don't move!
This is a real gun! Stay away!

367
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:34,933
- Calm down, man.
- Stay away!

368
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:36,476
Catch me if you can.

369
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:37,849
- Quit it.
- I'm Superman!

370
00:36:42,017 --> 00:36:43,017
Hey, hey!

371
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:04,879
Is he... dead?

372
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,849
Sir... Sir?

373
00:37:09,684 --> 00:37:11,284
- No drugs...
- You shouldn't touch him.

374
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:13,849
Where are the drugs, you bastard!

375
00:37:31,975 --> 00:37:33,392
Huh?

376
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:36,309
Where did this come from?

377
00:38:01,184 --> 00:38:05,809
Around 5:30 pm today in the redevelopment
zone at Haengbok-dong, Gwangnam...

378
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:09,184
By the way, this golf bag.
Is it yours?

379
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:12,059
It was full of strange things.

380
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,848
Kim was a member of
the Phantom drug trafficking gang.

381
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:17,892
Police said Phantom recently smuggled
10kg of meth from Southeast Asia...

382
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:21,601
- It's not mine.
- Really? It's not Sua's either.

383
00:38:21,642 --> 00:38:23,100
Then where did it come from?

384
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:26,392
Police succeeded in recovering the body.

385
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:29,434
- But they failed to obtain the meth...
- Huh? Wait.

386
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,059
- which he had fled with.
- Why?

387
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:36,392
Police are backtracking Kim's
escape route for the meth bag.

388
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:42,111
This crystallized drug resembles ice,
and thus is called 'Ice' or 'Crystal'.

389
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:44,849
It was recently
smuggled in from Vietnam.

390
00:38:45,476 --> 00:38:47,892
Based in clubs around Gwangnam,

391
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:51,476
the Phantom drug gang
has recently grown rapidly.

392
00:38:51,517 --> 00:38:55,684
Unlike the gangs of the past, they
operated virtually and in small cells.

393
00:38:55,726 --> 00:39:00,142
Their true identity is hidden,
hence the name Phantom.

394
00:39:00,184 --> 00:39:02,849
- It looks like a candy.
- The cautiously operating gang

395
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:07,559
recently left behind a trail
due to their gang member, Kim Bongnam.

396
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:13,267
The police got intel about
10kg of meth being smuggled in,

397
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,849
and surveilled Kim.

398
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:21,434
The 10kg of meth had come in
from Vietnam a week ago.

399
00:39:21,476 --> 00:39:25,601
A taxi driver reported on Kim
for acting weird in the back seat

400
00:39:25,642 --> 00:39:29,850
and being suspicious
while carrying a heavy bag.

401
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:35,848
Kim used the subway and the bus
from Seoul to Incheon...

402
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:37,309
I don't feel anything.

403
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:43,476
Don't overthink it.
There's no drug in this neighborhood.

404
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:47,434
Police traced back
the delivery app Kim used

405
00:39:47,476 --> 00:39:50,142
and raided the motel where Kim was hiding.

406
00:39:50,184 --> 00:39:54,562
After recklessly jumping off
a building in an attempt to escape,

407
00:39:54,663 --> 00:39:56,955
Kim eventually ended up dead.

408
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,397
- Kim betrayed the gang...
- It looks the same!

409
00:39:59,436 --> 00:40:03,892
and tried to steal the drugs
with his acquaintances.

410
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:09,225
Holy! Are these actually real?

411
00:40:10,768 --> 00:40:12,933
But how did it end up here?

412
00:40:15,184 --> 00:40:18,184
Wait a second...
Who brought it here?

413
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:40,559
Hold on, think.

414
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:44,684
while stealing drugs and running away.

415
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:50,392
We can see how deeply
drugs have infiltrated our daily lives.

416
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:53,293
Trades by tossing
happen in residential areas.

417
00:40:53,332 --> 00:40:55,012
Calm down.

418
00:40:55,035 --> 00:41:01,225
The ones doing the tossing are
students, housewives,

419
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:05,142
and ordinary people
who'll avoid suspicion.

420
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:10,217
Meanwhile, the Phantom
drug trafficking gang...

421
00:41:10,264 --> 00:41:14,768
- has earned over 200 million won a month.
- 911, what's your emergency?

422
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:16,849
Hello?

423
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,309
Can you hear me? Hello?

424
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,184
200 million?

425
00:41:24,474 --> 00:41:26,098
200 million every month?

426
00:41:31,434 --> 00:41:32,768
With this?

427
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:38,768
Kang Eunsoo?

428
00:41:42,392 --> 00:41:43,768
Kang Eunsoo?

429
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,543
Ah, yes.

430
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:49,850
You're here through Manager Baek?
To work in the kitchen?

431
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,517
- Yes.
- Damn.

432
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:55,849
You're unlucky.
We already hired someone.

433
00:41:57,065 --> 00:42:00,435
Are you okay with other work
besides kitchen duty?

434
00:42:02,005 --> 00:42:03,601
Yes, of course.

435
00:42:12,642 --> 00:42:16,433
You'll see nasty things in club toilets.
Try to ignore.

436
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:35,184
The Phantom drug trafficking gang has
earned over 200 million won a month.

437
00:42:45,235 --> 00:42:47,902
Have you all been
on vacation or something?

438
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:51,421
- No, sir.
- Were you lazing off?

439
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:54,004
No, sir.

440
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:56,654
How could you not find the bag
with so many people?

441
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:01,059
It's messy as it is
with the suspect dead.

442
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,642
If you don't find those drugs,
I'll get screwed.

443
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:07,849
And that means all of you
will get screwed too.

444
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:41,950
Hey, you're all gonna get
ass-cramps.

445
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:47,184
Go door to door,
stake out in clubs, or do whatever.

446
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:51,684
Don't sit there like idiots.
You hear me?

447
00:43:55,318 --> 00:43:56,318
Everyone, outside.

448
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:08,392
GWANGNAM POLICE STATION

449
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:29,601
ART TEACHER

450
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:33,392
Sua's mom speaking.

451
00:44:33,724 --> 00:44:35,849
Sua hasn't been coming to class?

452
00:44:37,267 --> 00:44:41,849
For a whole week?
That can't be...

453
00:44:42,434 --> 00:44:46,492
My daughter loves art class,
more than anything else.

454
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,434
Yes, I'm aware of that.

455
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:54,768
I can tell apart between those
who love art and those who're forced.

456
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:56,996
But why...

457
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:06,338
Is there something you know?

458
00:45:08,822 --> 00:45:14,100
Well, I could be wrong...

459
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:23,559
SCHOOL WITHDRAWAL FORM

460
00:45:34,517 --> 00:45:35,559
Are you okay?

461
00:45:36,642 --> 00:45:37,642
Did you get burnt?

462
00:45:37,684 --> 00:45:42,390
Sorry, I have to go.
Thank you for calling me.

463
00:45:49,549 --> 00:45:50,809
Quitting school?

464
00:45:51,479 --> 00:45:54,971
You can't just quit school
out of nowhere, okay?

465
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:59,068
If I go absent for three months,
I can file a withdrawal.

466
00:45:59,146 --> 00:46:02,428
What are you saying?
It's already difficult as it is!

467
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:06,142
Exactly! Dad collapsed,
and we're about to get kicked out.

468
00:46:06,326 --> 00:46:08,369
How can I keep painting
and go to school?

469
00:46:09,384 --> 00:46:10,478
It's impossible.

470
00:46:12,384 --> 00:46:17,470
Sua, it's not as bad as you think.

471
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,601
Mom will take care of it.

472
00:46:20,216 --> 00:46:24,294
You're only fifteen. If you drop out now,
what will you become later?

473
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:26,310
Yes, I'm fifteen.

474
00:46:27,575 --> 00:46:29,850
Why do you keep
treating me like I'm five?

475
00:46:29,892 --> 00:46:33,165
The situation's not that bad?
You'll take care of it?

476
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,136
Liar...

477
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:39,849
I can see and hear.
Did you think I wouldn't know?

478
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:45,184
You've been borrowing money everywhere
and even sold your wedding ring!

479
00:46:46,979 --> 00:46:48,855
I'm not acting impulsively.

480
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:50,684
I thought a lot about this.

481
00:46:51,121 --> 00:46:56,184
For now, I'll work part-time
and help pay for Dad's treatment.

482
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:58,642
I can take the GED for school.

483
00:46:59,577 --> 00:47:00,743
As for painting...

484
00:47:02,296 --> 00:47:03,684
I don't need it anymore.

485
00:47:04,768 --> 00:47:06,309
It's not like I'll die without it.

486
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:11,059
But Dad will die.

487
00:47:14,178 --> 00:47:15,892
Dad will die without money.

488
00:47:46,837 --> 00:47:47,837
Is that weed?

489
00:47:50,392 --> 00:47:52,849
Wow, it has no scent.

490
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,908
It's like a cigarette.
Where'd you get it?

491
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:57,100
James.

492
00:47:57,311 --> 00:48:00,201
Oh, the new dealer you found?

493
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:02,849
How is he?
Is he good-looking?

494
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:08,250
He's coming later.
Wanna see him?

495
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:09,881
Yeah.

496
00:48:15,348 --> 00:48:16,682
More than enough.

497
00:48:18,601 --> 00:48:21,225
Let's see how cute this James is.

498
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,100
I saw the news.
What happened?

499
00:49:10,392 --> 00:49:12,934
Something came up.

500
00:49:13,476 --> 00:49:15,642
I can't go into detail.

501
00:49:16,684 --> 00:49:19,892
I need more time
to get your stuff.

502
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:23,933
You already took my money
for the new drugs. What the fuck?

503
00:49:24,726 --> 00:49:27,142
I can't believe I even listened to you.

504
00:49:27,362 --> 00:49:29,309
Enough. Let me speak to your boss.

505
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:33,892
Listen, I'll call you back
as soon as I get it.

506
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,639
Hey! Hey!

507
00:49:49,434 --> 00:49:50,517
BOSS

508
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,892
Yes, boss.

509
00:49:56,933 --> 00:50:00,726
Damn idiots!
How could they fuck up now?

510
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:03,684
We're almost out of stock...

511
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,089
James!

512
00:50:06,476 --> 00:50:07,849
There you are.

513
00:50:09,103 --> 00:50:10,392
Got anything on you?

514
00:50:18,017 --> 00:50:19,809
I know you don't take checks.

515
00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:21,319
It's an advanced payment
for this weekend.

516
00:50:21,483 --> 00:50:23,483
You know who's coming, right?

517
00:50:23,514 --> 00:50:25,692
This amount won't cut it.

518
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:27,271
They're used to bigger stuff.

519
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:29,177
Don't worry.
I'm always ready.

520
00:50:29,224 --> 00:50:31,641
Great, come on.
I'll introduce you to Sujin.

521
00:50:31,727 --> 00:50:33,673
- The daughter of W Entertainment.
- Sure.

522
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:48,849
James?

523
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:51,349
He only deals with VIPs.
Why?

524
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:57,152
- Oh, he left something behind.
- Okay, wait.

525
00:50:59,295 --> 00:51:00,919
Look, he's over there.

526
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:03,613
Over there, with glasses.

527
00:51:04,267 --> 00:51:06,850
Next to the rabbit.

528
00:51:06,892 --> 00:51:09,849
- That's James, right?
- Him?

529
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:13,517
Yeah, I think that's James.

530
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:48,651
We gave him
painkillers, so he'll be fine.

531
00:51:49,108 --> 00:51:49,795
Okay.

532
00:51:54,726 --> 00:51:58,309
- How are you feeling?
- It hurts.

533
00:52:33,512 --> 00:52:34,701
Honey, I'm here...

534
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,849
HAPPINESS HOSPITAL

535
00:53:44,676 --> 00:53:45,676
Honey.

536
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:48,975
Why are you here?

537
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,559
Hey, I just felt suffocated.

538
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,918
Needed some air.

539
00:53:56,254 --> 00:54:01,270
But you can't be up there.
Everyone got startled.

540
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:05,425
If you're feeling stuffy,
should we go for a walk?

541
00:54:05,606 --> 00:54:07,439
Let's go eat out.

542
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:11,644
- Will that be okay, Doctor?
- Yes, of course. Anytime.

543
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:16,767
We can call Sua too.
And have a family dinner.

544
00:54:17,025 --> 00:54:17,955
You know...

545
00:54:20,177 --> 00:54:21,469
I regret it too.

546
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:23,849
What?

547
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,489
I regret marrying you.

548
00:54:27,193 --> 00:54:28,771
If it hadn't been me,

549
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:33,059
you could've lived more comfortably.

550
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:35,768
You could've been happier.

551
00:54:37,071 --> 00:54:41,267
I thought I could
make you and Sua...

552
00:54:42,469 --> 00:54:45,684
live a really happy life.

553
00:54:51,013 --> 00:54:52,013
Honey.

554
00:54:53,175 --> 00:54:54,800
I never thought...

555
00:54:56,476 --> 00:54:58,267
I'd end up like this.

556
00:55:00,485 --> 00:55:03,104
I took everything away from you both.

557
00:55:04,626 --> 00:55:06,626
No, that's not true.

558
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:10,873
Stop, don't talk like that.
It's not true.

559
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:11,974
Eunsoo.

560
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:17,576
I'm sorry.

561
00:55:41,802 --> 00:55:43,881
HAPPINESS HOSPITAL FUNERAL HALL

562
00:55:55,642 --> 00:55:57,601
Uh, ma'am...

563
00:55:58,849 --> 00:56:01,090
We understand you're shocked.

564
00:56:01,598 --> 00:56:03,785
There's nothing I can say
to comfort you.

565
00:56:03,887 --> 00:56:07,476
But we need to know
how you'd like to proceed.

566
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:10,849
No...

567
00:56:12,225 --> 00:56:15,726
My husband is gone...

568
00:56:19,766 --> 00:56:21,473
What should I do?

569
00:56:24,052 --> 00:56:25,262
I need to go home.

570
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:27,833
Excuse me?

571
00:56:28,642 --> 00:56:29,849
Ma'am?

572
00:56:31,394 --> 00:56:32,489
Ma'am!

573
00:57:13,052 --> 00:57:14,261
No!

574
00:57:35,684 --> 00:57:36,684
Lift him up!

575
00:57:50,705 --> 00:57:52,454
We're not losing the house.

576
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:55,849
And you're not dying.

577
00:57:56,142 --> 00:57:57,809
I'll protect everything.

578
00:57:57,981 --> 00:58:00,191
So just stay by my side.

579
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,142
Just stay alive.

580
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:04,225
If you die...

581
00:58:04,768 --> 00:58:06,267
Me and Sua will...

582
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:09,187
We'll lose everything.

583
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:06,850
Sua.

584
00:59:13,036 --> 00:59:15,454
Don't skip school.

585
00:59:15,817 --> 00:59:17,569
You don't have to give up
painting either.

586
00:59:17,766 --> 00:59:20,720
I have a plan.
I'll only take a few days.

587
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,566
I'm your mother.

588
00:59:30,311 --> 00:59:33,061
Mothers can do anything.

589
00:59:33,684 --> 00:59:34,849
Trust me, okay?

590
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:55,392
400,000 WON PER 0.5G. HOW MUCH?

591
00:59:55,434 --> 00:59:56,434
100.

592
01:00:21,356 --> 01:00:22,606
James?

593
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:34,942
What business does a cleaner
have with me?

594
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:39,957
I can't wait forever.
Your time's up.

595
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:42,434
Wait, hang on.

596
01:00:53,849 --> 01:00:56,426
When is James coming, anyway?

597
01:00:57,668 --> 01:01:00,809
He shows up when he wants,
sells, and leaves.

598
01:01:00,941 --> 01:01:04,730
None of his customers know
about him apart from his name.

599
01:01:04,777 --> 01:01:07,472
Really? What does he have to hide?

600
01:01:08,726 --> 01:01:09,892
300 million?

601
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,225
In Gwangnam, everyone knows everyone.

602
01:01:13,355 --> 01:01:15,925
Then suddenly,
he appeared out of nowhere.

603
01:01:15,949 --> 01:01:18,300
Sounds fishy.
Can we trust him?

604
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:21,809
Everyone was skeptical at first.

605
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:28,019
He'll get you weed, ketamine, meth...
Whatever you want.

606
01:01:28,043 --> 01:01:28,849
Hold on a sec.

607
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:32,332
Plus, he plans his transactions perfectly,
and has good manners.

608
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,849
I was wondering
what you were up to.

609
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:39,309
Lady, did you go around eavesdropping?

610
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:44,517
Gwangnam is different from Hongdae
or Itaewon. If you're rich and stylish,

611
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:45,849
they don't care about your age.

612
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:50,225
Many people are into older prostitutes.
Like guys in their fifties.

613
01:01:51,392 --> 01:01:52,320
What?

614
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:56,081
There are easier ways to earn money.
Why be a cleaner, right?

615
01:02:04,768 --> 01:02:06,849
What... are you doing?

616
01:02:07,476 --> 01:02:08,849
Aren't you going to show me?

617
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:14,564
I need to check you out
before I connect you.

618
01:02:15,555 --> 01:02:17,097
Are you crazy?

619
01:02:18,517 --> 01:02:21,350
Lady, stop pretending!

620
01:02:21,563 --> 01:02:24,355
Nothing's free in this world, right?

621
01:02:26,975 --> 01:02:28,642
No, I'm serious!

622
01:02:30,602 --> 01:02:32,184
You fucking whore.

623
01:02:32,225 --> 01:02:33,642
Come here!

624
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,242
Can we do the transaction tomorrow?

625
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:39,975
No, security has tightened cuz of Phantom.
No shipments until next week.

626
01:02:43,849 --> 01:02:45,017
Crazy bitch!

627
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:55,601
Damn, do you have
a death wish or what?

628
01:02:55,849 --> 01:02:58,975
Bitch, how dare you slap me?

629
01:03:00,642 --> 01:03:01,849
Get up.

630
01:03:05,142 --> 01:03:06,642
You piss me off.

631
01:03:06,684 --> 01:03:07,849
Get up.

632
01:03:08,809 --> 01:03:10,809
What a fucked up day.

633
01:03:11,073 --> 01:03:12,975
Bitch, you need more beating.

634
01:03:22,262 --> 01:03:24,387
- Wha..?
- What are you doing?

635
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:29,111
I was just...

636
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,579
Payback?

637
01:03:36,186 --> 01:03:37,228
No, no.

638
01:03:45,248 --> 01:03:47,332
She hit me first.

639
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:51,100
How about we let a third party decide?

640
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:53,849
Like the cops, for example.

641
01:03:54,601 --> 01:03:56,726
Chill, why go that far?

642
01:03:56,768 --> 01:03:59,849
Exactly.
Why go that far, right?

643
01:04:00,941 --> 01:04:03,434
I told you not to cause trouble.

644
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:09,059
You're banned from coming up here.

645
01:04:09,642 --> 01:04:11,059
Hand over the card key
and fuck off.

646
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:13,975
Who do you think you are?

647
01:04:22,013 --> 01:04:23,348
Wanna find out?

648
01:04:50,332 --> 01:04:51,499
What is this?

649
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:57,642
Yours?

650
01:05:03,768 --> 01:05:05,225
Is it gold or what?

651
01:05:05,726 --> 01:05:08,535
You can report his ass
for assault if you want.

652
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:11,726
No, I won't do that.

653
01:05:19,431 --> 01:05:20,848
If you change your mind...

654
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:24,091
Uh, wait.

655
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:30,515
Thank... you.

656
01:05:43,434 --> 01:05:47,809
There are countless dealers,
but there's no one safer than him.

657
01:05:53,054 --> 01:05:56,185
Nor anyone who draws more curiosity.

658
01:06:06,532 --> 01:06:07,989
James!

659
01:06:15,692 --> 01:06:17,150
Are you down or not?

660
01:06:21,849 --> 01:06:24,476
I need it tomorrow.
At least 15g up front.

661
01:07:15,193 --> 01:07:16,277
Who are you, huh?

662
01:07:22,696 --> 01:07:24,849
Wait. The cleaning lady?

663
01:07:25,683 --> 01:07:26,973
What the hell?

664
01:07:29,118 --> 01:07:30,368
Why are you following me?

665
01:07:30,535 --> 01:07:32,743
Hey, are you listening?

666
01:07:37,481 --> 01:07:40,549
It's me.
Don't you recognize me?

667
01:07:46,059 --> 01:07:48,115
Sua's mother?

668
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,662
No way.
What are you doing here?

669
01:07:51,678 --> 01:07:52,678
James.

670
01:07:58,309 --> 01:08:00,849
You're James, aren't you?

671
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:09,661
No, let me explain.

672
01:08:09,849 --> 01:08:12,848
A guy I know needed
some help at the club.

673
01:08:12,849 --> 01:08:13,849
Count me in.

674
01:08:14,592 --> 01:08:16,051
- What?
- Let's work together.

675
01:08:24,983 --> 01:08:27,982
Let's be partners.
You and me.

676
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:25,642
WALKING ON THIN ICE

677
01:09:26,283 --> 01:09:28,673
The profit will be split
7:3 in favor of James.

678
01:09:28,849 --> 01:09:29,970
Are you kidding me?

679
01:09:30,142 --> 01:09:32,447
I look forward to seeing
how valuable you become.

680
01:09:32,618 --> 01:09:34,085
I can sell it in no time.

681
01:09:34,085 --> 01:09:35,353
I'm curious.

682
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,108
Hey, where did you lose
the drug bag again?

683
01:09:38,142 --> 01:09:40,335
It's identical to the one
from Kim Bongnam's motel room.

684
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:41,309
James!

685
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:43,759
You think I don't know
they had a drug party here?

686
01:09:43,814 --> 01:09:45,392
You look damn familiar.

687
01:09:45,434 --> 01:09:48,849
Have you forgotten that I caught you?

688
01:09:49,369 --> 01:09:51,345
Then should I tell Sua too?

689
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:52,848
Fucking bastard...

690
01:09:52,849 --> 01:09:54,849
Did you expect
a drug dealer to be nice?
