00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:39,999
WALKING ON THIN ICE

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
DRUG USE ISN’T JUST A MERE
DEVIATION BUT A SERIOUS CRIME

3
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:45,348
A SINGLE WRONG
CHOICE CAN DESTROY

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,999
AN INDIVIDUAL, A FAMILY,
AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,250
PART-TIME JOB PLATFORM

6
00:00:58,334 --> 00:00:59,999
[FOR HIRE] FOOD DELIVERY

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,626
VIETNAMESE NOODLES “AHN EM”

8
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:05,036
Isn't it unfair?

9
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:08,999
We work like dogs our whole life
and still can't buy a house.

10
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:13,542
This society doesn't give us chances,

11
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:14,403
it only takes from us.

12
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:16,793
But why must we?

13
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,203
Live a good life?

14
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:40,292
This is just a part-time
delivery job.

15
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:43,706
What you get here is a compensation.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,375
A compensation...
for your precious lives.

17
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:26,751
You finally did it.

18
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:28,417
Congratulations.

19
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:32,417
Thank you. I paid off
my student loans

20
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,999
all thanks to you.

21
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,250
Thank you, boss!

22
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,375
I didn't do much.
You grinded well.

23
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:39,999
See that, everyone?
You can be like Jongwoo too.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,542
Use this place as a stepping stone
to get your full-time jobs!

25
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,167
- Got it?
- Yes, boss!

26
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:49,959
He looks intimidating,
but he's not that scary.

27
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:51,584
He's not violent, right?

28
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,450
No, nothing like that.
Don't worry.

29
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:03,918
Let's go.

30
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,876
Jongwoo!

31
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:09,250
Ready for your first day
at the job?

32
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:12,167
Jongwoo!

33
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:14,164
Jongwoo.

34
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,999
Boss, this is my younger brother.

35
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:40,459
Junhyun, say hello.

36
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,999
- Junhyun?
- Yes.

37
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,410
Welcome. Welcome.

38
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,959
EPISODE 7

39
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,569
A group smuggling in
and distributing drugs

40
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:14,709
from Southeast Asia
has been arrested.

41
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,459
They operated by luring in
young job seekers into selling drugs,

42
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,999
then murdered them later
to keep confidentiality.

43
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:22,542
Reporter Lee has the story.

44
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:24,718
The drug gang known as 'Phantom"

45
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:29,459
hid meth and other drugs in food,
repackaged them,

46
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,671
then distributed them
to Korea and Japan.

47
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:36,468
The police found drugs and cash
worth tens of billions of won

48
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,905
as well as the cell
phone of the recent

49
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:41,542
hit-and-run victim at
the gang's restaurant.

50
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:44,621
Based on the drug fingerprint analysis
of the substance detected

51
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:48,626
in the hit-and-run victim's body,
a connection to Phantom was uncovered.

52
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:52,876
The organization is believed
to have concealed its tracks

53
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,048
by luring job seekers
into drug trafficking

54
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,667
and then killing them afterward.

55
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:58,960
The investigation also
revealed that the drug

56
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:01,334
smuggling, distribution,
and hit-and-run cases,

57
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,709
along with a total of four related deaths,

58
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:05,626
are all the work of Phantom.

59
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:09,827
Five Vietnamese gang members
present at the scene were also detained,

60
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:13,233
and will be handed to the prosecution
after their charges get confirmed.

61
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:26,999
I WANT 100 MILLION WON BY THE WEEKEND

62
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:32,584
OR ELSE, I'LL SEND THESE
PICS TO EVERYONE AROUND YOU

63
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,250
Wait, then...

64
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,167
Who the hell is this?

65
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:48,209
Jang Taegu! Jang Taegu! Jang Taegu!

66
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:51,125
Form is temporary; class is permanent.

67
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,626
The definition of Taegu, isn't it?

68
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:57,999
- Yes, chief! A legend!
- Keep it down, everyone.

69
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:02,472
We caught them all, so file your
reports in. Make the announcement fast,

70
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:05,980
get good evaluations,
get bonuses, and get promoted.

71
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,999
- Salute! Thank you, chief!
- Thank you, chief!

72
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:12,042
Taegu, look here.

73
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:18,584
- Go take a dump.
- Oh, come on.

74
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,667
Get to work!
You don't get paid for free.

75
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:22,999
- Work!
- Yes, sir!

76
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,626
No team dinner today? Huh?

77
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:27,667
- Beef!
- We want beef!

78
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:31,083
Beef! Beef!

79
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,709
Where are you?

80
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:40,999
Got it.

81
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:45,999
Where?
I can't see you.

82
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,584
Stop right there.
Stay still.

83
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,999
Okay, come to the car.

84
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:15,038
- What is it?
- Watch carefully.

85
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:17,626
This is the blackmailer's photo,

86
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,999
and this is the one I just took.

87
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:23,796
They were watching us
from here on that day.

88
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:29,999
What happened to your hand?

89
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:31,375
It's nothing.

90
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:37,510
Then it wasn't just Donghyun
and his brother there that day?

91
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:40,690
Did you see the car?
Do you remember?

92
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:43,542
No.

93
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:48,533
Did you recall something?

94
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:51,975
No, it's just that
something feels off.

95
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:56,292
If they'd been watching us,
why keep quiet

96
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,728
and suddenly start
blackmailing us now?

97
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:05,661
What if someone in Phantom
escaped arrest or got away?

98
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:08,999
Then they would've already shown up
and taken the drug.

99
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,999
Not demand only 100 million.

100
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:15,636
What if it's someone close?

101
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:19,829
They know the people around us,
and blackmailed to our non-work phone.

102
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:21,680
That means they were
watching us up close.

103
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:25,673
It might be someone we know.

104
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,043
You lost to Sua
even in the mock exams?

105
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:35,160
How can you lose to her at everything?

106
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,250
What have I not done for you?

107
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:42,876
I've spent tons of money
on your extra tutoring classes!

108
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:45,101
Money, money, money!
Just stop!

109
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:50,331
I hate taking the extra tutoring classes.

110
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,027
You made me take them.
Why do you keep demanding from me?

111
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:58,417
If you're so stingy, take it all back.

112
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:02,292
Throw me away while you're at it!

113
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,522
It's not like I chose
to be your daughter!

114
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:07,999
Yoon Jinhee.

115
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:13,463
I wish I was born into Sua's family.

116
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:17,229
You know that?

117
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,999
Yoon Jinhee!

118
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,367
I'll find the blackmailer.
You work on the money.

119
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:55,751
100 million by myself?

120
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:59,083
The weekend's so close.
How am I going to make enough?

121
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,495
Can't we use your money first?
I'm sure you have that much.

122
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:06,862
Don't you?

123
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:09,696
Are you serious?

124
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:17,709
You're joking. You can't have spent...
Did you buy a house?

125
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:21,325
- I don't have to explain myself.
- You're driving me nuts!

126
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:26,176
Then what's the plan?
Do you have a solution?

127
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,584
I wasn't the only one earning money.

128
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,999
Not my husband's treatment money.

129
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:34,282
Why do you think I did all this
in the first place?

130
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:39,774
Even if you do catch them, there's
no guarantee I'll get my money back!

131
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:42,876
I can't touch the treatment money,
no matter what!

132
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:46,154
Then there's only one way.

133
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,374
No, I can't do this anymore.

134
00:10:56,398 --> 00:11:00,459
Then he'll send the photos to your family.
Do you have another plan?

135
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:05,334
Let's pay them first.
Play it safe.

136
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,334
I'll find the culprit
in the meantime, okay?

137
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:20,999
CALLER ID BLOCKED

138
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:22,250
I WANT 100 MILLION WON BY THE WEEKEND

139
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:44,626
Ah, hot!

140
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:46,751
Ouch.

141
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:22,999
No...

142
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,125
15 million won burnt to waste...

143
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:30,250
God, I'm crazy!

144
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,626
Ah, what a waste.

145
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,292
What do I do with this?

146
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:45,375
And how did you not burn?

147
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,834
Damn it! What do I do?

148
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,459
Where is she?

149
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,570
How did you know...?

150
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,640
Drop the act.

151
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:34,375
I know you always come here after
lying about being on a business trip!

152
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:42,136
You tailed me?

153
00:13:42,542 --> 00:13:47,167
What we need to talk about
is that you dared

154
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:49,999
to do this filthy thing
behind my back!

155
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,999
Where is she?

156
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,709
Where is she?
Where is that woman?

157
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,209
Tell her to come out!
Where is she?

158
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:02,999
Miyeon.

159
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:05,999
Yang Miyeon!

160
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:09,451
Stop it!
There's no woman here.

161
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:14,054
I come here
literally to be alone.

162
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:17,918
What?

163
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,876
To be away from you.

164
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,834
DK

165
00:14:40,876 --> 00:14:43,209
YOU'RE BARELY REACHABLE.
CAN I BUY 30 G? I'LL PAY EXTRA

166
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,999
I have to stick to small amounts...

167
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:54,999
Pay double
and I can ship right away.

168
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:59,000
Mr. Park Dojin has finished chemotherapy.

169
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,083
Thank you.

170
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:09,959
You okay?

171
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:19,083
We ran the ID.
He died two years ago.

172
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:21,106
It's a burner phone.

173
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,751
That means he's not an ordinary person.

174
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:28,709
Well, the internet tells you everything.
You can easily get

175
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:30,484
caller-ID blocking and burner phones.

176
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,437
It's a world where
illegal has become easier.

177
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:37,834
So, what happened
that you're this desperate?

178
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,626
Another secret, huh?

179
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:47,249
- Anything else you want?
- Recent call log and cell-tower pings.

180
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:52,256
That'll cost you double.

181
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,876
Okay.

182
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,918
I'm going to kill the bastard.

183
00:16:14,688 --> 00:16:17,360
Big news! Jinhee spread
the rumors about Sua!

184
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,542
Oh, really?
I thought they were besties.

185
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,584
It's true. Yoojung just told me.

186
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:23,626
Unbelievable, what a bitch.

187
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:25,999
Acting all friendly,
then stabbing her behind her back!

188
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:27,209
Like mother, like daughter.

189
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:32,250
Sua.

190
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,709
I said it because
I was worried about you.

191
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,626
But Yoojung was just running her mouth.

192
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,918
You're just like your mom.
Always blaming everyone but yourself.

193
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,292
Then how perfect is your mom?

194
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:52,999
If you and your mom were so good,
why would people talk behind your backs?

195
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,999
- You said cash, not transfer?
- Yes.

196
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:54,584
Including VAT,
we can buy your car at...

197
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,167
65 million won.

198
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:18,209
Total assets: 79,260,537 won

199
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:34,500
I told you, I can't make
100 million on my own.

200
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:37,709
What have you been doing?
Are you even searching?

201
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:39,999
You think blackmailers
get found so easily?

202
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,375
Money's the same!

203
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:44,042
You said it's someone close.
Search your people.

204
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,500
Those with grudges against you.

205
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:48,834
For now, chip in 10 million each, okay?

206
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,741
Whats this?
You never come in person.

207
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:10,167
Just set up your shop here.

208
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:14,918
I know a prosecutor who does
meth during night duty.

209
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:18,667
He says the reports write themselves.
Thought I might try myself.

210
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,834
Do you know how many
complaints we file a day?

211
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:22,999
You'd make a killing.

212
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,626
Is this why Hwirim calls you crazy?

213
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:28,667
He's a born killjoy.
He doesn't get humor.

214
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:32,083
By the way,
I heard you got cut off.

215
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,824
He loses it every time
your name comes up.

216
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:38,626
Bet you made him
feel bad or something.

217
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:41,945
I once broke a promise,
and he blocked me for months.

218
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:45,375
He forgets what he did,

219
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:48,876
but never what others did to him.
Jackass.

220
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:02,125
You must study
the Q3 performance report,

221
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,999
government-support project plan,
and the last board minutes.

222
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:38,792
Since it's your first board meeting,
the chairman's expectations are very high.

223
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:43,792
Thank you for the briefing.
You may go.

224
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:56,500
Cockroaches...

225
00:23:58,417 --> 00:23:59,375
Cockroaches...

226
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:10,459
Receiving Vaka inquiries 24/7.

227
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,792
#top_quality #highest_purity
#strongest_security

228
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:17,125
Where is it...
Where is it?

229
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:18,999
Where is it...

230
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:23,000
Where is it? Where is it?
Where is it?

231
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:30,725
Found it.

232
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:34,292
Hwirim find out?

233
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm just saying
it could be a possibility.

234
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:40,000
- We have someone on the board, right?- We do.

235
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:42,375
But you'd know better.
You're right beside him.

236
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:46,125
Something came up,
so I haven't been onto him.

237
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:47,626
Like what?

238
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:54,264
Whatever it is, if he caught on, our
company would've been in trouble already.

239
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,083
Or he would've gone
straight to Father.

240
00:24:58,433 --> 00:24:59,975
Are you sure
everything's going fine?

241
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,375
I'm meeting Austin next week.
We need to be ready.

242
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:06,083
We need to hold at least 0.5%
of TwoN Holdings shares.

243
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:08,417
We can't convince Austin
or anyone else otherwise.

244
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:10,684
- We're still far off!
- I know!

245
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:11,792
Do you?

246
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:16,918
You're not the only one
on the line here.

247
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:20,167
Everything we're doing
is under my name.

248
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:22,959
I never should've accepted
to work with you.

249
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:26,042
You always ruin things for
others, you know that?

250
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:29,667
If the money isn't ready
by this weekend, I'm out.

251
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:32,334
Bro... Bro!

252
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:55,999
Why now of all times?

253
00:25:58,762 --> 00:26:00,999
Who the hell could it be?

254
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:16,250
Eunsoo!

255
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:17,918
What are you doing?

256
00:26:28,209 --> 00:26:29,918
You look exhausted.

257
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:33,876
What's with your face?
What did you do last night?

258
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:36,751
Did you spend it with the art tutor?

259
00:26:37,893 --> 00:26:38,893
What?

260
00:26:42,885 --> 00:26:48,174
I've met plenty of people
while teaching children.

261
00:26:48,918 --> 00:26:52,103
The more diligent they are,
the bigger the mess when they fall.

262
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:54,999
And they betray much harder too.

263
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:59,959
That's exactly what you are.

264
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,167
Maybe that was why...

265
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:10,459
You always stood out to me,
like a splinter in my nail.

266
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:16,196
And I can't go
without getting rid of it.

267
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:29,000
See you tomorrow.
It'll be fun.

268
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:41,542
CALLER ID BLOCKED

269
00:27:41,584 --> 00:27:45,250
GOT YOUR MONEY.
LOOKING FORWARD TO NEXT WEEK

270
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:18,125
Mom, you're home today!

271
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,292
Did you eat?

272
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:22,667
Yeah.

273
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:25,040
I've been thinking about something.

274
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:28,042
I'll be back soon.
Don't skip dinner.

275
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,083
Who? Jinhee's mom?

276
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:57,876
I bet she's paying back after
getting humiliated at the open class.

277
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:00,999
What if she tried to find
evidence between us,

278
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,834
then saw everything by chance?

279
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:05,417
Wait, isn't that lady rich?

280
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:07,500
Who doesn't want money
in this world?

281
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,486
You burn through money yourself!

282
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,375
There's no one who needs money
more than me.

283
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:19,959
Yes. That's why she blackmailed
for money—it's our biggest weakness.

284
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:22,999
100 mil every week?

285
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,918
Seriously?
I have to keep doing this?

286
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:28,626
God...

287
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:35,360
Should I call Jinhee's mom
and talk it out?

288
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:39,584
Maybe I should beg her for forgiveness.

289
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:45,834
No! The more I bow,
the easier I'll get crushed.

290
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:46,918
Then what should I do?

291
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:50,354
What should I do...

292
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,417
Stop it.

293
00:30:00,836 --> 00:30:02,180
How long have you gone sleepless?

294
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:05,839
Ever since you got the text?

295
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,999
Listen, you could kill yourself.

296
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:14,003
I can't sleep.
I can't eat either.

297
00:30:15,843 --> 00:30:19,195
Every time I doze off,
the same dream comes back.

298
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:24,667
My family staring at me,
knowing everything I did.

299
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:31,334
Listen, Mr. Lee.
If Sua finds out about me,

300
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:34,042
I'll kill myself.

301
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:38,209
I'd rather die than let that happen.

302
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,991
Please forgive my son.

303
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:52,999
If you say the word, Mr. Chairman.
I'll do anything.

304
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:54,999
Please, have mercy.

305
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:58,394
Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman!

306
00:31:13,584 --> 00:31:14,542
Kyung...

307
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,767
Think carefully.

308
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:05,999
That professor could be the culprit,
like you said.

309
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:10,599
But if not,
we'll be in bigger trouble.

310
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:13,286
Anyone else come to mind?

311
00:34:13,622 --> 00:34:16,417
Maybe something happened
before you got that text,

312
00:34:16,459 --> 00:34:19,862
or maybe someone
who became curious about you.

313
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:23,709
Even the smallest detail helps.
Let's widen the scope.

314
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,959
You still haven't done the paperwork?

315
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:43,403
The drug bag is still missing.

316
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,999
Then what did we find
at Do Gyuman's restaurant?

317
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:49,667
Regular meth,
not the new one they lost.

318
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,918
That's why Gyuman
killed Hwang Donghyun.

319
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:56,334
Donghyun found the drug, hid them,
and secretly sold them online.

320
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:59,430
The Vietnamese gang
confessed everything.

321
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:03,334
That drug was made for Japanese VIPs.

322
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:05,999
They probably found it
and sent it to Japan.

323
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,125
- We need a statement...
- How?

324
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:10,334
Our intel has gone off the grid.

325
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:13,125
And Do Kyuman's exercising
his right to silence.

326
00:35:14,374 --> 00:35:18,156
Didn't you hear the chief?
He said to wrap this up fast.

327
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:20,296
We're piled up with other cases too.

328
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:24,042
Leave the rest to the geezers.
We've done our part.

329
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:38,397
So the police came to your house?

330
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:42,695
And asked about the drug
and a few other things about me?

331
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:48,876
Yeah, but they didn't find anything.

332
00:35:49,295 --> 00:35:51,940
I fooled them away.

333
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:54,415
And also lied to me.

334
00:35:56,158 --> 00:35:57,542
Listen.

335
00:35:58,896 --> 00:36:00,138
What did I say?

336
00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:04,834
That we need to share every single thing,
absolutely everything!

337
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:06,459
Yet, you lied to me again?

338
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,302
Hey, I didn't mean to.

339
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:13,767
You were afraid
I would quit if I found out.

340
00:36:16,164 --> 00:36:18,241
You're a selfish woman.

341
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:21,864
You don't care if I get caught,
as long as you get your money, huh?

342
00:36:23,192 --> 00:36:27,387
How can you say that?
The selfish one is you.

343
00:36:27,926 --> 00:36:31,512
You sat there taking the money
while I did all the work.

344
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:34,999
You blamed me for
the drug source and everything.

345
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:36,999
Do you even remember our contract?

346
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:41,999
That we may renegotiate
profit distribution based on contribution.

347
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,542
I do the promotion, sales, and delivery,
yet it's 70/30?

348
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:46,709
And apparently you're broke?

349
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:50,834
I gave up my husband's hospital fee. And
you still haven't found the blackmailer!

350
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:54,999
Fine, the cops?
You really think that's my fault?

351
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:56,667
Do you even know
why they came to my house?

352
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:59,726
They traced the records
on your burner phone, okay?

353
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,459
I lost my phone
thanks to you, remember?

354
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:05,500
You screwed me over
by swapping the bag!

355
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:08,542
What about Donghyun?
I said I can convince him.

356
00:37:08,584 --> 00:37:12,250
You got distracted and
lost them both in the end!

357
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,667
Go on, don't stop now.

358
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:24,834
You want to blame
their death on me, don't you?

359
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:28,999
That's what you've
wanted to say all along!

360
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:31,792
Yes! You left because of a call!

361
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,626
And where did you
spend your money?

362
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:35,338
I know that you're using me!

363
00:37:35,408 --> 00:37:36,999
You think I didn't notice?

364
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:41,677
You're pretending to care
just to keep me working, aren't you?

365
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:43,724
And you want me
to share everything?

366
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:46,364
You never share a word!
Why only me?

367
00:37:46,396 --> 00:37:49,153
This is no partnership!
It's completely unfair!

368
00:37:55,042 --> 00:38:00,243
So all this is my fault?
For taking advantage of you?

369
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,999
Don't forget.
You came to me first.

370
00:38:05,999 --> 00:38:07,792
So who used whom?

371
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:13,792
BRO

372
00:38:16,876 --> 00:38:17,999
BRO

373
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:25,144
If you're that upset,
then fuck off.

374
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,019
I'll handle it myself from now.

375
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,999
And do what?
Hey! Hey!

376
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:36,999
Fine, whatever!
I'll do as I please too!

377
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:36,436
Is this your house?

378
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,042
Your real house?

379
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:02,292
I didn't mean to lie from the start.

380
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:06,042
Jinhee just assumed I lived there.

381
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,083
I never said anything.

382
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:29,459
What about the class fund?

383
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:34,125
- Huh?
- Were you the thief?

384
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:42,959
LEE DAYOON
KIM SEONG

385
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:45,083
SEO DOHEE, SONG HAENA, PARK MINHEE

386
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:46,834
PARK JIMIN

387
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:49,000
Gyeongdo said that?

388
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:53,959
Wow, our rookie's really grown up.

389
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,292
Isn't working hard
a good thing, though?

390
00:40:59,898 --> 00:41:00,959
Guess you're not a fan.

391
00:41:02,786 --> 00:41:06,439
He seems a little obsessed
with the drugs.

392
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:11,751
Yeah, he's been frantic
trying to find that bag.

393
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:14,792
He's working overtime, unlike before.

394
00:41:16,631 --> 00:41:19,125
- About Phantom...
- Yes.

395
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:23,068
We haven't figured out
how the Phantom has our intel, right?

396
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:25,431
No, sir.

397
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:14,999
Really?

398
00:42:16,626 --> 00:42:20,000
You're not gonna tell them?
That I live here?

399
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:23,167
Only if you return everything.

400
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:25,999
Why are you being nice?

401
00:42:32,124 --> 00:42:35,897
- Then why's your face red?
- What are you talking about?

402
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:38,334
Wipe your nose.

403
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:39,999
Let me see.

404
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:43,167
Done.

405
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,042
Look who it is.

406
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:00,667
Isn't that Mr. Lee?

407
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:02,792
Hey!

408
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,500
Look, Sua drew this!

409
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:09,834
Hey, Yoojung! Stop!

410
00:43:09,876 --> 00:43:12,209
Don't you like Mr. Lee too?
Don't lose him to her.

411
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,083
Mr. Lee likes me the most.

412
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,584
No, he likes me!
Didn't you see him last time?

413
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:18,918
No, it's not like that...

414
00:43:33,751 --> 00:43:35,709
Everyone has a dark side.

415
00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:37,999
But...

416
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:44,584
That's not all you are.

417
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:48,999
I'm...

418
00:43:50,918 --> 00:43:51,788
I'm sorry.

419
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:54,599
By the way,
what was that you delivered?

420
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:56,999
What?

421
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:02,584
HAPPINESS HOSPITAL

422
00:44:15,417 --> 00:44:17,000
TOO MANY ATTEMPTS

423
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:26,417
TRY AGAIN IN 30 SECONDS

424
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:29,292
You always pay in cash.

425
00:44:30,944 --> 00:44:32,149
Is that a problem?

426
00:44:33,383 --> 00:44:34,342
No, not really.

427
00:44:37,543 --> 00:44:39,876
You're a bit short
on this week's fee.

428
00:44:39,999 --> 00:44:41,250
153,000 won.

429
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:51,999
I'll pay when he's discharged tomorrow.

430
00:44:52,896 --> 00:44:53,936
Okay.

431
00:44:56,382 --> 00:44:58,215
I can do it myself.

432
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:03,000
I have to handle your discharge
and thank the doctor.

433
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:06,500
There's so much to do tomorrow.
You can't do it all alone.

434
00:45:07,647 --> 00:45:10,428
I'm coming right after
the parents' meeting tomorrow.

435
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,999
If you're busy,
I can go home by myself.

436
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:15,999
How? You can't take the bus.

437
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:22,999
I'm just saying.

438
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,179
The chemo I'm on
isn't covered by insurance.

439
00:45:27,999 --> 00:45:32,000
Yeoju told me you work
as a housekeeper for Sua's art tutor.

440
00:45:34,362 --> 00:45:35,445
Is that true?

441
00:45:36,876 --> 00:45:38,999
Was that enough to cover my bills?

442
00:45:47,918 --> 00:45:48,826
Honey.

443
00:45:48,857 --> 00:45:51,584
Do you have something to tell me?

444
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:07,500
Hold on, I need the bathroom.

445
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:25,125
Are you kidding me?

446
00:46:25,707 --> 00:46:27,154
You changed the account password?

447
00:46:27,787 --> 00:46:29,370
You were whining.

448
00:46:29,459 --> 00:46:32,167
So I cut your workload.
Got a problem?

449
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:33,218
What?

450
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:36,667
You're right.
We should be paid by our workload.

451
00:46:36,709 --> 00:46:39,792
I'll handle customers and deliveries.

452
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:41,042
You just pack the drugs.

453
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,042
What are you playing at?

454
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,375
Or hand over the drug
and fuck off.

455
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,999
Can't do that, can you?

456
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:58,999
The number you have dialed
is switched off.

457
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:02,042
Fuck! That bastard.

458
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:17,209
URGENT: HIRING A DROPPER

459
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:25,263
DM me if you're interested.

460
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:35,542
CALL-DETAIL RECORDS

461
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:55,375

GWANGNAM POLICE STATION

465
00:48:22,751 --> 00:48:23,959
Police station...

466
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,459
Oct 17th, Kim Minwoo gave info
on James to police.

467
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,709
Oct 22nd, a call from Medusa's boss.

468
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:38,375
Where are you, James?

469
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,292
Signs of police involvement...

470
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:49,999
The police traced the records
on your burner phone, okay?

471
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:55,250
Nov 10th, police visited
Kang Eunsoo's home.

472
00:48:56,999 --> 00:49:02,459
Nov 16th, Hwang Donghyun and Hwang Junhyun
broke into Kang Eunsoo's home.

473
00:49:03,564 --> 00:49:06,167
Found "money-grubber" texts
on Hwang Donghyun's phone.

474
00:49:07,584 --> 00:49:11,626
Money-grubber,
Phantom's intel broker?

475
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:18,834
THE MONEY-GRUBBER CONTACTED US,
SAYS HE KNOWS JAMES

476
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:25,375
MONEY-GRUBBER

477
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:29,918
MONEY-GRUBBER

478
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:34,167
The number you have dialed
does not exist.

479
00:49:36,792 --> 00:49:38,042
Money-grubber...

480
00:49:41,751 --> 00:49:43,459
Phantom's intel broker?

481
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,459
The police?

482
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:54,999
The police...

483
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,999
Applying for the dropper job.

484
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,792
ID CARD

485
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:12,667
What are you doing?

486
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,626
- Aren't you going to art?
- Yeah, I am.

487
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,667
Hey, buy me tteokbokki.

488
00:50:24,709 --> 00:50:26,542
Buy it with your own money.

489
00:50:26,584 --> 00:50:29,999
How about fish cake?
No, I want soondae!

490
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:38,306
Alright, we've seen enough.
Let's vote.

491
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:43,999
Raise if you're in favor
of installing security cameras.

492
00:50:46,751 --> 00:50:48,751
Including myself, twelve.

493
00:50:49,999 --> 00:50:51,999
Opposed... three?

494
00:50:54,999 --> 00:50:56,125
Who didn't vote?

495
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,125
Um, Eunsoo?

496
00:51:00,249 --> 00:51:01,541
Eunsoo!

497
00:51:02,774 --> 00:51:04,625
You haven't voted.

498
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,959
Are you in favor or against?

499
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:15,959
I'm against it. Cameras in classrooms
raise privacy issues.

500
00:51:15,999 --> 00:51:17,667
They're at a very sensitive age.

501
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:24,375
The goal is to prevent crime in advance.

502
00:51:24,417 --> 00:51:26,834
The thief hasn't been caught yet.

503
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:30,417
We need evidence to prevent escape.

504
00:51:30,706 --> 00:51:33,182
Wouldn't that be better
for the kids?

505
00:51:33,584 --> 00:51:37,292
And there was that
recent incident too.

506
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:41,042
You know, the brothers who sold drugs.

507
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:43,626
They even sold to minors.

508
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,292
What? Seriously?

509
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:50,375
That's why we need to stay alert
and manage things.

510
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:52,792
So creeps like that
can't get near our children.

511
00:51:54,125 --> 00:52:01,000
Wait. Eunsoo actually
worked with the dead criminal.

512
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:07,999
I saw him a few times myself
at the store you work at.

513
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:12,388
He seemed so normal.
I would have never known.

514
00:52:15,685 --> 00:52:17,060
What are you trying to say?

515
00:52:18,038 --> 00:52:22,248
Just that the world's so scary.

516
00:52:22,999 --> 00:52:28,999
People who look innocent like you
end up doing terrible things.

517
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:35,876
Ladies.

518
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:39,542
Shall we take a break?
Maybe use the restroom.

519
00:52:39,584 --> 00:52:41,709
Sure, sure.

520
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:44,417
Ugh, it's suffocating.

521
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:46,999
How are we supposed to raise children?

522
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:51,876
That's why many people are sending
their kids abroad or immigrating.

523
00:52:52,918 --> 00:52:54,959
It's safer there.

524
00:52:55,471 --> 00:52:57,679
Wait, are you sure?

525
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,834
Thank you.

526
00:53:02,876 --> 00:53:03,876
Looks delicious.

527
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,918
- Let's dig in.
- Yup.

528
00:53:06,913 --> 00:53:08,248
Oh, thank you...

529
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:15,209
Never mind, I guess.

530
00:53:18,584 --> 00:53:20,000
No, it's okay. I'll feed myself.

531
00:53:20,959 --> 00:53:23,167
Just eat it already.

532
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:25,667
Yes, sir.

533
00:53:38,459 --> 00:53:40,584
Hey, rookie.
Drinking on duty?

534
00:53:40,626 --> 00:53:42,584
- Should I spit it out?
- Just kidding.

535
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:50,083
Jang Taegu.

536
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:54,999
Divorced in 2017 due to domestic violence,
stock losses, and so on.

537
00:53:56,907 --> 00:54:02,584
Choi Gyeongdo, bank loan of 320 mil,
2.3 mil interest per month.

538
00:54:02,844 --> 00:54:06,999
Father's hospital bill:
8.7 mil won per month.

539
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:12,167
So he's got both motive and reason.

540
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,999
A very likely candidate...

541
00:54:19,334 --> 00:54:20,876
EXCHANGE OFFICE

542
00:54:21,999 --> 00:54:22,999
What, bro?

543
00:55:03,626 --> 00:55:05,334
Looks like someone's desperate.

544
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:19,751
Don't mess with me like a coward.
Just say what you want.

545
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,250
A coward?

546
00:55:21,362 --> 00:55:23,069
You're telling me that?

547
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,999
You're very brave.

548
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:28,626
Or maybe just fearless.

549
00:55:46,709 --> 00:55:48,083
It was that night.

550
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:53,250
Didn't I tell you?
I can't stand not pulling out splinters.

551
00:55:53,999 --> 00:55:57,834
Was it...
Was it really you?

552
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,792
This is why we need
security cameras.

553
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:06,792
I never wanted to go this far.

554
00:56:06,999 --> 00:56:09,468
I really mean it.
Sort of.

555
00:56:25,999 --> 00:56:31,751
Wait, instead of the parents' chat,

556
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:35,459
I'll just post it
in the kids' group chat.

557
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,876
That'll make it certain, right?

558
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:05,353
Dojin, congratulations
on your discharge.

559
00:57:06,187 --> 00:57:07,186
Thank you.

560
00:57:07,315 --> 00:57:10,482
Don't come here again, alright?

561
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:16,083
Congratulations.
Stay healthy from now on.

562
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:17,918
Thank you, sir.

563
00:57:17,959 --> 00:57:20,999
Stop by when you come
for your checkups.

564
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:29,959
- Sure. You'll be discharged soon too.
- Yeah.

565
00:57:29,999 --> 00:57:32,834
I'll buy you a Rubik's Cube later.

566
00:57:32,876 --> 00:57:34,083
Thank you.

567
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:17,209
When people are faced
with the unexpected,

568
00:58:18,918 --> 00:58:21,834
and do things they had
never imagined,

569
00:58:22,819 --> 00:58:25,500
that's when they realize
who they truly are.

570
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,999
Oh, no! Madam!
Are you okay?

571
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:54,667
Here, look at me!
Try to breathe!

572
00:58:54,709 --> 00:58:56,584
Madam! Madam?

573
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,334
Here's what you asked for.

574
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:59,959
The receiver requested 100 million
to be sent in investments.

575
00:59:59,999 --> 01:00:03,334
Definitely a very cautious person.

576
01:00:03,756 --> 01:00:06,959
The meeting's every Thursday at 5 pm.

577
01:00:07,999 --> 01:00:09,999
Huh? That's today.

578
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:16,918
Bad economies hit
ad and construction industries first.

579
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:19,626
The stock's already dropped two-thirds.

580
01:00:20,205 --> 01:00:21,792
Our company is in danger.

581
01:00:21,834 --> 01:00:24,999
With the business presentation soon,
we shouldn't purchase aggressively.

582
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,584
One more problem
and we could lose control entirely!

583
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:30,779
Is this really the time to be cautious?

584
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:35,834
We can't afford to lose
cash liquidity right now.

585
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:40,876
We should be focusing
on the next IR.

586
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:43,834
Right, Executive Director?

587
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:23,999
Sir?
Are you alright?

588
01:06:13,999 --> 01:06:14,999
The number you have dialed...

589
01:06:14,999 --> 01:06:16,834
LEE KYUNG

590
01:06:18,959 --> 01:06:20,999
Pick up.
This is an emergency!

591
01:06:28,959 --> 01:06:29,999
Move!

592
01:06:30,876 --> 01:06:31,959
What the hell?

593
01:06:40,999 --> 01:06:42,083
DELETE

594
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,375
DELETE

595
01:06:51,542 --> 01:06:53,042
Where are the other photos?

596
01:06:56,673 --> 01:07:00,589
Shit, it wasn't Miyeon?

597
01:07:09,167 --> 01:07:10,500
Oh my god.

598
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:13,417
- Professor Yang, are you okay?
- Miyeon!

599
01:07:13,999 --> 01:07:15,334
Miyeon! Oh my god.

600
01:07:21,334 --> 01:07:22,999
It's her bag...

601
01:07:22,999 --> 01:07:24,751
Which hospital?

602
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:27,959
She was foaming at the mouth.

603
01:07:27,999 --> 01:07:30,000
What happened to her?

604
01:07:38,542 --> 01:07:40,167
DICTIONARY

605
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:33,500
You're the money-grubber,

606
01:08:33,695 --> 01:08:34,999
aren't you?

607
01:09:16,751 --> 01:09:19,542
WALKING ON THIN ICE

608
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:22,834
I really like the look in your eyes.

609
01:09:22,876 --> 01:09:25,334
I didn't recognize you at first either.

610
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,626
No way, you...

611
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:27,417
Shh.

612
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:28,999
We need to shut down operations.

613
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:34,375
If I lose this job too,
I've got nowhere left to go.

614
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:35,999
You want to quit, huh?

615
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:40,334
The delivery part-time job...
How much does it pay?

616
01:09:40,375 --> 01:09:41,792
Who's the money-grubber?

617
01:09:41,834 --> 01:09:44,876
I want 200 million a week, cash only.

618
01:09:44,918 --> 01:09:47,959
How do you know his name?
Wait, then is he...

619
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:49,751
She's our insurance.

620
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:52,751
If things go south,
we'll pin it on her.
