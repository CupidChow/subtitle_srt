1
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,643
Hi.

2
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:06,604
Brother Benny sent me…

3
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:18,688
Sit down.

4
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:29,984
My name's Max.

5
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,672
I'm Jackson.

6
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:38,436
Benny sure is a lucky bastard.

7
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,400
Where did he find you?

8
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,728
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

9
00:03:45,144 --> 00:03:47,308
It was a compliment,
don't you get it?

10
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:51,364
Thank you for choosing me
for the threesome.

11
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:54,976
Just tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

12
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,728
Don't be nervous.

13
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:01,896
This guy comes very quickly.

14
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:32,936
Let's go.

15
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,224
You look good.

16
00:04:58,476 --> 00:04:59,812
Really?

17
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:02,976
But it's too expensive.

18
00:05:04,768 --> 00:05:06,936
Don't worry, let's go.

19
00:05:07,268 --> 00:05:13,896
Here I laugh, here I cry.

20
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:19,144
Here I live, and here I'll die.

21
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:24,644
Here I pray

22
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:28,520
and here I feel lost.

23
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:33,768
Here I seek, and here I miss.

24
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,144
Beijing, Beijing

25
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:54,768
almost the distance
between the neon lights and the moon.

26
00:05:57,436 --> 00:06:03,604
In the midst of their struggles,
people comfort and hug each other.

27
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:09,268
Searching and chasing,
grasping at shattered dreams.

28
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:18,020
Here we laugh, here we cry.

29
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,812
Here we live, and here we'll die.

30
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,188
Here we pray.

31
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:32,644
Here we feel lost.

32
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:38,268
Here we seek, and here we miss.

33
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:45,688
Beijing, Beijing.

34
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:09,728
It was great.

35
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,812
You're not going to come?

36
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:56,436
I have a client later.

37
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:15,852
I can't let him down.

38
00:09:17,728 --> 00:09:19,128
Big Brother.

39
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:21,188
Cheers.

40
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:26,768
How are you tonight?

41
00:09:27,352 --> 00:09:28,596
Okay.

42
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:29,932
That's good.

43
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:31,728
Come outside.

44
00:09:32,476 --> 00:09:34,644
Big Brother, I'm sorry.

45
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:45,188
Brother Bao, I'll be right back.

46
00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:56,520
Brother Bao, he's a very good friend,
I'm sure it's urgent.

47
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:58,896
What about me?

48
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,396
Brother Bao, don't be angry,

49
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:07,104
I'll come back
and drink three glasses, okay?

50
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:14,896
Okay, go, and then three glasses.

51
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,644
Thank you, Brother Bao.

52
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:32,128
Let's beat it, this guy's a psycho.

53
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,144
Don't interfere, okay?

54
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:38,200
Listen to me,
I've seen plenty of guys like this.

55
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:41,144
You can earn money any way you like,

56
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,852
but I can't.

57
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:48,536
I can't let my mom down.

58
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,096
I know you take care of your family,

59
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:57,688
but please
think about your situation.

60
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,436
Do you know what kind of guy he is?

61
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:09,688
Are you finished?

62
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:11,160
I got you breakfast.

63
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:48,560
I shouldn't have treated you
like that yesterday.

64
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,060
Brother Bao!

65
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:22,436
Where are you?

66
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:24,144
I'm here…

67
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:25,688
Brother Bao!

68
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:27,976
Brother Bao!

69
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,060
Brother Bao! Where are you?

70
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:34,604
There he is!

71
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,476
Brother Bao!

72
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:43,104
Motherfucker!

73
00:16:08,188 --> 00:16:10,560
Xiaolai on the fifth floor.

74
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:14,672
The young man's okay.
What happened?

75
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,980
FIVE YEARS LATER IN ANOTHER CITY

76
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:35,019
How are things at home?

77
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,060
Not bad,

78
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:40,520
except Grandfather has gotten worse
since his stroke.

79
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,936
Thanks for everything you do.

80
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:51,104
If I can help in any way,
you must let me know.

81
00:19:52,728 --> 00:19:55,020
Don't worry,

82
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:56,812
we can take care of him.

83
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:06,228
By the way, when you get a chance,
give Dad a call.

84
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:09,768
Tell him he shouldn't drink so much.

85
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:16,020
Though he never says it,
I know he misses you.

86
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:23,600
You haven't been back
since Mom passed away...

87
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,148
I know.

88
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,688
I'm coming soon.

89
00:23:08,768 --> 00:23:10,560
Babe, does it feel good?

90
00:24:10,352 --> 00:24:11,644
You didn't come.

91
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,268
You're the star of the show.

92
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,768
As long as you're happy, I'm happy.

93
00:24:26,604 --> 00:24:28,020
But that's not okay.

94
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,976
Even friends need rules,

95
00:24:33,268 --> 00:24:34,604
right?

96
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Got it.

97
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:12,852
I'm off.

98
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:20,188
Bye.

99
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:22,728
Brother.

100
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:48,688
This guy's really something.

101
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:51,688
Treating you like an innocent girl.

102
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,436
If you think he's so great,
I can introduce him to you.

103
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:00,852
Why not someone
a little more generous?

104
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,448
If you're looking for someone
more generous,

105
00:26:04,988 --> 00:26:06,604
go ask your Xiangdong.

106
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,020
Why would I bother him?

107
00:26:09,188 --> 00:26:10,976
He's already switched sides.

108
00:26:14,604 --> 00:26:15,608
By the way,

109
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:19,504
how much money are you gifting
Xiangdong and Lulu for their wedding?

110
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,352
Why should I gift them money?

111
00:26:22,268 --> 00:26:24,144
It's a fake wedding.

112
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:29,164
They already have
the wedding certificate.

113
00:26:30,352 --> 00:26:32,404
We're the ones pretending for them,

114
00:26:32,644 --> 00:26:34,728
they should be gifting us money.

115
00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:38,436
Just pretend it's for Lulu's efforts.

116
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,786
She is playing a fake wife by choice.

117
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:46,981
Is it just for the money?

118
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,896
Aren't you done being angry?

119
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,476
Why should I be?

120
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,896
I'm just afraid
your generosity will bankrupt you.

121
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:17,520
Well, we can't go empty-handed.

122
00:27:19,312 --> 00:27:20,936
Let's recycle this.

123
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:30,976
Xiangdong, Lulu and we
are very special friends.

124
00:27:31,812 --> 00:27:33,712
But for you,

125
00:27:35,324 --> 00:27:37,420
this arduous journey
wasn't easy either, was it?

126
00:27:37,728 --> 00:27:41,604
- So let's drink another toast.
- No, no need, thank you.

127
00:27:41,768 --> 00:27:46,812
You're all taking
good care of Xiangdong.

128
00:27:46,976 --> 00:27:50,560
He talks about you guys all the time
when he's back home.

129
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:53,728
So it's not necessary,
you're welcome.

130
00:27:54,268 --> 00:27:55,976
- Come.
- Sit down. Sit down.

131
00:27:59,688 --> 00:28:04,304
The bride and the groom
didn't toast with us. So here I come.

132
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:06,688
Let's drink.

133
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:14,396
Don't drink so much.

134
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:19,144
Congratulations, and...

135
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:21,956
As your friend,

136
00:28:22,228 --> 00:28:25,820
I've witnessed your love marathon.

137
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,476
It was never easy, not easy at all.

138
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Sister Lulu, are you okay?

139
00:28:40,728 --> 00:28:42,104
Cheers!

140
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,408
- Not so much.
- It's fine.

141
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,352
Xiangdong, this one's for you.

142
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,536
From now on, treat her well.

143
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:02,476
Lulu's my dream lover,

144
00:29:04,268 --> 00:29:07,312
if you let her down,
I'll kick your ass.

145
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:24,564
Such a happy day, the bridal couple
needs to toast each other, right?

146
00:29:24,688 --> 00:29:29,608
- Xiangdong, Lulu, drink together.
- Yeah! Not even a toast yet!

147
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:32,396
Come on, drink!

148
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:45,156
Okay, after the first toast
comes the second.

149
00:29:45,396 --> 00:29:47,060
Haven't you had enough?

150
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:49,852
What?

151
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,560
No way!

152
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:54,851
They didn't even kiss
on their wedding day.

153
00:29:54,852 --> 00:29:57,020
Shouldn't they kiss at least once?

154
00:29:57,188 --> 00:29:58,976
Right? Kiss at least once!

155
00:29:59,728 --> 00:30:03,228
Kiss, kiss, kiss...

156
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,812
Can you finally give it a rest?
Stop it!

157
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,612
Xiangdong did it right.
He quit after earning enough money.

158
00:30:22,896 --> 00:30:26,312
He finds a fake marriage
to keep his family satisfied.

159
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:27,992
With your beauty, you could too.

160
00:30:28,212 --> 00:30:31,908
You just need to try harder.

161
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:35,188
I'm far from that.
Sometimes it's just fate.

162
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:38,042
I went to dinner with Lulu
the other day

163
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,105
and saw a street singer.

164
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:44,160
She said he was once the most
successful money boy in Changsha.

165
00:30:44,396 --> 00:30:45,896
Fate has hit him hard.

166
00:30:46,268 --> 00:30:47,560
What's up with him?

167
00:30:47,852 --> 00:30:50,643
He fought for someone
and wound up crippled.

168
00:30:50,644 --> 00:30:53,020
And he also spent
two years in prison.

169
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:55,976
That's rough.

170
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,676
I heard that it was for his lover.

171
00:30:58,896 --> 00:31:01,936
But when he was arrested,
his lover disappeared.

172
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:05,644
Heaven knows he'll be punished.

173
00:31:07,188 --> 00:31:10,352
Maybe he had his reasons.

174
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:15,936
What reasons?

175
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:18,332
That guy's ruthless.

176
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:22,456
If you want to talk
about ruthlessness,

177
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:29,604
my Xiangdong's ruthless too.

178
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,060
Here, eat something.

179
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,436
Is he really crippled?

180
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,812
He's quite handsome,

181
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:53,312
but you wouldn't think so
when you see him walk.

182
00:33:11,104 --> 00:33:13,060
It's raining.

183
00:33:22,228 --> 00:33:23,592
He's inside.

184
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,476
Stop!

185
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,811
You're suspected of prostitution
and distribution of drugs.

186
00:33:28,812 --> 00:33:31,560
We have a search warrant.
Please cooperate.

187
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:35,476
Search the premises for drugs

188
00:33:35,728 --> 00:33:37,396
or other prohibited items.

189
00:33:38,228 --> 00:33:40,448
Keep your hands to your side,

190
00:33:40,824 --> 00:33:43,376
palms facing forward.

191
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:45,395
Turn the music off!

192
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:47,812
Stay in that position and don't move.

193
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,896
What's that music?

194
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,228
Squat!

195
00:34:04,188 --> 00:34:06,768
Why is this door locked? Open it.

196
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,688
Open the terrace door.

197
00:34:35,104 --> 00:34:36,476
Sit.

198
00:34:42,644 --> 00:34:44,060
Nothing.

199
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,476
Captain, nothing to report.

200
00:34:55,604 --> 00:34:56,768
Let's go.

201
00:35:01,144 --> 00:35:04,188
Get dressed,
you're coming to the station.

202
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:08,144
Or don't you like wearing clothes?

203
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:55,104
Ladies and gentlemen,

204
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:58,811
we rent imperial costumes
from the Qing dynasty.

205
00:35:58,812 --> 00:36:02,604
Rentals are at the corner,

206
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:08,188
so you'll get photos of unforgettable
memories of our picturesque village.

207
00:36:08,312 --> 00:36:13,144
We also offer plenty
of local delicacies for you to enjoy.

208
00:36:16,476 --> 00:36:17,956
How many tickets?

209
00:36:18,188 --> 00:36:19,559
What tickets?

210
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,520
You want to go to the village?

211
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,688
30 Bucks.

212
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,852
Brother Fei!

213
00:36:28,768 --> 00:36:29,976
It's really you.

214
00:36:32,188 --> 00:36:34,936
Long, I almost didn't recognize you.

215
00:36:35,144 --> 00:36:37,976
Are you ripping off tourists again?
Fei's from the village.

216
00:36:38,104 --> 00:36:39,476
Brother Fei.

217
00:36:39,812 --> 00:36:41,436
Let's get on.

218
00:36:42,644 --> 00:36:44,264
Take care, Brother Fei.

219
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:55,976
A lot's different.

220
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,936
- Didn't you leave to find work?
- Yeah…

221
00:37:28,352 --> 00:37:30,704
But I wasn't happy, so I came back.

222
00:37:32,936 --> 00:37:34,604
Where were you?

223
00:37:35,312 --> 00:37:37,896
Your sister said you were in Yiwu.

224
00:37:38,812 --> 00:37:40,688
So I went there.

225
00:37:41,352 --> 00:37:43,020
But I didn't find you.

226
00:37:49,312 --> 00:37:51,476
I wasn't in Yiwu very long.

227
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:53,728
Then I went to Shenzhen.

228
00:38:20,104 --> 00:38:23,020
Fei, how long are you staying?

229
00:38:28,268 --> 00:38:29,768
It depends.

230
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:54,060
Sister...

231
00:38:57,396 --> 00:38:59,976
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

232
00:39:02,936 --> 00:39:04,604
I wanted to surprise you.

233
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,144
You look even better now.

234
00:39:16,852 --> 00:39:18,768
Why's your hair so short?

235
00:39:18,896 --> 00:39:20,936
It makes your ears look bigger.

236
00:39:22,104 --> 00:39:23,460
Really?

237
00:39:24,104 --> 00:39:26,476
Did you eat?
I can make you something.

238
00:39:27,144 --> 00:39:29,187
- Let's have lunch together.
- Okay.

239
00:39:29,188 --> 00:39:31,092
Li Kang!

240
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,728
- My little brother's back.- Dad isn't here.

241
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:41,688
- Doudou.
- He went to the neighbour's.

242
00:39:42,852 --> 00:39:45,396
- This is Uncle.
- Hello, Uncle.

243
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:51,268
Good boy. Give Uncle a hug.

244
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,688
Your uncle held you
when you were little.

245
00:39:57,936 --> 00:39:59,728
I brought a toy for you.

246
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,020
This is for you.

247
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,144
Doudou, no.

248
00:41:37,476 --> 00:41:38,728
Mom.

249
00:41:39,852 --> 00:41:41,520
Fei's here to visit you.

250
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:46,436
This money offering is from Fei.

251
00:41:48,688 --> 00:41:50,352
Use it where you are now.

252
00:41:58,104 --> 00:41:59,936
The family's all doing fine.

253
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:04,936
Dad and Grandpa are the same.

254
00:42:08,268 --> 00:42:11,352
Last week,
Grandpa had a doctor's appointment,

255
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,620
there are no big problems.

256
00:42:17,644 --> 00:42:19,060
Please protect him.

257
00:42:21,476 --> 00:42:23,020
Also protect Fei.

258
00:42:23,188 --> 00:42:25,728
Make sure he's safe.

259
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:34,104
Fei, say a few words to Mom.

260
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:45,936
Mom,

261
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,312
is everything alright where you are?

262
00:42:57,476 --> 00:42:59,060
I wasn't a dutiful son

263
00:43:01,188 --> 00:43:03,688
and couldn't come to see you
in the end.

264
00:43:05,228 --> 00:43:06,812
I hope you're not sad.

265
00:43:10,396 --> 00:43:11,768
But don't worry,

266
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:19,976
I'll take good care
of Dad and sister's family.

267
00:43:36,268 --> 00:43:37,520
Mom,

268
00:43:41,104 --> 00:43:42,768
I miss you.

269
00:44:27,436 --> 00:44:31,560
Take this.
Have it made into a ring.

270
00:44:34,396 --> 00:44:36,020
For your lover.

271
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:42,560
Don't be so picky.

272
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,228
You know what they say:

273
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:52,144
The only ones left
are the ones nobody wants.

274
00:44:55,436 --> 00:44:58,768
Hurry up and get married.

275
00:45:00,896 --> 00:45:05,352
Don't be like Fei, who's on his own

276
00:45:06,768 --> 00:45:08,560
and all alone.

277
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:13,436
Grandpa,

278
00:45:14,476 --> 00:45:16,188
it's me, Fei.

279
00:45:17,352 --> 00:45:18,728
I'm back.

280
00:45:21,312 --> 00:45:22,352
Fei.

281
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,436
Fei.

282
00:45:34,896 --> 00:45:36,060
Fei!

283
00:45:38,104 --> 00:45:39,228
Dad.

284
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,268
Dinner's almost ready.

285
00:45:48,896 --> 00:45:50,144
Go wash up.

286
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,268
Come, drink.

287
00:47:00,644 --> 00:47:04,059
This is
how men are supposed to drink.

288
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:07,020
A Cai, tell your mom to stop cooking.

289
00:47:07,728 --> 00:47:08,768
It's enough.

290
00:47:09,188 --> 00:47:12,788
It's not that much, keep drinking,
there are more dishes coming.

291
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:16,852
A Jie, what are you doing?

292
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,560
Give me my water gun back.
Stop messing around.

293
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:27,728
A Jie, I'm your grandpa!

294
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:31,228
Quit playing around!
You have no manners!

295
00:47:32,604 --> 00:47:35,020
What naughty kids.

296
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:39,468
Sit down or you'll be in trouble
with your dad.

297
00:47:39,852 --> 00:47:43,364
A Cai, come here

298
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:45,060
and control your kid!

299
00:47:45,476 --> 00:47:48,604
No manners at all.
He sprayed water on me.

300
00:47:49,644 --> 00:47:55,396
A Jie, stop messing around
or I'll beat you to death.

301
00:47:55,688 --> 00:47:58,020
Eat with the others. You hear me?

302
00:47:58,352 --> 00:47:59,728
Let's drink!

303
00:48:07,728 --> 00:48:10,392
You're just the same.

304
00:48:11,692 --> 00:48:13,500
I keep telling you

305
00:48:13,768 --> 00:48:18,560
you need to teach your kids manners.
But you don't listen.

306
00:48:19,728 --> 00:48:22,808
If A Jie keeps this up,

307
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,252
you'll be really sorry someday.

308
00:48:25,976 --> 00:48:29,448
Dad, I have to get up
before sunrise for work.

309
00:48:29,612 --> 00:48:31,464
How can I find time for that?

310
00:48:31,896 --> 00:48:34,019
His mother can take care of him.

311
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,520
That's just excuses.

312
00:48:38,988 --> 00:48:41,088
Raising kids these days is hard.

313
00:48:41,268 --> 00:48:43,688
And you have two. That's not easy.

314
00:48:45,812 --> 00:48:47,188
That's life.

315
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:59,020
Fei, do you have a girlfriend?

316
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:04,036
Your dad has been waiting
for grand kids a long time.

317
00:49:06,728 --> 00:49:07,976
Not yet.

318
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,812
Just so you know,

319
00:49:11,352 --> 00:49:15,020
young people these days
are hooking up before marriage.

320
00:49:17,144 --> 00:49:19,560
Fei, is your uncle right?

321
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,144
I don't have money or a career.
No one's interested in me.

322
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:29,476
Getting married isn't difficult.

323
00:49:29,812 --> 00:49:33,396
Just find someone
who'll work hard with you.

324
00:49:35,644 --> 00:49:38,188
Girls have high standards these days.

325
00:49:38,688 --> 00:49:42,852
Then stay here and I'll introduce you
to a girl from the village.

326
00:49:44,436 --> 00:49:46,312
You're almost 30.

327
00:49:47,144 --> 00:49:49,020
If you wait longer,

328
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,800
even the village girls
won't want you.

329
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:56,728
And then your family will lose face.

330
00:50:04,604 --> 00:50:06,188
Liang Guixiang,

331
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:10,144
you're his father.

332
00:50:11,688 --> 00:50:13,228
Aren't you worried?

333
00:50:15,936 --> 00:50:19,520
He's gone all year.
I can't control him.

334
00:50:20,896 --> 00:50:23,604
Let him deal with it on his own.

335
00:50:26,436 --> 00:50:28,060
Yes, Brother,

336
00:50:28,768 --> 00:50:33,643
city people and village people
think differently these days.

337
00:50:33,644 --> 00:50:37,104
Don't interfere
with the affairs of others.

338
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,936
So based on what you're saying,

339
00:50:42,768 --> 00:50:45,188
city people don't need
to get married?

340
00:50:46,268 --> 00:50:51,144
Look at Guo Lao Yi's oldest daughter,

341
00:50:51,312 --> 00:50:54,144
she's over 30
and doesn't want to get married.

342
00:50:54,768 --> 00:50:58,268
You can't tell if
she's a man or a woman.

343
00:50:59,228 --> 00:51:02,644
She must be one of those perverts.

344
00:51:09,104 --> 00:51:10,144
Fei,

345
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:16,604
do you want to be
one of those perverts like her?

346
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:18,768
Brother!

347
00:51:24,352 --> 00:51:28,560
Uncles, enjoy your meal.
I'm going to check on Grandpa.

348
00:51:29,688 --> 00:51:30,896
Fei,

349
00:51:31,728 --> 00:51:35,104
what your uncles say
is for your own good.

350
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,976
You dare show your face
to your grandpa?

351
00:51:40,352 --> 00:51:43,688
You realize he's sick
because you made him so mad!

352
00:51:45,976 --> 00:51:47,352
Why is it my fault?

353
00:51:48,436 --> 00:51:50,768
What you did in the city,

354
00:51:50,896 --> 00:51:52,144
you know very well.

355
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:59,228
Your family lost face because of you.

356
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,268
Even we, the Zhang Family,
are ashamed.

357
00:52:03,604 --> 00:52:04,976
Do you get that?

358
00:52:05,476 --> 00:52:08,020
Fei, please sit down.

359
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:18,188
Stop!

360
00:52:23,768 --> 00:52:27,188
Are you trying to
kill your grandfather?

361
00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:34,896
- Stop right there!
- Dad!

362
00:52:36,228 --> 00:52:37,896
- Dad!
- Fei!

363
00:52:39,436 --> 00:52:40,604
Stop it!

364
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,228
- Damn it, get out of the way!
- Dad!

365
00:52:48,688 --> 00:52:49,812
Fei!

366
00:54:19,852 --> 00:54:23,312
Only after leaving did I realize
this is a good place.

367
00:54:28,604 --> 00:54:30,976
I went also to Shenzhen to find you,

368
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,896
but I didn't.

369
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,688
I found a job in a factory there.

370
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:40,812
Sixteen hours a day.
I never even saw the sun.

371
00:55:00,104 --> 00:55:04,020
Fei, you always beat me at swimming
when we were kids.

372
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:42,476
If you meet the right person,

373
00:55:44,476 --> 00:55:46,228
don't let them go.

374
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,936
The opportunity may not come again.

375
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:55,476
Life is so long.

376
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,268
I don't want you to be lonely.

377
00:56:03,436 --> 00:56:06,768
Don't worry about Dad.
I'll take care of him.

378
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:15,060
You need to start
thinking of yourself.

379
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,936
Take a nap.

380
00:57:07,768 --> 00:57:11,060
My cousin's son died yesterday.

381
00:57:11,976 --> 00:57:13,604
The one with money.

382
00:57:14,896 --> 00:57:17,060
Her son drowned in the reservoir.

383
00:57:18,396 --> 00:57:22,020
This kid was always very well behaved

384
00:57:23,604 --> 00:57:25,312
and got good grades.

385
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,475
His parents let him
take all kinds of lessons.

386
00:57:30,476 --> 00:57:32,020
Piano, painting.

387
00:57:34,188 --> 00:57:37,936
It's hard
to get into a good university.

388
00:57:38,896 --> 00:57:42,352
He went on holiday
with his classmates

389
00:57:44,268 --> 00:57:45,852
and drowned.

390
00:57:47,476 --> 00:57:49,144
He was their only child.

391
00:57:52,812 --> 00:57:57,796
In the past few years,
they worked hard and earned a lot.

392
00:57:58,268 --> 00:58:00,060
What good did it do them?

393
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,604
You didn't show up.
Our godfather isn't happy about that.

394
00:58:40,728 --> 00:58:42,688
He says you're ungrateful.

395
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,936
The old jerk.

396
00:58:47,104 --> 00:58:51,560
He says
he won't help you out next time.

397
00:58:55,852 --> 00:58:57,976
Did you give him my money gift?

398
00:58:58,812 --> 00:59:00,560
You can trust me.

399
00:59:18,936 --> 00:59:20,352
I just got 3000,

400
00:59:20,976 --> 00:59:22,852
I'll transfer it to you now.

401
00:59:23,312 --> 00:59:25,352
And I'll get you the rest.

402
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,688
Forget it.

403
00:59:27,312 --> 00:59:30,644
Just invite me to dinner
the next time you get paid.

404
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,560
Hello?

405
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:05,768
Fei!

406
01:00:16,644 --> 01:00:19,768
I've brought you
everything you like to eat.

407
01:00:24,936 --> 01:00:26,060
Smoked ham.

408
01:00:29,768 --> 01:00:30,976
And also...

409
01:00:36,436 --> 01:00:37,644
Thank you.

410
01:00:38,688 --> 01:00:40,020
Have you eaten?

411
01:00:42,728 --> 01:00:44,768
- I'll invite you to dinner.
- Okay.

412
01:00:45,312 --> 01:00:47,144
- I'll take this up first.
- Okay.

413
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,104
You can wait here.

414
01:00:53,688 --> 01:00:54,852
Okay.

415
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,644
Why did you suddenly come here?

416
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,312
Does your uncle live here?

417
01:01:44,812 --> 01:01:46,604
Do you have friends here?

418
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,560
You're my friend.

419
01:01:52,228 --> 01:01:54,592
Does your grandmother know
that you're visiting me?

420
01:01:55,728 --> 01:01:57,436
She doesn't know anything,

421
01:01:58,604 --> 01:02:00,312
Fei, why aren't you eating?

422
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:03,352
How long do you plan on staying?

423
01:02:03,768 --> 01:02:05,312
I'm not going back.

424
01:02:07,188 --> 01:02:08,352
Fei,

425
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,188
can I stay with you for a while?

426
01:02:12,852 --> 01:02:14,268
It's not convenient.

427
01:02:18,436 --> 01:02:20,624
This is my cousin,

428
01:02:21,588 --> 01:02:22,676
Long. This is Brother Yong.

429
01:02:23,268 --> 01:02:24,268
Brother Yong.

430
01:02:24,396 --> 01:02:25,896
Just call me Yong.

431
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,688
Let's go.
I'll introduce you to the owner.

432
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,020
Damn, does everybody
from your village look so hot?

433
01:02:59,144 --> 01:03:01,188
I can give up hooking right now.

434
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:03,435
He doesn't do that.

435
01:03:03,436 --> 01:03:06,768
A delicious piece like that
shouldn't be wasted.

436
01:03:06,896 --> 01:03:08,104
Stop the nonsense.

437
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:12,644
Can you find him a place
to stay tonight?

438
01:03:14,352 --> 01:03:15,604
Let me think.

439
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,216
Don't you have to work
during the day?

440
01:03:23,472 --> 01:03:25,440
I haven't had a day off in weeks.

441
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,267
Why are you drinking?

442
01:03:28,268 --> 01:03:30,312
Because you've been ignoring me.

443
01:03:30,436 --> 01:03:32,311
I said I've been busy lately.

444
01:03:32,312 --> 01:03:36,104
If you're busy, I could help you.
I can clean your apartment.

445
01:03:41,896 --> 01:03:43,520
I can also cook for you.

446
01:03:48,188 --> 01:03:50,696
Just because
we're from the same village,

447
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,896
doesn't mean we have to be friends.

448
01:04:03,896 --> 01:04:05,268
Don't drink so much.

449
01:04:34,896 --> 01:04:37,020
You should go find someone else.

450
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:42,268
If it's a question of money,
I can double it.

451
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,644
That's not what this is about.

452
01:05:02,852 --> 01:05:07,020
I've never kissed a man in my life.

453
01:05:09,896 --> 01:05:11,312
Young man,

454
01:05:12,144 --> 01:05:14,476
please consider it destiny.

455
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,436
I'm begging you.

456
01:07:03,852 --> 01:07:05,352
The owner agreed.

457
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:08,604
He'll deduct a month's pay
for the damages.

458
01:07:08,852 --> 01:07:10,895
Just apologize to the customer.

459
01:07:10,896 --> 01:07:13,328
I quit. And I won't pay either.

460
01:07:15,472 --> 01:07:17,824
Are you aware
how Yong pleaded for you?

461
01:07:17,988 --> 01:07:19,736
You think you can just quit?

462
01:07:19,976 --> 01:07:23,188
Do you know how much shit
I put up with every day?

463
01:07:23,312 --> 01:07:25,936
I'm not here
to live this kind of life!

464
01:07:27,976 --> 01:07:30,132
Who doesn't work hard
for their money?

465
01:07:30,728 --> 01:07:34,876
Life is just eating, drinking,
shitting, sleeping and earning money.

466
01:07:37,852 --> 01:07:39,851
If I wanted to live like that,

467
01:07:39,852 --> 01:07:42,019
I could've stayed in the village.

468
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:44,688
Be a tour guide and rip off tourists.

469
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:46,768
I would never have come here.

470
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,352
Why am I here?

471
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,060
For this moldy mattress?

472
01:07:53,476 --> 01:07:56,104
I give half my pay
for this shitty place.

473
01:07:57,728 --> 01:07:58,744
Fei,

474
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:02,268
how can people live like this?

475
01:08:04,228 --> 01:08:06,435
Who knows why we're alive?

476
01:08:06,436 --> 01:08:09,144
You're not in the position
to make demands.

477
01:08:09,396 --> 01:08:10,895
Just think about it.

478
01:08:10,896 --> 01:08:15,936
A dog in a cage
stops barking after a few days.

479
01:08:40,436 --> 01:08:41,476
Fei,

480
01:08:43,976 --> 01:08:47,688
how could you turn out this way?

481
01:08:53,268 --> 01:08:54,728
People like us

482
01:08:55,396 --> 01:08:57,520
can't expect our dream life here.

483
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,688
You should go.

484
01:09:01,228 --> 01:09:02,876
This place doesn't suit you.

485
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:05,228
I think you live a good life here.

486
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,352
If you can make it,

487
01:09:11,812 --> 01:09:13,036
so can I.

488
01:09:16,604 --> 01:09:17,768
Can you?

489
01:09:27,768 --> 01:09:30,560
You want to do it?
So let's do it right now!

490
01:10:01,976 --> 01:10:03,476
If you sell your body,

491
01:10:05,312 --> 01:10:07,476
everybody will look down on you.

492
01:10:08,312 --> 01:10:10,936
You'll be despised
by your family forever.

493
01:10:23,188 --> 01:10:24,728
Selling ​​yourself?

494
01:10:26,812 --> 01:10:29,396
Who doesn't sell themselves
to make money?

495
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,104
My uncle worked in a tannery
all his life.

496
01:10:36,396 --> 01:10:41,144
He ended up with cancer
and died alone far away from home.

497
01:10:45,104 --> 01:10:47,436
Isn't that also selling your body?

498
01:10:51,644 --> 01:10:56,076
Tell that to the cops

499
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,784
when they catch you.

500
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:02,020
Where are you going?

501
01:12:04,352 --> 01:12:06,396
I'll go wherever I want to go.

502
01:14:46,644 --> 01:14:47,728
Fei!

503
01:14:50,228 --> 01:14:52,188
Whether you help me or not,

504
01:14:53,976 --> 01:14:55,896
I've already made up my mind.

505
01:15:17,936 --> 01:15:21,811
He called to say how he loves me,
and he invited me to dinner.

506
01:15:21,812 --> 01:15:23,688
He even booked a private room.

507
01:15:23,828 --> 01:15:26,852
That day I didn't check,
I just let him go.

508
01:15:29,604 --> 01:15:33,828
He said he works for city government
and wanted to support me.

509
01:15:34,268 --> 01:15:38,604
He also said that he could
get me a new job or pay for college.

510
01:15:38,728 --> 01:15:40,312
You're just too stupid.

511
01:15:42,352 --> 01:15:45,728
Then I had to piss really bad
and went to the bathroom.

512
01:15:45,852 --> 01:15:48,104
When I came back, he was gone.

513
01:15:48,228 --> 01:15:49,267
Motherfucker…

514
01:15:49,268 --> 01:15:51,604
- My phone, my wallet…
- You idiot.

515
01:15:52,644 --> 01:15:56,188
Even my expensive sweater and
my fancy lighter, all gone.

516
01:15:56,728 --> 01:15:58,352
Can you believe this guy?

517
01:16:01,396 --> 01:16:04,560
So you are here
to steal food from our mouths?

518
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:06,940
You do your job, I do mine.

519
01:16:07,064 --> 01:16:08,780
Who said anything about stealing?

520
01:16:09,144 --> 01:16:11,187
Have you even done this before?

521
01:16:11,188 --> 01:16:12,936
I bet you're still a virgin.

522
01:16:13,644 --> 01:16:16,519
You need pubic hair down there
for this job.

523
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,936
Do you even have any?

524
01:16:18,144 --> 01:16:19,560
I bet he doesn't.

525
01:16:21,936 --> 01:16:24,688
If you can do it, so can I.

526
01:16:26,688 --> 01:16:28,728
Okay, then show us what you got.

527
01:16:29,312 --> 01:16:30,895
Take off your clothes.

528
01:16:30,896 --> 01:16:33,812
I bet he's too scared
to take off his clothes.

529
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:36,436
Then show us your little brother.

530
01:16:37,268 --> 01:16:40,188
You know what they say,
big talk, small cock.

531
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,520
Strip!

532
01:16:42,324 --> 01:16:45,068
Or do you need me to teach you how?

533
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:48,396
Take it off first.

534
01:16:51,644 --> 01:16:52,976
He's really doing it!

535
01:16:53,352 --> 01:16:54,560
Strip, strip!

536
01:16:58,936 --> 01:17:00,352
Alright, cut it out.

537
01:17:03,644 --> 01:17:06,244
This kid's pretty good, he can stay.

538
01:17:08,668 --> 01:17:10,312
That's not a good idea.

539
01:17:10,688 --> 01:17:12,396
Get dressed, we're leaving.

540
01:19:24,896 --> 01:19:26,144
Thank you.

541
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,060
Babe,

542
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,436
take your clothes off too.

543
01:19:53,896 --> 01:19:55,812
Come help me with the dough.

544
01:20:13,644 --> 01:20:14,852
Babe,

545
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,476
would you mind leaving me alone
with Long today?

546
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,228
Whatever makes you happy.

547
01:21:01,728 --> 01:21:03,312
So, Teacher Fei,

548
01:21:05,352 --> 01:21:07,268
did I behave well today?

549
01:21:12,896 --> 01:21:14,228
It's all fine.

550
01:21:17,768 --> 01:21:20,268
Then why do you seem upset?

551
01:21:26,896 --> 01:21:29,436
No, everything's fine.

552
01:22:22,188 --> 01:22:25,020
Everyone has to die
when their time comes.

553
01:22:27,728 --> 01:22:29,312
If you want to cry, cry.

554
01:22:33,688 --> 01:22:36,560
Sister Lulu,
can you read my palm too?

555
01:22:37,188 --> 01:22:40,020
I'm so beautiful, where's my prince?

556
01:22:40,144 --> 01:22:42,895
Your lines are too complicated.

557
01:22:42,896 --> 01:22:46,604
- You call yourself a beauty.
- Aren't I?

558
01:22:48,268 --> 01:22:50,604
- I'll give you more soup.
- Okay.

559
01:22:54,104 --> 01:22:55,560
Thanks.

560
01:22:56,268 --> 01:22:58,644
When will Fei go home
for the funeral?

561
01:22:58,768 --> 01:23:02,768
- His relatives don't want him there.
- He's not going back?

562
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:07,352
His uncle's family is really cruel.

563
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,728
Okay, come on, let's drink.

564
01:23:11,228 --> 01:23:13,603
I'm not going back this year either.

565
01:23:13,604 --> 01:23:15,643
Why not? You'll be all alone.

566
01:23:15,644 --> 01:23:18,395
I can't stand traveling
during New Year's,

567
01:23:18,396 --> 01:23:22,688
30 hours in a train
and then a bus just to get home.

568
01:23:22,852 --> 01:23:25,935
You're happy to see
your family on the first day.

569
01:23:25,936 --> 01:23:29,435
- Then relatives ask questions.
- Then it starts.

570
01:23:29,436 --> 01:23:32,603
What do you do?
How much do you make?

571
01:23:32,604 --> 01:23:34,519
Have you bought an apartment?

572
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,687
Do you have a fiancé?
Want me to introduce you to one?

573
01:23:36,688 --> 01:23:39,976
Isn't that annoying,
the same questions every year?

574
01:23:40,188 --> 01:23:41,812
That's why I'm not going.

575
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:45,144
When I go home for New Year's,
my stepfather's very good to me.

576
01:23:45,268 --> 01:23:49,156
Every morning he heats my room.
He's afraid I might catch cold.

577
01:23:49,444 --> 01:23:52,744
He tries not to wake me up.

578
01:23:53,184 --> 01:23:54,976
He's crazy about having a son.

579
01:23:55,768 --> 01:23:59,688
When I called him dad
last year, he almost cried.

580
01:24:01,168 --> 01:24:02,187
Heartwarming.

581
01:24:02,188 --> 01:24:03,628
I tell you,

582
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,268
you are one lucky kid

583
01:24:09,268 --> 01:24:10,852
to have such a good dad.

584
01:24:11,644 --> 01:24:14,976
Come, let's toast
to this kid's luck.

585
01:24:16,688 --> 01:24:18,228
To a good dad.

586
01:24:23,604 --> 01:24:25,896
Every time I go back
for New Year's,

587
01:24:26,188 --> 01:24:30,396
my mom starts crying
three days before I leave.

588
01:24:32,352 --> 01:24:33,728
Then I cry too.

589
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:37,636
Once we cry together,

590
01:24:39,268 --> 01:24:41,544
I don't want to leave home anymore.

591
01:24:42,936 --> 01:24:44,520
Don't talk nonsense.

592
01:24:45,188 --> 01:24:46,976
Give me a hug.

593
01:24:59,768 --> 01:25:02,020
Let's have a shot.

594
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:04,604
Yeah, a round.

595
01:25:04,852 --> 01:25:07,604
Does everybody have
something to drink?

596
01:25:09,976 --> 01:25:11,644
You have something, right?

597
01:25:13,476 --> 01:25:15,460
And I'll pour some for myself.

598
01:25:19,728 --> 01:25:21,396
That is my last drink.

599
01:25:24,104 --> 01:25:25,436
I'm pregnant.

600
01:25:28,852 --> 01:25:33,812
After New Year's, Xiangdong and I
will move back to Shandong.

601
01:25:34,852 --> 01:25:36,936
Down it!

602
01:25:38,104 --> 01:25:41,560
Congratulations, Lulu.
You're going to be a mother.

603
01:25:41,768 --> 01:25:43,520
Take care of yourself.

604
01:25:50,396 --> 01:25:53,644
I'll raise my child well
with Xiangdong.

605
01:25:56,396 --> 01:25:58,476
Why don't you say a few words?

606
01:26:15,688 --> 01:26:17,188
We're not coming back.

607
01:26:22,396 --> 01:26:25,644
These six years were
the most important of my life.

608
01:26:26,976 --> 01:26:29,728
I used to want to stay here forever.

609
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:36,268
But now I want to start a real family
with Lulu in Shandong.

610
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,896
But these years with you

611
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:49,268
have been
the most precious in my life.

612
01:27:20,188 --> 01:27:21,560
Xiangdong,

613
01:27:23,436 --> 01:27:24,688
Lulu.

614
01:27:26,852 --> 01:27:28,604
Cheers to you both.

615
01:27:32,228 --> 01:27:34,188
I wish you all the happiness.

616
01:27:36,644 --> 01:27:39,728
And take good care of yourselves

617
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:43,352
in Shandong.

618
01:29:54,768 --> 01:29:55,896
Grandpa,

619
01:29:59,476 --> 01:30:01,560
Fei's here with money for you.

620
01:30:11,044 --> 01:30:13,604
I'm not allowed to come say farewell.

621
01:30:18,352 --> 01:30:19,976
I hope you're not too sad.

622
01:30:32,896 --> 01:30:34,060
Grandpa,

623
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:40,020
Fei's here with money for you.

624
01:30:58,188 --> 01:30:59,812
Isn't it cool?

625
01:31:02,104 --> 01:31:03,936
Where did you get this?

626
01:31:04,104 --> 01:31:05,936
I bought it for us.

627
01:31:06,852 --> 01:31:08,976
You can't waste money like this.

628
01:31:09,728 --> 01:31:13,728
What's the point of earning money
if you don't spend it? Hop on!

629
01:31:21,268 --> 01:31:22,520
Where are we going?

630
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:27,268
I'll go straight ahead,
then turn left,

631
01:31:27,976 --> 01:31:30,852
then turn right,
then maybe turn left again.

632
01:31:31,144 --> 01:31:34,104
- And then I'll spin in circles.
- You're crazy.

633
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:42,228
I may be crazy, but I'm happy.

634
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,852
Fei, what am I to you?

635
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:02,268
You're like a torch in the winter

636
01:32:03,228 --> 01:32:06,136
the blazing flame warms my heart.

637
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,728
Whenever you sneak up near me

638
01:32:10,936 --> 01:32:13,768
the fire illuminates me.

639
01:32:14,312 --> 01:32:18,104
Your big eyes are bright and flashing

640
01:32:18,728 --> 01:32:22,267
like the stars in the sky,
the brightest one.

641
01:32:22,268 --> 01:32:25,768
You are like a torch

642
01:32:25,976 --> 01:32:29,476
the blazing flame warms my heart.

643
01:32:40,604 --> 01:32:45,060
The café is three blocks
from the square

644
01:32:46,436 --> 01:32:51,560
almost the distance
between the neon lights and the moon.

645
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:59,852
In the midst of their struggles,
people comfort and hug each other

646
01:33:00,188 --> 01:33:06,352
searching and chasing,
grasping at fragile dreams.

647
01:33:07,852 --> 01:33:14,436
Here we laugh, here we cry…

648
01:34:03,476 --> 01:34:05,644
This is my wife, Li Yu.

649
01:34:06,768 --> 01:34:08,352
My son, Dabao.

650
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:11,896
Li Yong, Li Yin,
say hi to the uncles.

651
01:34:12,604 --> 01:34:14,976
- Hello, uncles.
- Such good kids.

652
01:34:17,688 --> 01:34:21,852
This is Liang Fei
and his friend Liang Dong.

653
01:34:22,728 --> 01:34:26,312
- Liang Long.
- Hello, Liang Long.

654
01:34:26,768 --> 01:34:28,060
Hello, Fei.

655
01:34:29,852 --> 01:34:32,104
Let's sit down and drink some tea.

656
01:34:32,936 --> 01:34:35,020
I ordered some dim sum too.

657
01:34:36,976 --> 01:34:39,396
Pour some more tea.
Careful, it's hot.

658
01:34:44,852 --> 01:34:48,616
Xiaolai didn't tell me he's married,

659
01:34:48,816 --> 01:34:50,336
we would've brought gifts.

660
01:34:51,104 --> 01:34:54,020
No worries, you're old friends.

661
01:34:55,896 --> 01:34:58,188
He wanted to surprise you.

662
01:35:00,436 --> 01:35:01,896
Right?

663
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:06,168
How do you know each other?

664
01:35:06,396 --> 01:35:07,976
We're family.

665
01:35:09,644 --> 01:35:12,268
- We come from the same village.
- I see.

666
01:35:12,976 --> 01:35:14,936
That means we're family.

667
01:35:15,896 --> 01:35:17,020
No.

668
01:35:18,396 --> 01:35:20,060
So you're very close.

669
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:40,728
Let me go.

670
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:45,560
Let me go!

671
01:35:50,104 --> 01:35:52,396
I know what you're going through.

672
01:36:02,812 --> 01:36:04,436
What do you know?

673
01:36:07,312 --> 01:36:09,188
You don't know anything.

674
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,520
I know you want to repay him.

675
01:36:22,312 --> 01:36:23,896
But you can't.

676
01:36:27,268 --> 01:36:29,020
His leg's already gone.

677
01:37:17,104 --> 01:37:20,188
I think he still loves you a lot.

678
01:37:33,604 --> 01:37:35,144
Don't you care?

679
01:37:43,228 --> 01:37:44,844
I think,

680
01:37:45,936 --> 01:37:50,724
if you were truly loved,

681
01:37:53,268 --> 01:37:57,520
you'd forgive him
for anything, right?

682
01:38:13,852 --> 01:38:15,560
I know your story, Fei.

683
01:38:19,604 --> 01:38:21,476
I think you're a…

684
01:38:24,396 --> 01:38:27,476
Someone who deserves to be loved.

685
01:38:36,352 --> 01:38:37,976
Are you happy?

686
01:38:40,976 --> 01:38:42,560
Do you love Li Yu?

687
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,688
Fei,

688
01:38:47,476 --> 01:38:49,872
do you really think

689
01:38:50,568 --> 01:38:52,652
that you're the only person
I'll ever love?

690
01:39:08,188 --> 01:39:09,812
The past is past.

691
01:39:12,688 --> 01:39:14,496
You should cherish Long.

692
01:39:37,396 --> 01:39:40,560
You shouldn't visit me anymore.

693
01:40:07,268 --> 01:40:08,851
No, frankly…

694
01:40:08,852 --> 01:40:12,852
Brother,
is this too expensive for you?

695
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,976
Real estate is 70,000 to 80,000
per square meters these days.

696
01:40:17,688 --> 01:40:20,103
Pretty boy, lower the price a little.

697
01:40:20,104 --> 01:40:23,228
Why don't you transfer
a little more money for me?

698
01:40:24,312 --> 01:40:26,559
- No, I mean, this money…
- Forget it.

699
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,852
Bye bye.

700
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:39,312
Are you drunk?

701
01:40:42,768 --> 01:40:44,020
No.

702
01:42:01,312 --> 01:42:03,560
I think Long's a very good person.

703
01:42:06,312 --> 01:42:07,688
Yes.

704
01:42:13,976 --> 01:42:15,560
But I don't know…

705
01:42:17,936 --> 01:42:19,768
If I can make him happy.

706
01:42:21,976 --> 01:42:24,852
I don't know
where you learned that nonsense.

707
01:42:26,604 --> 01:42:29,896
If you are happy yourself,
you'll make others happy.

708
01:42:33,812 --> 01:42:35,352
Are you happy?

709
01:42:41,312 --> 01:42:42,852
I'm very happy.

710
01:42:52,396 --> 01:42:54,268
I'm like a spider,

711
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:59,020
weaving my web everywhere
and spreading my love.

712
01:43:00,812 --> 01:43:06,144
I don't let anyone get away
and hold on tightly.

713
01:43:17,104 --> 01:43:19,688
How much hair gel
do you use every day?

714
01:43:20,604 --> 01:43:22,412
To keep it so neat.

715
01:43:25,896 --> 01:43:27,936
Don't be so depressed, smile.

716
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,144
How about it?

717
01:43:36,852 --> 01:43:39,020
Li Yong can call you Uncle No. 2.

718
01:43:40,476 --> 01:43:43,020
And the baby will call you
Daddy No. 2.

719
01:43:43,812 --> 01:43:45,352
Very interesting.

720
01:43:53,604 --> 01:43:55,896
I just wish we could be all happy.

721
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:58,688
We can live together.

722
01:43:59,976 --> 01:44:02,396
Take care of each other
like a family.

723
01:44:03,312 --> 01:44:05,728
You, me,

724
01:44:06,476 --> 01:44:08,060
Xiaolai and his family.

725
01:44:09,476 --> 01:44:10,728
We can.

726
01:44:12,476 --> 01:44:14,188
We can live together,

727
01:44:15,768 --> 01:44:17,396
in a big house,

728
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:22,560
with a yard and a pool.

729
01:44:42,104 --> 01:44:44,060
You really love him that much?

730
01:44:46,812 --> 01:44:48,728
He lost a leg for me.

731
01:44:52,352 --> 01:44:53,560
I could too.

732
01:45:00,268 --> 01:45:02,936
Don't deceive yourself anymore.

733
01:45:03,104 --> 01:45:05,396
You're always living for others.

734
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,312
Do you think
that makes you a great person?

735
01:45:08,768 --> 01:45:10,851
The way you sacrifice yourself,

736
01:45:10,852 --> 01:45:15,188
you constantly hurt yourself
and sometimes others too.

737
01:45:17,104 --> 01:45:19,268
Xiaolai has left the pain behind.

738
01:45:23,104 --> 01:45:24,936
I know that you love me.

739
01:45:27,728 --> 01:45:29,852
We can have a good life together.

740
01:45:31,104 --> 01:45:33,312
We can also live the life we want.

741
01:45:34,728 --> 01:45:36,396
Isn't that good enough?

742
01:45:42,228 --> 01:45:43,812
You are my family,

743
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:46,744
but he's my beloved.

744
01:45:48,476 --> 01:45:50,268
I can't change that.

745
01:46:14,852 --> 01:46:17,520
Do you think
I'm stronger than you are?

746
01:46:21,768 --> 01:46:24,312
Do you think
you can hurt me like that?

747
01:46:29,476 --> 01:46:31,228
I'm like a spider.

748
01:46:32,688 --> 01:46:34,396
Not letting anyone go…

749
01:46:35,268 --> 01:46:36,896
And loving everyone.

750
01:46:40,436 --> 01:46:41,936
Is that so wrong?

751
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:54,852
You devoured me,

752
01:46:57,604 --> 01:46:59,104
that's not love.

753
01:47:18,936 --> 01:47:23,144
- There are still clothes to wash.
- Okay, be right there.

754
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:28,244
The washing machine's ready.
Please sign here.

755
01:47:31,436 --> 01:47:32,976
Okay, thank you.

756
01:47:37,268 --> 01:47:38,768
Thanks.

757
01:47:46,228 --> 01:47:48,976
Will you teach A Yong
how to ride a bicycle?

758
01:47:49,768 --> 01:47:52,020
- Mom, come on.
- Okay.

759
01:47:53,228 --> 01:47:54,768
A Yong, I'm coming.

760
01:47:56,396 --> 01:47:58,396
Open the door!

761
01:48:05,604 --> 01:48:06,768
Fei!

762
01:48:17,976 --> 01:48:19,644
I don't need your pity.

763
01:48:43,976 --> 01:48:46,552
I'm begging you, spare me.

764
01:48:55,268 --> 01:48:56,812
Long's gone.
