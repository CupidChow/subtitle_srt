00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,208
BASED ON THE NOVEL
I MET LOH KIWAN BY CHO HAE-JIN

2
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:05,333
When we land, walk out separately.
Don't crowd together.

3
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:09,916
Once in customs, you'll see a checkpoint.
That's where you'll give your passport.

4
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,500
Try not to act nervous.
Do what they tell you.

5
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,083
But, sir, what if they question all of us?

6
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,541
"I don't speak French, sorry."
That's all you'll have to say.

7
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,541
We're preparing to land.
For your safety, sit down, please.

8
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes, ma'am.

9
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,500
Once you're off the plane, go to gate 3.
We'll meet by the bathrooms.

10
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,125
"I don't speak French."

11
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,750
-Wait, so what do I do, then?
-I don't speak French.

12
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,583
Memorize it.
You could get caught otherwise.

13
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,208
-What do we do if we get caught?
-This is your captain speaking.

14
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,291
We have begun our descent
into Brussels Airport.

15
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,625
Next.

16
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,125
"I don't…"

17
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,500
Please have
your passports ready. Thank you.

18
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,666
Jeon Chun-bong.

19
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,416
Lee Han-gil.

20
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,666
Park Dong-hun.

21
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:44,875
Kim Jeong-sik.

22
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,166
Lee Gwang-cheol.

23
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:59,208
Um, excuse me, comrade.
Where is this place?

24
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,208
I'll drive you. Forty bucks.

25
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,125
I'll pay you when we get there.

26
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,208
Here's the money.

27
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:58,125
I don't know what your story is,
but I don't want any bad luck. Take it.

28
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,583
Call me if you wanna go back to China.

29
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,625
Here's my card.

30
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:23,666
Go.

31
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,208
Please
don't push each other around.

32
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,416
Please stay in the line.

33
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,583
You can't stand there.
Go to the other side.

34
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,708
Come on through.

35
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,666
Next.

36
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,083
Move on, please.
Move on.

37
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,625
Please fill out this form.

38
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,875
Next.

39
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,666
You must attach a copy of your ID.

40
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,833
An ID.

41
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,000
Um, passport, please.

42
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:38,250
A copy of the passport
or another form of ID you have to attach.

43
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,041
Do you… Okay.

44
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,916
Please get some help
from the interpreter, okay?

45
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,875
Mm-hmm.

46
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,125
Yes. Mm-hmm.

47
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,208
You. Help.

48
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,750
Mr. Loh Kiwan?

49
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,791
Hello there.
I'm your interpreter, Kim Gyeong-sil.

50
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:03,708
Oh.

51
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,166
You're in luck today.
You usually have to book in advance.

52
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,583
I'm really glad to help you out.
Shall we go?

53
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,708
-Hello. How are you?
-Hello.

54
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:31,208
"First thing we need to do
is gather some personal information."

55
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:35,125
"Your name, your date of birth,
country of origin, and hometown."

56
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,583
My name is Loh Kiwan.

57
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,666
I was born
December 1st, um, 1990.

58
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:52,708
Camp 7, Hasang Collective Farm, Usi-gun,
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

59
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,083
I was born
in the farm's seventh work unit.

60
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:02,166
I was able to obtain a passport
through a broker my uncle found.

61
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:15,208
"So, Mr. Loh,
you say that you fled to China in 2019

62
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,083
but that you weren't employed
while you were living in Yanji."

63
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:22,000
"How were you able
to afford a plane ticket here to Belgium

64
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,666
and counterfeit a passport?"

65
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,083
Well, uh…

66
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,375
Well, my mother… she…

67
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,416
" Do you mean
your mother gave you the money?"

68
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,916
Mom, why aren't you eating?

69
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,833
I'm not hungry.

70
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,333
Anyway, it brings good luck
when you eat a birthday meal alone.

71
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,416
They say if you do that,

72
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,416
you'll go through your entire life
without ever starving.

73
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:12,500
They say you should eat your noodles whole
if you want to live longer,

74
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,500
so stop breaking your noodles apart, okay?

75
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,916
All right, okay.

76
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,583
Oh, Mom… do you work today?

77
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,291
You know people like to have
warm food on cold days.

78
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,958
That also means more money for you and me.

79
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,125
I know, but I should be the one working.

80
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,708
You do so much for us…
while I spend my days indoors.

81
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:49,916
It's so unfair.

82
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,500
Now, now. It's your birthday,
and I don't mind working.

83
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,291
Besides, all a mother wants is
for her child to be safe and healthy.

84
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,583
I can continue to work for us
until we leave China.

85
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,625
So don't worry.

86
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,666
It's my fault.

87
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,125
I should've turned a blind eye
when the boss was beating up Jeong-jin.

88
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,041
Otherwise, I wouldn't have to be
in hiding like this.

89
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,916
-I'm sorry, Mother.
-Now, don't talk like that.

90
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,958
He would have died
if you didn't intervene.

91
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,041
You did the right thing,
so never apologize for that.

92
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,625
All right, okay.

93
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,791
Don't stay past closing, hmm?

94
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,083
I would leave on time
if it was up to me, but it's not.

95
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,250
I'll see you after work.

96
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,333
Happy birthday, comrade.

97
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,208
Miss!

98
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,166
Yes?

99
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,000
-What would you like?
-A cold one.

100
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,166
Coming right up.

101
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,416
-Hey, that snow sure is wild.
-Hey, comrade!

102
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,666
-You're here!
-Yeah!

103
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,833
Mr. Loh?
This is the last question for today.

104
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,416
"Are you Korean-Chinese

105
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,916
and just pretending
that you are North Korean

106
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
to receive state subsidies
set aside for defectors?"

107
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:11,791
Uh,

108
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,750
I am not.

109
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,791
No.

110
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:22,250
There will be a second interview.
I can fit you in on February 5th.

111
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,416
At three o'clock. I'll jot you down.

112
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,416
I guess I'll see you then.

113
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,083
Um, wait…

114
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,583
You mean February… of next year?
Is that what I'm hearing?

115
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,583
Mmm.

116
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,000
It's just… what am I supposed to do?
I won't be able to work for now?

117
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,208
You'll just have to hang in there.

118
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,083
Where did you say
that restaurant was again?

119
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,291
Oh, just have to go downstairs.
It's on the left.

120
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,291
Ah!

121
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,916
Oh God, baby,
you taste like watermelon.

122
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,041
Come up here.
I wanna taste too.

123
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,250
You will. I'm not done with you yet.

124
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,666
Yeah, right there.

125
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,208
Oh yes. You're so good like that.

126
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,208
Oh yeah.

127
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,541
Oh, hey there, sexy. You wanna join us?

128
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,750
Hey, get out of here!
I said, get out of here, huh?

129
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,250
Get out of here!

130
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,083
Don't kick him out so soon!

131
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,250
I wanna taste of him.

132
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,875
Hey! Let me in!

133
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,500
You idiot! I kicked you out, freak!

134
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,416
Now, where were we?

135
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,291
You missed out.
Maybe next time, pretty boy.

136
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,125
Who's this piece of trash?

137
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,541
Isn't this the one we saw
pissing by the train station?

138
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,666
This one's way shorter.
Makes you look tall.

139
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,916
Shut up, asshole.

140
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,916
Get lost, you beggar.
This is our fire.

141
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,500
-Yeah, get out of here.
-I won't hurt you.

142
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,750
Take your shit
and get the hell out of here!

143
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,708
Sorry, I lied.

144
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,333
Take that, you beggar.

145
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,083
Dirty bastard!

146
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:42,833
Take that, bitch!

147
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:45,750
That's what you get, you dirty hobo!

148
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,583
-Damn, I'm starving.
-Down for a beer?

149
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,958
I never turn down beer.

150
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,416
-I can go for a burger.
-You eat too much.

151
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,791
Hey, hurry up!

152
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,250
I'll ask you one more time.

153
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:33,375
NAME: LOH KIWAN

154
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,291
Is this person here your son?

155
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,166
No, sir.

156
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,291
That's not my son.

157
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,458
Hey there! Officer Lee.

158
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,166
Don't you two know
this lady is Mr. Choi's second cousin?

159
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,500
Mr. Choi?

160
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,875
Oh, come now. You remember.

161
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,750
He gave your wife a ride
that night she got too drunk.

162
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,416
Ah, guess what.

163
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,041
Mr. Choi's son recently was accepted
to Peking University.

164
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:06,500
Mr. Choi was never one for studying.
It's funny, actually.

165
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,875
He barely graduated.

166
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,416
How did a fool like that
raise such a smart son?

167
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,875
Huh?

168
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:17,708
Hey, Ma.

169
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,250
Hey!

170
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,458
Hey, freeze!

171
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,666
Mom, this way!

172
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:38,750
Stop!

173
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:43,750
Stop! There they are!
Stop right there! Freeze!

174
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,375
-Shit!
-Hey!

175
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:47,291
It's through here.

176
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,583
Come on! Get them!

177
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,958
They went that way!

178
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:03,416
Freeze right now!

179
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,666
Mom, no. Over here.

180
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,375
This way!

181
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,125
Almost there, Mom!

182
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:53,791
Mom!

183
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:58,375
Answer me. Mom!

184
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,375
Wake up! Mom!

185
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,916
-She just came out from nowhere.
-Yeah, crazy.

186
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,000
-Ok Hui, wake up.
-Uncle, help me. Please!

187
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,125
-Hey! Hey. Hey, sis.
-Mom, wake up!

188
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:24,291
-Mom!
-Open your eyes. Please!

189
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,250
Hey! Move the car! Hey!

190
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:31,416
Kiwan.

191
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,958
You have to survive, Kiwan.

192
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,833
You'll have to continue on without me now.

193
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,375
You need to go on.

194
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,208
Find a life worth living.

195
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:50,916
Seek refuge…

196
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:54,333
and have a life of your own.

197
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,375
Get up, Ma.

198
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:01,041
You're coming with me too.
You'll be okay, huh?

199
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,291
You can't be here. They'll catch you.

200
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,583
I'll stay here with your mother.
Don't get caught.

201
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:09,916
Someone help us!

202
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,666
We'll all die if you get caught!
Get out of here!

203
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:14,833
Go, son.

204
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,416
Go!

205
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,250
-Go!
-Hey, there here! I found them.

206
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,708
Over here!

207
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:25,583
-This way!
-Kiwan, you can't get caught!

208
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,875
-Please, just go!
-Coming through!

209
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,416
-You have to leave.
-Move, people.

210
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:34,083
Hurry, Kiwan.

211
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,541
Move out of the way!

212
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,375
He doesn't speak English or French.

213
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:38,083
Can we get an interpreter?

214
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,000
Okay.

215
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,291
I'm calling
from Schaerbeek Police Station.

216
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,833
You posted bail for Ms. Marie Lee, right?

217
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,458
She is suspected of theft.

218
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:56,416
Hold on.

219
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:58,500
Ma'am.

220
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,583
You don't need to come.

221
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:04,458
Just send the settlement money.

222
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:12,125
Listen to me. How many times
do I have to tell you don't come here?

223
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:25,125
Excuse me. Hello, comrade.

224
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:29,666
My wallet. Can you please give it back?

225
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,125
What wallet?

226
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:35,666
I have no idea.

227
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:45,375
Listen, comrade. I know, uh… you took it.

228
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,750
So please give it back to me, huh?

229
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,541
Did you spend everything in it?

230
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:53,458
Did you?

231
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,250
I did. Why?

232
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,125
What else
was I supposed to do with it, hmm?

233
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,416
Well, that wallet…

234
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:13,458
My mother, uh…

235
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,958
The wallet is all I have left of her.

236
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,416
The money that you stole from me,

237
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,208
I obtained it…

238
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,083
from selling my mother's body.

239
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:32,333
So please tell me where my wallet is.

240
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,500
This is a plane ticket
to fly to Belgium tomorrow.

241
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:41,916
This money,

242
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,125
where did you get it?

243
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,833
Huh?

244
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,250
Your mother's body was, um…

245
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:59,041
was sold to a hospital.

246
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,833
My mother was sold?

247
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:13,166
What are you talking about, Uncle?

248
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,916
Uncle?

249
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:21,208
Listen, your mother wanted this.

250
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:24,708
I showed her the money
so she knew how much her life was worth.

251
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,416
She agreed to this.

252
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:31,625
It was… her final gift.

253
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:55,083
-Let go of me, Uncle.
-Kiwan, don't.

254
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,083
Stop! Let go!

255
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,791
Let go! Let me die!

256
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,250
Leave me alone!

257
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,041
Give it here! Let me die!

258
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:07,125
Uncle, let go of me.

259
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,041
Stop.

260
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,375
What are you doing?

261
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,750
Get a grip, Kiwan.

262
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,208
Your mother wanted you to survive!

263
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:20,333
You can't die, you hear?

264
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,125
Do it for your mother's sake, okay?

265
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:24,958
Do you hear me?

266
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:31,208
Don't let
your… mother's death be in vain.

267
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,375
You need to get out of here.

268
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Get on that plane and never look back!

269
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:39,500
Promise me you will!

270
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,875
Promise me!

271
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,750
I need to know that you'll be okay, Kiwan.

272
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,875
Tell me you understand!

273
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,958
Kiwan.

274
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,458
Kiwan.

275
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,500
I'm sorry.

276
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,541
Mom, I'm sorry.

277
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:51,416
Mom! Mom!

278
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,000
You want your wallet?

279
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:23,500
I need your help.

280
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:29,250
Tell them that I stole… only 30 bucks,
and you can have your wallet back.

281
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,750
You really are shameless, aren't you?

282
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,875
You want me to lie for you
after what you did?

283
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,083
I've got a record.

284
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,333
I won't get locked up for just 30 bucks.

285
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:45,375
A thief should go to jail.
It's exactly where you belong.

286
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:50,250
I can't get your wallet if I'm locked up.

287
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:54,583
Just help me.

288
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:59,291
I'm hoping
you can help confirm his identity

289
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,000
and the exact amount stolen.

290
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:03,125
Okay.

291
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:05,250
All right.

292
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,750
Just a moment. I'll put him on.

293
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,416
Good afternoon to you too.

294
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,958
Loh Kiwan is my name, yes.

295
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,625
Yes.

296
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,041
It was American dollars.

297
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:32,708
About $30. Thank you.

298
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:36,750
Yes.

299
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,125
Thank you.

300
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:42,666
We'll make it quick.

301
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:44,750
Let's go.

302
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,916
Just go home and wait.
I'll get it for you later.

303
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,416
I don't have a home to go to.
So let's go now.

304
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,041
Well, give me your number,
and I'll grab it for you tomorrow.

305
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:57,083
You think I'd trust a thief?
I want my wallet back.

306
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:58,708
We'll go together.

307
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,208
Marie. Marie!

308
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:13,833
Uh, sir, wait a minute.
Sorry, I'm Marie's father. Can we speak?

309
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,291
I heard you're from North Korea.

310
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,666
This is for you.
It's not much, I'm afraid.

311
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,291
-It's just-- Don't make a scene.
-What are you doing?

312
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,333
I'm just trying to help you here.

313
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:30,083
It's only a small amount, but…

314
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,375
-Stop!
-Stop, Marie.

315
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,333
-Stop acting like you're a good person!
-Can't we talk for a moment?

316
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,083
I've got nothing to say to you.

317
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:46,708
Seriously.

318
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:52,166
Are you coming or not?

319
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:11,083
Hey, just wait here.

320
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,666
Oh, that's a good one.
You know I don't trust you.

321
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,291
-I'm coming too.
-Stay here! Do as I say.

322
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,166
Give me ten minutes.

323
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,333
Please give me a bit more time.

324
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:34,208
Goddamn it!

325
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,666
I told you not to move.

326
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:38,791
Don't knock over the apple.

327
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh, Marie, you're here.
Hey, riddle me this.

328
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,583
How do I avoid shooting
the journalist in the head?

329
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,541
Please just give me more time.

330
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:53,166
Is there a problem with my stance?
What do you think?

331
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,250
You aim too long.

332
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:00,041
Shoot within three seconds of aiming.
Don't hesitate.

333
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,333
Is that right?

334
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,291
This isn't my specialty.

335
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,958
I only set the targets.

336
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,750
But you shoot them.

337
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:30,125
Remember the wallet I gave you yesterday?
Well, I need it back.

338
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,458
Marie, you're terribly predictable.

339
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:35,750
It's almost cute.

340
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:48,041
-Don't touch me!
-Shut up!

341
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:52,666
Give us a moment.

342
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,625
I expected this.

343
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,125
You stole it, didn't you?

344
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:02,958
It's none of your business.

345
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,416
Don't steal money to pay me back.

346
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,958
Work for me until your debt is paid.

347
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:14,083
I told you I quit.

348
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,416
I think that's my decision.

349
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:24,958
Next Wednesday, two-on-two with the Dutch.
Win and I'll give you this money back.

350
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,458
And the wallet.

351
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,416
Tell them I shoot from 25 meters.

352
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:39,166
They're gonna ask for 50,
but say no, okay?

353
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:40,875
Okay.

354
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,500
Let's get outta here.

355
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,416
Hey, wait. Where's my wallet?

356
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,916
I'll get it next week.
You have to wait longer.

357
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:01,750
Is this all a big joke?
You're lying to me again, aren't you?

358
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,333
I'm not lying, all right?

359
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:05,666
Your wallet's with a friend.

360
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:09,625
Shit.

361
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:11,166
Hey!

362
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,916
Last round.
We've gotta get to work soon.

363
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,500
All right, next round.

364
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:25,083
You know those guys.
They're all about money.

365
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,208
Like you, right?

366
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,416
Ah, shut up.

367
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,833
-What the hell?
-What's his deal?

368
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:33,375
I want my wallet.

369
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:36,333
-Give me my wallet!
-Fuck off.

370
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:40,416
-Hey, get up. Come on, let's go.
-Aren't they just two of a kind?

371
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,125
What's going on?
What's with all the noise?

372
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:47,250
Why are you still here?

373
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,750
Oh, I see.

374
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:54,375
So you're the "friend" she mentioned, huh?

375
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:56,583
Stay right there.

376
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,166
You and I need to talk.

377
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:02,708
Let me go! Let go! Stop it!

378
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,458
-Shit!
-Kiwan.

379
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:14,166
If we don't leave, they'll kill you.
This won't solve anything.

380
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,500
Let go of me!

381
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,125
You can trust me. I promise.

382
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:21,666
I'll get your wallet. I swear I'll get it.

383
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:01,250
Come over here.

384
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,375
You have to remember
that you're in a foreign country,

385
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:13,500
so you better keep that temper of yours
in check. Got it?

386
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,250
Yeah, well, you're one to talk.

387
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,250
When did you come to Belgium?

388
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:40,625
When I was young.

389
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,083
When did she pass away?

390
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,166
Your ma.

391
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,916
The 2nd of last December.

392
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:54,125
2:15 in the morning.

393
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,583
So you must feel lonely this time of year.

394
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:03,416
My mom also died in the winter.

395
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,000
Have you found any work here?

396
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,833
I recycle bottles for money.

397
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:17,583
I make just enough not to die.

398
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:23,750
I know it's not too fancy,
but at least I don't steal.

399
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:24,958
Okay, trash king.

400
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:29,125
No one's going to give me any work.
I don't exist here.

401
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,625
ILSIM EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

402
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,875
Hey. Call here.

403
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:49,958
The boss there is a Korean guy.
Say Lee Youn-sung sent you.

404
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,291
Lee Youn-sung?

405
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,958
Yeah, the man outside the station today.

406
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:58,250
Oh. Do you mean your father?

407
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:02,583
Why can't I say you sent me?
Why must it be your father?

408
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,416
Well, do whatever you want.
I'm nobody though.

409
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:18,791
Hey, I was just thinking.

410
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,750
I'm worried
that I'll embarrass your father.

411
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:28,750
My clothes are gross… and I smell.

412
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,666
I'm not presentable.

413
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:44,250
Change into these.

414
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,750
Well now. This is different.

415
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:12,875
So when should I bring
these back to you, then?

416
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:16,583
Just keep them.
They don't belong to anyone.

417
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:20,166
I have more in there. Want them?

418
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,583
No. It's okay. I'm good.

419
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,875
Whoever hurt your lip,
you should stay far away from him.

420
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:37,416
You deserve better than that.

421
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:40,333
Hurting a woman's face is disgraceful.

422
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:43,416
Any man who'll do that once
is sure to do it again.

423
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,416
Oh.

424
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:59,625
You made me a promise. Don't forget.

425
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,541
CHOI RYUK-MYUNG, MALE
DOB: DEC. 1, 1990, HEALTHY

426
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,833
Ch… Choi Ryuk-myung?

427
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:18,250
Yeah.

428
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:20,333
That's your name now. You're a new man.

429
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,375
It can be complicated
to find work for North Koreans.

430
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:28,750
So when we're there, we'll tell everyone
that you're Chinese-Korean.

431
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:30,083
Ah, of course.

432
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,333
Thank you so much, comrade.

433
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,750
Don't mention it.

434
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,166
Did the money I sent come through?
It's been two days.

435
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:03,500
Hey!

436
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,458
Hey, I've gotta go.

437
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:08,666
If you have any trouble,
Seon-ju will help you out.

438
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,125
-She's actually Chinese-Korean.
-Thank you.

439
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:14,458
Take good care of him, Seon-ju.

440
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:25,250
All right. Let's go in.

441
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:58,458
Who brought that idiot here? Seriously.

442
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,125
Hey, comrades! I'm trapped in here!

443
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,583
Please open the door!

444
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:32,416
Comrades! I'm sealed in here!

445
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,833
Comrades, help! Someone please let me out!

446
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,250
If you press this button,
the door will open from the inside.

447
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:00,375
The green button. Do you understand?

448
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,666
Yes.

449
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,416
-I was right, so pay up.
-I was so close.

450
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,875
You owe me, dog.

451
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:10,916
Beat it! Go to work!

452
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,625
-Go to work!
-Sure, Mom.

453
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:15,916
-What the fuck did she say? Walk away.
-Hey, man, just calm down. Get a grip.

454
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,750
Those bastards all decided to place bets
on how long you'd be stuck in the freezer.

455
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:21,791
-Huh.
-They like to play tricks on the newbies.

456
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:23,083
But just ignore them.

457
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:25,166
Go and do the rest now.

458
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:27,166
Okay.

459
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:28,083
Damn, those guys at work
sure are infuriating. They're assholes.

460
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:32,708
They do that to every newbie.
Trap them in that freezer as a sick joke.

461
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:34,625
It's not personal, just so you know.

462
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:43,583
What's wrong? Is the meat
not good enough for you, or what?

463
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:46,041
Why would someone with a job steal food?

464
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,583
That meat doesn't belong to either of us.

465
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:55,291
Listen, this shoebox apartment
is 200 a month,

466
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:56,958
and the bus is 50 bucks or more a month.

467
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:59,416
My money's completely gone
by the time I need to buy any food.

468
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,166
So, in my eyes, this is what's fair.

469
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,250
You know how they pat us down
when we all head home?

470
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:13,958
Well, it turns out they wouldn't dare
pat down a woman's chest.

471
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:16,666
So it'd be dumb of me not to steal.
That's how I see it.

472
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:27,083
I do it all for them.
My kids are my whole world.

473
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:29,666
The one in the middle
looks so mischievous.

474
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:34,125
He looks like a general.
So military with his shaved head.

475
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:35,708
That's my daughter.

476
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:39,208
She's needed brain surgeries,
so we've had to shave her head.

477
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:41,458
-Ah…
-It's no big deal, hmm?

478
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:43,833
The poor kid still has
one more surgery though.

479
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:48,916
Afterwards, I'll be able to braid her hair
and send her off to school.

480
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,000
Well, uh, she's very brave.

481
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:01,333
Thank you. I think I'm pretty full.
The rest of it's yours.

482
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:03,000
Comrade, eat more meat.

483
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,333
You have it.

484
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:06,916
Actually, I'm sick of meat.

485
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,708
The smell gets to me
since we're surrounded by it all day.

486
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:13,500
And stop saying comrades.
Don't you wanna blend in?

487
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:16,541
If you keep saying comrades,
everyone will know you're not from here.

488
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:32,333
Who's got time for love? Not me.

489
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,541
I see the same guy every night.

490
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:38,041
Look, there he is, catching the bus!

491
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:39,958
That's the guy I was telling you about.

492
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,833
Let's get away this weekend.
Wanna meet up?

493
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,666
Well, I really want to,
so let's go later.

494
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:57,500
Ah. Yeah, he's a simp.

495
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:08,125
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for today's main event.

496
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:11,000
The women's target shooting spectacular
is about to begin,

497
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:13,666
so please grab your drinks
and find your seats!

498
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:18,041
First up is
the international sensation herself,

499
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:20,208
hailing all the way from the Netherlands,

500
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,125
Julia!

501
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,833
Tonight, she's facing off against
the pride of Belgium,

502
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:28,958
our very own Marie!

503
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:33,291
Each player will take one practice shot

504
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,583
before we begin
the first match of the set.

505
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:38,000
You have one minute until betting closes.

506
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:41,041
So hurry up, everyone,
and make your choice!

507
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,458
Marie, what is it?

508
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:45,166
What is this?

509
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,583
-Were you never planning to tell me?
-Just give it here.

510
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:51,958
You killed her?

511
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:53,916
Euthanasia?

512
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:56,250
So Mom didn't just die, then.

513
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,083
-You were the one who killed her.
-I can explain everything, Marie.

514
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:03,833
Just listen to me for once, hmm?

515
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,583
-It's not what you think
-Why did you lie to me?

516
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:14,541
-Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
-Your mom wanted this.

517
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:17,666
She knew you wouldn't have
been able to handle this.

518
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:20,333
Don't you dare put this on her!
You know that's not it, huh?

519
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:24,166
You knew that I wouldn't let her
go through with it.

520
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:26,583
So you did it while I was training.

521
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:29,375
Marie, listen. It wasn't like that.
I promise, okay?

522
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:30,666
It wasn't like that.

523
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:32,791
Just let me explain.

524
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:37,000
Don't panic, ladies and gentlemen.

525
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:40,083
In the meantime,
here's some info for tonight's drawing.

526
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:42,500
You each should have a ticket.
Turn them over.

527
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:45,583
-You should see a number there, right?
-Give me five minutes.

528
00:56:46,166 --> 00:56:47,916
I haven't done this in a while.

529
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,083
After tonight's game,
we'll do a raffle drawing.

530
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:52,000
I hope you're all excited.

531
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:54,708
Who's ready to see
some more grade-A shooting?

532
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,458
You're trembling like a terrified puppy.

533
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:34,250
All right, folks,
that was the end of the fourth match.

534
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:37,375
It's now time to wait
as the scores are tallied.

535
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:39,125
Will we have a winner now,

536
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:41,625
or will we continue on to a fifth round?

537
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:45,083
Without further delay,
let's now reveal Marie's results.

538
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,500
Forty-eight points!

539
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:49,791
It's a tie!

540
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:52,291
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

541
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:53,625
Here you go.

542
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:56,041
Four!

543
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,083
Three!

544
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:58,625
Two! One!

545
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:02,041
That's it, ladies and gentlemen.
Betting is now closed.

546
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,500
Here we go!

547
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:18,750
Now Marie.
Will she break under pressure?

548
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:21,500
Or will she shoot her way to victory?

549
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:23,125
Let us see!

550
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,583
All right!

551
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:51,958
And now let's see her final score!

552
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:55,583
10.4! What an incredible finish, my God!

553
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:58,750
By two tenths of a point,
Marie is the winner!

554
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:00,083
She had her eye on the prize!

555
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:02,375
Make some noise for Marie!

556
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:08,541
Marie! Marie! Marie!
Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie!

557
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,166
Fuck yeah!

558
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,375
Didn't I tell ya you'd win?

559
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:24,250
Did you see the look on Gerd's face?
I think he fell in love with you.

560
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:27,916
He said he won't pull out his investment.

561
00:59:28,541 --> 00:59:30,833
You should see him before you go.

562
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:32,833
I've got somewhere to be.

563
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:36,083
Are you kidding? Hmm.

564
00:59:36,583 --> 00:59:38,416
I've been trying
to get him here for years.

565
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:41,375
We need him to help expand our business.

566
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:45,541
Listen, I won. Just give me the wallet.

567
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,250
I should go.

568
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:17,041
Eat with me.

569
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,500
Have you eaten yet?

570
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:22,250
What?

571
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:25,833
Can I please borrow some of your meat?

572
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:28,250
-Are you sure? I stole it.
-Yes, yes, thank you.

573
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:35,333
-Thank you. You're kind, comrade.
-Mm-hmm.

574
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,666
Comrade, comrade.

575
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:11,833
Do you need something else?

576
01:02:11,916 --> 01:02:12,916
Any lettuce?

577
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:35,875
Utensils.

578
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,000
Ah…

579
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:39,875
I brought you some bowls, too,
just in case.

580
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:42,416
-Uh…
-Just don't forget to wash it all, okay?

581
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,083
Thank you, comrade.

582
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:15,291
Why are you standing? Sit down.

583
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,875
Eat it while it's hot.
I know it's not much.

584
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:26,208
Did you buy all this?
Where'd you get the money?

585
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:28,250
I didn't have to buy it. It was all free.

586
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:29,583
Huh?

587
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:36,041
It's not from the trash, so don't worry.

588
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:40,708
Early in the morning, by North Station,
they give us free food.

589
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,666
I go by every day
and pick the things I want.

590
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:52,333
I'll get going.

591
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:54,000
All right.

592
01:04:58,166 --> 01:04:59,333
Don't walk me out.

593
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:02,583
I want to. It's dark outside.

594
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:10,125
-Tea? Who wants some tea?
-Huh? What's going on?

595
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:11,541
Wow, it's 9:00 already?

596
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:15,875
My neighbor offers tea at night.
He does this every night around 9:00.

597
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:19,625
-Tea! Anyone want tea?
-Let's have some. I'll leave after.

598
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:22,083
No, wait, hold on.
Don't. Don't go quite yet.

599
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:25,416
Tea, everyone! Nice and hot!

600
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,333
I'm not allowed to have guests.
He can't know that you're here.

601
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,000
We'll have to wait.

602
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:32,833
Okay, okay, that's enough.

603
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:34,666
Careful now, it's hot.

604
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,083
Quiet.

605
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:40,541
Come one, come all! I have tea!

606
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:46,916
Get your tea!

607
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,958
Nice and hot! Come and get it.

608
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:52,000
It's ginger with a touch of citrus.

609
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:53,125
Get your tea.

610
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:01,125
Hey, do you want any tea tonight, Kiwan?

611
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:07,500
Cut it out! You're too loud!
Stop your racket!

612
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:09,375
He's trying to rest! Huh?

613
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:13,375
What a bitch.

614
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:22,875
Last chance! Get your tea!

615
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,416
All right, I'm leaving! Last chance!

616
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,166
Last call for tea!

617
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:39,250
No one? Anyone?

618
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,500
We will start recording now.

619
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:51,291
This photo here is from 1997.

620
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,541
It was May Day.

621
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:57,250
We had joined a delegation
that went to Pyongyang to celebrate.

622
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:00,333
It's my mother and I.

623
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,875
She held me in her arms
at Kim Il Sung Square.

624
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,208
"The photos
will be submitted as evidence."

625
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:13,333
"And after we scan them for you,
we'll return it to you."

626
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,625
"Uh, we also contacted
Cheonsim Hospital,

627
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:25,583
which you had mentioned
during your first interview."

628
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,916
"The hospital stated, unequivocally,
that they've never been involved

629
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,916
with the purchase or sale
of corpses or body parts at any point."

630
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:43,083
They're lying. The buying and selling
of bodies happens secretly underground.

631
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:46,833
It's not the sort of thing
the hospital would admit to, right?

632
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:57,875
"You'll have to
prove your nationality some other way."

633
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:00,000
"At this time,
you won't receive refugee status

634
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:02,541
because you can't prove
you defected from North Korea."

635
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:07,000
Didn't I tell you
everything you asked me?

636
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,083
Why would I lie to you two?
You don't believe me?

637
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:23,875
"I'm sorry.
It's difficult to believe your statement

638
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:26,333
about your mother's body
being sold illegally

639
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:27,750
to Cheonsim Hospital."

640
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:30,708
"And since there's no proof
backing up your claim

641
01:08:30,791 --> 01:08:32,625
that you really are a defector
from North Korea,

642
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,208
we won't be able to help you."

643
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:35,916
Mmm.

644
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,416
"Lastly, if we rule
that the photo you provided

645
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,875
fails to constitute as valid evidence,

646
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:43,000
you'll have to go."

647
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:45,833
"You will be
forcibly repatriated to China."

648
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:54,041
You're saying I'll be deported?

649
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:06,666
Hey, do it again.
The meat still has fat on it.

650
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,833
Cut around the sides.

651
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:10,083
Hey, comrade.

652
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:13,708
How can you tell
if I'm really North Korean?

653
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:16,291
Well, for one,
you always say comrade when talking.

654
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,291
And, uh, just the way you look.

655
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:20,666
Koreans have
a totally different bone structure.

656
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,375
Comrade Seon-ju…

657
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,500
Uh, never mind.

658
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:39,083
Hey, what's on your mind, huh?

659
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,250
Just spit it out.

660
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:45,625
Hey, what is it, hmm?

661
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:51,916
Do you think you might speak on my behalf
down at the courthouse?

662
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:55,041
I think it might help
if I had a witness by my side.

663
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:58,791
Of course I can. That's no big deal.

664
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,291
-Do you mean that? Huh?
-Yes!

665
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:03,083
You'd really come, comrade?

666
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:04,541
For sure.

667
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:06,375
Oh, great.

668
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,750
And besides, I really need good karma soon

669
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,041
'cause my daughter
is about to have surgery.

670
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:15,208
Thank you, comrade.

671
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:18,291
Hey, if I end up getting refugee status,
it will all be thanks to you.

672
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:20,916
Hey, if you wanna pay it forward,
then get me something.

673
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Lately, I've been craving for fish.
You got that?

674
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:25,166
Okay, you got it.

675
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:27,041
What would you like?

676
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:29,083
Sea bream? Two? Okay.

677
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,375
Oh.

678
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:43,750
-My beer.
-Oh, pardon me.

679
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:46,125
-What did you do to my beer, huh?
-Sorry.

680
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,208
Hey!

681
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:49,041
This asshole dropped my beer.

682
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:52,250
What the hell, man?
Hey! Tough guy! What's this?

683
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:54,708
-Give that back.
-Want it back? Then come get it. Huh?

684
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:57,250
Do you like it? Do you like it?
You wanna go, huh?

685
01:10:57,916 --> 01:11:01,125
Here, take it. Get outta here!

686
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:03,583
-Go home!
-Yeah.

687
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:08,958
-You owe me a beer.
-Buy me a beer!

688
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:11,166
Oh!

689
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:16,041
The fuck, man? Look what you did.

690
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:17,791
-You're not gonna get away with this.
-Hey!

691
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:19,541
-We need help! He's hurt!
-Hey!

692
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:22,958
-Call the police! You're dead.
-God!

693
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:25,500
-Get the police! We need help!
-Help us, somebody!

694
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:26,833
My husband is getting attacked!

695
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:29,625
-Help! This guy's crazy!
-Oh no! Someone call the cops!

696
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,500
Help him!

697
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,916
Someone please call an ambulance!

698
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:43,541
I told you I'm not going. Stop calling me.

699
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:50,458
Marie, did you recommend
someone to the factory by chance?

700
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,000
So what if I did, hmm?

701
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:57,750
What a monstrosity!

702
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:00,541
He came out of nowhere
and lunged at my husband.

703
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:02,583
And he attacked him for no reason!

704
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:05,708
Miss, you're next.

705
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:12,791
Uh, Loh Kiwan.
He was in the assault from last night.

706
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:15,083
-Are you a relative or his lawyer?
-No.

707
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:16,833
Then, no, I can't let you visit him.

708
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:21,541
-I just wanna see his face for a moment.
-It's not possible, miss.

709
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:26,625
-So what'll happen to him, then?
-He'll have three days to file an appeal.

710
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:29,500
If he doesn't,
the deportation process will begin.

711
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:31,500
Or, if you want, you can pay his bail.

712
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:37,041
-Shit!
-Calm down, miss.

713
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:39,166
May I remind you this is a police station?

714
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:42,875
Hey.

715
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,500
You're a police officer, right?

716
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:48,375
-This is insane.
-Please calm down, miss.

717
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:49,583
Hey, I'm not finished.

718
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:55,500
If he's deported,
then you're condemning him to die.

719
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,125
Be a police officer, huh?

720
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:59,458
Carry out justice!

721
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,958
Marie.

722
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:23,208
Wait a second.

723
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,500
Go. I have things to do.

724
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:42,000
Here, take this.
He's a trusted friend. A good lawyer.

725
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:45,833
I heard that you've been
undergoing refugee screening.

726
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:47,916
I think he could
really help out your case.

727
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:49,875
Oh, thank you.

728
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,708
This means so much to me… sir.

729
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:55,833
I have one request, however.

730
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:58,125
Yes, please go ahead, sir.

731
01:13:58,208 --> 01:13:59,333
My daughter.

732
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:04,583
She's a very vulnerable girl.
I really want her to get better.

733
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:09,000
She needs someone strong.
Someone who can support her.

734
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:13,291
Not someone
who's just as unstable as she is.

735
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:17,125
Uh, excuse me, sir--

736
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:19,541
I don't think
you should see my daughter anymore.

737
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:22,916
You have too much going on in your life.

738
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:27,166
Staying in this country
is your only top priority, Kiwan.

739
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:18,041
Hi, Kiwan.

740
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:20,833
-So today's the big day.
-Are you ready?

741
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:23,583
-Yes.
-You'll be great.

742
01:15:32,125 --> 01:15:33,125
TRIBUNAL OF BRUSSELS

743
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:35,333
During his first interview two months ago,

744
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:37,791
Mr. Loh, uh, provided specific information

745
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:40,708
that a North Korean citizen
would only know.

746
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:44,250
However, his request
was contested shortly after,

747
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:45,833
claiming insufficient proof.

748
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,541
Can you explain this lack of proof,

749
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:49,708
as it was the reason
that this request was denied?

750
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:54,375
The hospital to which Mr. Loh here
claims to have sold his own mother's body

751
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,916
denies this obscene and false accusation.

752
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,916
The prosecution doesn't believe
her body was sold.

753
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,250
The two photos Mr. Loh provided
were confirmed to be of Pyongyang, yes,

754
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:05,583
but they could have been taken
by Chinese travelers on vacation.

755
01:16:05,666 --> 01:16:08,875
We believe these photos fail
to prove Mr. Loh's claim

756
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:11,041
that he is indeed a North Korean national.

757
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:12,500
Therefore, insufficient.

758
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:15,291
Furthermore, Mr. Loh claims
to have lived in the city of Yanji…

759
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:17,958
The prosecution doesn't believe
you have enough evidence…

760
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:20,916
According to our investigation,
there is nothing to support this story.

761
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,333
…so we may need to provide
stronger proof for your claim.

762
01:16:23,416 --> 01:16:25,083
Have the witnesses arrived?

763
01:16:43,416 --> 01:16:45,416
The résumé Mr. Loh provided

764
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:48,416
was indicative he was from Yanji, China.

765
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,166
I didn't have a reason to doubt him,

766
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,333
so he was introduced as Chinese
at the factory.

767
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:56,291
Did Mr. Loh identify himself to you
as a Chinese-born ethnic Korean

768
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:57,666
and not as a defector?

769
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,625
Sir, please take your time answering.

770
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:02,416
We just want you
to recall all of the events properly.

771
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:06,833
Yes. That's exactly what he said.

772
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,875
-Sir, you're lying.
-Silence, sir.

773
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,333
-Calm your client.
-Pardon.

774
01:17:11,833 --> 01:17:13,166
Mr. Loh. Mr. Loh.

775
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:15,250
Let's hear them out.

776
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:18,416
I now call Ms. Kim Seon-ju.
Please step forward.

777
01:17:24,041 --> 01:17:27,083
I see you worked alongside Mr. Loh
over at the factory.

778
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:32,416
Were you aware Mr. Loh applied
for North Korean refugee status?

779
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:36,291
Please take your time answering, Ms. Kim,
and please remember you're under oath.

780
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:39,791
The testimony that you give
will be used as evidence in this hearing.

781
01:17:39,875 --> 01:17:41,000
You may proceed.

782
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:44,208
Your Honor. Yes, I was aware.

783
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:48,458
There are many people who are mixed
Korean and Chinese who take advantage

784
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:51,541
by saying they are defectors
from North Korea when they aren't.

785
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,791
They pretend to be North Korean defectors
immigrating for refugee benefits.

786
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:57,916
I suspected Mr. Loh might be one of them.

787
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:01,750
Do you know Mr. Loh's Chinese name?
What is it?

788
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:06,166
Ms. Kim, please tell us
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

789
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:10,000
Choi Ryuk-myung.

790
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:12,166
"Cui Liming," what we say in Mandarin.

791
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:26,000
Choi Ryung-myung?

792
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:29,666
You know that's not my real name.

793
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:35,583
So why did you lie up there?

794
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,625
Tell me, comrade.

795
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,250
Betraying me like that, was it worth it?

796
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:45,166
You told me the other day…

797
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:49,416
that it was obvious that I'm North Korean.

798
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:52,041
I wanna know why.

799
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:01,333
I deserve to know why.

800
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,541
-What are you doing, Kiwan?
-Comrade.

801
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:04,958
Kiwan, let go!

802
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:06,583
Tell me!

803
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:12,708
Why'd you do it?

804
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:16,958
Why did you do that to me?

805
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:19,416
Kiwan!

806
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,041
Kiwan, you're… you're hurt. Let go.

807
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:01,166
What do you want?

808
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:04,583
Did you leave something here?

809
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:06,166
Uh, no.

810
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,208
I just…

811
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:15,791
You can't just show up here
out of nowhere.

812
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:34,666
Start preparing for your next match.

813
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:38,583
Gerd will be there.
We need him to work with us.

814
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,541
You came here just to say that?

815
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:55,541
-Coaches are supposed to be tough, Marie.
-Stop breathing down my neck.

816
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:05,583
I don't need your shit anymore.
I'm fine without drugs these days.

817
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:07,416
It sure didn't seem like that last time.

818
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:13,625
Listen to me.

819
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:15,291
I don't give a fuck about your refugee!

820
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:18,125
But do as I say!
You still need to pay your debt to me.

821
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:20,541
So you better stay within my sight,
you got that?

822
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:22,333
You're mine.

823
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,250
FREE

824
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:23,000
Gerd put down three million on you.

825
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:26,750
If we can double that,
that's half our debt all paid off.

826
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:30,333
I rigged the game.
You're guaranteed to win.

827
01:23:31,416 --> 01:23:32,791
So just have fun out there.

828
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:43,416
Chloe! Chloe!

829
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
The tension is palpable, folks!

830
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,166
Now it's time for Chloe's last shot!

831
01:23:54,916 --> 01:23:56,125
8.2 for Chloe!

832
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,291
Nice work, Chloe!

833
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:02,750
Hey! Learn to shoot!

834
01:24:28,041 --> 01:24:29,541
What the fuck?

835
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:33,375
What a disaster!
She missed the entire target.

836
01:24:33,458 --> 01:24:34,791
What just happened, folks?

837
01:24:35,458 --> 01:24:38,541
In this unprecedented event,
Chloe wins the match!

838
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:41,708
Now, please, folks, calm yourselves!

839
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:45,125
Please don't throw anything!
Folks, please restrain yourselves!

840
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:48,500
Where the hell
do you think you're going, huh?

841
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,208
You're on your own from now on.

842
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,791
Listen, you won't survive out there
without me. You're nothing!

843
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:57,375
No.

844
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:00,041
You're wrong.

845
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:05,750
Damn it!

846
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:32,958
Kiwan, hey.

847
01:25:33,666 --> 01:25:35,833
Hey, listen to me, Kiwan. Wait!

848
01:25:35,916 --> 01:25:37,916
Before the trial,
a person from the refugee office

849
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,500
came to the factory.

850
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:42,750
They said they would shut us down if
they learned your documents were forged.

851
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:46,375
So that's why we let you take the fall
for everyone else's sake.

852
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:50,041
He said I wouldn't get my visa renewed
if I didn't lie about everything.

853
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,958
My, um, my daughter's operation
is very soon,

854
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:54,625
and she relies on my wages.

855
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:57,416
In the end, it turns out
he didn't even renew my visa.

856
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,250
What do you want me to say to you, hmm?

857
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:02,250
Oh, that's too bad.
It must've been hard for you.

858
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:04,458
No, hey! Don't go!

859
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:07,291
I just really want to apologize to you.

860
01:26:09,083 --> 01:26:12,291
I'm being deported soon.
I got caught without a visa.

861
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:15,041
I'll be back in China with my children,

862
01:26:15,125 --> 01:26:18,208
so I don't think I will ever be
in Belgium again, so, uh…

863
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,791
I had to see you before I leave.

864
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:25,750
I'm so sorry… comrade Loh Kiwan.

865
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:05,625
I heard back from
a well-known defectors' advocacy group.

866
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:12,416
They'll submit a statement of support,
and they'll even attend your next trial.

867
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:15,458
This will definitely help
increase your credibility, I believe.

868
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:19,041
Don't give up hope yet, okay?

869
01:27:20,625 --> 01:27:21,500
Okay.

870
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:24,750
Would you like something to drink?
A juice or coffee?

871
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,375
Juice, please.

872
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:36,250
IN MEMORY OF LEE JEONG-JU

873
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:40,666
DAUGHTER: LEE MARIE

874
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:56,666
What are you doing here?

875
01:27:57,625 --> 01:28:01,583
Once I found out this was happening today,
it felt wrong not to come.

876
01:28:04,166 --> 01:28:06,250
So I'd like to pay my respects
by helping out.

877
01:28:20,541 --> 01:28:23,333
My wife left us all
three years ago, as you know.

878
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,041
This will be my family's
last public memorial service.

879
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:33,333
Moving forward,
we will get together privately

880
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:36,250
to honor her and her legacy.

881
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:41,708
Marie.

882
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:46,583
Got a good turnout, I see.

883
01:28:47,666 --> 01:28:48,583
Marie.

884
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:53,375
Ah…

885
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:57,541
Everyone's so dressed
and eating such nice food,

886
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:59,416
all for someone that's dead.

887
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,750
What does this accomplish?

888
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:06,166
Go be sad at home.

889
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:09,500
Why do this when it's all just
one big show for you, huh?

890
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,125
What?

891
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:18,916
Are you afraid people might
point fingers if they knew what you did?

892
01:29:19,416 --> 01:29:20,416
Stop this!

893
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,416
Stop what?

894
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:27,458
Stop what, Dad?

895
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:31,750
What did I do? What?

896
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,208
I told you to stop! You need to leave!

897
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:35,791
Ah!

898
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:41,750
Listen! Because of your actions that day,
I no longer have a mother. She's dead.

899
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:43,166
Put that down right now.

900
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,583
Do you know what you did?

901
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:48,416
I died a long time ago. Understand?

902
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,416
I understand, hmm? Now give me that!

903
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,208
Get the fuck away!

904
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:58,958
Stay away from me! Don't you ever dare
tell me what to do anymore, okay? Okay?

905
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:43,083
Marie, open the door, please!
Marie!

906
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:51,333
Marie! Marie!

907
01:31:00,833 --> 01:31:03,625
The floor is like jelly.
Will I fall?

908
01:31:06,291 --> 01:31:09,541
The floor is wobbling.
It's too damn much.

909
01:31:10,875 --> 01:31:12,250
It's jelly!

910
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:14,416
I'm seasick.

911
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,750
Just sit down. Standing is bad shit.

912
01:31:16,833 --> 01:31:20,458
Yeah, just sit. Nice.
Who is this guy?

913
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:23,416
Huh? What?

914
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,458
-Who is this clown?
-You're here.

915
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:29,708
Is the circus in town?
Where'd you come from?

916
01:31:29,791 --> 01:31:32,625
-I came from the North.
-This you on vacation? Oh, Marie.

917
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:35,791
Want a vacation?
This will take you far away.

918
01:31:35,875 --> 01:31:37,000
Good girl.

919
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:39,791
Hey! Are you insane?

920
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:40,833
Crazy bastard!

921
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:46,458
Marie.

922
01:31:46,541 --> 01:31:48,541
Marie.

923
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:50,500
Marie, give it to me.

924
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,208
Let go!

925
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:57,666
Shit. Shit.

926
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:59,791
Fuck off! You don't get to stop me!

927
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:07,708
-Marie!
-Let go!

928
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:08,625
Stop this!

929
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:12,208
Do you want to die?
Is that what you want, huh?

930
01:32:12,291 --> 01:32:13,291
No.

931
01:32:14,125 --> 01:32:15,916
If I die, I can't do drugs.

932
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:18,250
Why would I throw this all away?

933
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:20,458
If you wanna die,

934
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:22,708
then be my guest.

935
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:33,250
Hey, wait.

936
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:35,500
That's not yours! Give it!

937
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:38,416
Oh shit!

938
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:45,166
That's mine!

939
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:06,416
Hey, Kiwan.

940
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,375
Hey!

941
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:14,500
Hey, what's wrong? Spit it out!

942
01:33:14,583 --> 01:33:15,791
Spit it out!

943
01:33:15,875 --> 01:33:17,375
Kiwan, I said spit it out!

944
01:33:17,916 --> 01:33:18,875
Oh God!

945
01:33:19,416 --> 01:33:21,333
Hey.

946
01:33:21,416 --> 01:33:23,041
Kiwan, please wake up!

947
01:33:31,166 --> 01:33:32,041
Nicky!

948
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:34,416
Open up! Open the door!

949
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:35,541
Nicky!

950
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:40,041
I need the… antidote!

951
01:33:40,583 --> 01:33:43,291
Hurry, get it! Hurry and get it!
Please hurry! Get it!

952
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:48,583
Please, please.

953
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:05,708
Hey, Kiwan.

954
01:34:07,583 --> 01:34:08,708
Are you okay?

955
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:14,208
You're…

956
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,416
You really are something.

957
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:19,166
Why do you do…

958
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:22,166
…that kind of stuff?

959
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:24,708
I was so worried about you.
Why did you do that?

960
01:34:27,416 --> 01:34:28,416
I'm sorry.

961
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:31,458
It's my fault.

962
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:34,791
I kept pushing you away.

963
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,541
You're all bark but no bite. That's it.

964
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:42,166
You like to pretend you're cruel,
but you're not.

965
01:34:43,916 --> 01:34:46,166
Behind that tough act is a sweet girl.

966
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:49,750
Marie.

967
01:34:51,541 --> 01:34:53,791
If you ever take drugs again,

968
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,000
I'll do what I just did.

969
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:59,125
I'll do it again.

970
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:03,958
If you ever try to hurt
or destroy yourself,

971
01:35:04,958 --> 01:35:07,500
I'll follow you to hell
and drag you out myself.

972
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:11,916
I'll help you find the light.

973
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,333
You go that?

974
01:36:24,583 --> 01:36:25,875
What is this of?

975
01:36:26,375 --> 01:36:28,250
It was my mom's favorite flower.

976
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:31,416
Hmm.

977
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:35,166
Well, it's pretty.

978
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:41,375
What happened here?

979
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:43,250
Well,

980
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:48,083
when my mother… and I
ran from North Korea…

981
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:56,041
we both, um… we both carried
razor blades in our clothes.

982
01:36:57,166 --> 01:36:58,375
Why?

983
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:01,458
Just in case the police

984
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:06,291
tried to send us back there.
We both would have rather died.

985
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:11,208
It was our backup plan.
We always carried them with us.

986
01:37:13,166 --> 01:37:14,791
So, on both our left wrists,

987
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:18,083
we ended up having
a few attempts together.

988
01:37:27,333 --> 01:37:28,250
Marie.

989
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:30,541
Listen.

990
01:37:34,666 --> 01:37:37,375
When I was living in China,
I broke the law.

991
01:37:37,458 --> 01:37:41,083
I got involved in a fight at work.
I should've ignored it.

992
01:37:43,083 --> 01:37:45,750
The police were looking for me,
so I went into hiding.

993
01:37:47,166 --> 01:37:48,166
Ultimately…

994
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:53,583
that circumstance led
to my mother's death.

995
01:37:56,666 --> 01:37:58,500
So, does someone like me…

996
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:04,083
deserve to be happy despite what happened?

997
01:38:11,083 --> 01:38:13,000
I ask myself the same question.

998
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,041
I'm like you.

999
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:24,083
We might think we don't deserve a lot.

1000
01:38:28,416 --> 01:38:30,166
But at least we have each other.

1001
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,000
And that's enough for me.

1002
01:38:59,541 --> 01:39:02,041
Uh, Marie, isn't this

1003
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:04,958
a little too much? I feel overdressed.

1004
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:07,125
A little overdressed is all right.

1005
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,458
Like a true Belgian, hmm?

1006
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:13,125
Mmm! How about that?

1007
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:17,500
-Don't do that. There's people outside.
-Just kiss me!

1008
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:18,541
-Mr. Loh.
-Kiss me back!

1009
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:19,708
-Uh, ah…
-Mr. Hyeok.

1010
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:23,541
Here. This just came from China.

1011
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,375
-Really?
-You should open it and take a look.

1012
01:39:25,458 --> 01:39:27,958
Uh… Thank you so much.

1013
01:39:28,458 --> 01:39:29,583
I'll leave you two.

1014
01:39:29,666 --> 01:39:31,291
Oh, no…

1015
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:37,958
KIM SEON-JU

1016
01:39:39,958 --> 01:39:40,916
Open it.

1017
01:39:51,458 --> 01:39:52,958
I've spent the past few days

1018
01:39:53,041 --> 01:39:55,750
going to all the newspaper archives
in Yanji.

1019
01:39:56,833 --> 01:39:58,916
I asked for all the newspapers
from last winter

1020
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,500
and brought them home with me.

1021
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:03,125
My kids and I read so many newspapers

1022
01:40:03,208 --> 01:40:05,500
that our fingertips
turned black from the ink.

1023
01:40:07,291 --> 01:40:09,416
My youngest, the one with the shaved head,

1024
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:12,333
just learned to read,
and she found this article.

1025
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:15,166
I knew right away
that this story was about you.

1026
01:40:16,833 --> 01:40:19,375
NORTH KOREAN WOMAN RAN INTO
SLIDING TRUCK ON SNOWY ROAD, DEAD

1027
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,791
Comrade Kiwan,

1028
01:40:25,583 --> 01:40:29,083
I know I can't undo what I did to you,
and I don't expect forgiveness,

1029
01:40:29,625 --> 01:40:32,666
but I hope that this will help your case.

1030
01:40:33,833 --> 01:40:36,875
Like your mom said,
you have to survive, comrade.

1031
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:49,250
-Oh, good. Look, they're here.
-I see.

1032
01:40:49,333 --> 01:40:50,500
-No, also…
-Ms. Gi Soon?

1033
01:40:50,583 --> 01:40:52,291
Hello, so good to see you.
How have you been?

1034
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:53,541
-Good. And yourself?
-Good.

1035
01:40:53,625 --> 01:40:54,791
-Glad to hear.
-Oh, you too.

1036
01:40:54,875 --> 01:40:56,958
-Thanks for coming today, everyone.
-Yes, thank you.

1037
01:40:57,041 --> 01:40:58,708
And here's Mr. Loh Kiwan.

1038
01:40:58,791 --> 01:41:00,875
Oh my goodness. Hello, sir.

1039
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:03,000
It truly is an honor to meet you,
Ms. Gi Soon.

1040
01:41:04,041 --> 01:41:05,541
I've read all your articles.

1041
01:41:05,625 --> 01:41:08,750
Oh, you're too kind.
I still don't know how I get published.

1042
01:41:08,833 --> 01:41:11,375
I love your work.
They made me cry, actually.

1043
01:41:11,458 --> 01:41:14,750
Oh, but I wrote them to make you smile.
You shouldn't cry.

1044
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:16,875
Come over here.

1045
01:41:18,375 --> 01:41:19,458
I'm busy right now.

1046
01:41:19,958 --> 01:41:22,583
If you knew how much your stunt cost me,
you'd shut your mouth.

1047
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:25,500
Did you really think
you'd get away with it?

1048
01:41:26,083 --> 01:41:28,125
I swear, Marie, this is your last chance.

1049
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:30,708
Get your ass over here.

1050
01:41:31,708 --> 01:41:34,041
Unless you wanna see a bullet hole
in your lover's skull.

1051
01:41:34,125 --> 01:41:35,208
Oh, my, my.

1052
01:41:36,083 --> 01:41:37,833
Thank you
for everything, comrades.

1053
01:41:40,083 --> 01:41:41,041
Any time.

1054
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,458
You have endured so much.
You've done well.

1055
01:41:44,541 --> 01:41:45,916
Oh, thank you, comrade.

1056
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,208
-Glad to help.
-Oh.

1057
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:49,791
Thank you for your support.
I appreciate it.

1058
01:41:49,875 --> 01:41:51,208
We'll always be here.

1059
01:41:52,125 --> 01:41:53,125
-Excuse me.
-Of course.

1060
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:55,625
I'm really sorry,
but someone is waiting for me.

1061
01:41:56,708 --> 01:41:57,625
What's going on?

1062
01:41:58,208 --> 01:42:00,333
So I forgot
that the plumber was coming by.

1063
01:42:00,416 --> 01:42:01,958
-It seems I have to run home now.
-Oh.

1064
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:10,333
So promise me you won't worry.
I'll return before the trial ends.

1065
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:13,291
Okay. Just hurry back when you're done.

1066
01:42:13,375 --> 01:42:14,666
Mm-hmm. I'll be quick.

1067
01:42:17,125 --> 01:42:20,500
But back then,
when they originally broke away from us…

1068
01:42:20,583 --> 01:42:22,666
We gather here today
for the second trial

1069
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:25,208
in the case between the Kingdom of Belgium

1070
01:42:25,291 --> 01:42:27,458
and Mr. Loh Kiwan.

1071
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:29,125
This article right here

1072
01:42:29,208 --> 01:42:31,833
was originally published
in a local newspaper in China

1073
01:42:31,916 --> 01:42:35,708
in the small town of Yanji,
on December 5th of last year.

1074
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:39,875
It describes the unfortunate death
of a North Korean defector.

1075
01:42:39,958 --> 01:42:42,041
She was struck by a bus
late during the night.

1076
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:45,083
The accident described
in this newspaper article

1077
01:42:45,166 --> 01:42:47,041
completely corresponds in perfect detail

1078
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:50,541
with the story Mr. Loh recounted
in his first interview.

1079
01:42:50,625 --> 01:42:54,791
The photo he provided of his mother
is clearly the woman in the paper.

1080
01:42:55,375 --> 01:42:56,500
I now call Loh Kiwan.

1081
01:42:56,583 --> 01:42:58,500
Can you state your name
for the court, please?

1082
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,916
My name is… Loh Kiwan.

1083
01:43:25,125 --> 01:43:26,541
Don't touch me!

1084
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:35,541
Give me the conditions
for your next match.

1085
01:43:35,625 --> 01:43:36,625
I'll have my girl ready.

1086
01:43:36,708 --> 01:43:37,750
What's happening?

1087
01:43:50,083 --> 01:43:50,916
No need.

1088
01:43:53,333 --> 01:43:54,541
What do you mean?

1089
01:43:54,625 --> 01:43:55,666
Your girl,

1090
01:43:56,291 --> 01:43:59,166
I don't want her for just… one season.

1091
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:03,041
The player… for your debt.

1092
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,166
She aimed at "zero," and you are screwed.

1093
01:44:08,666 --> 01:44:12,000
She shouldn't be wasted
at such a small-time shop as this.

1094
01:44:12,916 --> 01:44:14,333
She's out of your league.

1095
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,083
That will be better

1096
01:44:19,041 --> 01:44:20,458
for her too.

1097
01:44:24,875 --> 01:44:25,916
Please don't do this.

1098
01:44:41,458 --> 01:44:42,833
You piece of shit.

1099
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:44,833
It's over for you.

1100
01:44:46,916 --> 01:44:50,416
Mr. Loh
then applied for refugee status

1101
01:44:51,541 --> 01:44:54,500
as a North Korean defector
sometime last December.

1102
01:44:54,583 --> 01:44:56,250
As his case was being reviewed,

1103
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:59,458
he started a new job
but using Chinese papers.

1104
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:03,875
You'll see the evidence of these acts
on page three of Mr. Loh's case file.

1105
01:45:17,791 --> 01:45:19,791
Mr. Loh, sit down, please.

1106
01:45:19,875 --> 01:45:21,583
Uh, Mr. Loh, what are you doing?

1107
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:26,541
I need to go. Sorry, Mr. Hyeok.

1108
01:45:26,625 --> 01:45:28,375
-Why?
-Marie needs me.

1109
01:45:28,458 --> 01:45:29,500
Mr. Loh, you can't just--

1110
01:45:29,583 --> 01:45:31,333
Sir, sit down, please.
Return to your seat!

1111
01:45:46,083 --> 01:45:47,791
Get the rest of the cash
from the safe.

1112
01:45:48,291 --> 01:45:50,541
-Get armed and ready. They're coming.
-Got it.

1113
01:45:54,041 --> 01:45:55,541
Marie, we've gotta move fast.

1114
01:45:56,833 --> 01:45:58,666
We both need to leave the country
right now.

1115
01:46:00,083 --> 01:46:03,000
-Why would I go with you?
-You're my player. You belong to me.

1116
01:46:04,041 --> 01:46:05,208
We're a pair.

1117
01:46:05,291 --> 01:46:08,208
That means… they'll look for you too.

1118
01:46:08,291 --> 01:46:10,166
His men will be here any minute.

1119
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:12,458
So we need to get out of this country.

1120
01:46:13,958 --> 01:46:15,000
Listen to me!

1121
01:46:15,583 --> 01:46:16,750
I'm not going with you.

1122
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:18,708
I don't belong to you!

1123
01:46:19,458 --> 01:46:20,875
You'll be safe with me.

1124
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:24,375
A place in Amsterdam will take us in.
I've already made the arrangements.

1125
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:26,458
We can start our own shooting parlor there

1126
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:28,625
without someone like Gerd
always butting in.

1127
01:46:28,708 --> 01:46:31,250
It'll be different this time.
It's an opportunity.

1128
01:46:31,333 --> 01:46:32,541
You don't have a choice.

1129
01:46:37,291 --> 01:46:38,750
You really are a monster!

1130
01:46:40,875 --> 01:46:43,208
You're right, Marie.
I'm a complete monster.

1131
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:46,833
But this fucking world made me a monster.

1132
01:46:46,916 --> 01:46:48,041
I can't help it!

1133
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:50,833
How about I give you a real taste of it?

1134
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:53,375
Marie!

1135
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,208
Marie! Marie!

1136
01:46:57,333 --> 01:46:58,416
Marie! Marie!

1137
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,666
Fucking bastard!

1138
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:03,041
Don't touch him!

1139
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,458
Get off of me!

1140
01:47:04,541 --> 01:47:05,416
Stay down.

1141
01:47:10,541 --> 01:47:12,000
Get away from him!

1142
01:47:12,583 --> 01:47:13,791
I said get away!

1143
01:47:22,541 --> 01:47:23,416
Marie.

1144
01:48:17,833 --> 01:48:19,375
What are you waiting for? Come on, huh?

1145
01:48:20,916 --> 01:48:22,000
Don't hesitate.

1146
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:24,333
Just shoot.

1147
01:48:49,125 --> 01:48:50,041
Let's go.

1148
01:48:52,625 --> 01:48:54,291
Marie!

1149
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,083
Gerd is dead.

1150
01:49:38,041 --> 01:49:39,041
Understood.

1151
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:41,583
I'll get the girl and bring her to Berlin.

1152
01:49:47,375 --> 01:49:48,583
Where is the girl?

1153
01:49:52,583 --> 01:49:54,041
You can go fuck yourself.

1154
01:50:11,416 --> 01:50:12,625
Marie.

1155
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:18,708
You're… you're safe. Don't worry, okay?

1156
01:50:19,458 --> 01:50:20,416
Huh?

1157
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:30,583
Marie.

1158
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:34,333
Hear me out. You can't stay here.

1159
01:50:42,958 --> 01:50:44,125
They'll look for you.

1160
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,041
If you want to be free from those men,

1161
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,125
leave Belgium forever.

1162
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:56,125
You need to call your dad.

1163
01:50:56,958 --> 01:50:58,708
He'll take you to the airport today.

1164
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:00,583
And what about you?

1165
01:51:02,291 --> 01:51:04,041
I can't leave without you, Kiwan.

1166
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:05,416
Huh?

1167
01:51:07,250 --> 01:51:09,458
I still don't have citizenship, so, uh…

1168
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:14,916
I can't come and go as I please just yet.

1169
01:51:17,375 --> 01:51:18,708
But you already knew that.

1170
01:51:29,541 --> 01:51:31,750
All of this is my fault.
I ruined everything.

1171
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:41,000
We were in such a good place,
and now it's all over.

1172
01:51:48,166 --> 01:51:49,250
That's not true.

1173
01:51:51,875 --> 01:51:53,375
What we have is too strong.

1174
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:56,375
Nothing can tear us apart.

1175
01:52:04,916 --> 01:52:06,916
Listen, what if I told you…

1176
01:52:10,458 --> 01:52:13,750
the best thing to happen to me
was stealing your wallet, huh?

1177
01:52:16,166 --> 01:52:17,333
When I first met you,

1178
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,666
I was about ready to give up.

1179
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:23,833
I kept going just to see your face again.

1180
01:52:27,583 --> 01:52:29,708
But you made me believe life was worth it.

1181
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:35,500
You're the reason I'm still here, Kiwan.

1182
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:43,250
Your father once said to me…

1183
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:47,833
I wasn't strong enough to be with you.

1184
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,583
His words were like daggers in my heart.

1185
01:52:55,291 --> 01:52:56,875
I felt unworthy of you.

1186
01:53:03,083 --> 01:53:04,791
But that's when I promised myself…

1187
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,875
I would become the person you needed.

1188
01:53:12,791 --> 01:53:14,791
A guy that would always be there for you.

1189
01:53:18,541 --> 01:53:20,666
So I vowed to prove your father wrong.

1190
01:53:22,833 --> 01:53:24,375
You mean a lot to me, Marie.

1191
01:53:25,666 --> 01:53:26,583
Hmm.

1192
01:53:29,041 --> 01:53:30,250
So someday soon…

1193
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:33,833
we'll be together again.

1194
01:53:48,166 --> 01:53:49,083
He's here.

1195
01:54:07,666 --> 01:54:08,708
Hop in the back.

1196
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,208
Oh, yeah. Uh…

1197
01:54:57,041 --> 01:55:00,083
So, uh, call me as soon as you land
to tell me you're safe.

1198
01:55:07,458 --> 01:55:08,625
Loh Kiwan,

1199
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:10,791
that young man…

1200
01:55:11,833 --> 01:55:13,500
Turns out he's a special guy.

1201
01:55:15,166 --> 01:55:17,416
Looking back,
I wish I was a little bit nicer.

1202
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:21,583
Please forgive me.

1203
01:55:28,583 --> 01:55:30,500
There was a time when Mom got worse.

1204
01:55:34,208 --> 01:55:36,458
So she would ring a bell
when she needed help.

1205
01:55:37,166 --> 01:55:38,875
I wanted to ease her pain,

1206
01:55:38,958 --> 01:55:41,375
but at the same time,
I couldn't bear to look at her.

1207
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:43,541
So I…

1208
01:55:46,875 --> 01:55:49,583
sometimes wished
she would fall asleep and never wake.

1209
01:55:52,875 --> 01:55:54,333
I felt so guilty for that.

1210
01:55:56,375 --> 01:55:58,666
And though I tried to hide it, she knew.

1211
01:56:00,166 --> 01:56:01,583
After she died, um…

1212
01:56:04,083 --> 01:56:06,166
I blamed myself for what happened to her.

1213
01:56:11,583 --> 01:56:13,291
You should have woken me up, huh?

1214
01:56:19,583 --> 01:56:20,666
There you go.

1215
01:56:29,375 --> 01:56:30,375
Please.

1216
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,250
Please let me go.

1217
01:56:36,375 --> 01:56:38,041
I just lie around all day…

1218
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:42,708
and wait to die.

1219
01:56:42,791 --> 01:56:44,916
It's unbearable to go on like this.

1220
01:56:47,875 --> 01:56:48,875
I can't go on.

1221
01:56:52,333 --> 01:56:54,291
-Jeong-ju, I, uh--
-My love.

1222
01:56:56,708 --> 01:56:59,625
I'm making you and Marie
miserable each day.

1223
01:57:00,666 --> 01:57:02,666
I don't want to live like this anymore.

1224
01:57:05,333 --> 01:57:07,958
Make sure that Marie
will never know the truth.

1225
01:57:11,541 --> 01:57:14,333
Don't let her know
I chose to leave her like this.

1226
01:57:16,375 --> 01:57:19,291
And promise me that she won't know
you were involved.

1227
01:57:23,958 --> 01:57:25,666
I don't want Marie

1228
01:57:26,875 --> 01:57:28,875
to feel like this was all her fault.

1229
01:57:28,958 --> 01:57:29,916
She can't know.

1230
01:57:32,083 --> 01:57:34,166
Otherwise, it would completely ruin her.

1231
01:57:42,583 --> 01:57:46,125
I'm sorry, and, uh, just know
that, no matter what, I still love you.

1232
01:57:49,541 --> 01:57:50,500
I love you.

1233
01:58:05,208 --> 01:58:06,125
You ready?

1234
01:58:08,333 --> 01:58:09,333
Let's get going.

1235
01:58:10,291 --> 01:58:12,750
We kindly request
that you move through screening

1236
01:58:12,833 --> 01:58:16,125
as soon as possible to avoid any delays
in getting to your flight.

1237
01:58:20,291 --> 01:58:21,750
Don't worry about me, Marie.

1238
01:58:22,541 --> 01:58:25,291
Just leave and don't look back. Hmm?

1239
01:58:28,208 --> 01:58:30,583
Hey. Don't cry over this.

1240
01:58:31,416 --> 01:58:33,875
Don't worry. Things will work out, okay?

1241
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:36,375
You know…

1242
01:58:38,375 --> 01:58:40,583
I still don't even have a picture of us.

1243
01:58:42,916 --> 01:58:45,000
I didn't get to travel anywhere with you.

1244
01:58:47,166 --> 01:58:49,375
And what if this really is goodbye for us?

1245
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:02,541
-Marie.
-Hmm?

1246
01:59:03,708 --> 01:59:04,666
One day,

1247
01:59:06,166 --> 01:59:08,000
we'll get to travel anywhere we like.

1248
01:59:08,083 --> 01:59:09,083
Hmm?

1249
01:59:10,875 --> 01:59:11,875
Look over there.

1250
01:59:13,541 --> 01:59:14,500
Turn around.

1251
01:59:19,583 --> 01:59:20,791
Madagascar.

1252
01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:23,250
I will take you there one day.

1253
01:59:24,541 --> 01:59:26,500
And we'll see those trees and turtles.

1254
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:28,416
Also,

1255
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,416
we'll go to Greece, Morocco, Turkey.

1256
01:59:36,208 --> 01:59:37,041
Okay?

1257
01:59:38,083 --> 01:59:40,833
We will travel
all over this crazy world together

1258
01:59:42,125 --> 01:59:43,375
till our shoes are worn.

1259
01:59:43,916 --> 01:59:45,583
Yeah, until our feet hurt.

1260
01:59:49,166 --> 01:59:50,166
How's that sound?

1261
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:53,416
Hmm?

1262
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:58,791
Don't cry, Marie, or I'll feel sad, huh?

1263
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:10,250
I love you.

1264
02:00:23,791 --> 02:00:24,708
It's time.

1265
02:01:21,416 --> 02:01:23,916
ONE YEAR LATER

1266
02:01:48,041 --> 02:01:49,541
FROM LOH KIWAN

1267
02:01:55,916 --> 02:01:59,791
I vowed to survive
no matter what hell I faced.

1268
02:02:00,833 --> 02:02:01,750
Christelle Conil?

1269
02:02:01,833 --> 02:02:04,250
It wasn't easy, but I kept my vow.

1270
02:02:04,333 --> 02:02:05,166
Three for lunch?

1271
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:06,166
I've made it this far.

1272
02:02:10,666 --> 02:02:13,208
I fought with everything I had
to gain the right

1273
02:02:13,291 --> 02:02:14,958
to live and work in Belgium,

1274
02:02:16,833 --> 02:02:18,250
and I finally earned

1275
02:02:19,625 --> 02:02:20,625
the right to stay.

1276
02:02:34,833 --> 02:02:36,416
-Thanks for everything
-Thank you.

1277
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:37,541
We'll miss you.

1278
02:02:38,541 --> 02:02:40,291
But I've come to understand

1279
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,166
that the few rights and protection I have
under refugee status…

1280
02:02:47,458 --> 02:02:51,166
will disappear the moment
that I step off Belgian soil.

1281
02:03:14,875 --> 02:03:16,041
Since you were young,

1282
02:03:17,291 --> 02:03:20,708
I've always believed
that the color blue suited you best.

1283
02:03:22,750 --> 02:03:24,166
Comrade, you look great.

1284
02:03:57,916 --> 02:04:01,583
My life has been like a weathering storm,
barely making it out.

1285
02:04:02,125 --> 02:04:03,791
Do I have in me to keep going?

1286
02:04:05,583 --> 02:04:07,833
I asked myself hundreds of times.

1287
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:10,958
And every time,

1288
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:13,791
I answered,

1289
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:17,458
I'll go through
as many storms as I have to.

1290
02:04:19,333 --> 02:04:21,083
Uh, may I see your ID?

1291
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:29,250
RESIDENCE PERMIT
LOH KIWAN

1292
02:04:33,083 --> 02:04:34,125
Thank you.

1293
02:04:35,458 --> 02:04:36,458
Uh…

1294
02:04:37,666 --> 02:04:39,583
Would you like a round-trip ticket?

1295
02:04:42,083 --> 02:04:42,958
No.

1296
02:04:44,333 --> 02:04:45,416
One way, please.

1297
02:04:46,083 --> 02:04:48,291
In the end, I realized my wish was

1298
02:04:49,125 --> 02:04:50,875
never to live in a country but

1299
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,166
the right to leave it whenever I wanted.

1300
02:04:55,750 --> 02:04:58,375
That is still… my wish.

1301
02:06:34,041 --> 02:06:38,916
MY NAME IS LOH KIWAN
