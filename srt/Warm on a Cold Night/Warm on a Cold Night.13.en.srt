He seems to come from hell.

157

He came to take revenge on everything in this world.

158

Walking in the dark.

159

00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,830
I want to know too.

177
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,490
Qiyuan Stone.

178
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,130
Can I entrust you

179
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,180
with this matter?

180
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,240
Certainly you can.

181
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,250
But, let me make it clear in adavance that

182
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,010
this clue might not have anything to do with

183
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,070
the case you are looking into.

184
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,380
It does not matter.

185
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,320
But, if Xu Youdao

186
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,480
is not the murderer,

187
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,250
then I was off the scent.

188
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:44,990
What are you afraid of?

189
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,360
Don't you still have your partner?

190
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,410
How about this?

191
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,550
I will continue

192
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,820
to find the murderer who

193
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,180
painted the three scars on the wolf's head.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,560
Is it okay for you to be in charge of investigating Xu Youdao?

195
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,170
Okay.

196
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,570
Then I will go first.

197
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,670
Is it a must that

198
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,290
I have to give in to that girl?

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,580
Alright, stop crying.

200
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,090
This candy is for you.

201
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,040
The candy is delicious.

202
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,730
Really?

203
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,490
Yes.

204
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,390
It's delicious.

205
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,800
Here.

206
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,690
Thank you.

207
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,000
Be careful.

208
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,790
We had been asking around for the whole afternoon,

209
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,480
and the information we gathered is all about there.

210
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,770
Hence, I figured it out that

211
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,540
Xu Youdao and Wang Jirong have been brothers

212
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,920
since their childhood.

213
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,920
They never have conflict over neither women

214
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,320
nor money.

215
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,410
As for Wang Jirong,

216
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,170
he had been doing bad things since he was a child,

217
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,570
but in this studio, Xu Youdao

218
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,430
is the most sympathetic to him.

219
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:05,880
Jun.

220
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,240
Do you remember one of

221
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,810
Wang Jirong's disciple saying

222
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,810
he was still in the studio

223
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,760
the day before yesterday.

224
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:13,800
The following day,

225
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,840
nobody saw him.

226
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,960
That's true.

227
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,790
So,

228
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,520
it took only twelve hours

229
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,880
for him to be found after going missing.

230
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,020
On this particular day,

231
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,400
Xu Youdao was in the painting studio during the day

232
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:32,810
and only went out for

233
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,940
three hours at night.

234
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,580
We apprehended him the next day

235
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,760
when he returned.

236
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,340
If he is the murderer,

237
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,490
then only these three hours

238
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:42,990
are available.

239
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,620
However, during these three hours,

240
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,040
he also visited Cuiyan Brothel.

241
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,900
How did you know?

242
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,640
I noticed it on him

243
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,410
when I arrived here yesterday–

244
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,970
it was the scent of the Cuiyan Brothel.

245
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,070
I also know that he has

246
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,650
a special side room in the Cuiyan Brothel,

247
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,800
which is dedicated to painting.

248
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,580
So...

249
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,440
So?

250
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:07,970
S-so what?

251
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,490
Han Zheng surely cannot find a clue.

252
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,960
Really, all you can recall is fighting with him.

253
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,040
Not really.

254
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,210
Well, I also want to be

255
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,160
a good partner to him.

256
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:20,930
But...

257
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,880
So,

258
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,420
if I want to manage him,

259
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,870
I must first mentally

260
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,390
subdue him.

261
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,720
But...

262
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,640
Unfortunately,

263
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,520
we have not found any clues.

264
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,160
He does not like painting at all and is only interested in money.

265
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,220
He is a money lover who enjoys gambling.

266
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,850
I heard that Eldest Senior

267
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,790
lent him a sum of money to

268
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,940
redeemed

269
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,180
a painting he sold.

270
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:46,570
Got it.

271
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:47,900
What?

272
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,080
Wang Jiarong is greedy for money and loves gambling.

273
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,050
He values money as his life,

274
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,630
but he is willing to borrow money

275
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,500
to redeem his painting.

276
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,940
Doesn't this

277
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,640
sounds strange?

278
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,390
Yes.

279
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,170
Lass.

280
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,230
I'm back.

281
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,640
I'm back!

282
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,060
Godfather.

283
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,680
How?

284
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,780
How is it?

285
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,130
Stop drinking. Let us get down to business.
It is not a trial case.

286
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,990
Come on, tell me.

287
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,720
Han Zheng

288
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,790
[Nanfeng Studio]

289
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,360
What?

290
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,160
He hurled the man up and down

291
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,230
the City Gate Tower.

292
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:28,880
Hu,

293
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,310
did Xu Youdao get hurt?

294
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,930
Trauma is certain–

295
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,470
Trauma is certainly not there.

296
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,770
Did he cover his face?

297
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:38,740
He seemed to have covered his face.

298
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,930
That's good.

299
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,740
In such a case,

300
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,930
I do not need to be made a scapegoat.

301
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:46,830
Oh no.

302
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,250
In that case,

303
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,080
he will

304
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,830
come back for us soon.

305
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,900
We are about to be screwed.

306
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,580
Be careful, be careful, be careful.

307
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,230
Lass.

308
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,240
Are you looking for Senior's painting?

309
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,150
Can you make it?

310
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,500
Young Prince,

311
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,920
you are quite strong.

312
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:09,800
How is it, Lass?

313
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,680
Is it bumpy?

314
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,460
This is so fun.

315
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,760
Painter Feng,

316
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,990
you are amazing.

317
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,370
You made

318
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,440
such an interesting and useful thing.

319
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,410
My Master had gout,

320
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,800
which made it difficult for him to walk for a while.

321
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,020
As a result,

322
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,090
there is such a chair in the studio.

323
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,950
I did not expect it to be used today.

324
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,460
Then Master Wei does not need to use it any more?

325
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,340
Master's gout was treated with acupuncture all year round,

326
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,890
and his leg improved significantly.

327
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,320
When he is able to walk and run,

328
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,710
he travels far and wide to spend time outside.

329
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,530
I have no idea

330
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,350
where Master is right now.

331
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,970
It seems that Master Wei has been travelling

332
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,960
for half a year now.

333
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:43,730
Yes.

334
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,450
I did not expect anything like this to happen

335
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,440
after Master left.

336
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:54,610
Please.

337
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,360
Let us go.

338
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,290
This is the warehouse of Nanfeng Studio.

339
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,370
Some items that were not previously in use

340
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,450
are all here.

341
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,030
So what happened was

342
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,080
Wang Jirong redeemed the painting

343
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,160
and tossed it here.

344
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,650
A disciple discovered this painting

345
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,570
and assumed it had been stolen,

346
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:20,770
so he gave it to me.

347
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,270
But when I asked Second Senior,

348
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,190
he said the painting was evil and

I have no idea,

353
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,290
and I have never encountered it.

354
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,890
Let us take a look first.

355
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,290
It is a normal scenery painting.

Where is the evil spirit?

Nothing wicked is apparent to me.

Your Highness, what do you think?

There are no flaws

as in his other paintings.

What is wrong?

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,500
Is this painting

369
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,339
redeemed

370
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,130

Sir, you are extremely perceptive.

This painting

was indeed redeemed

What is wrong with Wuming Painting Club?

378

Nothing.

379
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,960
Wuming Painting Club is a decent place.

380
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,050
It is just that

381
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,440
the place is not so compatible with me.

382

Incompatible?

Incompatible?

It does not matter.

the owner rarely shows up,

and prefers to listen to stories.

to collaborate with him to put up a show

Exactly.

Is it possible that he made a mistake in the drawing

there was nothing wrong with it,

523
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,410
determined by the owner's preferences.

524
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,640
The owner might play with it for a few years

525
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,140
or perhaps give it away,

526
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,520
or sell it.

527
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,610
No one knows.

528
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,390
Then why is this painting

529
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,860
with the marks of two categories?

530
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,620
Because of that strange occurence,

531
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,950
it upgraded this painting from the category of Zhen

532
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,370
to the category of Ji.

533
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,080
This was also the reason why Wang Jirong is determined

534
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,030
to redeem this painting.

535
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,320
That night,

536
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,900
the old man

537
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,440
who was fishing in the river originally

538
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,420
disappeared from the painting overnight.

539
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,220
The man in the painting disappeared?

540
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,280
Exactly.

541
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,050
Such a strange painting.

542
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,050
Your boss

543
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,610
has even promoted it to a higher category.

544
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,080
It's nothing.

545
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,690
Please have a seat.

546
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,820
Our boss prefers rare things.

547
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,030
The more mysterious the thing is,

548
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,370
the more our master likes it.

549
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:35,970
So

550
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,770
it is also possible that Wang Jirong painted

551
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,320
two paintings at the same time,

552
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,360
one with and

553
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,550
one without the old man on the boat,

554
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,350
and then found an opportunity to switch them.

555
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,580
Exactly in accordance

556
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,630
with your master's preferences.

557
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,900
There is no such thing as just looking exactly the same in paintings.

558
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,440
There is also the differences in the ink used and the brushwork.

559
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,840
I personally examined the painting and

560
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,370
remember every stroke

561
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,300
clearly.

562
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,190
Even if it is drawn by the same artist,

563
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,760
as long as there is a wrong stroke,

564
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,350
it will not escape my attention.

565
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:06,800
Furthermore,

566
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,930
if it is done for the owner's favor,

567
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,460
why would he pay

568
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,960
twice the price to redeem the painting?

569
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,930
It is completely illogical.

570
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,750
Actually,

571
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,600
it is not that illogical.

572
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,490
Shopkeeper Li, what else do you know?

573
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,560
You just said

574
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,870
he was hung with a wolf's head after his death.

575
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,240
Is it true?

576
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,190
Yes.

577
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,140
Do you know

578
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,790
this is also a painting?

579
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,610
Xu Youdao's Wolf-Headed Man Roaming at Night.

580
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,790
You have done your research.

581
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,570
Since we get along so well,

582
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,200
let me give you a piece of advice.

583
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:46,810
Do not investigate

584
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,150
this case any more.

585
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:50,520
Why?

586
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,270
Because I think

587
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,270
they were killed by the painting.

588
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,610
In the end,

589
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,540
all your investigation will be in vain.

590
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,520
Maybe

591
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,850
you will get killed by the painting as well.

592
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,960
Sir,

593
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,310
people were killed by the painting?

594
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,180
That's

595
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,050
too ridiculous.

596
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,050
Little girl,

597
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,020
I like what you say.

598
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,150
But as for your subordinate,

599
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,490
he is so unlikeable.

600
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,590
You...

601
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,230
Calm down. Calm down.

602
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:35,610
Sir,

603
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:36,970
I have one more thing

604
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,650
to ask you.

605
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,580
Is…

606
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,230
Is there any other paintings

607
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,690
from this Nanfeng Studio

608
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,810
with which

609
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,890
such bizarre things happened too?

610
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,760
You are smart.

611
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,550
Is that painting called The Painting Immortal?

612
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,650
That is right.

613
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:51,950
Sir,

614
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,370
can you tell us more about

615
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,790
what happened

616
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,060
in more specific detail?

617
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,230
So that we will also know whether

618
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,560
we should pursue the investigation further.

619
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,620
I'll reluctantly

620
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,680
to give you some advice.

621
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,620
That painting

622
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,700
is called the Painting of a Snow Night in Jiuxiao City

623
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,730
The Immortal in the Painting is just the nickname of it.

624
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,730
Could it be...

625
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,370
someone in the painting is missing too?

626
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,410
The opposite happened for this painting.

627
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,130
The Painting of a Snow Night in Jiuxiao City

628
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,600
is the final work drawn by Master Wei Gonglin,

629
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,780
the head of Nanfeng Studio,

630
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,890
who devoted his whole life to this painting.

631
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,560
Congratulations, Master.

632
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,580
The painting of Master Wei is fantastic.

633
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,570
The sky was full of vibrant colors

634
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,590
one evening,

635
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,270
and auspicious snow fell unexpectedly at night,

636
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,310
and the sky and the earth were vast.

637
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,300
Some people in Nanfeng Studio

638
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,330
heard fairy music

639
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,960
and smelled a strange fragrance.

640
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,000
The next day,

641
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,560
they discovered

642
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,570
an extra immortal in red had appeared

643
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,770
on the Painting of a Snow Night in Jiuxiao City.

644
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:06,980
Senior.

645
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,780
Who'd dare to draw

646
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,860
on Master's painting?

647
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,860
This stroke

648
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,060
must be done

649
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:11,760
by Master.

650
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,640
What a skillful work.

651
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,050
I did not.

652
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,680
[Qian, Wei Gonglin]

653
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,600
I have no idea either.

654
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,750
Congratulations, Master.

655
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
The achievements of Master are extraordinary.

656
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,710
This is the immortal in the painting.

657
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,540
Come in uninvited and live in the painting.

658
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,050
Congratulations, Master.

659
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,240
Congratulations, Master.

660
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,700
From that onwards,

661
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,920
the painting has been called The Immortal in the Painting

662
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,070
and became a priceless treasure.

663
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,250
The Painting Immortal?

664
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,930
“Wolf-Headed Man Roaming at Night" hasn’t been solved yet.

665
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,010
Fishing Alone at Han River

666
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,320
is also very strange.

667
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,000
Now comes another "Painting Immortal."

668
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:45,920
Do you believe that this case

669
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,400
has anything to do with the painting?

670
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,120
Do you truly believe that the paintings

671
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,200
are killing those people?

672
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,030
If you want to believe that,

673
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,360
it's better to believe

674
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,540
that the trees over there, the grass on the ground,

675
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,720
and the door outside

676
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,170
can jump out and kill you.

677
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,770
Believe me.

678
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,800
Maybe the key to this case

679
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,010
is really related to painting.

680
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,690
As long as the case is not solved,

681
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:07,840
there is no truth.

682
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,310
Then, Xu Youdao is not the murderer, right?

683
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,310
Shouldn't you apologize

684
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,630
for what happened during the day?

685
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,070
You're walking so fast again.

686
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,540
I am having difficulty walking right now,

687
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,610
why can't you wait for me?

688
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:24,730
Take it.

689
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:25,770
What?

690
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,080
♫ I want to travel mountains and lakes with you ♫

691
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,490
♫ The shadows the moon casts on the waters is lovely  ♫

692
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,520
♫ Through winds and rains, I bring you to a place where the sky is clear ♫

693
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,060

This is a kind of vine flower from the south.

868
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,680
It's easy to grow.

869
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:01,220
But few people plant it.

870
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,690
I've checked carefully.

871
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,690
In Nanfeng Hall,

872
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,940
they are only found

873
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,770
in Lin Zhixing's courtyard.

874
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,140
Isn't this

875
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,580
the same way Wang Jirong died?

876
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,460
I got it.

877
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,430
Wang Jirong was turned into Xu Youdao's painting by

878
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,810
Xu Youdao's wolf head.

879
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,190
Xu Youdao was transformed into Lin Zhixing's painting

880
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,450
by Lin Zhixing's flowers.

881
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,210
I got it.

882
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,400
The murderer is warning us.

883
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,950
He's forewarning that the next person to die is

884
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:28,410
Lin Zhixing.

885
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:28,760
[Lin Zhixing]

886
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,760
Commander.

887
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,370
I have an idea.

888
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,660
We just need to send someone

889
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,760
to keep an eye on Lin Zhixing

890
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
and follow the clues.

891
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:40,880
Then we can catch the murderer.

892
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:41,900
Yes.

893
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,830
Prince Han,

894
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,070
what is your opinion?

895
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,740
You are really enthusiastic to

896
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,390
follow the murderer's idea.

897
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,560
What idea do you have then?

898
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,210
Brother Daren,

899
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,510
what Prince Han means is

900
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,440
you are going towards

901
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,750
wherever the murderer wants you to.

902
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,270
Are you the murderer's good son?

903
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,670
What if the murder wants us

904
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,010
to protect Lin Zhixing

905
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,850
but has another purpose?

906
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,040
Right?

907
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:11,560
Come here.

908
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,270
Time is running out.

909
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,730
What you should do is

910
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,500
split up.

911
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,130
Split up.

912
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,270
Let's not talk about the preview,

913
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,430
But this...

914
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,320
Lin Zhixing

915
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,090
must have something

916
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:25,930
to do with this.

917
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,830
So we can't

918
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,710
ignore it.

919
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:28,640
Right?

920
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,210
Yes.

921
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,020
Besides,

922
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,620
what Prince Han said

923
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,400
also makes sense.

924
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,860
We can't be always

925
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,850
led by the murderer.

926
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,090
We must find out

927
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,410
his purpose and motive.

928
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:38,940
Right?

929
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,380
You're right, Commander.

930
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:41,550
How about this?

931
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,690
I'll take someone to keep an eye on Lin Zhixing.

932
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,040
Don't Jiu'er and Prince Han

933
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,760
have some clues?

934
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,010
They can go and investigate.

935
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,040
Yue Daren,

936
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,960
are you trying to take my job?

937
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,250
What do you mean?

938
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:51,850
Hu Badao,

939
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
do you even know what's going on?

940
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,050
Go away!

941
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,600
I was the first one who mentioned about

942
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,640
keeping an eye on Lin Zhixing.

943
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,850
How is it not helping?

944
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,700
You are certainly not helping.

945
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,560
You are stealing the job.

946
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,220
This...

947
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:01,850
You...

948
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,580
She's already like this.

949
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:06,040
Han Zheng, Han Zheng.

950
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,930
Your Highness, what are you trying to do?

951
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:08,430
Forget it.

952
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:08,970
Yue Daren!

953
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:09,840
Come here.

954
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,430
Come over.

955
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:11,940
Go, go, go.

956
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:12,650
Forget it.

957
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,180
No wonder you have been always bullied

958
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:14,910
at the Inspection Bureau.

959
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,560
I'm not.

960
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,950
I don't want to be so calculative with him.

961
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,010
They are usually like that.

962
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:22,990
But today,

963
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,050
it seemed that they were really scared.

964
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,140
However,

965
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,200
without Prince Han,

966
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,990
no one would have stood up for me.

967
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:30,530
Right?

968
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,910
Stop.

969
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,520
There must be something behind your sweet words.

970
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,730
You stop.

971
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,510
Have you forgotten?

972
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,400
Forget what?

973
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,130
You said it yourself.

974
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,290
I will accompany you to check the painting,

975
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,530
then you will send me home.

976
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,130
Aren't I sending you home now?

977
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,220
Is this considered sending me home?

978
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,710
I am so sleepy and tired now.

979
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,060
My leg is injured as well.

980
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,890
I just hope

981
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,930
you can fly me around again.

982
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:54,680
Then I will be flown...

983
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,990
I am also tired and sleepy .

984
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,690
Take me with you too.

985
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,610
And I'm home...

986
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,900
That was so fast.

987
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:11,930
You brat!

988
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,510
Mother.
You still know to come back?

989
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,920
[He'an Hall]

990
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:15,740
Look

991
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:16,970
at the time now.

992
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:18,450
You really...

993
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,630
Mother, I'm back.

994
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:21,450
He'an Hall

995
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:22,660
Hurry up, come in.

996
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,540
I'll apply some medicine for you.

997
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,000
Alright.

998
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:24,740
Look at you.

999
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,210
You just can't stay still.

1000
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,540
This Han Zheng

1001
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,130
usually looks fierce.

1002
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,810
I didn't expect that

1003
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,730
he would apologize to me.
