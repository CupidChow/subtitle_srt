4
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,060
I'm in...

5
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,340
Jiu'er's room?

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,840
What happened to me last night?

7
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,390
Didn't I go home?

8
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
What on earth...

9
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:17,910
Wait–

10
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,300
Jiu'er...

11
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,030
Last night, did I...

12
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,860
Impossible.

13
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:27,770
Am I dreaming?

14
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,510
Oh no.

15
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,170
No way.

16
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,960
Your Highness.

17
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,420
My hair has grown longer.

18
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,329
Your Highness.

19
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,140
Your Highness,

20
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,300
what should I do?

21
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,260
Enough.

22
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,220
I'll find a way.

23
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,820
Stop crying.

24
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,770
Don't laugh.

25
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,490
I'm sorry, Keha.

26
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,820
I've only seen

27
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,250
Uncle Abu with long hair.

28
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,390
I didn't expect you to look like this

29
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,270
when you shapeshift.

30
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,820
I look very cool when I shapeshift,

31
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,460
it's nothing like that at all.

32
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,930
Now I look like a monkey.

33
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,130
In fact, it's a fat monkey.

34
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:33,790
Give me your hand.

35
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,440
Let my mother take a look.

36
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,390
How is it?

37
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,700
It's just your hair has grown.

38
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,340
Why did you have to scare me

39
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:39,970
hiding under the sheets?

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,780
I thought I–

41
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,420
What did you think?

42
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:47,820
Nothing.

43
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,850
I still want to ask...

44
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,579
Why Keha and I...

45
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,340
slept in your room?

46
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,300
Right, Jiu'er.

47
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,220
Why were you

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,180
sleeping next to me today?

49
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
You scared me this morning.

50
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,850
Because...

51
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,520
- Slow down.
- I’m fine.

52
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,110
Jiu'er,

53
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,120
I'll take you home first.

54
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,760
I'm home.

55
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,190
Let's continue drinking

56
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,860
later.

57
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,760
Slowly.

58
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,000
We're in the room.

59
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:23,750
Sit down.

60
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,460
- No.
- Come.

61
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,550
Sit down.

62
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,350
Your Highness.

63
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,150
Let me tell you.

64
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,500
Get out!

65
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,580
Get out!

66
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,490
I'll leave.

67
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,159
Jiu'er, take a seat.

68
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,800
Go to sleep.

69
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:42,850
But you...

70
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,780
You have to let go of my hand first.

71
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,659
Yes.

72
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,820
I think I haven't

73
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,940
replenished

74
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,980
your health

75
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,120
in a long time.

76
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,200
Let me replenish plenty for you

77
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,900
today.

78
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,880
The Six Treaties will be signed soon.

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,210
With that,

80
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,030
Qian-Qi couples

81
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,330
can engage legally.

82
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,860
We can be the first couple

83
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,980
with a Qian-Qi marriage certificate.

84
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,320
How is he so cute?

85
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,580
I even want to...

86
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,180
Your Highness.

87
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,980
Why don't we go home and sleep?

88
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,820
Let Miss Jiu'er

89
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,690
rest early.

90
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,460
Let Jiu'er sleep.

91
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,440
H-help him up.

92
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,690
I'm...

93
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,590
Slow down.

94
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,020
I'm going to sleep too.

95
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,540
This...

96
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,620
Han Zheng, you guys go back first.

97
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,460
- No.
- He won’t let go.

98
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,420
No.

99
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,480
I have an idea.

100
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,890
Hurry up.

101
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,800
Dear Han,

102
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,840
let go of me.

103
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:20,570
Be good.

104
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,650
It hurts.

105
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,660
Here.

106
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,420
Jiu'er, why are you so fat now?

107
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,540
I'll leave him to you.

108
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,860
Got it. Go ahead.

109
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,340
It seems like it was effective.

110
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,930
Your hands are warmer than mine.

111
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,530
Your Highness, have a rest.

112
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,470
Can't you

113
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,630
sympathize with me?

114
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,830
[He'an Hall]

115
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,620
Open your mouth.

116
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,680
It seems like

117
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,980
everyone's symptoms

118
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,780
are the same.

119
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,470
After being poisoned,

120
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,400
your limbs would become uncontrollable.

121
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,360
You would shiver from time to time.

122
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,910
Then your emotions will gradually

123
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,750
become sensitive,

124
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,840
and you will eventually lose control.

125
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,000
In about seven days,

126
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:18,990
you will start growing hair,

127
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,300
and will become like this in no time.

128
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,580
I can't even see

129
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,810
my handsome face anymore.

130
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,200
But that's not right.

131
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,410
Didn't you two

132
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,940
get poisoned on the same day?

133
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,340
Right.

134
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,240
Why is my future son-in-law

135
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,390
completely fine?

136
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,020
I guess it's because His Highness

137
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,740
has a Xueqi's qualities.

138
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,670
In that case, Keha,

139
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,480
from today on,

140
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,310
don't go out.

141
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,140
No.

142
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,010
I can go out

143
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
if I groom myself.

144
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,090
You have so much hair,

145
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:49,900
how can you go out?

146
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,060
Jiu'er!

147
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:54,790
Han Zheng!

148
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,000
Jiu'er!

149
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,590
Han Zheng!

150
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,620
Tianyun.

151
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,900
Bad news!

152
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,380
The street is full of hair.

153
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,380
Hair?

154
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:02,680
What hair?

155
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,410
Why is there hair here?

156
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,340
Could Tianyun be talking about

157
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,580
the Qi men from Shuobei Dance Tavern?

158
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,060
Let's go!

159
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,030
Don't take my stuff!

160
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,850
Put it down.

161
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,730
Put it down.

162
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,340
Give me ice.

163
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,520
I want ice.

164
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,220
I want the fan.

165
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,140
What are you doing?

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,800
Give me the fan!

167
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,820
Give me the fan.

168
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,170
His Highness is here.

169
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,780
Qi people are rebelling!

170
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:29,980
Liu Fu! Liu Fu!

171
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:30,860
Go and have a look.

172
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,360
Hurry! Step back!

173
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,549
Step back.

174
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,190
Step back.

175
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,419
Everyone, step back!

176
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:35,850
Hurry!

177
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:36,900
Listen to me.

178
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,200
Back off!

179
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:37,840
Back offQ

180
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,419
These

181
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,580
are just

182
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,289
some Qi who didn't shave.

183
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,150
Isn't that Chilang who owes me money?

184
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,560
How dare they

185
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,430
shapeshift in public?

186
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Exactly.

187
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,620
This is outrageous!

188
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,340
Everyone!

189
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,840
Whether they has transformed or not,

190
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,880
will be investigated by the Inspection Bureau.

191
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,260
But these Qi people

192
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,430
have no ill intentions.

193
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,280
How can they have no ill intentions?

194
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,100
Your Highness,

195
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,140
take them back to

196
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,410
Shuobei Dance Tavern first.

197
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:01,820
All right.

198
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:02,620
Here.

199
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,460
Make way.

200
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,340
Go back.

201
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,100
Here.

202
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:05,520
Lord.

203
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,110
Lord.

204
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,820
Why is it so warm

205
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,800
in Shuobei Dance Tavern?

206
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:11,980
Your Highness,

207
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,570
there's something wrong with Shuobei Dance Tavern.

208
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,660
We’d better leave.

209
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:17,610
All right.

210
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,560
Let's take them back.

211
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,210
Come.

212
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,100
He can't leave.

213
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,740
He owes me 20 taels.

214
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,860
It was 10 taels.

215
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:28,940
You...

216
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,270
You increased your interest rate.

217
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,860
It became 20 taels

218
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,420
in just half a month.

219
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,850
What about it?

220
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,400
It's only been a few days,

221
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,380
you can't even talk anymore.

222
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,340
Exactly.

223
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,060
[Shuobei Dance Tavern]

224
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,140
They are cheating us.

225
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,540
They are framing us.

226
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,870
You cheater!

227
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,520
Cheater, cheater!

228
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,580
Cheater!

229
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,780
Cheater!

230
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,340
Liu Fu!

231
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,100
Catch him!

232
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,470
Protect His Highness!

233
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,730
They cheated us.

234
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,400
Qi people are going crazy!

235
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,530
Qi people are going crazy!

236
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,770
Qi people are committing murder!

237
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,020
Beat him!

238
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,030
Beat him! Beat him!

239
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,740
Kill them!

240
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,180
Chase them!

241
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,290
Separate them!

242
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,400
Move!

243
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,380
Calm down.

244
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:05,780
Stop fighting!

245
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,380
Stop!

246
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,260
Stop fighting!

247
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,660
Calm down.

248
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,100
Stop fighting!

249
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,600
Stop fighting!

250
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,430
Back off!

251
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,060
Go back!

252
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,260
Stop fighting! Back off!

253
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,250
Stop fighting!

254
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,720
Back off!

255
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,180
Han Zheng!

256
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,400
You have to be calm.

257
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,800
Keha!

258
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,060
Qi people are hurting people!

259
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,660
Qi people are hurting people!

260
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:45,670
Step back.

261
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,940
- Stop fighting!
- Cover your nose.

262
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,670
Get out of our Jiuxiao City!

263
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,440
Fight with them!

264
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,160
General.

265
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,620
What's wrong with them?

266
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,620
It's nothing.

267
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,660
They'll be fine after a sleep.

268
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,230
General is indeed amazing.

269
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,330
This is the one who put the cat out just now.

270
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,510
Look at the emblem on his hand.

271
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,210
He's indeed from Snow Chamber.

272
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,570
What happened?

273
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:38,870
Inspector Yue,

274
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,700
the Qi people want to destroy Jiuxiao City

275
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,880
and want to kill us!

276
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,100
Yes, Inspector Yue.

277
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:43,880
It's so scary!

278
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,100
The Qi people has gone crazy!

279
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,510
Inspector, they didn't go crazy,

280
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,900
this is their nature.

281
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,510
I treated you so well normally,

282
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,210
- how could you destroy my Jiuxiao City?
- Exactly.

283
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,070
Inspector Yue,

284
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,370
you have to help us.

285
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,940
What if they kill us?

286
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,490
Inspector Yue,

287
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,850
please help us!

288
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,830
Inspector Yue,

289
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,280
you have to help us.

290
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,470
Be softer.

291
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,280
Don't wake them up.

292
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,280
They're fierce.

293
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,680
They didn't go crazy.

294
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,780
They were poisoned.

295
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,540
If they weren't provoked,

296
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,740
they wouldn't be like this.

297
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:13,710
Your Highness,

298
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,460
what poison is this?

299
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,240
I've never seen it before.

300
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,150
There is such a poison.

301
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,420
We have the antidote.

302
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,740
We can prove it to you right away.

303
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:29,930
Keha.

304
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:30,740
Keha!

305
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,070
He's awake.

306
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,180
He's awake.

307
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,370
Keha!

308
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,710
Keha!

309
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,580
Your Highness!

310
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,560
Isn't this a prison cell?

311
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,460
Cut the crap.

312
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,130
Take the antidote first.

313
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,380
Here.

314
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,110
Okay.

315
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,620
Come on.

316
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:58,860
Okay.

317
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,440
Okay.

318
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,290
H-how do you feel?

319
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,700
It feels like like there's a surge of power

320
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,220
coming up.

321
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,760
I-I feel like I'm going back to normal.

322
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,620
Great!

323
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,210
Amazing, Mother!

324
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,820
Okay, be good.

325
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,160
Control yourself.

326
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,850
Understand?

327
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,980
It's only a few hours.

328
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,380
Control yourself.

329
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,040
Sit here.

330
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,680
Why are you...

331
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:45,830
Yes.

332
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,880
Dr. Qin,

333
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,260
I'm too tired.

334
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:54,950
Why does your medicine not

335
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,550
seem to work.

336
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,260
Mother,

337
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,900
when will this medicine take effect?

338
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,220
It should be

339
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,710
immediate.

340
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,500
But why is he

341
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,270
still jumping around here?

342
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,420
You're so disobedient.

343
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,740
Why is he still like this now?

344
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,740
Maybe the poison has been mutated by someone.

345
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,540
Although the symptoms are the same,

346
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,180
only the person

347
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,060
who poisoned them knows the antidote.

348
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,990
Stop moving.

349
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,870
I think you should just give up.

350
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,910
They don't look like they've been poisoned,

351
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,210
they've obviously shapeshifted.

352
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,270
Find a way

353
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,210
to get them to shapeshift back.

354
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,090
Otherwise, if we lock them up,

355
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,550
we can do nothing to them.

356
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:33,530
Commander.

357
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:36,790
Enough.

358
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,700
Stop this futile attempt.

359
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:38,990
Just let them go.

360
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:40,490
Release–

361
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,050
Commander Yan.

362
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,300
the Law Department has agreed to release them?

363
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,700
Not only that,

364
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,340
you have to also make sure that every single one of them is released.

365
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,380
You guys

366
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,900
better find a way soon.

367
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:51,490
Sir,

368
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,950
what do you mean?

369
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,700
We just received an order

370
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,770
from the Law Department,

371
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,800
saying that after His Majesty heard about what happened today,

372
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,230
he feels that the Qian and the Qi

373
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,330
have been in conflict for a long time.

374
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,330
There are many issues.

375
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,060
Now the city has changed a lot.

376
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,430
So in order to protect

377
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,260
Qian people's life,

378
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,740
he decides

379
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,580
to have all Qi people

380
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,060
leave Jiuxiao City

381
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,630
within seven days.

382
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,540
- What?
- What?

383
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,960
How is that possible?

384
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,730
How could Father

385
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,390
give such an order?

386
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,770
You really have no idea?

387
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,370
As they were creating chaos in Shuobei Dance Tavern.

388
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,650
incidents have occurred in dozens of places

389
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,210
in Jiuxiao City.

390
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,700
The whole Jiuxiao City

391
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,350
is in a turmoil because of the Qi people.

392
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:37,560
That's enough, Jiu'er.

393
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,070
Let me do it.

394
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,970
Don't worry, Uncle Bu,

395
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,560
you'll be fine soon.

396
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,700
Go out and rest.

397
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,030
Let me do it.

398
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,060
Go.

399
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,340
Where's Han Zheng?

400
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,790
Mother, I'm scared.

401
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,780
But those people have nowhere to go.

402
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,060
We can't go out to play any more.

403
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,270
Who knows if they will

404
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,540
charge at us and hurt us?

405
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:09,859
Come on.

406
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,089
Help me carry them.

407
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:12,700
Okay.

408
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,119
Be careful.

409
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,180
How can I live?

410
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,079
So many of my goods

411
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,960
are all gone.

412
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,980
Sir, three buns please.

413
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,560
I won't sell them to anyone

414
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,819
but the Qi.

415
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,319
Leave.

416
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,550
How dare he steal from you?

417
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,140
Are you okay?

418
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:27,460
Scram!

419
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,110
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

420
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:29,890
Scram!

421
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:30,750
Get lost!

422
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,140
Scram!

423
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:31,900
Get out!

424
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,710
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

425
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
How dare you still stay here?

426
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,100
Get out!

427
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,500
Scram!

428
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:35,940
Get out!

429
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,740
It's all your fault.

430
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,620
You're not welcome here.

431
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,420
Get out of Jiuxiao City.

432
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,150
You're not welcome here!

433
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,580
Get out!

434
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,940
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

435
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,690
You're causing turmoil to Jiuxiao City!

436
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,220
Get lost!

437
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,620
Get lost!

438
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,540
Stop causing us harm!

439
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,030
Get lost!

440
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,640
Jiuxiao City doesn't need you.

441
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,700
Get out!

442
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,550
Get out!

443
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,140
Get out!

444
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,740
Get out!

445
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,260
Scram!

446
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,260
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

447
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,100
Get out of here!

448
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,860
Get lost!

449
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,580
Don't come again.

450
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,740
Han Zheng.

451
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,420
Han Zheng!

452
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,040
Han Zheng!

453
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,780
Han Zheng,

454
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:15,910
calm down.

455
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,100
This

456
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,040
wasn't just an accident.

457
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,710
Someone took the chance as we were not prepared

458
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,870
to deliberately drive the Qi people in Shuobei Dance Tavern

459
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,690
onto the street.

460
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,540
When you were moving them back,

461
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,480
I went to take a look at Shuobei Dance Tavern.

462
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,080
I remember these things.

463
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,340
It should be

464
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,460
what was used to put ice cubes to cool down

465
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,580
Shuobei Dance Tavern.

466
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,790
But the people of Show Chamber

467
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,620
swapped them for kindled charcoal

468
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,230
when we weren't looking.

469
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,540
This made Shuobei Dance Tavern

470
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,140
too hot.

471
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,260
They couldn't stand it

472
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,460
so they fled onto the street.

473
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,300
That's right.

474
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,040
It was my negligence.

475
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,310
Although I sent people

476
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,800
to lock the hidden doors in Shuobei Dance Tavern,

477
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:29,920
I didn’t expect

478
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,360
they could think of this way

479
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,910
to let Qi people run out by themselves.

480
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,910
I was in the wrong too.

481
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,400
I always thought

482
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,520
poisoning is the last card

483
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,340
Snow Chamber would play.

484
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,340
I didn't expect they

485
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,320
planned so much.

486
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,180
All just to

487
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,660
to kick Qi people out of Jiuxiao City.

488
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,600
Don't blame yourselves.

489
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,490
The Snow Chamber used such a strange poison

490
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,390
to make us

491
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,100
let our guard down.

492
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,020
If the poison doesn't take effect,

493
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,310
it'll be hard for us to find out

494
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,000
what they want to do either.

495
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,300
But I think

496
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,360
something is amiss.

497
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,860
They have made

498
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,780
such a powerful poison

499
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,800
but it's only used to chase out Qi people.

500
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,050
It seems

501
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,610
like the motivation and results don't match.

502
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,270
You mean...

503
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,470
They are poisoning people anyway,

504
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,710
they could have poisoned Qi people to death,

505
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,150
but Snow Chamber is only using it

506
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,780
to chase them out

507
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,500
so it's strange.

508
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,300
That's right.

509
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,170
Maybe

510
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,010
they don't want to offend the State of Qi

511
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:28,970
on the surface.

512
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,400
But isn't it offending the State of Qi

513
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,070
if they're chasing them out?

514
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:36,890
Bad news!

515
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,000
Bad news!

516
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,920
What's wrong, Mother?

517
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:39,370
It's bad!

518
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,410
Come and help me.

519
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,230
Quick!

520
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,300
Come on.

521
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,060
This way.

522
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:45,900
Hurry. Here.

523
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:52,420
Mother.

524
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,060
What happened to Uncle Bu?

525
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,790
I thought

526
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,620
he's sleeping so soundly

527
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,450
because he inhaled the sleeping powder

528
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,410
Chilan and I gave him.

529
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,620
But when I checked his pulse,

530
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,810
I found his pulse was very weak.

531
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,940
He seems like he's sleeping,

532
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,740
but it also seems like he's on the brink of death.

533
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,370
That makes sense.

534
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,460
The evil Snow Chamber

535
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,180
wants to kill them all?

536
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,480
Mother, have you found the antidote?

537
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,590
But don't worry.

538
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,300
I'll do my best to give him acupuncture.

539
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,870
It can buy us some time.

540
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,770
If we can find the antidote

541
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,730
before they are exhausted,

542
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,060
they might not die.

543
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,180
That's right.

544
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,870
Father's edict

545
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,040
is about seven days.

546
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,940
If we find the antidote in seven days

547
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,780
and find the truth

548
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,220
to prove

549
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,340
Qi people were framed,

550
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,450
then the Qi race

551
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,140
won't be kicked out.

552
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,270
Every time Marquis Xian meets

553
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,010
an important figure,

554
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,240
he wouldn't let us follow him.

555
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,220
Who is it?

556
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,090
Administer Deng.

557
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,570
Instead of looking for a needle in a haystack,

558
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,720
we should find another way.

559
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,370
To find the person who poisoned them

560
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,700
to get the antidote.

561
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,740
My Lord,

562
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,860
the situation in the city

563
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,820
is exactly what you expected.

564
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,450
We need more people in the city.

565
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,180
Don't let your guard down.

566
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,520
We must protect

567
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,460
the safety of the people.

568
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,100
Yes.

569
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,550
Lord!

570
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:54,740
Lord!

571
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,420
Lord!

572
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,580
Lord!

573
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,580
You...

574
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,180
Go.

575
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,770
Are you sure they've passed out?

576
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,320
Did they recognize us just now?

577
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,710
Look at how Keha looks like.

578
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,500
How could he recogize him?

579
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,220
I have

580
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,230
just never been against

581
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,350
such a powerful evil force.

582
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,710
I'm a little scared.

583
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,700
You got me to put on a saving a damsel in distress show

584
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,700
but you got me a

585
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,460
greasy old man–

586
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,130
Keep your voice down.

587
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,240
Don't wake him up.

588
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,040
Good for you, Su Jiu'er!

589
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,270
Hua!

590
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:56,440
You're a good talker.

591
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,270
It's a pity

592
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,020
if you don't talk me more.

593
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:58,580
Right?

594
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,450
And you're not a familiar face.

595
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,230
If our show

596
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,500
doesn't work on him,

597
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,260
what should we do?

598
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,140
Don't worry,

599
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,440
it's a classic

600
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,570
for a good reason.

601
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,630
All right, go now.

602
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,740
Do your best.

603
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,380
Don't be nervous.

604
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,610
Go. Go.

605
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,410
Let's go.

606
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:19,780
Jun,

607
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,580
go over there with me.

608
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,720
What are you doing?

609
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,260
Don't move.

610
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,690
That's enough.

611
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:24,980
Go.

612
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,590
Wake up, old man!

613
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,900
They're coming.

614
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,830
Wake up!

615
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,580
Wake up!

616
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,150
Wake up!

617
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,650
Wake up!

618
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,630
They are coming.

619
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,020
Hurry up!

620
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,210
They're coming!

621
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,080
- What’s going on?
- Run!

622
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,480
Where am I?

623
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,520
We are in the middle of escaping!

624
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,750
Faster.

625
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,460
Faster.

626
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,460
If you keep talking

627
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,540
- you will die!
- Faster!

628
00:24:59,600 --> 00:24:59,980
Let's go!

629
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,180
I'm not going.

630
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,680
- Let's go!
- No!

631
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,180
Oh no.

632
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,790
I'm so stupid. Why should I save you?

633
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,720
They found me.

634
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,380
Who?

635
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,560
Who?

636
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,380
Idiot.

637
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,140
Who else is causing all the

638
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,220
unrest in the city.

639
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,210
Are you leaving or not?

640
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,340
No!

641
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,330
Die yourself then. I'm leaving.

642
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:30,900
You...

643
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,900
Okay.

644
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,960
It's Han Zheng's turn.

645
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,660
How dare these Qi people

646
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,970
cause such chaos in Jiuxiao City?

647
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,740
I must–

648
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,180
Guard Yuan,

649
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,250
where are you?

650
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,600
Help!

651
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,980
Guard Yuan!

652
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,740
Where are you?

653
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,020
Guard Yuan!

654
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,310
Your voice

655
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,540
is so bright.

656
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,220
I haven't had enough fun yet.

657
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:33,980
Keha.

658
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:34,980
Keha!

659
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,170
Hurry up!

660
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:36,900
It's your turn. Go.

661
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,740
Let's go.

662
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,930
Don't dawdle. Go.

663
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,700
Coming.

664
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,020
Hurry.

665
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,750
I'm starting.

666
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,290
Don't scare me.

667
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,860
I'm someone useful.

668
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,810
Who are you?

669
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,270
I am the Administer!

670
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,690
Such a poor acting.

671
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,920
If you need anything,

672
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,140
just tell me.

673
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,280
You are the Administer?

674
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,860
I hate the Administer the most!

675
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,760
Why do you hate me?

676
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:14,680
I...

677
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,020
I don't even know you.

678
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,420
Snow Chamber

679
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,240
is so despicable.

680
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,260
What Chamber?

681
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,400
The antidote.

682
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:26,820
Sci-

683
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,360
Scissors?

684
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,720
You poisoned us!

685
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,700
Antidote!

686
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,100
Antidote?

687
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,500
What antidote are you talking about?

688
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,320
I didn't poison anyone.

689
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,270
You're still hiding it?

690
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,740
I'm not!

691
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,380
Give it to me.

692
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,940
I don't have the antidote.

693
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:46,700
This...

694
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,210
Is he pretending?

695
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,380
I don't think so.

696
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,660
Administer Deng has always been

697
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,770
straight forward in the court.

698
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,260
Why is he denying it now?

699
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,760
Could he... really not know?

700
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,660
Hurry up!

701
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,200
Why is there a cat?

702
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,740
So, Qi people are afraid of cats.

703
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,120
Kitty?

704
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,090
Scare him.

705
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,170
Are you okay, Han Zheng?

706
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,340
Scare him.

707
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,240
Oh no!

708
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,180
Keha.

709
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,360
The show is over.

710
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,270
Calm down.

711
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,860
Keha!

712
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,620
Wake up!

713
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,460
What?

714
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,640
I'm saving you.

715
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,580
If I didn't do anything,

716
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,260
you'd have lost control.

717
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,860
Han Zheng,

718
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:52,940
are you alright?

719
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:56,650
Your Highness.

720
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,400
It's all that cat's fault.

721
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,250
Did I ruin everything

722
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:00,980
again?

723
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
Did you get him to speak?

724
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,060
I did.

725
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,230
But,

726
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,850
it's different

727
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,470
from what we imagined.

728
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,020
What's it?

729
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,140
We might have been tricked.

730
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,660
He's not from the Snow Chamber.

731
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,930
Someone ordered Shopkeeper Li

732
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,600
to mention Administer Deng

733
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,580
before he died.

734
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,210
Then this person...

735
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,910
Can only be one person.

736
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,140
If Administer Deng is

737
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,290
the head of Snow Chamber,

738
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,140
he must know

739
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,130
the characteristics of this poison.

740
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,460
To scare Keha with a cat

741
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,810
is basically suicide.

742
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:41,710
You're right.

743
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,380
What Administer Deng said is true then.

744
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,500
He doesn't know about Snow Chamber

745
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,330
nor the antidote.

746
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,980
Right, Your Highness?

747
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,700
Then Jiu'er,

748
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,340
why are you still so calm?

749
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,820
We lost our clue.

750
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,540
We don't know

751
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,350
what went wrong either.

752
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,060
We only have six days left.

753
00:29:59,280 --> 00:29:59,730
By then,

754
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,750
what would the Qi people of Jiuxiao City do?

755
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,700
What would happen to Jiuxiao City?

756
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,690
I think if you don't remind him,

757
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:10,890
he wouldn't know.

758
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,390
If Administer Deng is innocent,

759
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,580
then the person

760
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,380
who misled us

761
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,810
is very suspicious.

762
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,060
But this man...

763
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,320
is his most respected brother.

764
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,190
Tell him.

765
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,140
Keha.

766
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,940
Go get some rest.

767
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,340
Jun.

768
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,020
Actually, the clue

769
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,270
is still there.

770
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,180
Really?

771
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:53,870
Tell me then.

772
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,160
We're not sure yet.

773
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,100
But listen carefully.

774
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,540
And please stay calm.

775
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,580
It's a big deal.

776
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,640
How can I stay calm?

777
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,300
Tell me.

778
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:05,650
We haven't

779
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,060
found any evidence yet.

780
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,150
It's just a theory.

781
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,220
Think about it.

782
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,810
After Marquis Xian died,

783
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,980
who led us

784
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,860
towards Administer Deng?

785
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:15,980
Shopkeeper Li.

786
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,790
But I don't know

787
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,860
why he lied.

788
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,610
Think about it deeper.

789
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,930
Marquis Xian was killed

790
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,040
must be because

791
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,740
there's someone with more power behind him

792
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,090
who is in charge of Snow Chamber.

793
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,250
Then would Shopkeeper Li

794
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,980
have such an identity?

795
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,800
Shopkeeper Li lays low.

796
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,850
He's just someone who runs errands.

797
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:40,980
Given his ability,

798
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,210
he won't be able to set up such a big trap.

799
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,570
If he had lied,

800
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,350
he must have been instigated by someone.

801
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,740
But he is interrogated by

802
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,810
my brother personally.

803
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:49,940
It's impossible.

804
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,840
Could it be you suspect my elder brother?

805
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:08,630
How is that possible?

806
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,130
Impossible.

807
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,180
I've been by his side for so many years.

808
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,860
I saw him every day.

809
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,380
He would never be

810
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,200
a member of Snow Chamber.

811
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,050
What's wrong with you two?

812
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,500
You're suspecting people around you

813
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,960
without any evidence.

814
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,240
It's not that they have no evidence.

815
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,900
The Crown Prince is just too cunning.

816
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:25,740
General.

817
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,980
Is everything done?

818
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,260
We were quick.

819
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,100
They thought Administer Deng lost his way

820
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,780
and have yet reported it yet.

821
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,790
I left Administer Deng

822
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,770
at the entrance of his residence

823
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,400
and fed him medicine.

824
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,820
Even if he wakes up,

825
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,500
he won't know

826
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,460
what happened today.

827
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,660
In this way,

828
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,930
we won't alert them.

829
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,020
Alert them?

830
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,010
You think you'd alert my brother?

831
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:48,680
Your Highness,

832
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,800
to be honest,

833
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:50,900
I just went to

834
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,410
the Law Department on my way just now.

835
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,540
You went to see Shopkeeper Li?

836
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,990
Did he say something again?

837
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,500
He lied before.

838
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,890
He might still be lying this time.

839
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,220
He didn't lie.

840
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,220
He's dead.

841
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,000
Dead?

842
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,700
Why hasn't the Inspection Bureau

843
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,540
heard anything about this?

844
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,270
The Inspection Bureau is but a subordinate of the Law Department.

845
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,850
It's not difficult if they want to hide something

846
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:11,940
from us.

847
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,430
Maybe it's because

848
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,900
he wants to die,

849
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,940
right?

850
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,140
Perhaps,

851
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,290
when Shopkeeper Li was sentenced

852
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,250
to be exiled to the far north,

853
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,430
he had already hung himself in the poison

854
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,700
to commit suicide before he was exiled.

855
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,870
But report lacks details.

856
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,460
It was deliberately kept from the Inspection Bureau,

857
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,400
and as the chief judge of this case,

858
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,050
and also our close friend, the Crown Prince

859
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,550
has never informed us of this.

860
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,390
There are various signs.

861
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,550
I can't find

862
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,420
a reason to defend him.

863
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,460
Impossible.

864
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,340
Even so, it can't be my elder brother.

865
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,510
He must have been framed.

866
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,300
You must be mistaken.

867
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:53,660
Chilan won't make

868
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
speculations without evidence.

869
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,170
She must have found something else.

870
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,780
The report is not clear.

871
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,540
He has been dead for so long

872
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,380
and the body has been missing.

873
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,500
So I went to the prison.

874
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,590
Shopkeeper Li's cell has been cleaned.

875
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,219
There is indeed markings made from

876
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,260
something heavy hanging from

877
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,370
the wooden fence

878
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,120
as written in the report.

879
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,639
The scent in the prison cell

880
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:34,360
was deliberately cleaned.

881
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:36,239
I can't smell anything that's obviously wrong.

882
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,380
But I found some clues

883
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:42,929
with my own ways.

884
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,260
Have a look.

885
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:52,290
What is this?

886
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:53,820
This is a small scratch

887
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,770
by the bed that'd be easily overlooked.

888
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,800
But us Chiqi Tribe

889
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,270
know a lot about craftsmanship

890
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,820
and scratches.

891
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,690
I noticed

892
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,670
this scratch is unlike the other scratches in its surroundings.

893
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,380
It should be newly made.

894
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,460
I know this.

895
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,830
New scratches

896
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,940
will cover the old scratches.

897
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,380
That's how you determine what's newer.

898
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,060
Yes.

899
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,400
And based on my experience,

900
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,270
these are the scratches caused by

901
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,540
nails scratching on it.

902
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,840
With this,

903
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,260
I followed the clues

904
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,640
and used something new us Chiqi Tribe

905
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,310
recently came up with.

906
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,290
The blood in the gap caused by the scratch

907
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,490
is the same as Shopkeeper Li's scent.

908
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,960
A small drop of blood on the bed frame.

909
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,650
Could there be a

910
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,940
possibility that Shopkeeper Li

911
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,600
accidentally hurt himself?

912
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,420
It doesn't mean anything.

913
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,700
Of course there's something else.

914
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,430
Shopkeeper Li is 181cm tall.

915
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,250
If he sat by the wall,

916
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,150
his head will be in the pool of blood,

917
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,410
and his hand would naturally be drooping,

918
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,940
covering this

919
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,700
pattern.

920
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,910
I suspect the injury was inflicted on him by someone.

921
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,660
His head was injured.

922
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,740
While he was dying,

923
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,810
he knew he couldn't save himself,

924
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,540
so he used this method

925
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,140
to leave a clue.

926
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,400
Shopkeeper Li likes stories.

927
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,170
He's been like this

928
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,740
since the Painting Case.

929
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,590
He's planned so many cases,

930
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,330
so,

931
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,180
he must be trying to deliver

932
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,180
an important information

933
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,260
so that we can know

934
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,200
who the murderer is.

935
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,380
What does this pattern

936
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,420
mean?

937
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,300
I'm guessing he was trying to say that

938
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,150
it was Ah Qi who killed him.

939
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,500
How did you know that?

940
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,190
Because it means

941
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,580
- is–
- Is seven.

942
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,060
Exactly.

943
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,780
Shopkeeper Li uses the abacus a lot.

944
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,570
One bead on top

945
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,500
and two below

946
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,080
means seven on the abacus.

947
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,070
I still remember

948
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,340
he once told me...

949
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,100
Seven times seven equals to 49.

950
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:17,940
Inspector Su,

951
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,710
your name is very special.

952
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,910
Jiu'er, Jiu'er,

953
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,110
nine two, nine two.

954
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
I can hide you

955
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,220
in the abacus

956
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,180
so easily.

957
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,950
Nine two, nine two.

958
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,820
This Crown Prince

959
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,860
is hiding so well.

960
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,790
If it weren't for

961
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,060
these details,

962
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,800
we may never

963
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,490
find traces of him.

964
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,660
But these evidences are not enough.

965
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,350
It only shows that

966
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,890
the master and servant are very suspicious.

967
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,780
Unless Shopkeeper Li's body

968
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,950
matches these information.

969
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,600
But too long has passed,

970
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,210
the body has gone missing.

971
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,450
You're right, Jiu'er.

972
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,430
Father won't believe that

973
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,810
Elder Brother plotted everything

974
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,580
and poisoned Qi people.

975
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,580
Much less asking him to withdraw his edict.

976
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,100
But Jun,

977
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:22,810
what about you?

978
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,540
I...

979
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:25,890
I don't know.

980
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,480
I'm a little tired.

981
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,400
I'll go back first.

982
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,300
Don't worry.

983
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,620
He will figure it out himself.

984
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,720
It's late now.

985
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,840
Let me send you home.

986
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:48,910
So,

987
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,980
what should we do next?

988
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,140
Let's take a rest first.

989
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,670
We need further consideration.

990
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:26,810
Your Highness.

991
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,090
It's late.

992
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,260
I can't sleep.

993
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:35,570
Your Highness,

994
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,480
did something sad happen today?

995
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:39,850
Liu Fu.

996
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,130
I...

997
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,440
I can't tell you.

998
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,460
Your Highness,

999
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,260
no matter what happens,

1000
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,620
don't make it hard for yourself

1001
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,600
or doubt yourself.

1002
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,940
Trust your own eyes.

1003
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,590
Why do you say that?

1004
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,360
I've served you for so many years.

1005
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,110
I know what you care about the most.

1006
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,190
You only want to protect

1007
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,490
the person you cherish the most.

1008
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,020
What if

1009
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,000
I have made a misjudgement about someone?

1010
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,220
How could you make a misjudgement?

1011
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,370
Why not?

1012
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,250
Back then, I was wronged

1013
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,980
in the inner court.

1014
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,600
It was you who trusted me

1015
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,350
and cleared my name

1016
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,980
so I am who I am today.

1017
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,460
As the saying goes,

1018
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,890
people use their eyes to judge people,

1019
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,120
and the inspectors use truth to judge people.

1020
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,350
But I think

1021
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,750
they are not as good as you.

1022
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,640
Your Highness,

1023
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,970
you use sincerity to judge people.

1024
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,780
What you said

1025
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:42,860
makes sense.

1026
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,450
Your Highness, have you understood?

1027
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,400
No.

1028
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,480
But,

1029
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,260
you're right.

1030
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,600
You can't fool people with hypocrisy.

1031
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,920
I know him the most

1032
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,740
in this world.

1033
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,510
I want to prove this innocence

1034
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,020
to my friends.

1035
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,890
Or

1036
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,470
find his reasons.

1037
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:05,940
Yes.

1038
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,000
I can't run away.

1039
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,830
I must help him.

1040
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,020
Liu Fu.

1041
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,640
Check something for me tomorrow.

1042
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:18,370
Remember,

1043
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,220
be very careful.

1044
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,550
I will help you.

1045
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,430
Isn't Qiwei Restaurant closed down?

1046
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,030
Why do I smell

1047
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,090
Qiwei Restaurant's

1048
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,110
yellow wine beef

1049
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,100
and Jiu'er favorite,

1050
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,580
Deyue Restaurant's meat bun

1051
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,660
from your lunch box?

1052
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,510
That's what you should do.

1053
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,940
I won't fight for it.

1054
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,580
As for Qixiang Restaurnt,

1055
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,280
although the shop is closed,

1056
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,640
it's easy

1057
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:09,880
to find a cook.

1058
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,140
I made this bowl

1059
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,370
for you.

1060
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,960
This is for Jiu'er.

1061
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,020
This is for me?

1062
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,380
Yes.

1063
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,230
Didn't you prepare one

1064
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,810
for me too?

1065
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,070
Then let's

1066
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,360
eat together when Jiu'er's here.

1067
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,420
Jun.

1068
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,420
You... You're here.

1069
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:02,750
What are you talking about?

1070
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,870
Aren't we partners?

1071
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,730
It's the rule to pick you up in the morning.

1072
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:07,980
Besides,

1073
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,310
how could you do this without me?

1074
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:13,490
What's wrong?

1075
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,340
Everyone is here.

1076
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,260
Yes.

1077
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,900
We can't do this with anyone here missing.

1078
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,180
Come on, General.

1079
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,090
Let's eat together.

1080
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,200
Here.
