[Episode 2]

4
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,450
Get on.

5
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,790
Ouch!

6
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,020
The fire...

7
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,230
Go up there quickly.

8
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:23,840
Let's go.

9
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,370
Why does the fire burn so fiercely?

10
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,660
It's too high.

11
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,470
If we jump from this height,

12
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,110
we'll be crippled if not dead.

13
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,040
So troublesome.

14
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,800
Help!

15
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,670
Flower and Willow Hall is on fire!

16
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,580
Flower and Willow Hall is on fire!

17
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,090
Hurry!

18
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,520
Go get water.

19
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,910
Come quickly and give us a hand!

20
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,410
Hurry.

21
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Go get some water.

22
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,720
It's so warm.

23
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,950
So comfortable.

24
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,520
What's going on?

25
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,470
Why does it feel like this again?

26
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,120
Why do I feel so much better

27
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,250
when I touch him?

28
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,210
Comfortable.

29
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:34,970
Get up.

30
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,290
He's awake.

31
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,900
Hold on.

32
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,850
How did he know I was awake?

33
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,200
No way.

34
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,030
I must go back to sleep.

35
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,630
How long

36
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,050
are you going to lay on me?

37
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,150
Get up.

38
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,280
If you don't,

39
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,360
you're doomed.

40
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,110
I'll get up now.

41
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,110
I just woke up.

42
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,870
Just woke up?

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,350
Don't you know

44
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,630
the heartbeat of fainting

45
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,430
is different from the wake-up heartbeat?

46
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,490
I fell

47
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,490
from such a high place.

48
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,750
It makes sense that I couldn't get up in such a short period.

49
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:09,810
Let me ask you.

50
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,790
Are you

51
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,670
severely ill?

52
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,010
Why is your body so hot?

53
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,140
Your body is so cold.

54
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,660
What happened exactly?

55
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,470
You are the sick one.

56
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,510
I asked you first.

57
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,420
Our Qi people are born with high body temperature.

58
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,550
What's the big deal?

59
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:24,830
But...

60
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,880
why don't I feel this way

61
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,090
when I touch other Qi people?

62
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,700
Do you

63
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,300
have any particular feelings

64
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,300
when touching me?

65
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,030
Well,

66
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,590
thank you

67
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,960
for not throwing me into the fire just now.

68
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,770
I was in a thoughtless moment.

69
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Wait for a moment.

70
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,230
Why are you looking for

71
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,960
the Qi people with three scars?

72
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,230
How do you know I am looking for him?

73
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,390
During the interrogation,

74
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,050
I knew already you weren't the culprit.

75
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,280
You are not interested

76
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,500
in the case at all.

77
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,930
What you are interested in

78
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,630
is the Qi people with three scars.

79
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,230
Am I right?

80
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,220
Flower and Willow Hall is the next place to dump bodies.

81
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,550
That's why you're here.

82
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,710
Your action

83
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,490
has proved my thoughts again.

84
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,470
You little girl.

85
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,830
You're smart.

86
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,590
Since

87
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,640
I'm so smart,

88
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,170
can you give me back the file

89
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,450
and come with me to the Inspection Bureau

90
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,850
and explain everything?

91
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,590
Does it sound good?

92
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:16,990
No.

93
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,400
Why?

94
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,550
This time, I came here secretly.

95
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,850
I have a special identity.

96
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,210
If the Qian race finds out,

97
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,140
makes a big fuss,

98
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,920
and spreads it to the old man,

99
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,550
I won't be able to find the person anymore.

100
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,510
I hate

101
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,700
you, the smart-alecky Qian race,

102
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,940
the most.

103
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,620
Don't assume that

104
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,770
we can work together

105
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,190
just because we share the same goal.

106
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,710
I can save your life when I am happy.

107
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,710
Once I feel upset,

108
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,840
I can

109
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,610
rip your throat at any moment.

110
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,170
Hold on.

111
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,690
Wait.

112
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,950
Previously, you made me lose my job.

113
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,040
A moment ago, you saved my life.

114
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,280
We're even now.

115
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,230
How about

116
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,710
we make a clean break?

117
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,510
A clean break?

118
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,190
Make peace.

119
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,520
From now on,

120
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,160
I won't arrest you anymore.

121
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,410
Let's go our separate ways.

122
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,690
First, she wants to touch me.

123
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,160
Second, she's cheating again.

124
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,450
My h-h-hand.

125
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,580
You just said you wouldn't arrest me.

126
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,530
You brat.

127
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,990
What is this?

128
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,190
Qian race is indeed cunning.

129
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,560
This should be

130
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,600
the so-called

131
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,070
weapon of restraint for Qi, right?

132
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,800
I heard it is a good experience.

133
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,190
Do you want to try it?

134
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,159
No, no, I don't.

135
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,320
I don't want it.

136
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,890
Please don't.

137
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,750
No! No!

138
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,630
No!

139
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,800
Where is he?

140
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,659
Come and take a look.

141
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,410
Slow down.

142
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,680
Slow down.

143
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,030
Are you okay?

144
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,940
I'm fine.

145
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,590
I'm sorry.

146

[He'an Hall]

147
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,870
What are you thinking?

148
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,530
I'm pondering something.

149
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:37,510
What is it?

150
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,640
Do you believe

151
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,990
I met someone

152
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,900
who elicited a unique reaction

153
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,110
from me?

154
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,520
Yes, I do.

155
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,290
Do you believe that

156
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,680
after I met this person,

157
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,930
I no longer felt cold,

158
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,700
and all my symptoms

159
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,900
were getting better?

160
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:58,800
Yes, I do.

161
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,130
Yes, yes.

162
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,670
Why do you believe in everything?

163
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,310
Even I don't believe it myself.

164
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,150
Silly girl.

165
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,950
I also know

166
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,220
the person you met is a man.

167
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,230
How do you know?

168
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,210
Because this magical power

169
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,680
that can bring people back to life

170
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,890
is

171
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,530
love!

172
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,640
Love

173
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,540
can make someone powerful,

174
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,420
make someone invulnerable

175
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,330
and never fear the cold.

176
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,049
All you know is to laugh.

177
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,289

share these with you

179
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,380
who are obsessed with "The Romance of the West Chamber?"

180
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,630
Forget it. I was wrong.

181
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,490
I'll quit sharing these with you.

182
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,740
Who is the person

183
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,080
you just mentioned?

184
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,929
No one.

185
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,210
-Jiu'er. Who is it?
-I'm going to sleep.

186
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,670
It's going to rain soon. You should go back too.

187
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,480
Tell me.

188
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,940
Remember to put out the fire.

189
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,360
So mysterious.

190
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,800
It must be a man.

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,330
Still trying to fool me?

192
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,210
This guy is so strange.

193
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,400
Why do I feel so comfortable

194
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,990
every time I contact him?

195
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,790
And no one has dumped the body after the fire.

196
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,460
So...

197
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,110
Who exactly is he?

198
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,080
Who is it?

199
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,670
It's me, Hu.

200
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,910
Hu?

201
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,930
Is she asleep already?

202
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,400
Jiu'er had fallen asleep earlier.

203
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,620
Don't tell me you're here to ask her to join an investigation.

204
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,490
If you're here to discuss work matters with her,

205
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,410
you'd better leave now.

206
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,210
I don't agree.

207
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,040
Fine.

208
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,080
Since she is already asleep, just forget it.

209
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,720
We'll talk tomorrow morning.

210
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,200
Oh yeah.

211
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,900
When Jiu'er wakes up tomorrow,

212
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,900
tell her

213
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,350
to come to me first.

214
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,800
Don't rush to the Inspection Bureau.

215
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,390
Got it.

216
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,090
Hu. Hu.

217
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,780
Why are you here at this hour?

218
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,310
She's awake.

219
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,830
Did I

220
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,830
wake you up?

221
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,540
No worries. I wasn't sleeping.

222
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,670
Is something wrong?

223
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,310
How about we talk inside?

224
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,180
Why bother to talk inside?

225
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,080
What are you doing?

226
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,230
Are you hiding something from me?

227
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,960
Don't go elsewhere. Talk here.

228
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:01,560
Okay.

229
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,460
Okay, let's talk here.

230
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,690
I was drunk during the day.

231
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,710
How did the fire accident

232
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,810
turn out?

233
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,850
Where did the fire accident happen?

234
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,420
I accidentally

235
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,320
knocked over a brazier today.

236
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,310
It's okay.

237
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,470
Did you catch him?

238
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,670
He ran away.

239
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,270
It's okay.

240
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,650
Let's sit down and talk.

241
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:21,810
It's okay.

242
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,850
Later on, I will

243
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,050
think of another way.

244
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,080
Most importantly,

245
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,130
Yan Kuan doesn't know

246
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,270
we went to Flower and Willow Hall to catch the culprit.

247
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,120
So, he won't

248
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,150
suspect you

249
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,500
of relating to the fire.

250
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,790
But there's one thing.

251
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,050
Don't turn yourself in

252
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,290
and take the blame.

253
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,760
Yes.

254
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,890
Although I don't know

255
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,140
what you are talking about,

256
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,320
you mustn't take the blame

257
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,070
for the fire.

258
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,220
Don't worry.

259
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,800
Regarding the fire,

260
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
I will definitely not plead guilty.

261
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,030
Hu.

262
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,940
You came to visit me at this hour.

263
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,270
Is there anything else?

264
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,920
Let me in on it.

265
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,530
The three-scar Qi man has dumped the body again.

266
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,330
Right at Flower and Willow Hall.

267
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,040
What bad luck.

268
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,930
The body dump and the fire accident happened at the same time.

269
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,260
How can I find any clues?

270
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,470
Take him away.

271
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,830
You two may call it a day.

272
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,050
Thank you, sir.

273
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,110
Let's ask

274
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,190
the neighbors nearby

275
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,700
to see

276
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,670
how the fire started.

277
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,290
I got the result.

278
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,430
Let's report to the Commander immediately.

279
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,810
Let's go.

280
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,910
No wonder the silly girl

281
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,240
didn't catch up with me.

282
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,350
But it's good.

283
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,420
I won't be distracted for guarding against her.

284
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,960
Why is he so weird?

285
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,110
He has

286
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:09,990
no smell at all.

287
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,710
I can't even tell

288
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,070
whether he's Qi or Qian.

289
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,850
Who are you?

290
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,360
He's skillful in martial arts.

291
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,620
Who exactly is he?

292
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,400
Have you all noticed it?

293
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,970
Lord Jiang was pierced through his chest

294
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,450
by the rope.

295
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,840
His heart was ripped out

296
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,960
of here.

297
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,180
The body was hung on the bucket hook.

298
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,380
The rest of his wounds

299
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,180
are the same as the first two corpses.

300
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,040
There are traces of being bitten.

301
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,660
At one go, ripped out the beauty's heart.

302
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,260
Spat it out at the lush Flower and Willow Park.

303
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,920
It seems

304
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,340
this is really a nursery crime case.

305
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:30,880
Yes.

306
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,120
-You're right.
-A nursery crime case.

307
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,970
The well that dumped the body

308
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,420
has the same water source as Flower and Willow Hall.

309
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,540
We only cared about the bathhouse,

310
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,760
but we forgot about the surroundings.

311
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,790
When did you find the body?

312
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,520
When putting out the fire.

313
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,000
Fire!

314
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,140
Help!

315
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,680
Get some water! Hurry!

316
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:53,590
Hurry.

317
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:54,880
This way.

318
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,320
Coming.

319
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,350
More water.

320
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,630
Come on, water is here.

321
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,420
Hurry!

322
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,680
Someone's dead!

323
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,180
Hurry!

324
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,190
Didn't anyone use the well

325
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,180
before the fire?

326
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,190
Why no one found such a big body?

327
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,050
Before the fire,

328
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,380
someone used this well.

329
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,970
But there was nothing inside.

330
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,560
It means

331
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,710
someone took advantage of the fire

332
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,330
and dumped the body into the well

333
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,560
in such a short time.

334
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,750
That's right.

335
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,800
That's impossible.

336
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,740
I think so.

337
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,590
Look.

338
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,430
Jiu.

339
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,910
If you have any clues,

340
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,020
why don't you

341
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,850
share with us?

342
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,180
Hu just told me

343
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,400
the murderer must be very familiar

344
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,470
with the layout near Flower and Willow Hall.

345
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,430
Otherwise, it wouldn't have been so speedy.

346
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,480
It could be a cart

347
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,100
or a carriage used to transport the body.

348
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,550
Otherwise, it's too showy.

349
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:49,950
Right?

350
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,990
Wait.

351
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,150
Slow down.

352
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:56,630
Are you okay?

353
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,270
I'm fine.

354
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,950
I'm sorry.

355
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,700
Go on. What's wrong?

356
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,050
Nothing.

357
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,350
How about we

358
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,470
ask the neighbors

359
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,530
if they have

360
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,820
seen such a suspicious person?

361
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,560
I've already asked

362
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,770
the neighbors.

363
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,790
But there are some doubts

364
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,720
that confuse me.

365
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,270
Just speak it out.

366
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,440
The neighbors said

367
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,990
before and after the incident,

368
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,230
a woman was tangling up

369
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,710
with a Qi.

370
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,680
She even fell

371
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,030
from the second floor of Flower and Willow Hall,

372
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,550
lying on that Qi.

373
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,530
They said the woman's traits

374
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,970
were similar to Jiu's.

375
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,350
Is that Qi

376
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,770
the one

377
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,470
who made a scene at Inspection Bureau's office?

378
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,420
What are you talking about?

379
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,210
Girl.

380
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,100
Isn't it your turn

381
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,330
to explain

382
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,440
where you were during the fire?

383
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,800
And

384
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,390
what's with

385
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,250
this burnt hair mark?

386
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,790
Where is the Qi man?

387
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,270
Move your hand away.

388
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,320
What are you doing?

389
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,170
Are you pretending to be a detective?

390
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,240
Talking nonsense about

391
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,100
the burnt hair.

392
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,060
Jiu'er was at home,

393
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,180
helping her mother cook.

394
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,830
She burnt her hair accidentally.

395
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,500
So what?

396
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,700
What did you mean just now?

397
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,570
Are you suspecting that

398
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,590
Jiu'er and the Qi man are in cahoots?

399
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,110
Hu Badao.

400
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,970
You're just being unreasonable.

401
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,530
We're solving the case, right?

402
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,560
If we have any clues

403
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,130
showing Jiu'er is involved,

404
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,600
we have to get to the bottom of it.

405
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,070
Yue Daren.

406
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,800
You bastard!

407
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,750
What's wrong?

408
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,560
Bad news!

409
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,360
Bad news!

410
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,460
Boss!

411
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,320
Bad news!

412
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,750
The owner of Flower and Willow Hall,

413
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,640
Mr. Jin is here.

414
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,570
He said the one who set the fire

415
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,030
was in Inspection Bureau.

416
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
Did you hear that?

417
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,950
Tell me.

418
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,670
Who burned my Flower and Willow Hall?

419
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,710
What?

420
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,040
Neither of you takes the blame?

421
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,220
You inspectors

422
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,830
are really not having a guilty conscience.

423
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,350
Mr. Jin.

424
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,830
You can't say that.

425
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,110
I think there must be

426
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,510
some misunderstanding.

427
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,319
The Silla paper.

428
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,400
This is exclusively for officials.

429
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,270
Not only is there

430
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,589
the official seal of the Inspection Bureau,

431
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,750
but also the signature.

432
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,490
This must be left by

433
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,950
the arsonist.

434
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,710
Wang Tianyun.

435
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,240
Here.

436
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,599
Take a look.

437
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,170
It's mine?

438
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,020
Why did you go to the bathhouse?

439
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,790
Did you set the fire?

440
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,840
Oh no.

441
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,090
I've caused trouble for Tianyun.

442
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,230
It's been two days.

443
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,310
Nothing here.

444
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,320
He might show up soon.

445
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,790
I...

446
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,520
Tell me.

447
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,100
It's me.

448
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,160
It's me.

449
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,910
How dare you,

450
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,550
an ignorant little girl,

451
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,350
to burn my Flower and Willow Hall?

452
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:56,950
Sir,

453
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,110
I made a mistake.

454
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,220
I went to Flower and Willow Hall

455
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,180
to block that Qi.

456
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,140
Who knows

457
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,480
I accidentally

458
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,450
knocked over the brazier.

459
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,330
Where is that Qi?

460
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,510
He

461
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,260
ran away.

462
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,030
Is he the one who dumped the body?

463
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,880
No.

464
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,270
When the murderer dumped the body,

465
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,590
he was trapped in the bathhouse with me.

466
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,950
He wouldn't be able to spare any time.

467
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,410
He could be an accomplice.

468
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,990
He deliberately created chaos

469
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,770
so that the three-scar Qi could dump the body.

470
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,570
That's right.

471
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,880
But

472
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,210
that day, he pretended to be three-scar Qi

473
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,550
and made a scene at Inspection Bureau

474
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,390
to get

475
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,230
the clues of the three-scar Qi man.

476
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,230
In this case,

477
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,820
he can't be

478
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,730
in cahoots with the three-scar Qi.

479
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,060
That's just your guess.

480
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,710
Enough.

481
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,140
It's your business

482
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,540
to investigate the case.

483
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,840
I'm not interested.

484
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,130
Commander Yan.

485
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,270
She admitted

486
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,470
she burned my bathhouse.

487
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,800
She must compensate me.

488
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,540
Sir,

489
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,750
I have a question.

490
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,450
How much money

491
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,830
is your bathhouse worth?

492
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,030
One hundred taels.

493
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,820
One hundred taels?

494
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,920
One hundred taels...

495
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,680
One...

496
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,750
If I say

497
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,170
I can't afford it,

498
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,870
what should we do?

499
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,120
According to the Great Qian's law,

500
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,120
I'll send you to prison for 10-year punishment.

501
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:14,900
Ten...

502
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,350
Don't.

503
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,400
T-T-Ten years?

504
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,280
I have money.

505
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,350
I'll spare you half a month.

506
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,970
I want to see the money,

507
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,070
one hundred taels.

508
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,270
If one tael is missing,

509
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,470
we will meet in court.

510
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,150
Commander Yan.

511
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,310
By then,

512
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,360
you won't cover up for your men, will you?

513
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,870
Commander Yan.

514
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,840
No doubt I will deal with it impartially.

515
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,190
But

516
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,870
Su Jiu'er

517
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,860
is no longer

518
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,080
my inferior anymore.

519
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,650
Yan Kuan.

520
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,630
What do you mean

521
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,590
by saying this?

522
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,780
You also pack your things and get out.

523
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,240
I made it clear that day.

524
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,810
If you couldn't catch that Qi

525
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,750
who made a scene at Inspection Bureau,

526
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,550
just get lost!

527
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,980
Why should I keep you?

528
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,120
Leave now.

529
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,830
Fine.

530
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,210
I don't want to serve you anymore.

531
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,790
Girl, don't worry.

532
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,310
After selling Hu's ancestral house,

533
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,870
we can get at least 100 taels.

534
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,590
By then,

535
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,990
we just throw the money in his face.

536
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,220
Let's go.

537
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,720
Godfather.

538
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,920
Where does Su Jiu'er live?

539
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,830
What does she do for a living?

540
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,060
I can't let her run away.

541
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,270
Her mother has a pharmacy

542
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,340
at Shou'an Pavilion.

543
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,400
Her father, Su Huan

544
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,780
was also

545
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,880
expelled from Inspection Bureau

546
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,150
because he failed in a case.

547
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,150
Like father,

548
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:24,930
like daughter.

549
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,410
Girl.

550
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,290
Girl...

551
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,940
Look carefully.

552
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,220
Whoever catches the murderer

553
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,950
will be rewarded with 100 taels.

554
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,120
It doesn't say

555
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,000
the inspectors of the Inspection Bureau don't count.

556
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,320
Of course

557
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,010
it's valid for the inspectors.

558
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,690
But you can't even

559
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,960
serve the tea.

560
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,830
Are you dreaming to catch the Qi with three scars?

561
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,630
That's right.

562
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,500
If I say after my foster father and I

563
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,380
end this case,

564
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,130
the Inspection Bureau

565
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,070
must accept us.

566
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,470
What do you think?

567
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,680
Okay.

568
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,800
I'll give you half a month.

569
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,280
Within half a month,

570
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,990
surely I can catch the murderer.

571
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,720
At that time,

572
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,470
I hope you can

573
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,670
make a formal apology

574
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,110
in front of everyone

575
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,670
for insulting my father.

576
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,030
Yes.

577
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,390
Okay.

578
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,610
Deal.

579
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,310
[Reward]

580
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,310
I think

581
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,450
you are very confident

582
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,680
in this case.

583
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,210
You surely have a well-thought-out plan.

584
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,760
That's wine.

585
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,970
What's wrong with you?

586
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,350
Actually,

587
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,450
I still want to cry.

588
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,820
Those are 100 taels.

589
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,860
It's fine.

590
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,910
I have money.

591
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,080
At worst,

592
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,860
I'll sell the ancestral house.

593
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,500
Once you sell the ancestral house

594
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,170
and lose your job at Inspection Bureau,

595
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,770
how do you live in the future?

596
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,960
Live like how it is supposed to be.

597
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,090
What am I afraid of?

598
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,040
Take it one step at a time.

599
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,380
I've made the promise.

600
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,800
I must solve this case.

601
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,330
Otherwise,

602
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,040
not only did I implicate you,

603
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,470
but also humiliated my father.

604
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,190
Fine.

605
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:12,920
Well.

606
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,400
Let me test you.

607
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,470
At one go, ripped out the beauty's heart.

608
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,430
Spat it out at the lush Flower and Willow Park.

609
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,460
What's the next line?

610
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,010
Severed in one bite, the beauty's head.

611
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,190
Throw it out at the gate of hell, under the moon.

612
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,150
Let me ask you again.

613
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,430
Four officials went missing.

614
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,920
How long is the interval

615
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,270
between a body dump?

616
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,230
Seven days.

617
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,790
Okay.

618
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,990
How long is the interval between three body dumps?

619
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,920
Seven days also.

620
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,440
This is the clue, my dear.

621
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,140
Seven days.

622
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,350
That's it.

623
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,860
We just need to wait for seven more days.

624
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,880
That corpse-dumper

625
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,490
will dump the body at the gate of hell again.

626
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,100
We'll wait patiently

627
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,470
and catch him by then.

628
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,630
Hu,

629
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,100
I've already thought of that.

630
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,740
Let me ask you.

631
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,670
Where is the gate of hell?

632
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,210
The so-called Qi with three scars.

633
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,230
We only know that

634
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,510
there are three scars on his face.

635
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,360
We don't know anything else.

636
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,670
Even if we

637
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,830
get to find the gate of death,

638
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,500
what if he wears a mask

639
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,270
or a hat

640
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,780
or makes a disguise?

641
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,300
It's hard to find the target.

642
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,350
Why is it so hard?

643
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,950
I remember

644
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,390
someone

645
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,750
knows more about three-scar Qi

646
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,730
than us.

647
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,350
Who?

648
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,750
Does he have the red phoenix's eyes,

649
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,550
amorous eyes,

650
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,230
almond eyes,

651
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,160
or Sanpaku eyes?

652
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,770
Red phoenix's eyes.

653
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,480
No, no.

654
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,350
Amorous eyes.

655
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,820
No, no, no.

656
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,080
I think

657
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,060
it's a combination of red phoenix eyes and amorous eyes.

658
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:47,960
Yes.

659
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,910
What about his mouth?

660
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,910
Is it big or small?

661
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,630
Are his lips red,

662
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,590
thin,

663
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,590
or thin at the top and thick at the bottom?

664
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,250
They are red

665
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,330
but not full.

666
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,050
The size is just right.

667
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,240
The corners of his mouth slightly raised.

668
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,110
However,

669
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,190
even if they're slightly raised,

670
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,120
he looks fierce.

671
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,970
Oh, my.

672
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,160
This is

673
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,280
a once-in-a-lifetime handsome man.

674
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,040
Let me see.

675
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,540
Hua,

676
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,280
your drawing skills

677
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,200
are about the same

678
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,790
as the painter at Inspection Bureau.

679
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,950
I've seen many people in my life.

680
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,720
I don't dare to say anything else.

681
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,650
But I'm really good at drawing men.

682
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,670
Is he the one

683
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,420
who makes you

684
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,600
feel love?

685
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,270
What are you doing?

686
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,250
This is the man I want to catch.

687
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,040
Show me the document.

688
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:01,820
Okay.

689
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,300
Next.

690
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,310
Show me the document.

691
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,600
Where is the document?

692
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,230
I came out in a hurry.

693
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,360
I forgot to bring it.

694
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,990
-Sir. -Take him away.

695
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,430
-Let's go.
-Sir. Sir.

696
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,230
I really forgot to bring it.

697
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,630
Hurry up.

698
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,260
Sir, I'll go home and get it now.

699
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,760
Behave yourself.

700
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,110
Sir!

701
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:21,480
Pass.

702
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,300
Here, show me the document.

703
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,630
Sir, please take a look.

704
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:31,940
Okay, next.

705
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,510
[Ten taels of silver offered to arrest the arsonist]

706
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,340
The document.

707
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:38,710
Next.

708
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,890
Stupid woman.

709
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,500
The portrait doesn't look like me at all.

710
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,760
Still want to catch me?

711
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,230
You've followed me

712
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,430
all the way in secret.

713
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
Why didn't you

714
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,710
hide your smell?

715
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,000
Show yourself.

716
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,870
May the stars bless us.

717
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,640
I thought it was someone else.

718
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,450
It turns out to be kungfu masters

719
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,680
from the four tribes.

720
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,450
Did the old man send you here?

721
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,110
His Majesty wants us to find you

722
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,960
and tell you that

723
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,540
there is a crisis in the country.

724
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,790
Your Highness should return immediately.

725
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,020
Right now, there are increasing conflicts

726
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,950
between Qi and Qian in Jiuxiao City.

727
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,880
I'm afraid someone is behind this.

728
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,630
Your Highness has a special identity.

729
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,550
If someone with an ulterior motive finds out,

730
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,170
the consequences would be too ghastly to contemplate.

731
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,500
I don't want to hurt you.

732
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,010
But to be honest,

733
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,430
you guys

734
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,920
even ten more can't take me away.

735
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,780
Your Highness.

736
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,660
Although we're in Jiuxiao City,

737
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,450
you have to follow

738
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,640
the rules of the Qi race.

739
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,730
Why bother?

740
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,830
You guys come on together.

741
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,920
Make it quick.

742
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,320
Who dares to make trouble in the city?

743
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,710
It seems to be over there.

744
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,110
Ice.

745
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,570
Your Highness.

746
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,660
How is it going?

747
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,990
There are checkpoints everywhere

748
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,450
to check the documents.

749
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,180
And I'm on the wanted list.

750
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,540
I can't do anything now.

751
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,960
When I came back,

752
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,880
I met kungfu masters from the four tribes

753
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,810
and got injured.

754
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,590
Your Highness.

755
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,750
How could you be

756
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,650
so careless?

757
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,200
Give it to me.

758
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,590
See?

759
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,590
I told you.

760
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,970
Take me with you when you go out.

761
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,620
After all, I'm from the Cangqi tribe.

762
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,550
My body works better than my brain.

763
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,320
How many people my father sent

764
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,410
do you think you can cope with?

765
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:30,950
You're right.

766
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,710
Your Highness, you are really skilled in martial arts.

767
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,550
Not many in the Qi race

768
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,750
can be your opponent.

769
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,720
But I'm your bodyguard.

770
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,250
Think about it.

771
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,110
I can be your personal bodyguard.

772
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,240
Am I right?

773
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,970
You didn't even give me

774
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,240
a chance to get hurt.

775
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,260
Have you heard a saying?

776
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,050
What is it?

777
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,660
Leaving the crowd

778
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,920
can make a person

779
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,040
calm and sober

780
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,880
and not emotional.

781
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,350
No. Who said that?

782
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,160
Your Highness.

783
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,870
Is this the reason

784
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,200
you choose to be a loner?

785
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,430
Not even willing

786
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,760
to stay in the state of Qi anymore.

787
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,220
The Holy Fire has been missing for ten years.

788
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,380
The frozen area

789
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,530
[A few months ago]

790
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,530
[Qi, King of Xueqi]

791
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,530
[Qi, Grand Preceptor, Hanlin]

792
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,330
has expanded to the far north.

793
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,760
If this continues,

794
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,380
I'm afraid it won't take decades

795
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,560
for us, the Qi race

796
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,940
to be completely frozen to death.

797
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,460
Due to the loss of protection of the Holy Fire,

798
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,550
the cold in the far north has worsened.

799
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,500
The guards were forced to retreat south.

800
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,220
However,

801
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,440
they were trapped

802
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,160
by the North Sea, which was frozen in an instant

803
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,220
due to the sudden snowstorm.

804
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,030
The North Sea is frozen!

805
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,190
Look! The snowstorm is coming!

806
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:30,670
Run!

807
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:31,950
Hurry!

808
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,150
The freeze

809
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,510
will be exposed one day.

810
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,650
Everyone in the race will know.

811
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,320
In order to survive,

812
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,230
attacking the Qian race

813
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:39,890
and expanding the territory

814
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,750
is inevitable.

815
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,700
Whether it's freeze or war,

816
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,580
both will endanger the survival of the Qi race.

817
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,780
Retrieving the Holy Fire

818
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,130
is the only solution.

819
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,950
[Qi, King of Xueqi]

820
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,810
The Holy Fire is related to the survival of our race.

821
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,710
But Muyan has been missing for 10 years.

822
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,240
We still couldn't find him.

823
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,160
[Qi, General, Chilan]

824
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,920
We have to

825
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,010
make another plan.

826
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,210
Your Majesty.

827
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,720
The state of Qian has agreed

828
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,920
to discuss

829
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,860
the details of the Qian-Qi Six Treaties with us next month.

830
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,180
This is the first step

831
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,550
our people get to move to the state of Qian.

832
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,900
You must get it done.

833
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,030
Yes.

834
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,830
Your Majesty.

835
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,350
A spy sent back the news,

836
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,790
stating a strange case had occurred in the state of Qian recently.

837
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,720
Rumor has it that

838
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,330
the murderer is

839
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,160
a Qi with three scars on his face.

840
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,500
Could it be Muyan?

841
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,760
No idea yet.

842
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,110
But I've sent a spy to follow up.

843
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,870
There will be news soon.

844
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,790
We need to set up checkpoints outside the city.

845
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,040
We can't let our people

846
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,740
near the far north again.

847
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,510
Chilan.

848
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,430
Go find Hanzheng

849
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,380
and let him guard the checkpoints.

850
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,200
If necessary,

851
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,560
let him know about the freeze.

852
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,870
It's time to let him know.

853
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,170
What about Muyan?

854
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,520
Keep it from him for now.

855
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,680
After all,

856
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,150
they are close friends.

857
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,740
Hanzheng never thought of

858
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,990
Muyan taking the holy fire

859
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,340
when he ran away.

860
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,450
All right, you two may leave.

861
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,240
Your Highness.

862
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,790
The landlady came just now.

863
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,660
She asked if

864
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,410
we have the pass.

865
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,710
If not,

866
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,300
she has to take this place back.

867
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,800
Why does Jiuxiao City

868
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,260
against Qi people like that?

869
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,150
Maybe we can

870
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,110
go back to Shuobei first.

871
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,840
Impossible.

872
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,070
So many Qi people

873
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,100
live here.

874
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,120
Why can't I?

875
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,520
I won't go back

876
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,710
until I find Muyan.

877
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,110
Muyan is also a Qi.

878
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,120
How could he

879
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,030
go freely?

880
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,130
Is it possible that

881
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,560
he is not in Jiuxiao City?

882
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,290
Maybe there's another possibility.

883
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,090
He has been

884
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,230
working with Qian people all this while.

885
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,020
Yes.

886
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,590
The two people last night

887
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,190
might be his friends.

888
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:13,810
So they don't have

889
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,670
the smell of Qi,

890
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,040
nor the smell of Qian.

891
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,310
Only a few people know

892
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,889
how to cover the smell with herbs.

893
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,409
Your Highness,

894
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,850
I have an idea.

895
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,179
We can find a Qian to work with.

896
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,719
Nonsense.

897
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,670
Your Highness doesn't even want

898
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,370
to be my partner.

899
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:31,920
How could you

900
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,880
work with Qian?

901
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,570
I don't believe

902
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,940
there is no other way.

903
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:36,909
A way?

904
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,500
There is one.

905
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,440
Tell me.

906
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,110
When I went to buy the ice,

907
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,469
I met a child from the Qi race.

908
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:44,110
He said only the Inspection Bureau

909
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,370
has the original pass.

910
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,219
But there is a place

911
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,480
we can counterfeit the documents.

912
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,080
Can we really fool them?

913
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,780
[Qi, Kaka]

914
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,130
Your Highness.

915
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:57,590
Come on.

916
00:34:59,110 --> 00:34:59,470
Kaka.

917
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,340
What took you so long?

918
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,670
Hurry up and do it for us.

919
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,630
It's him, right?

920
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,070
Yes.

921
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,320
Come with me.

922
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,640
Kaka, you're here again.

923
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,090
Cheng, so early?

924
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,150
It's late already.

925
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,770
Kaka is here.

926
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,600
Calligraphy. Take a look.

927
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
-This is the new arrivals.
-No. No.

928
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,170
What do you think? Look at this.

929
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:16,740
I don't want all of those.

930
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,100
Sir.

931
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,350
It's right ahead.

932
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,190
-Let's go.
-Sir. Sir.

933
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,720
Hurry up.

934
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,480
Let's go.

935
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,190
Let me see.

936
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:25,530
[Blacksmith Shop]

937
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,700
It's here. Let's go.

938
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,370
Here we are.

939
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,350
Boss.

940
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,230
Your business is coming.

941
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,260
What do you want?

942
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,420
A pass.

943
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,390
Name.

944
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,350
Kehaku'erte.

945
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:13,820
Age?

946
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,550
Can't you tell?

947
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,220
I just finished my coming-of-age ceremony.

948
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,790
Sixty.

949
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,070
Are you stupid?

950
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,730
A forged document.

951
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,700
Why do you need real information?

952
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,590
Boss.

953
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,640
You can write the name as you like.

954
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,120
Age.

955
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,990
Fifty years old.

956
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,480
As for the identity,

957
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,060
let it be a fur merchant.

958
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,720
Just wait.

959
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,820
Here are your documents.

960
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,610
He is really from the Chiqi tribe

961
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,080
which is good at craftsmanship.

962
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,690
It looks exactly like the genuine one.

963
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,080
It's just a piece of cake.

964
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
Ten taels of gold.

965
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,820
Here,

966
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,990
there must be many people

967
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:09,990
coming to you for fake documents.

968
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,190
How is that possible?

969
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,420
Not everyone

970
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,460
can afford these 10 taels of gold.

971
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,040
If one doesn't use the real document

972
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,670
and has to spend a lot of money

973
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,430
to get a fake one from me,

974
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,660
usually

975
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,020
he has an unspoken reason.

976
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,590
Have you ever seen

977
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,930
a Qi

978
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,650
with three scars on his face?

979
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,500
It's not easy for Qi people

980
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,020
to live in Jiuxiao City.

981
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,030
Bad news! The soldiers are here!

982
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,000
Run! Run!

983
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,290
The soldiers are here! Run!

Hurry up.

Hurry up!

988
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,650
Hurry! Move! Move!

989
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,990
Your Highness, go!

990
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,630
You are wanted.

991
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,270
Go!

992
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:52,470
Hurry!

993
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:53,750
Go.

994
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,040
Get out of here first

995
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,200
and you'll be safe.

996
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,020
Leave now.

997
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,970
Why don't you

998
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,720
come with us?

999
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,010
I...

1000
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:09,890
I...

1001
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,680
Go, Your Highness.

1002
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,440
Thank you.

1003
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,030
Thank you.

1004
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,850
Such a fool.

1005
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,570
Good.

1006
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,580
Good.

1007
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,220
Good.

1008
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,190
Bravo!

1009
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,620
Bravo!

1010
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,050
Good job, girl.

1011
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:36,960
Why do I

1012
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,170
admire you so much?

1013
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,250
You're so smart.

1014
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,780
During the summer in Jiuxiao City,

1015
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,380
Qi people are afraid of heat.

1016
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,560
This Qi

1017
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,470
looks

1018
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,410
rich and fussy.

1019
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,380
So?

1020
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,780
He'll buy plenty of ice.

1021
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,420
But thanks to

1022
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,340
Hu,

1023
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,590
who has a huge social network,

1024
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,350
we were able to catch them so quickly.

1025
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,010
No worries.

1026
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,410
Asking the landlords

1027
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,630
to confirm their identities

1028
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,560
is not a big deal.

1029
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,230
Those

1030
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,820
are my old friends.

1031
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,920
We can ask them for help.

1032
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,780
Just one word.

1033
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,090
Nonetheless, my girl

1034
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,390
is so smart.

1035
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,970
You actually thought of

1036
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,810
letting Kaka, a Qi,

1037
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,150
lure him into the game.

1038
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,170
Thanks to

1039
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,820
Kaka and Granny's help.

1040
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,130
They let us know

1041
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,190
Qi people are not only afraid of fire.

1042
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,200
It really works.

1043
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,250
There's something more fatal.

1044
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,840
Don't worry.

1045
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,890
I just checked.

1046
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,720
They slept soundly

1047
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,730
like dead pigs.

1048
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,690
Godfather,

1049
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,230
do you think

1050
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,710
they will

1051
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,060
tell us everything?

1052
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,050
Don't worry.

1053
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,450
I'll lock them in the cellar

1054
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,740
and set a fire.

1055
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,470
Moreover, we can starve them for two days.

1056
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,350
I guarantee

1057
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,410
they will expose everything they do.

1058
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:04,910
Keha.

1059
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:06,640
Get up!

1060
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,760
Why is it happening again?

1061
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,660
Luckily he's here.

1062
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,360
I have to give it a try.

1063
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,520
Godfather,

1064
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,030
I suddenly thought of something.

1065
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,230
I want to go in and confirm.

1066
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,810
Wait for me.

1067
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,620
Put my onion amulet

1068
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,380
on your neck.

1069
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,150
Just in case.

1070
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,750
My Godfather is so smart.

1071
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
Be careful, girl.

1072
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,420
I'll go in first.

1073
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,800
Chilies.

1074
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,330
Onions.

1075
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,070
In fact, the Qi people are not difficult

1076
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,070
to deal with.

1077
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,320
Now that you are

1078
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,670
in my hands.

1079
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,690
It's really strange.

1080
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,940
I can see clearly again.

1081
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,100
What is this stupid woman doing?

1082
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,900
It's really strange.

1083
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,220
Why do I have

1084
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,070
such a strange feeling

1085
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,330
every time I touch him?

1086
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,090
Although I don't know

1087
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:44,960
why,

1088
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,690
if I could

1089
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,250
take him home,

1090
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,060
I can be cured.

1091
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,440
If so, can I

1092
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,640
live a long life?

1093
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,950
Live a long life?

1094
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,830
Why are you...

1095
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,460
Godfather! Godfather!

1096
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,660
Shut up!
