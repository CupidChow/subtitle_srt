[Episode 32]

4
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,140
You really kissed.

5
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:42,700
Mother.

6
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,140
Oh no.

7
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,220
I really fell in love with a Qi this time.

8
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:49,820
Wait.

9
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,340
Isn't he going back to become the King of Qi?

10
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,020
He won't refuse to take responsibility

11
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,420
for kissing you, right?

12
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,580
He won't.

13
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,140
Don't worry, Mother.

14
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,740
Han Zheng said

15
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,430
he will be victorious in the

16
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,660
Xuandong Grand Ceremony

17
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,260
and then announce to everyone

18
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,460
that he wants to marry me, Su Jiu'er.

19
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,070
Otherwise, he will refuse the throne.

20
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,740
That's great.

21
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,140
Under Han Zheng's

22
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,100
protection,

23
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,910
you can be healthy and safe,

24
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,780
and live a long life.

25
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,460
I'm relieved.

26
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,860
Mother.

27
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,920
I can finally live until an age

28
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,940
where I can care for you in your old age.

29
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,470
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
That's not right.

31
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,740
He's not

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,579
Jiuxiao City's Emperor.

33
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,210
He wants to abduct my daughter.

34
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,140
What are you thinking about, Mother?

35
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,540
How could I leave you behind

36
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,870
and go to Shuobei alone?

37
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,180
Do you mean

38
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,100
you are going to

39
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,100
give up on Prince Han for my sake?

40
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,060
No.

41
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,420
I want to bring you

42
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,980
to Shuobei with me.

43
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,900
I'll open

44
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,990
a small clinic for you there, okay?

45
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,140
Really?

46
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,660
Can a Qian

47
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,620
open a clinic in Shuobei?

48
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,340
Mother.

49
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,500
Why not?

50
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,850
Think about it, you often treat Qi people

51
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,180
here, too.

52
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,310
When you go to Qi,

53
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,500
you will be like

54
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,660
a female Bian Que

55
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,100
or a female Hua Tuo.

56
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,180
Then I will definitely become

57
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,620
the best female Qian physician in Shuobei!

58
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,900
The best female Qian physician!

59
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,540
My mother is the best.

60
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,060
Aunty Qin.

61
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,620
Do I need to wipe here too?

62
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,940
No, I'll do it.

63
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,820
It's okay. Leave it to me.

64
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,900
Han Zheng.

65
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,020
Isn't it too hard on you

66
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,020
to do this?

67
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,020
Not at all.

68
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,500
It's nothing.

69
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,860
That's the spot.

70
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,980
It's too high.

71
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,940
Jiu'er can never reach it.

72
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,140
I'll take care of this from now on.

73
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,820
It's too high here.

74
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,550
I'll be worried if you clean it.

75
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Morning, Mother.

76
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,700
Morning.

77
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,580
Morning.

78
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,420
Well...

79
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,950
You know, right?

80
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,740
I solved the siren case

81
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,420
with you,

82
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,100
so I've performed a meritorious service.

83
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,630
Commander Yan entreated me

84
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,260
to return to the Inspection Bureau.

85
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,060
He looked sincere,

86
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,780
so I agreed.

87
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,460
It's obviously because

88
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,020
the relationship between the two races has been tense,

89
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,540
so Commander Yan wants to win you over

90
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,740
to ease the tension.

91
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,420
Of course.

92
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:49,020
Your Highness is a noble man.

93
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,140
You don't bear grudges.

94
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,340
I don't bear grudges?

95
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,220
Let me tell you.

96
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,900
I bear grudges like no one else.

97
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,100
I only agreed because

98
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,060
when I'm part of the Inspection Bureau,

99
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,580
it's easier for me to investigate Mu Yan's case

100
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,620
and

101
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,080
to protect you.

102
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,180
Take a seat.

103
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,180
I have something for you.

104
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,250
What is it?

105
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,540
Why is the token this color?

106
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,660
In this way,

107
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,620
you and I

108
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,580
will be the only ones in the Inspection Bureau

109
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,110
with the exact same tokens.

110
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,260
They match too?

111
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,900
Of course.

112
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,860
So cute.

113
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,580
Let's go

114
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,460
report for duty.

115
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,140
Wait.

116
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,980
Let me put it on for you first.

117
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,700
We must also

118
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,020
tell them today

119
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,700
that we are together.

120
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,180
Are we going to make it public today?

121
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,900
Of course.

122
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,980
Soon,

123
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,260
I will announce this news

124
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,260
to the world.

125
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,740
So you mean

126
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,180
we'll test the waters

127
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,460
with the Inspection Bureau first?

128
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,659
What are you thinking about?

129
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,920
If the response is bad,

130
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,770
are you going to take it back?

131
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,940
No.

132
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,060
Let's go.

133
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,630
Let's go.

134
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,640
Brother Daren.

135
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,580
Lass.

136
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,860
Prince Han.

137
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:29,700
Lass.

138
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,140
This...

139
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,000
Brother Daren,

140
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,180
I have something to tell you.

141
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,620
We...

142
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,820
Stop talking.

143
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,460
I'm so glad

144
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,100
to see you.

145
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,580
I'm waiting for your help.

146
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,110
Come on. Don't stand there.

147
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,590
Hurry

148
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,540
What is it?

149
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,580
Pay up!

150
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:42,909
Look.

151
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,460
You owe me money!

152
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,900
No wonder it was so noisy

153
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,820
just now.

154
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,140
Jiu'er, Prince Han.

155
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,060
You're finally here.

156
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,940
Stop shouting!

157
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,630
Someone is here to help you.

158
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,659
Don't push!

159
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,400
Stop shouting!

160
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,500
Line up!

161
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,540
Calm down.

162
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,220
We worked so hard

163
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,140
for half a year.

164
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:07,700
He...

165
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,070
He refuses to pay us!

166
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,140
I've told you.

167
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,940
Your boss has already

168
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,270
run away with the money!

169
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:12,980
He's run away!

170
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
He's run away!

171
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,180
Nonsense!

172
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,280
Everyone knows

173
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:16,740
our boss

174
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,860
is extremely loyal and honest.

175
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,860
He won't run away!

176
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,620
You are a bunch of

177
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,460
dimwits.

178
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,940
Only you would believe him.

179
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,980
Why else would your boss

180
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,040
have disappeared?

181
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,420
You are so vicious!

182
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,100
You must have silenced him!

183
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,860
Nonsense!

184
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,100
What you said

185
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,050
is crazy!

186
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:33,700
Who knows?

187
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
You Qian can even

188
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,780
gorge out Qi people's Qi Vital Stones.

189
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,020
You have no conscience!

190
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,500
Yes!

191
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,540
You have no conscience!

192
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,780
You've done so much evil!

193
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,700
You...

194
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,420
Shameless!

195
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,940
You're a dog without a home!

196
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,460
What?

197
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,740
How dare you call me a dog?

198
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,540
I'll kill him!

199
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,540
I'll kill him!

200
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,740
Be quiet.

201
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,140
Listen to me.

202
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,650
Brother Daren.

203
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,300
Why did things

204
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,780
suddenly become like this?

205
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,060
Well, you know,

206
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,540
after Marquis Xian's case,

207
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,860
the Qian-Qi conflict in Jiuxiao City

208
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,780
blew up.

209
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:57,900
Many Qi people didn't want

210
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,180
stay in Jiuxiao City anymore,

211
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,340
so they left.

212
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,050
There are some who left without settling their debts.

213
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,700
It has also affected

214
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,900
Qian people's lives.

215
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,660
The conflict is getting worse and worse.

216
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,390
No one can do anything about it.

217
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,320
Stop fighting!

218
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,580
Stop shouting!

219
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,450
Stop them! Stop them!

220
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,150
[Leave No Stone Unturned]

221
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,780
Calm down.

222
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,100
Don't fight.

223
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,780
Heyin.

224
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,660
Look.

225
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,880
Do you remember

226
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,180
this was your favorite when you were young?

227
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,310
You kept pestering me to buy it for you.

228
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,620
I'm sorry.

229
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,500
What about flatbread?

230
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,409
It's the best when it's fresh.

231
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,140
Have one.

232
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,860
Brother Jun.

233
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,419
You're so noisy.

234
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,140
I'm sorry.

235
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,580
I just wanted to cheer you up.

236
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,780
I just want to be alone for a while

237
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,340
in silence.

238
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,220
Don't follow me, okay?

239
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,960
What do you want to eat?

240
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,580
What do you want to play with?

241
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,500
Tell me.

242
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,020
I'll keep you company.

243
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,540
Madam.

244
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,860
I'm sorry.

245
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,620
It's you?

246
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,300
Marquis Xian's daughter?

247
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,820
Wait.

248
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,100
Your father killed my son!

249
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,700
Calm down.

250
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,900
Give my son back to me!

251
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,980
Give my son back to me!

252
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,180
Give my son back to me!

253
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,100
Calm down.

254
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,100
Her father did so many bad things.

255
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,620
How dare she

256
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,680
show her face here?

257
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,780
My husband's Qi Vital Stone

258
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,780
is almost all gone.

259
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,340
He'll be bedridden

260
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,740
for the rest of his life.

261
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,660
What does it have to do with her?

262
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,660
She knew nothing.

263
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,590
She's innocent.

264
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,660
He destroyed my husband's life.

265
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,390
He destroyed our whole family!

266
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,700
Let's go.

267
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,660
Give my son back to me! Don't go!

268
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,930
We're finally almost done with taking testimonies.

269
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,660
Tomorrow,

270
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,150
we can deal with them

271
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,020
one by one.

272
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,500
Let's talk about tomorrow's work

273
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
tomorrow.

274
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,420
Close your eyes

275
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,110
and have a good rest.

276
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
How about we settle today's matters

277
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,220
today?

278
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,180
What else do we have to do?

279
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,140
Yue Daren.

280
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,500
Yue...

281
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,880
Your Highness.

282
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,740
You want to talk to me?

283
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,880
Brother Daren.

284
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,070
Does your back hurt?

285
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,820
A little.

286
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,580
You should have told me earlier.

287
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,820
I'll go to my mother's place tomorrow

288
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,500
to get some of her

289
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,620
special ointment for you.

290
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,500
That's great.

291
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,880
See you tomorrow, Brother Daren.

292
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,340
See you tomorrow.

293
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,900
Go on.

294
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,570
I understand.

295
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,380
I understand.

296
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,980
Our relationship is aboveboard.

297
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,420
Why are you hiding it from everyone?

298
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,380
I didn't mean to hide it.

299
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,690
I just thought

300
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,090
this isn't the right time

301
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,380
for it.

302
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,700
Why not?

303
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,100
Look.

304
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,820
Recently,

305
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,510
everyone has been so busy.

306
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,100
If we tell them now,

307
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,250
wouldn't it look like

308
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,900
we're not doing our jobs properly?

309
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,460
Right?

310
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,540
Besides,

311
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,740
even if we make it public now,

312
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,970
no one has the time

313
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,190
to congratulate us.

314
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,180
You're right.

315
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,540
Jiu'er.

316
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,660
Bad news!

317
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,670
T- The tower.

318
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,440
Prince Jun is going to jump off the building!

319
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,180
What?

320
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,580
Heyin, calm down.

321
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,300
Let me help you.

322
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,260
Don't act rashly.

323
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,820
Yes.

324
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,460
Princess,

325
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,420
please don't be impulsive.

326
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,500
If you fall from so high up,

327
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,940
your intestines will fall out!

328
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,870
Don't come over!

329
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,420
I'll jump if you come any closer.

330
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,060
No, no, no.

331
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,420
Heyin, I'm begging you.

332
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,220
Don't do this.

333
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,460
You killed my father.

334
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,460
Why won't you let me

335
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,540
reunite with them?

336
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,260
I know you hate me.

337
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,420
You can punish me however you want.

338
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,060
Heyin.

339
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,900
You must cherish

340
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,020
your life.

341
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,380
What's the use of hating you?

342
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,700
Will it make my father

343
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
come back to life?

344
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,290
I want to jump.

345
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,860
I know

346
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,580
I'll be free once I let go.

347
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,540
But I'm scared.

348
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,060
Do you think death will hurt a lot?

349
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,380
Yes.

350
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,420
Yes.

351
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,100
Do you remember when you broke your arm

352
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,620
climbing over the wall?

353
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,180
You were in pain for three whole days.

354
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,300
You couldn't even sleep.

355
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,340
If you fall from here,

356
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,400
it will hurt ten thousand times more.

357
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,900
But I really...

358
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,660
I really

359
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,040
don't have anything to live for anymore.

360
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,980
Look at those people down there.

361
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,990
Every one of them

362
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,180
hates me.

363
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,740
Everyone who cares about me

364
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,900
is already dead.

365
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,300
I really don't know

366
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,300
what I still have

367
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,260
to live for.

368
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,270
I care about you.

369
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,180
Heyin, I care about you.

370
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,340
I care about you

371
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,940
like your father did.

372
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,160
I hope things will get better for you.

373
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,580
Really?

374
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,020
Yes.

375
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,540
But I only know that

376
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,780
if I die,

377
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,680
one good thing will come out of it.

378
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,500
You will regret it

379
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,900
for the rest of your life!

380
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,840
I know Father was in the wrong,

381
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,340
but why did you

382
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,580
do that to him?

383
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,630
Father treated you so well.

384
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,020
I liked you so much.

385
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,940
Why did you do this to me?

386
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,260
This is the place!

387
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,990
Hurry up. Come and deal with it!

388
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,780
It's dangerous.

389
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,110
I think I heard it wrong.

390
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,060
It's the princess wants to jump off the building.

391
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,340
Go maintain order. Hurry up.

392
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,940
Hurry up.

393
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,860
I'll go up and stop her.

394
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,700
Step back! Step back!

395
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,300
Step back.

396
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,100
We handled Marquis Xian's case.

397
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,700
When she sees you,

398
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,500
she'll only get more agitated.

399
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,020
Right.

400
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,390
You go instead.

401
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,580
Right.

402
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,830
You can fly up

403
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,090
and get her back down.

404
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,020
I'm not going.

405
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,740
What if you get jealous

406
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,740
after I save her?

407
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,980
I promised you

408
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,780
I wouldn't fly with anyone else.

409
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,120
Why are you saying that

410
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,140
at a time like this?

411
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,700
Don't come over.

412
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,180
Heyin.

413
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,290
Come here.

414
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:07,980
Princess, be careful.

415
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,580
Calm down.

416
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,810
Don't move.

417
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,780
Come here.

418
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,300
This building is so high.

419
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,060
If you fall,

420
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,300
your intestines

421
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,340
will fall out.

422
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,170
You'll die!

423
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,380
Watch out!

424
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,180
Heyin!

425
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,300
Watch out!

426
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,460
Heyin!

427
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,320
What are you doing?

428
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,100
Heyin!

429
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,700
Come on.

430
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,100
Heyin!

431
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,560
Come on.

432
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,820
Let me help you up.

433
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,060
Heyin!

434
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,260
Brother Jun!

435
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,980
Brother Jun!

436
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,300
Brother Jun!

437
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,750
Why are you so silly?

438
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,220
You scared me to death!

439
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,150
Do you know that?

440
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,460
Brother Jun.

441
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,940
I'm so scared.

442
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,030
I don't want to die anymore.

443
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,620
I don't want to die anymore.

444
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,930
It's scary to die.

445
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,670
I don't want to die anymore.

446
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,180
Heyin.

447
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,460
Heyin.

448
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,970
I promise you.

449
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,420
The worst part of your life

450
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,350
is already over.

451
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,320
I will only do one thing in my life,

452
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,170
and that is to treat you well.

453
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,570
I'll give you everything

454
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,220
your father can give you.

455
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,020
No.

456
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,420
You must be lying to me.

457
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,300
Just like back then,

458
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,700
when you lied to me

459
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,300
so I would take you to Han Zheng.

460
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,020
I swear.

461
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,000
I will only do one thing in my life,

462
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,740
and that is to treat you well.

463
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,340
Really?

464
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,780
Yes.

465
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,660
As long as

466
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,360
you don't anything stupid again.

467
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,380
I won't do anything stupid again.

468
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,340
Brother Jun.

469
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,380
I'm glad she's fine.

470
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,980
When she fell down from above,

471
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,840
it was so scary.

472
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,180
Hong,

473
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,300
don't be afraid.

474
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,740
This is the middle of nowhere.

475
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,740
I'll protect you.

476
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,580
Come on, this way.

477
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,820
Please watch over us.

478
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,940
I'm here to help the villagers on the mountain

479
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,980
catch sheep.

480
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,940
Don't let anything happen to me.

481
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,180
Hong, wait for me.

482
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,220
Don't go anywhere, okay?

483
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,800
How can I get rid of sorrow?

484
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,220
I can only pee.

485
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,020
What is that elderly lady

486
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,300
doing here so late?

487
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,220
We have had more cases in the past couple of days

488
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,210
than over the past six months.

489
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660
I'm exhausted.

490
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,740
I can finally take a day off.

491
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,410
The paperwork, too.

492
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,900
My arm is going to break.

493
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,340
Han Zheng.

494
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,870
Help me massage it a little.

495
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,660
That's it?

496
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,980
You only wanted

497
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,140
"a little."

498
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,060
I...

499
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,590
Massage me 20 times.

500
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,860
Harder.

501
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,660
Why did you use so much pressure?

502
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,620
I'm sorry.

503
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,380
Are you in a bad mood?

504
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,900
No.

505
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,980
You're angry.

506
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,820
I said I'm not.

507
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,260
Is it because

508
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,420
I didn't find the right opportunity

509
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,780
to tell everyone that we are dating?

510
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,420
You didn't find the right opportunity?

511
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:22,930
I think

512
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,500
you just don't want to say it.

513
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,340
Of course I want to.

514
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,300
I do.

515
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,020
Look.

516
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,700
During this period,

517
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Qian-Qi conflict has been rampant.

518
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,700
Everyone in the Inspection Bureau

519
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,160
has been impossibly busy.

520
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,580
Heyin and Jun

521
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,700
are still sad.

522
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,580
If we announce that

523
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,940
we are together now,

524
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,890
it'll feel like

525
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,940
we're rubbing salt in their wounds,

526
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,460
right?

527
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,300
So as long as Qian-Qi conflict

528
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,300
doesn't subside,

529
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,660
we'll have to keep

530
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,980
sneaking around like this?

531
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,900
Of course not.

532
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,940
When everyone is done with their work,

533
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,940
and Jun and Heyin—

534
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,420
Wait.

535
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:02,940
Su Jiu'er.

536
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,940
Who am I?

537
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,220
Han Zheng.

538
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,860
You always call Wen Jun

539
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,340
"Jun."

540
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,900
But you only call me directly by my name.

541
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,380
It sounds distant.

542
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,660
I'm very unhappy.

543
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,900
Jun asked me to call him that.

544
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,940
Fine.

545
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,300
I'll give you a nickname too.

546
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,490
I call you...

547
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,180
Han'er?

548
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,500
Or...

549
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,820
Zheng'er?

550
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,180
Forget it.

551
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
Forget it.

552
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,460
How about

553
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,760
I call you Dear Han?

554
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,580
Dear Han.

555
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,580
No.

556
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,820
Forget it.

557
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,020
I won't.

558
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:58,990
Dear Han.

559
00:20:59,420 --> 00:20:59,950
Dear Han.

560
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:00,940
Dear Han!

561
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,670
Dear Han!

562
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,380
Dear Han. Dear Han.

563
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,100
Dear Han. Dear Han.

564
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,780
Dear Han.

565
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,220
How about

566
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,180
we do this?

567
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,890
After this period of time,

568
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,620
after everyone settles things

569
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,140
and feels better,

570
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,500
let's just

571
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,720
get married

572
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,310
and scare them to death.

573
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,350
Are you serious?

574
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,220
He seems serious.

575
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,780
Chilan told me

576
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:28,950
that you Qian

577
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,580
prepare three documents and six rituals,

578
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,100
and three matchmakers and six bride prices

579
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,300
when you get married.

580
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,140
Although I'm a Qi,

581
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,380
I want you to have

582
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,460
whatever other Qian girls have.

583
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:39,980
No.

584
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,700
Yours must be better.

585
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,380
Your Highness, Prince Jun is here.

586
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,020
Jun.

587
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,480
You're calling him Jun again.

588
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,020
I've prepared some

589
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,740
good tea.

590
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,380
I have good taste now.

591
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,360
Let's go try it.

592
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,060
Let's go.

593
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,580
There's no need.

594
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,910
I'm looking for Jiu'er.

595
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,580
You...

596
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,740
She's busy right now.

597
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,500
I'll take you to try it.

598
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,700
It's really delicious.

599
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,740
There's really no need. I'm looking for Jiu'er.

600
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,300
I'm—

601
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,700
-Jun. -Jiu'er.

602
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,380
Why are you here at this hour?

603
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,660
How's Heyin?

604
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,740
Much better. She's willing to eat now.

605
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,220
I have something to tell you.

606
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,260
Sure.

607
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,380
Keha.

608
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,900
I meant...

609
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,560
Let's talk in private.

610
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,620
Please excuse us.

611
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,070
Go ahead.

612
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,760
Let's talk inside.

613
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,470
Jun, what do you want to tell me?

614
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,220
Your Highness.

615
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,680
Haven't I become smarter?

616
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,460
I heard

617
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,220
you and Miss Jiu'er talking about

618
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,220
getting married.

619
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,840
Prince Jun came just then,

620
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,820
so I announced his arrival loudly

621
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,740
and tried to stop him.

622
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,340
Aren't I awesome?

623
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,020
Shut up.

624
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,260
I haven't gotten even with you

625
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,720
about the eavesdropping.

626
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,140
Don't bother me while I'm listening to them.

627
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,670
You're eavesdropping too.

628
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,740
Jun, what's the matter?

629
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,580
Jiu'er.

630
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,020
I...

631
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,180
I have to tell you something.

632
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,930
What is it?

633
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,550
Why are you so hesitant?

634
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,900
I liked you.

635
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,900
Will His Highness

636
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,540
kill Prince Jun?

637
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,950
I can't stop him.

638
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,990
What should I do?

639
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,500
But

640
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,980
I might not have the right

641
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,140
to like you anymore.

642
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,300
Jun.

643
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,540
What are you talking about?

644
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,620
I know the person you like

645
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,580
is not me.

646
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,660
That's good.

647
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,180
Jiu'er

648
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,780
only likes me, her fiancé.

649
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,340
Luckily, Prince Jun doesn't want to die.

650
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,950
What did you say?

651
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,700
I said...

652
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,520
I'm starving to death.

653
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,980
I always thought that

654
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,980
as long as I didn't ask for anything in return,

655
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,980
it's fine for me

656
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,420
to treat you well.

657
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,340
But sometimes, I hesitate.

658
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,260
After all,

659
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,980
it's rather rude to keep knocking

660
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,060
on a door that doesn't want to open.

661
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:09,780
Jun.

662
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,780
Jiu'er.

663
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,020
I won't like you anymore.

664
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,180
This decision has been...

665
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,620
It has been...

666
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,340
troubling me for a long time.

667
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,700
Besides,

668
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,460
I might not have the energy

669
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,220
to wait for your door to open anymore.

670
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,740
So I've decided

671
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,940
to never get married.

672
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,740
I'll always be Heyin's brother.

673
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,310
I'll protect her forever.

674
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:31,900
I...

675
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,780
I don't know what to say.

676
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,740
But Jun,

677
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
I don't think you need to do this.

678
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,680
You really did nothing wrong.

679
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,950
You just wanted to save Han Zheng.

680
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,780
You wanted to save us.

681
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,340
Jiu'er.

682
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,700
I'm not saying these

683
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,140
to make you feel guilty.

684
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,460
I just want...

685
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,140
some closure for myself.

686
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,460
This way,

687
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,660
I'll feel better.

688
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,380
Jun.

689
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,980
You might have

690
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,030
heard this many times already,

691
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,360
but I still want to say that

692
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,260
you are really

693
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,520
a very good person.

694
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,180
But I hope you will

695
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,060
be more considerate

696
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,660
of yourself.

697
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,740
I...

698
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,140
I'm not a good person.

699
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,620
I only did this

700
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,530
for my own peace of mind.

701
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,220
Your Highness.

702
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,020
Calm down.

703
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:40,980
Don't fight.

704
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,610
Han Zheng, don't get me wrong.

705
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,620
Jun is just...

706
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:46,580
He...

707
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,910
Brother Han,

708
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,350
don't get agitated.

709
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,420
I just...

710
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,170
Don't think too much into it.

711
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,420
It's normal for friends to hug each other.

712
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,510
Brother Han.

713
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,440
What are you doing?

714
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,220
Your Highness.

715
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,550
We are all good friends.

716
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,540
I want a hug too.

717
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,260
Jiu'er, bad news!

718
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,820
Oh no.

719
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,060
Brother Tianyun is here

720
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,390
with his bad luck again.

721
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,940
Brother Tianyun.

722
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,300
What happened?

723
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,140
Didn't Chen Li go missing for a day?

724
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,500
He's back.

725
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,830
Isn't that a good thing?

726
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,160
Why are you panicking?

727
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,620
He said there are human-eating monsters

728
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,510
on the mountain in the suburbs.

729
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,220
Monsters?

730
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,120
Human-eating?

731
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,590
Let's go investigate the case.

732
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,580
Wait for me.

733
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,020
How long more?

734
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,110
Probably...

735
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,100
Soon?

736
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,230
Why must you follow us if you're tired?

737
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,780
Slow down.

738
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,520
Prince Jun.

739
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,180
Don't you know it's improper for men and women to touch each other?

740
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,300
Also, don't forget

741
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,670
what you said to Jiu'er.

742
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,940
Brother Han is right.

743
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,160
Then you...

744
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,100
You are...

745
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,860
You probably don't know yet.

746
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,210
Jiu'er and I are actually—

747
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:27,700
Chen Li.

748
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,140
We've been around the mountain

749
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,020
twice.

750
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,020
Why aren't there any traces?

751
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,820
Maybe it was too dark that day.

752
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,420
I don't remember it clearly.

753
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,330
It should be around here.

754
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,940
Have you been

755
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,110
too tired recently,

756
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,660
and took a dream as reality?

757
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,900
I saw it with my own eyes.

758
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,240
Seven or eight hairy monsters

759
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,950
rushed out in an instant

760
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,540
and swallowed that granny

761
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,500
whole

762
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,900
in front of me.

763
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,100
When I woke up,

764
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,220
my beloved horse, Hong,

765
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,420
was already gone.

766
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,620
They ate her as a snack!

767
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,580
Hong?

768
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,660
Are you talking about this horse?

769
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,340
Maybe...

770
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,220
Maybe those monsters are picky?

771
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,990
What are you talking about?

772
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,500
They ate an old woman,

773
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,940
so why wouldn't they eat your horse?

774
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,620
Maybe...

775
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,280
they were full?

776
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,480
You have to believe me.

777
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,590
I really saw it with my own eyes.

778
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:30,860
How could there

779
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,260
be no traces at all?

780
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,500
Look at the grass.

781
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,700
They've been dug out.

782
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,220
It looks like someone did come here.

783
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,340
But if this granny

784
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,460
really was killed,

785
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
why are there no traces

786
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,940
of blood?

787
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,080
There's blood.

788
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,340
Such a small drop.

789
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,960
Isn't this enough to prove

790
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,700
that the granny

791
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,940
died here yesterday?

792
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,540
There's nothing left

793
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,600
except for this drop of blood.

794
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,860
How cruel.

795
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,420
This is rather different

796
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,400
from the scene you described.

797
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,580
This is a razor for shaving.

798
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,780
Why is it so rusty?

799
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,100
Maybe that granny

800
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,340
was a hairdresser.

801
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,780
There are only a few hairdressers

802
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,180
in Jiuxiao City.

803
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,960
It's easy to investigate.

804
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,660
I remember now.

805
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,060
There used to be a granny

806
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,220
who shaved people

807
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,610
in Niulan Village.

808
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,380
Granny Cao.

809
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,740
May I ask

810
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,740
if that granny was skinny

811
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,100
and a little stooped?

812
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:42,660
Yes.

813
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,060
She was a mute,

814
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,980
and she couldn't hear well.

815
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,420
If it were Granny Cao,

816
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,340
would she have really

817
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,420
been killed?

818
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,260
Jun.

819
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,120
Are you sure it's here?

820
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,900
Yes.

821
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,540
I've written a few characters

822
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,900
based on Granny Cao.

823
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,540
I even visited her several times.

824
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,140
It's here.

825
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,080
Most of the people you wrote about have met tragic ends.

826
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,340
We're here.

827
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,100
She has already been killed,

828
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,430
and she had no children.

829
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,820
It's unnecessary to knock.

830
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,500
Right.

831
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,780
Granny Cao?

832
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,440
Granny Cao.

833
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,380
Granny.

834
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,440
Do you still

835
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,100
remember me?

836
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,740
Granny Cao.

837
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,500
Did you get hurt

838
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,270
on the mountain yesterday?

839
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,930
Did you get hurt?

840
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,260
Only here?

841
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,260
Come in. Look who this is.

842
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,180
Come in.

843
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,460
You all can do the interrogation.

844
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,500
Why did you bring me here?

845
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,420
See who it is.

846
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,140
Ghost!

847
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,300
Come on.

848
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,620
Raise your head.

849
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,780
Take a good look.

850
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,300
Granny is sitting right there.

851
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,980
She wasn't eaten

852
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,840
by any monster.

853
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,660
What...

854
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,580
What was with that drop of blood?

855
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,940
It was from her hand.

856
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,840
Since you're here,

857
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,820
take a good look.

858
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,260
Go.

859
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,380
Granny Cao.

860
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,780
Did you see any monsters

861
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,900
in the mountains?

862
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
Have you been

863
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,380
attacked by those monsters?

864
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,540
Do you know

865
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,980
what those monsters are?

866
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,150
Brother Chen Li.

867
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,780
You can talk.

868
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,780
No.

869
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,820
I've told you everything I know,

870
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,620
Officer.

871
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:15,900
Jiu'er.

872
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,380
Fine.

873
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,710
Get back to work.

874
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,620
OK.

875
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,420
Amitabha. Amitabha.

876
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,220
Granny Cao.

877
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,140
You can tell us

878
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,900
if there's anything wrong.

879
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,020
Louder.

880
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,100
I said that we will help you

881
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,710
if there's anything wrong.

882
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,100
Granny Cao.

883
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,020
Why did you go into the mountain

884
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,500
all alone

885
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,210
so late at night?

886
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,900
What should we do?

887
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,910
I can't get anything out of her.

888
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,140
Forget it.

889
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,020
Since Granny Cao

890
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,900
is fine,

891
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,750
should we let her go back first?

892
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:05,940
Okay.

893
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,489
Granny...

894
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,530
She heard that clearly.

895
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,739
Jiu'er, I think she's—

896
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,679
That's odd.

897
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,190
Something's wrong.

898
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,659
When she pretended not to understand

899
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,139
when we asked her

900
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,300
why she came here at night,

901
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,630
I knew something was up.

902
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:40,659
I didn't expect her to come again tonight.

903
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,540
Han Zheng.

904
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,620
Can you smell

905
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,219
what's in her basket?

906
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,620
Meat patties.

907
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,139
Meat patties?

908
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,320
So she's here to deliver food?

909
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:55,060
But who is she delivering it to

910
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,179
in the middle of nowhere?

911
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:56,710
Let's go.

912
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,700
She's so cautious.

913
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,150
It seems something is wrong

914
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,260
with this room.

915
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,420
Let's go.

916
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:49,740
What are you doing?

917
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,470
Brother Han.

918
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,740
I'm scared.

919
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,240
Move aside.

920
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,340
It's okay.

921
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,070
Don't be afraid.

922
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,060
It's okay.

923
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,780
Kaka?

924
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,260
Sister Jiu'er?

925
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,500
Uncle Bu?

926
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,560
Father, it's okay.

927
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,860
Everyone, it's okay.

928
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,620
She's one of us.

929
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,100
Don't be afraid.

930
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,060
It's okay.

931
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,440
Thank you, Granny Cao.

932
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,780
Kaka.

933
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,700
How did they

934
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
become like this?

935
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,340
I don't know.

936
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,780
At first,

937
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,540
my father only had spasms from time to time.

938
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,840
It was a bit like...

939
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,100
dancing.

940
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,000
Father!

941
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:18,900
Father!

942
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:19,620
Father!

943
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,150
Uncle Bu!

944
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,100
It's okay.

945
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,380
Father, be good.

946
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:22,860
Father.

947
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,020
Father, be good.

948
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,480
Father, it's okay.

949
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,300
It's okay.

950
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,180
What happened then?

951
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,910
Then, he started growing fangs

952
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,820
and fur.

953
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,580
He also

954
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,620
started to lose control.

955
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,540
Aunty Xiu,

956
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
did you see wrong?

957
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,420
How could there be a monster here?

958
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,750
Aunty Xiu, Uncle Zhang.

959
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,140
What's wrong?

960
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,380
Look. It's hiding inside.

961
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,140
Who are you?

962
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,540
Come out!

963
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,380
Come out!

964
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,660
I told you I didn't see wrongly.

965
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,450
Kaka.

966
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,620
I'm your father.

967
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,460
Father!

968
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,260
His father?

969
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,820
Father, what's wrong?

970
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:02,810
I...

971
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,500
I don't know.

972
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,740
Let me see.

973
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,940
Is he shapeshifting?

974
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,620
How would he dare?

975
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,620
He didn't even pay rent last month.

976
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,750
If he dares to shapeshift and run amok,

977
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,060
I'll call the authorities and get him arrested.

978
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,570
Father!

979
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,660
Father!

980
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,740
It's okay.

981
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,980
Stop talking!

982
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,500
In less than three days,

983
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,260
he had fur

984
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,420
all over his body.

985
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,360
It looked like he was shapeshifting.

986
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,020
Father and I were afraid of being kicked out Jiuxiao City,

987
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,880
so we hid in this abandoned house.

988
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,420
Later, Granny Cao found more people

989
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,420
facing the same situation as Father,

990
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,820
so she sent them all here.

991
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,780
But so much time has passed,

992
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,590
and they still haven't gotten better.

993
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,980
This condition is called...

994
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,260
What is it called?

995
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,840
It's called...

996
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:48,940
Father.

997
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,090
It's okay.

998
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,770
I think I read about this

999
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,540
in a book.

1000
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,500
It said that people looking more and more like monkeys

1001
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,100
is called "ancestral return."

1002
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,980
That's right. It's called "ancestral return."

1003
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,310
Shouldn't ancestral return for Qi people

1004
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,390
make them look more like Qi people?

1005
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,260
No.

1006
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,980
They don't look like

1007
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,660
we do

1008
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,190
when we're shapeshifting.

1009
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,100
At most,

1010
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,460
they are halfway shapeshifted.

1011
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,300
If we cut their hair,

1012
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,660
won't they look the same as before?

1013
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,860
I thought so too.

1014
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,620
Father!

1015
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,740
It's okay.

1016
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,780
It's okay.

1017
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,770
It grew so fast?

1018
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,820
It's okay.

1019
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,460
But even if it's ancestral return,

1020
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,580
it's impossible for the fur

1021
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,240
to grow out again so fast after being shaved off.

1022
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,860
This place is too far from the city.

1023
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,470
It's not convenient

1024
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,380
to send food here or to take care of them.

1025
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,100
If we can find a hiding place for them

1026
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,460
in the city,

1027
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,160
we can slowly investigate the cause.

1028
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,340
Why don't you send them to my house?

1029
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,340
No.

1030
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,460
I know a place.

1031
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,400
It might be more suitable.

many Qi-related shops in Jiuxiao City

closed down.

Yes.

1039

Things have changed.

1040
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,820

00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,620
I don't believe you.

1056
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:01,820
Keha!

1057
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,500
Your Highness.

1058
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,420
How can you treat our own people

1059
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,080
so roughly?

1060
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,030
I was wrong.

1061
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,560
I will do better next time.

1062
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,780
Let me help him in first.
