[Episode 4]

4
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,460
The strangest thing in this case

5
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,590
is

6
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,020
the motives

7
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,509
the murderer

8
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,300
has.

9
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,140
If he wants to complete the nursery rhythm,

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,450
he can just simply

11
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,420
murder four Qian people.

12
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,020
There's no need

13
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,770
to target these four lords?

14
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,039
It seemed that the four lords

15
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,200
rarely had personal ties while they were all officials.

16
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,330
But do you know?

17
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,290
The four lords came to

18
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:02,850
Shuobei Tavern every month

19
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,090
on the same day

20
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,170
at the same time.

21
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,610
In other words,

22
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,030
they went together

23
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,730
and disappeared together.

24
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,790
This place is indeed very suspicious.

25
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,050
And strangely,

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,329
four bodies

27
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,450
Only on the thumbs of three bodies

28
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,260
had traces of wearing a thumb ring

29
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,440
for a long time.

30
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,290
But the last person who died

31
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,900
had nothing.

32
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,440
What are you so proud of?

33
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,050
Am I sincere enough?

34
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,070
Is this information useful?

35
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,250
Why don't you just say

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,820
you are afraid of being killed

37
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,350
and you need my protection?

38
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,300
Then why can't you

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,510
believe that

40
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,780
I just want to

41
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,940
be friends with you?

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,260
How about this?

43
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,329
If you can keep me alive,

44
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,470
I'll recite the rest of the files

45
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,340
for you.

46
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,170
Also, I'll give you

47
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,290
a real pass.

48
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,810
What do you think?

49
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,600
I'll think about it.

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,050
Keha, see her out.

51
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,120
Young Master Han.

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,520
You...

53
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,200
Didn't you hear him?

54
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,140
Go, go, go.

55
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,820

56

60

Let me tell you.

61
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,020
The hedgehog you gave

62
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,590
is really delicious.

63
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,990
You can't eat for free.

You have to come.

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,410
Just go.

66
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,500
Your Highness.

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,660
I chased her away.

68
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,440
Your Highness.

69
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,440
You seem to disagree verbally,

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,810
but I can tell

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
you've made up your mind,

72
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,170
right?

73
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,000
Shut up.

74
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,890
Can't you see me considering?

75
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,850
Your Highness.

76
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,260
What are you considering?

77
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,980
Think about it.

78
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,500
The women of the state of Qian

79
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,760
are much more delicate

80
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,400
than women in the state of Qi.

81
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,090
Even if she likes you,

82
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,150
she can't beat you.

83
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,010
And she can't

84
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
make things cannot be undone

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,380
like men of the Cangqi tribe,

86
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,520
right?

87
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:56,710
So I think

88
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,380
Your Highness is safe.

Are you stupid?

It's so early.

97
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,040
No one would go to a dance tavern

98
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,700

99
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,840
Let's go.

100
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,570
Can you wait for me?

101
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,550
Slow down a bit.

102
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,300
I've been waiting for you for so long.

103

No way.

105
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,430
I'm starting to feel dizzy.

106
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,570
If I don't touch him,

107
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,210
I'll lose all my energy

108
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,870
when investigating the case.

109
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,630
I need to think of a way.

111
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,850

Aren't you going to investigate a case?

your rules

122
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,930

Try it. It's very delicious.

132
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,230
There is no delicacy in the state of Qian.

133

This is really delicious.

No.

Is it too sticky?

Don't move.

I'll handle it for you.

It'll get stickier if you do it.

No.

142
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,330
Did you do it on purpose?

143
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,580
I didn't mean it.

144
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,810

but flirts with a Qi man.

151
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,250
So disgraceful.

Nothing.

When will they come?

157

Yeah.

Excuse me.

167

Be careful.

This is only the minority.

169
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,150
Qi people are generally tall and strong.

180
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,390
Why are you looking at me like that?

181
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,180
I don't like Qi people.

182
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,130
Don't get me wrong

183
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,850
I really don't like Qi people.

184
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,720
Without a token,

185
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,370
you aren't allowed to enter.

186
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,880
Please come in.

187
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,750
You are a newcomer with no token.

188
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:53,670
I... He and I...

189
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Young Master Han.

190
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
Are you planning to leave me behind?

191
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,410
Dear Han.

192
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,190
What did you call me?

193
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,850
Please don't be mad at me anymore.

194
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,720
I was wrong.

195
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,980
I promise. I swear.

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,120
I will never glance at

197
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,590
other boys anymore.

198
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,950
Can you stop being angry?

199
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,270
Sorry, I was wrong.

200
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,790
I do have the token.

201
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,510
I do.

202
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,790
I promise

203
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,140
you will be the only one

204
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,360
in my heart and sight.

205
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,000
What a Qian-Qi couple!

206
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,620
It's so big here.

207
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,490
Look at the floor.

208
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,480
It shines with every step you make.

209
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,270
People always say that women from the Qian race are very reserved.

210
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:48,990
Why can't I

211
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,820
see it in you?

212
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,320
I

213
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,680
have no choice.

214
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,010
But we're in trouble now.

215
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,360
Since we came in

216
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,660
with this kind of identity,

217
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,620
we have to

218
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
continue to play the role of lovers.

219
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,200
Or else, if others find out,

220
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,310
they'll know something's wrong with us.

221
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,620
And that means

222
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,240
I can touch you

223
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,880
as I wish.

224
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,660
But you look happy.

225
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,400
No.

226
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,530
Actually, I'm sad too.

227
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,320
I also feel wronged.

228
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,940
You can't tell anyone about this.

229
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,870
Keep it a secret.

230
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,110
I wish I could get married in the future.

231
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,810
The Qi race has a lifespan of hundreds of years,

232
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,980
but we can only choose one partner in our lives.

233
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,570
Do you think they will believe

234
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,900
the smart and handsome I

235
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,490
would fall for you?

236
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,190
What's wrong with...

237
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,660
Let's say

238
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,260
if I can make them believe

239
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,970
that you choose me blindly,

240
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,090
then you'll agree

241
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,350
to be my partner, okay?

242
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,920
Let go.

243
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,580
You are so loved-up.

244
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,670
Come in, please.

245
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,970
Is she a Qian?

246
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,400
Yes.

247
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,790
Look at them.

248
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,400
Why is a Qian here?

249
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,340
Exactly.

250
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,260
What's wrong with being a Qian?

251
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,660
Why is this place so dark?

252
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,740
I can't even see the way.

253
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,980
Why is she with a Qi man?

254
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,780
It's strange.

255
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,100
It won't last long.

256
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,760
Don't you

257
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,420
entertain Qian people here?

258
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,120
Not many.

259
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,940
Besides, this is not a place

260
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,670
you can come to just with money.

261
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,240
Please sit upstairs.

262
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,130
Let's continue drinking.

263
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,290
The dishes are ready.

264
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,290
Please enjoy.

265
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,170
But

266
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,760
we haven't ordered yet.

267
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,900
In Qi's taverns,

268
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,740
guests don't need to order wine.

269
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,800
Each tavern has its own special menu.

270
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,560
You drink whatever they serve.

271
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,350
Where should we start

272
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,550
with this grande dance tavern?

273
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,480
How would I know?

274
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,290
You begged me to come.

275
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,810
Besides,

276
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,610
I know very little about this case.

277
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,900
You've been hiding it from me,

278
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,460
and you don't want to reveal everything.

279
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,260
Cooperation?

280
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,140
I really believed you.

281
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,120
I haven't caught

282
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
good timing before this.

283
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:01,890
I'll tell you now.

284
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,940
What are you doing?

285
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,130
Come closer to me.

286
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,820
There are all Qi people down there.

287
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,780
They'll hear

288
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,560
the secrets we're talking about

289
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,360
very clearly.

290
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,440
Great.

291
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,670
We can pretend to be lovey-dovey.

292
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,890
What?

293
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,450
Listen carefully.

294
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,750
In the 33rd year of Dingkun,

295
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,200
on March 16.

296
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,470
The banquet at the Zhang Residence

297
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,870
invited four dancing girls

298
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,050
from Shuobei Dance Tavern

299
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,440
to entertain the guests.

300
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,790
The four lords went missing together that night.

301
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,120
The servants in the Zhang Residence said,

302
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,380
the four dancers left at 7 o'clock.

303
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,490
While the four lords were abducted

304
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,510
around 9 o'clock.

305
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,510
At 9 o'clock,

306
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,790
four dancers

307
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,400
had returned to the dance tavern.

308
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,480
So they are not suspects.

309
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:45,940
Look

310
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,680
at them.

311
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,340
I've done an investigation into them.

312
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,510
The four lords

313
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,110
seemed to be on bad terms,

314
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,010
but they were actually very close.

315
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,130
They came to Shuobei Dance Tavern

316
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,610
every month.

317
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,020
I wonder

318
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,390
what the death of these four lords

319
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
has to do

320
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,770
with this place.

321
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,900
What are you doing?

322
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,420
Let go of our boss!

323
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,940
You're skillful in martial arts.

324
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,130
I've been in Jiuxiao City for so many years

325
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,470
and I've never heard of you.

326
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,860
May I know

327
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,080
which tribe are you from?

328
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,340
You don't need to know.

329
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,300
Interesting.

330
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,190
Such a rebellious man

331
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,150
is married

332
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,180
to a Qian.

333
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,070
Shut up.

334
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,740
Don't be nervous.

335
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,490
I just want to invite

336
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,690
this little Qian girl

337
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,460
to come over and ask a question.

338
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,420
Why don't we have a deal?

339
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,730
I'll ask Da to let her go.

340
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:27,940
You

341
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,780
make me feel better.

342
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
What do you think?

343
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,590
Dear Han.

344
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,800
-Are you okay?
-Everyone.

345
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,260
It's a misunderstanding.

346
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,540
Enjoy yourselves.

347
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,540
All the drinks tonight

348
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,510
are free.

349
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,370
Thank you, Young Master Baiyin.

350
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:52,810
Da.

351
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,260
Young Master Baiyin, I appreciate your generosity.

352
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,190
Make a pot of tea.

353
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
Here, Lord Zhang.

354
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,010
Please.

355
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,070
The moment you arrived,

356
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,570
I knew someone

357
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,450
had entered here

358
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,110
with Lord Zhang's thumb ring.

359
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,580
It's just that I've been observing for a long time

360
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,180
and couldn't find out who you are.

361
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,540
So,

362
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,480
I would like to

363
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,780
ask this girl something.

364
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,790
Judging from your tone,

365
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,090
do you know Lord Zhang Yunhe?

366
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,540
I'm a Qi,

367
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,470
wandering alone in a foreign country.

368
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,400
All these years,

369
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,000
thanks to Lord Zhang's help.

370
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,340
He and I

371
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,450
are good friends despite the great difference in age.

372
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,140
Friends despite the great difference in age?

373
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,520
But he looks like

374
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,080
he's only in his thirties.

375
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,420
I'm

376
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,600
83 years old this year.

377
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,570
83?

378
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,750
If so, the one next to me

379
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,780
might also be an old monster.

380
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,180
As a Qi,

381
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:58,030
you treat the Qian nobles as your confidant.

382
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,030
It seems that

383
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,310
you don't like Qian people very much.

384
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,730
Then why do you have

385
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,770
such a cute

386
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,650
Qian girlfriend?

387
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,030
How can you tell

388
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,900
I'm her lover?

389
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,520
Why did you...

390
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,660
Since you aren't the one who brought her in,

391
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,020
I have to ask her out then.

392
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,530
Sure.

393
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,010
No, no, no.

394
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,800
Sir,

395
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,990
that's how he is.

396
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,260
He's always fierce

397
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,600
and he's been arguing with me lately.

398
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,020
But he's actually a very nice person.

399
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,420
Right?

400
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,310
Oh yeah.

401
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,390
From what you said,

402
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,150
Lord Zhang

403
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,490
should be one

404
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,950
who won't regard the Qi race

405
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,450
as a foreign race.

406
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,060
That's why you gave him the thumb ring

407
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,180
so that he could come to Shuobei Dance Tavern.

408
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,700
You are quite smart.

409
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,100
You've asked everything you want to know.

410
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,500
But

411
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,750
who are you?

412
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,890
Why do you have Lord Zhang's thumb ring

413
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,090
in your hands?

414
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,940
I'm Su Jiu'er, an inspector of the Inspection Bureau.

415
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,410
I see, you're from Inspection Bureau.

416
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,830
Since the Nursery Crime Case happened,

417
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,760
you people have come here

418
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,890
over and over again.

419
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,420
After investigating,

420
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,480
nothing was found.

421
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,960
Instead,

422
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,100
you treated my dancers

423
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,030
as the suspects,

424
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,550
wasting your time.

425
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,760
That's because

426
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,320
I wasn't

427
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,340
involved in the case at that moment.

428
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,910
By the way,

429
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,540
I have another question.

430
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,940
When the four lords

431
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,420
came here every month,

432
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,570
were they really coming for the performance?

433
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,370
Of course not.

434
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,200
The four lords

435
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,530
are our regular guests.

436
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,450
They didn't come here

437
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,700
to drink and have fun,

438
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,170
but to avoid

439
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,230
the spy of the Anti-Qi Party.

440
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,560
Of course,

441
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,140
they would ask me

442
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,610
the life status of Qi people

443
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,640
in Jiuxiao City.

444
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,000
On the day he went missing,

445
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,860
Lord Zhang

446
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,520
also asked for the dancers from me.

447
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,710
The sedan chairs of Zhang Residence

448
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,500
took them away at 5 o'clock

449
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,440
and sent them back on time at 9 o'clock.

450
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,450
The dancers

451
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,810
also didn't find anything unusual.

452
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,700
In this case,

453
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,110
the four of them

454
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,380
were in the Pro-Qi Party in the Imperial Court of the state of Qian.

455
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,180
Pro-Qi Party?

456
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,140
There are two parties in the Imperial Court of the state of Qian.

457
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,660
One hopes that Qian and Qi

458
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
can live in peace.

459
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,680
While the other one hates the Qi race,

460
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,390
hoping to draw a clear line.

461
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,970
How do you know so much?

462
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,150
You are the ignorant one.

463
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,780
Can't you let me be more knowledgeable than you?

464
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,260
How am I ignorant?

465
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,400
I know the Qian race

466
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,560
better than you.

467
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,750
It seems that

468
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,060
you two feel like

469
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,170
a Qian-Qi couple.

470
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,230
How on earth did you draw that conclusion?

471
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,340
Why do things become

472
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,730
more and more strange?

473
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,810
If these four lords

474
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,290
are from the Pro-Qi Party,

475
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,110
why would a Qi

476
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,060
come after them?

477
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,450
I know.

478
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,820
Maybe the murderer isn't...

479
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:06,660
Wait.

480
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,570
If the murderer is not a Qi,

481
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,520
that means

482
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,060
it may not be the three-scar man.

483
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,820
Does that mean he'll wash his hands of the activity?

484
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,980
Are you suspecting

485
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,690
the murderer

486
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,120
is not a Qi

487
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,550
because Qi won't kill people from Pro-Qi Party?

488
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,980
Can you people read minds too?

489
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,210
Not only can I investigate this case,

490
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,220
but also tell you now.

491
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,740
I smell a rat in this case.

492
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,050
Why?

493
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,130
I have come with you.

494
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,220
You should recite the file to me.

495
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,940
Why are you cheating?

496
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,070
We agreed to exchange information.

497
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,870
I promised you

498
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,340
to come here with you

499
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,340
and keep you safe.

500
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,500
You just need to contribute your brain power.

501
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,230
I don't care.

502
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,770
Tell me what's fishy.

503
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,040
So that we can be good partners.

504
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,000
Who is your partner?

505
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,750
Today, we...

506
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,650
No, you...

507
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,050
You...

508
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,080
What happened to my hand?

509
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,940
Did Master poison me?

510
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,680
Look.

511
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,480
What poison?

512
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,340
This is a special spice

513
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,210
of the Qi race.

514
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,160
It can absorb into the skin

515
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,020
and help Qi relax.

516
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,680
If a dance tavern uses this,

517
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,930
it means it treats the guests well.

518
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,880
It shines in the dark,

519
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,610
and can last for months.

520
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,000
It's just a spice from the Qi race.

521
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,670
Don't be surprised.

522
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,780
I see.

523
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,740
Young Master Han.

524
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,570
Our partnership today

525
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,460
went well.

526
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,690
How about this?

527
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,490
Let's have a high-five farewell.

528
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,490
Tomorrow, you tell me what's fishy.

529
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,690
I'll recite the file for you

530
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,460
and start a new day.

531
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,150
Okay?

532
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,570
It's getting late.

533
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,280
High five tomorrow then.

534
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,540
See you tomorrow.

535
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,050
Mother of Jiu'er.

536
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,910
Is Jiu'er home?

537
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,500
No, she isn't.

538
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,510
I don't know where she has been

539
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,270
at this hour.

540
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,220
Why are you looking for her?

541
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm just dropping in to visit her.

542
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,330
I brought you a gift too.

543
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,530
What is it?

544
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,530
Don't keep me guessing.

545
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,600
Red Stone Centipede and Golden Scorpion.

546
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,530
Do you like them?

547
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,100
Where did you get it?

548
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,030
This is a treasure.

549
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,780
I knew you'd like it.

550
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,990
A few days ago,

551
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,940
I dug them for you

552
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,960
when I was performing my official duties.

553
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,330
These two are poisonous.

554
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,240
Were you hurt?

555
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,370
No.

556
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,740
Why should I be afraid of it?

557
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,140
I'll get you a bottle of medicine.

558
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,270
It's for detoxification.

559
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,980
Thank you.

560
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,470
Remember to take it

561
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,180
when you dig it next time.

562
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,250
By the way,

563
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,550
dig up some Black-tailed Centipedes.

564
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,420
That thing is highly poisonous,

565
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,750
but it's very precious.

566
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,740
But after taking this medicine,

567
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,930
you won't die even if you're stung.

568
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,370
[Inspection Bureau]

569
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,210
There's no hidden pattern.

570
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,740
I knew it.

571
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,830
The other three lords

572
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,760
had signs of wearing a thumb ring.

573
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,640
But he didn't.

574
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,990
This means

575
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,420
this is not

576
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,500
Lord Zhang's body.

577
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,340
It was changed

578
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,070
and disguised as Lord Zhang.

579
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,030
That's not right.

580
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,820
This is even stranger.

581
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,930
The murderer abducted four lords

582
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,980
and insisted on matching with the nursery rhythm of the Qi race.

583
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,150
Why did

584
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,990
a non-related body

585
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,310
suddenly appear?

586
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,380
You aren't

587
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,580
as stupid as you look.

588
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,080
You...

589
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,820
Why are you here?

590
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,150
After you found out the dark pattern,

591
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,240
you noticed something was wrong with the body.

592
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,600
So you left me

593
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,400
and came here for an autopsy,

594
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:16,800
right?

595
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,390
I...

596
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,570
Young Master Han.

597
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,720
You misunderstood.

598
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,420
Previously, you pretended to be the three-scar Qi

599
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,220
and made a scene in Inspection Bureau.

600
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:26,840
So that everyone

601
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,930
remembers you.

602
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,900
If they know

603
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,560
I work with a Qi,

604
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,050
there would be

605
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,310
unnecessary trouble.

606
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,240
Since you think it's troublesome,

607
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,970
why do you want to

608
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,280
be my partner?

609
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,470
Because I trust you.

610
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,620
You, as an inspector of Inspection Bureau,

611
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,430
would believe

612
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,290
a man

613
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,000
who made a scene at Inspection Bureau?

614
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,280
I...

615
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,230
Young Master Han.

616
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,220
Master Han.

617
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,480
Please go back first.

618
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,210
I'll explain it to you tomorrow.

619
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,690
Okay?

620
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,420
Don't let others find out.

621
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,680
If they find out we are together,

622
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,100
I will lose my job.

623
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,110
At that point, you won't have

624
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,310
any convenience in the investigation.

625
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,130
Young Master Han.

626
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,970
Do you think I'm a baby

627
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,830
whose teeth are not yet complete?

628
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,230
You...

629
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,270
-Put me down first.
-Stop bluffing.

630
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,420
Put me down first.

631
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,240
Oh no.

632
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,040
It's happening again.

633
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,430
Young Master Han.

634
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,250
What are you doing?

635
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,220
You keep saying

636
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,180
we are partners.

637
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,560
But you refused

638
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,460
my request again and again.

639
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,150
The only thing you like is high-fives.

640
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
What are you up to?

641
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,870
I'm innocent.

642
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,690
There's absolutely nothing I'm up to.

643
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,290
Did the old man send you here?

644
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,160
Where do I

645
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,680
know an old man?

646
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,580
I'm partnering with you

647
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,140
only to solve the case.

648
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,820
Put me down.

649
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,060
You're still telling lies, aren't you?

650
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,500
Please.

651
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,970
Fine.

652
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,590
Let me tell you the truth.

653
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,050
Okay?

654
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,800
Actually,

655
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,820
when I was young,

656
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,050
I had a weird disease.

657
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,510
I will be weak from time to time

658
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,440
and lose all my senses.

659
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,130
But every time

660
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,190
I touch you,

661
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,230
I can regain my strength.

662
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,180
Come here.

663
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,500
Let me touch you.

664
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,740
-I beg you.
-This is no time

665
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,200
for you to make up stories.

666
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,430
What is all that about? Loss of five senses

667
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,820
and having a weird illness.

668
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,690
I think

669
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,130
you are a licentious Qian

670
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,010
who makes up stories

671
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,620
and coaxes the Qi people.

672
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,290
I'm really not.

673
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,380
It's fine.

674
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,090
I think I left it in the coroner's room.

675
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:43,790
Wait for me.

676
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,720
Oh no.

677
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,370
They must be back.

678
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,760
Come over quickly, so that I can touch you.

679
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,780
Don't push your luck.

680
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,370
Okay?

681
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,420
Oh no, I'm still wearing gloves.

682
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,020
I...

683
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,350
Stay here.

684
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,850
Please leave now, okay?

685
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,660
If they find out,

686
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,150
I'll lose my job.

687
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,790
What does it have to do with me?

688
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,320
I can still investigate the case without you.

689
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,120
-And...
-Lower your voice.

690
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,580
Don't even think about...

691
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,570
What...

692
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,010
What's going on?

693
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,750
What should I do?

694
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,220
I just want you to shut up.

695
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,900
-You scared me.
-Daren.

696
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,500
You're still here at this hour?

697
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,380
By the way,

698
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,500
the Commander has ordered that

699
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,650
the bodies of the four lords

700
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,700
are important evidence.

701
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,960
Nothing must go wrong.

702
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,230
What's wrong?

703
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,490
Is there something wrong with this body?

704
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,800
Not this.

705
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,210
That is

706
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,550
the one with a problem.

707
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,080
This one.

708
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,320
Let me see.

709
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,000
You scared me.

710
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,260
What's the problem?

711
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:37,780
Girl,

712
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,580
if you have any new clues,

713
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,540
just tell me.

714
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,550
I know you are very smart.

715
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,900
You've been weak since childhood.

716
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,780
You have to hide your strength.

717
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,180
Right?

718
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,080
Is this girl

719
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,000
really sick

720
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,580
and has lost her five senses?

721
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,580
There are only six days left to investigate the case.

722
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,560
Why waste your time

723
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,200
here?

724
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:03,570
In my opinion,

725
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,420
we can work together.

726
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,660
I can talk

727
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,080
with the Commander.

728
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,690
With your brain power

729
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,100
and my connections,

730
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,310
we arrest the three-scar Qi together.

731
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,540
You can guarantee the job,

732
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,520
and I'll get the reward.

733
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,810
It's a win-win situation.

734
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,400
Stop.

735
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,160
Stop, Daren.

736
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,220
These are not important.

737
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,710
Take a look at this body.

738
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,500
The wound is dark purple.

739
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,810
There were few traces of bleeding.

740
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,550
It's more like a wound

741
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,160
after death.

742
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,710
I'm afraid the murderer

743
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,880
wanted to frame Qi people.

744
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,750
So the murderer is very likely

745
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,430
not the Qi with three scars.

746
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,160
That's not important.

747
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,440
My point is,

748
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,690
do you want to solve the case

749
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,430
or keep the job?

750
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,200
So you mean...

751
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,460
One, two, three, four.

752
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,860
All four bodies are here.

753
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,690
There won't be any new victims.

754
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,510
Qian and Qi are now having endless conflicts.

755
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,820
The Qi race wants to implement Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

756
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,220
Right?

757
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,090
And the Qian race

758
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,580
wants to get the goods on the Qi race.

759
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,100
At this time,

760
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,430
three-scar Qi appears.

761
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,540
Both sides support you to catch him,

762
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,220
bringing him to justice,

763
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,280
closing this case,

764
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,240
and putting the blame on Qi.

765
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,380
Why not?

766
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,210
How can you do that?

767
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,290
Lie down.

768
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,560
I am kindly

769
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,450
reminding you.

770
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,700
You keep your job

771
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,220
and work with me.

772
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,040
Doesn't it sound good?

773
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,140
But Daren,

774
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,670
I'm an inspector.

775
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,960
I pursue the truth,

776
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,110
not convenience.

777
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,040
Even if there is truth,

778
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,330
can you reveal it to the public?

779
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:44,620
Fine.

780
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,960
Go ahead if you want to.

781
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,880
After all, wait until you've figured it out,

782
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,500
your uniform will not be

783
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,340
valid long.

784
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,690
[Inspection Bureau]

785
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,700
Brother.

786
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,640
I'm sorry.

787
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,170
I had no choice.

788
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,080
I'm sorry, brother.

789
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,760
I'm sorry.

790
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,300
What's wrong with your illness?

791
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,790
I...

792
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,940
Actually, I don't know.

793
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,470
They said I wouldn't live long.

794
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,170
Thanks to my mother insisting on medicine,

795
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,360
to keep me alive.

796
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,060
But it's really strange.

797
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,300
Every time I touch you,

798
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,450
I feel

799
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,310
very warm.

800
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,960
It's like I've recovered.

801
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,310
So you want to

802
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,350
stick with me

803
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,580
instead of finding out the truth?

804
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,670
Don't you frame me.

805
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,760
Although I touch you,

806
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,500
the sun and the moon

807
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,740
can be witnesses of me wanting to find the truth.

808
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,780
I am an inspector.

809
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,980
My father told me

810
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,830
we are ordinary people.

811
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,940
We can't control many things.

812
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,920
We can only do our job well.

813
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,290
Since I'm an inspector,

814
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,920
my duty is to find out the truth.

815
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,100
Fine.

816
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,750
Then find out the truth.

817
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,380
And I'll be responsible

818
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,240
to reveal the truth to the public.

819
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,390
These four bodies

820
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,430
have wounds

821
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,120
from the same angle

822
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,450
and the same depth.

823
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,460
That's right.

824
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,720
It's so precise, unlike real claws.

825
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,980
It's more like

826
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,210
a heavy tool.

827
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,930
Besides,

828
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,780
most of them are post-death injuries.

829
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:29,990
Yes.

830
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,300
You, Qian people, don't know much

831
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,260
about Qi people.

832
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,660
You've also seen fewer wounds.

833
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,120
When you see blood blurry,

834
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,020
you assume

835
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,180
it must be done by the shapeshifted Qi.

836
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,020
So

837
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,940
you knew

838
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,270
the murderer wasn't Qi?

839
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,300
I arrived half an hour

840
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,890
earlier than you.

841
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,170
Half an hour?

842
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,090
So you'd been

843
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,030
hiding behind

844
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,280
and laughing at me.

845
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,180
It's because you

846
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,990
hid your strange illness from me.

847
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,520
There are so many Qi people,

848
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,780
but you were only pestering me

849
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,980
and kept touching me.

850
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,830
I even thought

851
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,070
you favored Qi men.

852
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,290
Even if I like a Qi man,

853
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,740
it won't be you.

854
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,770
Let me think about it.

855
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,740
If I want to look for

856
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,140
someone in Jiuxiao City,

857
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,270
I do need

858
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,220
a more reliable partner.

859
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,010
Do you mean

860
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,250
I'm reliable?

861
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,630
You're thinking too much.

862
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,650
Is it your martial art

863
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,380
or your brain

864
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,550
that makes you qualified to be my partner?

865
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,550
I just pity you

866
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,820
because you're weak and sick.

867
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,030
Now, you even ask me

868
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,440
for protection.

869
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,510
I was born

870
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,590
with strength.

871
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,120
It's a piece of cake

872
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,250
to protect you.

873
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:39,930
I will prove that

874
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,880
I can be

875
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,770
a good partner.

876
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,500
Wait.

877
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,300
If you want to be my partner,

878
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,130
you have to promise me three conditions.

879
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,110
What three conditions?

880
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,740
First,

881
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,410
before you get fired,

882
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,590
make me

883
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,530
a real pass.

884
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,480
Second,

885
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,880
without my permission,

886
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,810
don't molest me.

887
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,820
I was treating my illness.

888
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,350
It's health and longevity.

889
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,940
What sexual harassment?

890
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,360
Third,

891
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,490
you have to recite the files for me.

892
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,570
And in the future,

893
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,190
you need to listen to me.

894
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,050
If you agree,

895
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,710
give me your hand.

896
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,280
From now on,

897
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,270
we are

898
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,200
good partners.

899
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,170
But my good partner,

900
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,980
I have one more thing

901
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,920
to ask you.

902
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:28,880
Go ahead.

903
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,280
Since the murderer is not a Qi,

904
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,330
the three-scar Qi man

905
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,880
who pushed me from the tower

906
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,960
must not be in cahoots

907
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,290
with the real murderer.

908
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,370
Otherwise, why did he use

909
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,480
a fake weapon?

910
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,130
It is easier if he directly asked the Qi

911
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:43,730
to kill

912
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,870
all four lords.

913
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,620
That's what I don't understand.

914
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,530
Anyway,

915
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,620
the motive of this case

916
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,700
is very clear.

917
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,060
Someone

918
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,890
wanted to use the nursery rhythm

919
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,020
to frame the Qi race.

920
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,130
His purpose

921
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,310
is to sow discord

922
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,070
between Qian and Qi.

923
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,180
But

924
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,470
I have a new discovery.

925
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,030
What is it?

926
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
Do you want to know

927
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,420
who was the identity

928
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,500
of this body

929
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,720
which replaced Lord Zhang?

930
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,980
the motive of this case

931
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,900
is very clear.

932
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,250
Someone

933
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,030
wanted to use the nursery rhythm

934
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,160
to frame the Qi race.

935
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,320
His purpose

936
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,580
is to sow discord

937
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,040
between Qian and Qi.

938
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:49,620
Here.

939
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:54,620
Here.

940
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,690
Let's call it a day.

941
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,490
Go back now.

942
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,180
Your father's troops

943
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,110
are coming soon.

944
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,550
So what?

945
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,130
If he dares to hurt you again,

946
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:14,990
I'll fight him.

947
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,100
Listen.

948
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,760
My father died in the arena.

949
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,490
He is the supreme honor of the Qi race.

950
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,550
It's not shameful.

951
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,340
But the Xuanqi tribe

952
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,310
was gone.

953
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,580
The Qi race

954
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,060
now belongs to you, the Xueqi tribe.

955
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,890
I don't want it.

956
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,640
Calm down.

957
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Leaving the crowd

958
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,260
can make people calm and sober

959
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,980
and not controlled by your emotions.

960
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,350
Your father

961
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,310
wants to work with the Qian people.

962
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,240
But I know

963
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,600
no matter what changes

964
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,730
between the Qi race,

965
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,990
the Qian race is not our bright future.

966
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,260
Qian people are cunning and cowardly.

967
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,930
They don't deserve to work with us.

968
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,930
Come back with me.

969
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,730
I will find a way to protect you.

970
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,360
If that old man

971
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,360
wants to hurt you,

972
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,270
I will definitely be on your side.

973
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:12,900
I swear.

974
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,790
But I want you to calm down.

975
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,180
Hanzheng.

976
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,910
You are the future of the Qi race.

977
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,210
In the future,

978
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,900
we will achieve something big for the Qi race.

979
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,550
I'll wait for you.

980
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,180
Muyan!

981
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,620
Muyan!

982
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:56,910
Muyan!

983
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,180
Muyan!

984
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,790
Is it really you

985
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,730
stirring up troubles

986
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,870
between Qian and Qi?

987
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:27,550
[He'an Hall]

988
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,620
Eat.

989
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:30,680
Dig in.

990
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,770
Physician Qin.

991
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,360
Why are you hiding it?

992
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,640
All these years,

993
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,590
you must have

994
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,150
the secret to immortality.

995
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,020
That crazy girl.

996
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,190
There is no such medicine in this world.

997
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,820
Forget it.

998
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,140
What time is it now?

999
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,950
Why isn't she back yet?

1000
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,680
Did she faint somewhere?

1001
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:51,650
No.

1002
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,020
I have to find her.

1003
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,420
Rest assured and stay here.

1004
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,420
Jiu'er

1005
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,210
has recently met the elixir.

1006
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,740
She couldn't faint.

1007
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,670
Maybe she's cultivating elixirs.

1008
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,840
Physician Qin,

1009
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,670
leave the secret recipe to me.

1010
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,710
I'm the one who needs it.

1011
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,600
You crazy girl.

1012
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

1013
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,480
I need to watch over my medicine.

1014
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,340
Physician Qin.

1015
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,900
Physician Qin!

1016
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,400
Stop shouting.

1017
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,970
If you scream again,

1018
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,730
all the male cats nearby will gather here.

1019
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,680
Thank you, girl.

1020
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,640
I'll buy you a drink next time.

1021
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,270
Uncle Hu.

1022
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,250
Why don't you come in through the door

1023
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,890
but want me to send Physician Qin away

1024
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,420
and help you climb the wall?

1025
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,900
I can't see her.

1026
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,700
That silly Jiu'er

1027
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,550
has been disappearing all day.

1028
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,990
What if her mother asks me

1029
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,850
where she went,

1030
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,110
and I can't answer?

1031
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,570
I have to catch her.

1032
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,460
How dare she stays out all night?

1033
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,170
Take your time.

1034
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,100
I'm going to bed.

1035
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,380
I heard everything just now.

1036
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,600
What did you say?

1037
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,980
Met with what elixir?

1038
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,870
That's...

1039
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,840
What is it?

1040
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,610
Jiu'er doesn't allow me to tell Physician Qin.

1041
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,780
You can't tell her,

1042
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,480
but you can tell me. Go ahead.

1043
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,640
Have you noticed

1044
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,170
Jiu'er hasn't fainted for a long time?

1045
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:13,870
It's true.

1046
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,530
She hasn't fainted much recently.

1047
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,330
What's wrong?

1048
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,620
She knows a Qi man.

1049
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,270
Once she touches him...

1050
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:22,960
Move your hands away.

1051
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,150
She will recover.

1052
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,500
So,

1053
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,810
I think

1054
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,170
she is curing her illness.

1055
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:28,740
A Qi?

1056
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,400
Touching him can cure the disease?

1057
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:31,820
Yes.

1058
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,650
He knows shapeshifting.

1059
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,420
He's tall.

1060
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,500
A man.

1061
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,700
She said,

1062
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,270
she regains her energy once touching the man.

1063
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,860
It's more effective than medicine.

1064
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,100
Nonsense.

1065
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:41,980
Even I, Hu Badao,

1066
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,640
can't believe it.

1067
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,710
It's real.

1068
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,670
That girl just

1069
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,500
made up a story

1070
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,140
to fool you,

1071
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,580
a heartless silly girl.

1072
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,710
She went to investigate the case.

1073
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,380
Uncle Hu.

1074
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,130
You don't understand women.

1075
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,110
Investigating a case?

1076
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,970
How could she not bring you along?

1077
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,040
There is only one thing in this world

1078
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,860
that Godfather can't be brought along.

1079
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,460
What is it?

1080
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,910
Dating.

1081
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,710
You're all here.

1082
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:11,420
What?

1083
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,020
Your Highness.

1084
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,840
Are you working collaboratively with that inspector?

1085
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,300
Yes.

1086
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,710
Didn't you tell me

1087
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,700
that in Jiuxiao City,

1088
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,140
I need someone to work together?

1089
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,420
No.

1090
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,130
You were against it yesterday.

1091
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,460
Why did you agree today?

1092
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,370
What did she do to you?

1093
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,760
She...

1094
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:33,880
What can she do?

1095
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,240
It's just that

1096
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,720
I got the goods on her

1097
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,100
and took the initiative.

1098
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:38,900
Now,

1099
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,050
I've controlled her

1100
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,720
in my hand.

1101
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,410
Well,

1102
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:45,900
what if she

1103
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,590
has other thoughts about you?

1104
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,230
I've never been afraid.

1105
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,100
Right?

1106
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,720
He agreed to

1107
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,210
be your partner

1108
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:55,650
because he pitied you.

1109
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,180
Did anything else

1110
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:57,890
happen?

1111
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,930
No, no.

1112
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,330
He's just

1113
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,580
a partner to me.

1114
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,530
Do you think

1115
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,750
you can fool me with those words?

1116
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,030
I'm telling the truth.

1117
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,930
I know.

1118
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,330
I'm old.

1119
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,230
You don't want to

1120
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,050
share your thoughts now.

1121
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,840
You only talk to some flowers

1122
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,030
and grasses.

1123
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,100
Godfather,

1124
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,780
I didn't want you to worry.

1125
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,510
But, Hu,

1126
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,670
Hanzheng

1127
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,220
is really incredible.

1128
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,220
Look.

1129
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,360
I have no bone identification experience.

1130
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,980
But he could tell

1131
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:47,980
that body

1132
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,490
seems to be in his prime.

1133
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:50,820
He's about the same age

1134
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,630
as Lord Zhang.

1135
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,830
But his knee

1136
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,590
has wounds with a degree of wear

1137
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,110
up to 40 or 50 years.

1138
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,640
But Lord Zhang

1139
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,110
is only 39 years old.

1140
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,730
What does this mean?

1141
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,380
It means this body

1142
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,010
is a Qi man.

1143
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:07,690
What the hell?

1144
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,520
Why is there another Qi man?

1145
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,730
Besides,

1146
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,220
if we deduce with the time of death,

1147
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,710
among all the victims,

1148
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,120
this Qi man died first.

1149
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,290
But he was thrown out in the end.

1150
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,050
So I think

1151
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,750
his identity

1152
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,870
should be the key to solving the case.
