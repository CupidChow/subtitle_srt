[Episode 24]

4
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,740
Back then,

5
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,860
when I first joined the Inspection Bureau,

6
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,650
I was just

7
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,880
a minor patrol who served tea and water.

8
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,160
On the other hand, you and Su Huan

9
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,860
were already

10
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,500
famous constables in Jiuxiao City.

11
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,979
Everyone admired you.

12
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,050
Back then, I thought

13
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,500
how nice it would be

14
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,160
if I could become like you two,

15
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,280
serve the people of Jiuxiao City

16
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,260
and become a hero to them

17
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,580
one day.

18
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,320
But since Su Huan passed away,

19
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,940
you fell into depression

20
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,900
and alcoholism.

21
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,860
You said you wanted to be

22
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,860
a good inspector,

23
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,790
but you wasted your time

24
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,950
with alcohol.

25
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,940
In my heart, I believe

26
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,800
Hu Baodao shouldn't be like this.

27
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,710
From today onwards,

28
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,500
Su Jiu'er will officially become

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,050
a Senior Inspector of the Inspection Bureau.

30
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,460
And we all believe

31
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,540
she will

32
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,800
improve in the future.

33

Hu.

36
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,700
All these years, you keep scolding me.

37
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,900
You scolded me for only thinking about

38
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,350
getting promoted and getting rich.

39
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,200
My friend.

40
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,390
Let's not think about getting promoted and getting rich.

41
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,790
Let's cherish every day.

42

Come on.

43

We are different,

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,160
But I know

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,840
we are friends.

46

I will still leave a space for you at the table

63

I'll wait.

69
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,180
Hu didn't leave at all.

70
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,060
He's just trying to scare me.

71
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,090
He must be hiding somewhere,

I don't care.

My godfather didn't leave.

86
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,530
He's just joking with me.

87

Otherwise,

why didn't he bring his kettle with him

89
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,990
when he left?

90
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,540
Why didn't he bring me with him?

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,550
No.

92

How can you get out of here alive

98

if you refuse to eat or drink?

99
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,530
I've picked up Keyuncha.

100
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,580
I think

101
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,120
he would rather

102
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,420
stay with Shi Luqing

103
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,790
than return to Shuobei.

104
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,050
So I decided

105
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,160
to bury them together.

106
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,480
I've asked someone

107
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,010
to ask Shi Luqing's father.

108
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,210
He also agreed.

109
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:24,770
Thank you.

110
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,180
Sorry.

111
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,340
You always have to

112
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,180
clean up after us.

113
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,130
It's been like this since we were young.

114

Speaking of which,

118
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,300
we haven't

119
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,270
thanked you yet.

120
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,270
I don't want you to thank me.

121
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,450
I want you to live well.

122
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,800
There's no more news about Mu Yan.

123

Can you pull yourself together?

127
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,420
Stop making me worry.

128
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,110
I'm fine.

129
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,480
I just

130
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,590
need some time.

131
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,270
Don't worry.

132
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,180
Everything will be fine.

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,740
The Inspection Bureau has submitted a plaint.

is the day Uncle Hu will be buried.

141

Have a good rest.

142

No matter what,

143
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,100
I won't give up.

144
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,140
I will get you out of here.

Come on.

149
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,670
Have a drink.

150
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,240
You're weak.

It's so cold here.

152
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,400
The wine will warm you up.

Can you come out?

Right now,

160
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,780
I'm the only one here.

161
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,570
There's no one else.

into your wine flask.

169

If you don't come out now,

Come out, okay?

177
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,230

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,590
Hu.

180
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,420
I never wanted to believe

181
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,180
it was all true.

182
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,450
Until today, when I saw you

183
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,280
lying there

184
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,580
quietly,

185
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,630
as if you were asleep.

186
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,590
But I thought

187
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,880
maybe you were

188
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,600
playing a prank on us.

189
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,600
Maybe the next moment,

190
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,580
you'll jump up.

191
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,860
Yue Daren is here!

192
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,290
You'll say,

193
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,570
"Didn't I have you fooled?"

194
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,700
Until...

195
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,350
Until...

196
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,930
the sand filled your grave

197
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,030
little by little.

198
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,270
That's when I realized

199
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,190
you have really

200
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,770
left us.

201
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:37,940
You shouldn't

202
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,490
think too much.

203
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,980
You still have a long life ahead of you.

204
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,590
In life,

205
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,210
there are many possibilities.

206
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,830
Take your illness for example.

207
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,710
Maybe one day,

208
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,190
you'll meet a famous physician,

209
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,490
or encounter an incident

210
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,290
that'll help you recover in an instant.

211
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,820
It's absolutely possible.

212
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,920
Let me make it clear.

213
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,600
When that time comes,

214
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,790
you cannot look down on me

215
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,190
or think of me as a burden.

216
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,480
You must take me with you wherever you go.

217
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,540
Hu.

218
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,290
If...

219
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,570
If only all of this

220
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,820
was just a dream.

221
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,690
If that's the case,

222
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,270
I hope...

223
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,430
I hope

224
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,350
I never get to meet Han Zheng.

225
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,380
I only want to be

226
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,140
a sickly errand girl

227
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,820
my whole life.

228
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,140
I just want you and my mother

229
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,460
to stay by my side.

230
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,100
In that case,

231
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,630
I want nothing else.

232
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,390
Hu.

233
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,550
I'm sorry, Hu.

234
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,680
It's my fault.

235
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,110
I'm sorry.

236
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,820
I'm sorry, Hu.

237
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,140
Can you come back, Hu?

238
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,840
Can you come back?

239
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,760
Hu.

240
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,100
Come back.

241
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,190
Hu.

242
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,330
I beg of you.

243
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,830
[Inspection Bureau]

244
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,220
Kaka.

245
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,900
If you need

246
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,060
any food or necessities,

247
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,990
just let me know.

248
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,349
I'll bring it to you.

249
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,569
Don't worry about me.

250
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,160
It's only half a month.

251
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,530
After you get out,

252
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,770
don't fight anymore.

253
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,050
You're a Qi.

254
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,349
You can cripple

255
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,660
Qian kids

256
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,250
very easily.

257
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:20,819
Come on.

258
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,270
A- As long as they

259
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,339
don't bully Bin,

260
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,310
I won't

261
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,200
mess with them.

262
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,140
Otherwise, I...

263
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,280
I'll beat them up every time I see them!

264
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:34,930
Kaka.

265
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,380
Thank you

266
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
for defending Bin

267
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,240
again and again.

268
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:40,970
But from now on,

269
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,630
you're not allowed to do this.

270
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,610
How can I live with myself

271
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,660
if anything happens to you?

272
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,540
How can I answer to your father?

273
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,800
My father told me that.

274
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,950
Bin is different from other kids.

275
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,740
He has been getting bullied since he was young.

276
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,240
We grew up together.

277
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,920
I have to protect him.

278
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,410
Let's go.

279
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,080
Prince Han.

280
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,000
Prince Han.

281
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,020
Why isn't he moving?

282
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,420
Why isn't he responding?

283
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,060
He haven't eaten for days.

284
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,460
He couldn't have starved to death, right?

285
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,500
Just as well, a life for a life.

286
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,300
Let's go.

287
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,620
Tianyun, don't talk nonsense.

288
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,860
We had worked together after all,

289
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,780
not to mention

290
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,620
he's the Prince of the Qi.

291
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,180
If he dies of hunger,

292
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,680
it'll be a big problem.

293
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,660
Prince Han.

294
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,130
He's not dead.

295
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,720
What are you doing?

296
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,560
Prince Han.

297
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,080
Eat something.

298
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,900
Where's Jiu'er?

299
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,520
Has she been absent

300
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,740
from the Inspection Bureau for days?

301
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,880
She comes every day.

302
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,170
But

303
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,190
I haven't

304
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,550
heard her voice of late.

305
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,190
It's not just you.

306
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,540
I haven't heard her voice

307
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,790
in a long time either.

308
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,870
She comes every day,

309
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,740
but her soul isn't with her.

310
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,580
He's not dead. Stop talking.

311
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,220
Let's go.

312
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,750
You killed Uncle Hu!

313
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,530
Cut it out!

314
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,740
Uncle Hu and Physician Qin

315
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,870
are my benefactors.

316
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,510
You killed Uncle Hu.

317
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,770
You're my enemy!

318
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,300
Kaka.

319
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,290
It was an accident.

320
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,680
Then he's a fool!

321
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,550
Kaka.

322
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,140
Be good, Kaka.

323
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,300
You killed Uncle Hu.

324
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,380
You killed him.

325
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:43,900
Kaka.

326
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,740
You fool!

327
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,920
What did you say?

328
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,050
Even if it was an accident, you still killed him!

329
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,070
He's a kid.

330
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,570
-Why are you arguing with him?
-Kaka, stop it.

331
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,660
You're a fool!

332
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,140
You fool!

333
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:52,820
Kaka.

334
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,660
You fool!

335
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,320
This child.

336
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,080
Fool.

337
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,190
Kaka, be good.

338
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,180
Be good.

339
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,570
You fool!

340
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:01,760
You...

341
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,380
Stop it.

342
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,370
Fool.

343
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,410
Han, are you out of your mind?

344
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,980
Han.

345
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,960
Are you out of your mind?

346
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,460
Jiu'er.

347
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,180
It's not even nine o'clock yet.

348
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,460
Why are you up already?

349
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,260
Mother.

350
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
I'm going to the Inspection Bureau.

351
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,270
Jiu'er.

352
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,620
You were on duty last night.

353
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,250
Even if you don't go today,

354
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,650
no one will say anything.

355
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,710
They don't say anything

356
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,940
because they want to take care of me.

357
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,090
I don't want that.

358
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,420
Jiu'er.

359
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,200
Jiu'er.

360
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,340
Your pulse is still unstable.

361
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,980
You haven't been so weak

362
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,060
in a long time.

363
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,620
Stay at home for a few days.

364
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,410
Let me

365
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,640
help you recuperate.

366
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,140
OK?

367
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,610
Don't worry, Mother.

368
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,470
I'm fine.

369
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
The Inspection Bureau

370
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,260
hasn't had many cases recently.

371
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,070
It's the same without you around.

372
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,400
Why are you so stubborn?

373
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,010
I just want to find something to do.

374
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,690
That way, time will pass faster.

375
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,430
I wanted to find something for her to do,

376
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,900
so I asked her to cut a watermelon.

377
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,950
She's cut seven or eight of them.

378
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,360
Let her.

379
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,820
There aren't any cases anyway.

380
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,740
Let her cut them.

381
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,010
But the Inspection Bureau's

382
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:07,850
watermelon supply for the month

383
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,690
is about to be depleted in a day.

384
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,680
What do I do if I need to cool down later?

385
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,310
Find her something to do.

386
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,120
What other options are there?

387
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:25,920
Jiu'er.

388
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,480
You have nothing to do anyway.

389
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,340
Why don't you do something for me?

390
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:31,960
Well...

391
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,350
Aunt Zhang lost her cat.

392
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,860
She came over to complain several times.

393
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,520
Why don't you help her find it?

394
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,880
I'll be right there.

395
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,050
There's another task.

396
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,140
Old Zhang and his wife

397
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
quarreled again.

398
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,740
It's just

399
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,100
about trivial matters.

400
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,310
You know them well.

401
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,300
Why don't you go and mediate?

402
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,820
Sure.

403
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,680
One more thing.

404
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,500
Commander Yan asked me to interrogate

405
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,940
Prince Han...

406
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,620
and take his statement.

407
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,090
If you want,

408
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,510
-let’s… -I don’t want to.

409
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,530
I'm going to catch the cat.

410
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,860
Are you stupid?

411
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,670
Why did you mention Prince Han?

412
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,070
They used to be so close—

413
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,230
That was in the past.

414
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,220
Not now.

415
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,030
It's impossible between them now.

416
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,920
So love will disappear,

417
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,430
right?

418
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,090
Yes.

419
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,270
It disappeared.

420
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,750
What a waste!

421
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,590
Prince Han, this is warm.

422
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,490
Don't eat that.

423
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,940
Hurry up.

424
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,770
Come on.

425
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,750
-You finally ate. -Come on.

426
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,550
I was so afraid you'll starve to death.

427
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,550
We can't take that responsibility.

428
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,050
I heard Jiu'er today.

429
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,580
Is she well?

430
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,150
She's like this piece of paper,

431
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,990
she could be blown away by a single breath.

432
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,540
Is she still insistent

433
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,430
on not seeing me?

434
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,500
Then I can't

435
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,710
replenish her health.

436
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,600
Do me a favor.

437
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:29,960
Could you

438
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,400
ask Prince Jun to come here?

439
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,100
Prince Han,

440
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,680
don't take yourself

441
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,570
too seriously.

442
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,570
To be honest, if I weren't worried you would starve to death,

443
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,470
I wouldn't even want to talk to you.

444
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,070
And you want me to ask His Highness to come here?

445
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,700
Even if I could get the message to him,

446
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,230
would he be willing to come?

447
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,080
Tell him

448
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,430
I have a way

449
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,050
to make Jiu'er

450
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,070
happy.

451
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,420
Hurry up!

452
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,340
Open the door!

453
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,670
Your Highness, this...

454
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,720
It's okay.

455
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,020
Did you mistreat him?

456
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,110
How would we dare?

457
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,230
Brother Han,

458
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,470
although we are good friends,

459
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,820
I cannot forgive you

460
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,520
for what happened to Uncle Hu.

461
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
If you hadn't said

462
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,580
you had a way

463
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,820
to make Jiu'er happy,

464
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,530
I wouldn't have come to see you.

465
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,980
Let's get down to business then.

466
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,580
Follow me.

467
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,430
This is called the called Soul Invoking Bell.

468
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,900
Soul Invoking Bell?

469
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,990
-Yes. -What is it?

470
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:05,900
It's...

471
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,510
It can summon souls.

472
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,280
If this can invoke souls,

473
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,420
those shamans

474
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,580
will run out of business.

475
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,980
Don't underestimate it.

476
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:15,750
Apparently

477
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,890
this has been soaked with the water of the netherworld.

478
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:18,990
If you miss

479
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,080
a deceased person,

480
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,540
hang it in a west-facing room

481
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,090
at sunset.

482
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,220
Then,

483
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,230
call the name

484
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,740
of the person you miss.

485
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,270
If it moves

486
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
without the wind,

487
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,100
it means the person you care about

488
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,300
is responding to you.

489
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,380
As if that's true.

490
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,460
It is!

491
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,300
Liu Fu told me about this.

492
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,820
When he was young,

493
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,170
he saw someone using it.

494
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,750
I know you miss Uncle Hu.

495
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,680
So I asked him for it.

496
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,900
It took him a really long time to find it.

497
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,180
There's no wind.

498
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,910
Will it really ring?

499
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,860
If it doesn't,

500
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,890
it means

501
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,750
it's just an ordinary wind chime.

502
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,740
Or it means that

503
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,840
the soul dies

504
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,180
with the person.

505
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,080
Hu.

506
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,940
I miss you so much.

507
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,420
I really miss you.

508
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,100
If you hear me,

509
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,810
make it ring.

510
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,370
Just once is enough.

511
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,220
Let me know

512
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,900
you've always been by my side

513
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,220
and have never left me.

514
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,690
It's all a lie.

515
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,760
Hu.

516
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,410
Is that you?

517
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,460
Is it really you?

518
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,570
You really came back, right?

519
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,210
You've always been by my side,

520
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:58,850
right?

521
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,270
You don't want to leave me, right?

522
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,390
Hu.

523
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:09,740
You...

524
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,100
You still had a lot to do,

525
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,650
and a lot of wine to drink.

526
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,960
I really miss you.

527
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,820
Alright.

528
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,370
I won't cry anymore.

529
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:30,820
I...

530
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,270
I know you're worried about me.

531
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,670
But don't worry.

532
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,580
I will take good care of myself

533
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,260
and Mother.

534
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,330
If you see my father

535
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,180
on the other side,

536
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,470
please tell him

537
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,500
I'm well. Mother is well too.

538
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,040
We're all well.

539
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,220
Everything is well.

540
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,020
You two must

541
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,310
take care of yourselves too.

542
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,950
One day,

543
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,520
we will meet again.

544
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,850
Su Jiu'er.

545
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,160
May this wind chime

546
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,170
bring you some comfort.

547
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,840
Godfather.

548
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,030
Take care.

549
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,180
Jiu'er.

550
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:40,630
Jiu'er.

551
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,120
Jun.

552
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,210
Hu heard me!

553
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,290
He really heard me!

554
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,530
He came back to see me!

555
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,100
I know.

556
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,650
So you must cheer up.

557
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,940
Don't make Uncle Hu worry.

558
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,020
We must be happy in the future.

559
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,270
We must all live well.

560
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,240
Your Highness.

561
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,090
I've finally completed

562
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,200
your task.

563
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,710
Alright.

564
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,210
It seems that

565
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,870
other than politics,

566
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,630
you can do everything else.

567
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,060
I'll treat that as a thanks.

568
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,990
You're welcome.

569
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,460
Liu Fu.

570
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,480
Go make some tea for us.

571
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,290
But I have to make it clear.

572
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,940
I tidied you up

573
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,660
only to thank you

574
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,280
for your Soul Invoking Bell.

575
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,370
But I still can't forgive you

576
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,030
for what happened to Uncle Ho.

577
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,520
What if I said

578
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,320
there's more to

579
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,930
Uncle Hu's death?

580
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,790
What do you mean?

581
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,100
I keep recalling

582
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,450
what happened that day.

583
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,860
When I left the West Chamber,

584
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,740
I think Uncle Han said to me,

585
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,490
"Han.

586
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,780
Are you out of your mind?"

587
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
You mean

588
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,100
because Uncle Han's head

589
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,940
had been hit,

590
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,820
he shouldn't have been able to speak.

591
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,620
That's right.

592
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,910
If it wasn't you,

593
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,110
who else could it be?

594
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,500
Uncle Hu

595
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,640
couldn't have fallen down himself

596
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,570
and hit his head on the vase, right?

597
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,750
I don't know.

598
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,970
But the more I think about it, the weirder it is.

599
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:58,990
Have you

600
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,480
told Jiu'er about this?

601
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,580
She refuses to see me.

602
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,540
I've told the patrolmen

603
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,670
about it many times.

604
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,030
But they all think

605
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,460
I'm just making excuses for myself.

606
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,660
It's not their fault.

607
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,420
After all,

608
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,480
you don't have any evidence.

609
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,740
Even if I believed you,

610
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,350
I don't know how to help you.

611
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,310
I can only help Chilan

612
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,650
to find

613
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,210
a better lawyer for you.

614
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,290
Thank you.

615
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,430
The sun is rising from the west.

616
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,830
I didn't know those words

617
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,340
existed in your dictionary.

618
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,800
Enough.

619
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,200
How has Jiu'er been

620
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,390
lately?

621
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,900
She can at least eat now.

622
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,540
But

623
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,960
she's still not in a good mood.

624
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,850
Maybe there aren't any cases

625
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,620
at the Inspection Bureau

626
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,680
that can rouse her.

627
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,500
This girl really is strange.

628
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,440
Only a case

629
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,100
can cheer her up.

630
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,420
That's right.

631
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,380
I have a case!

632
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,740
You're just a kid.

633
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,000
What case can you have?

634
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,160
Have you heard of

635
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,320
the Peony Murder Case?

636
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,070
I think I've heard

637
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,780
a storyteller talk about it

638
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,780
at the teahouse.

639
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,320
it's a serial murder case.

640
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:13,260
Ten years ago,

641
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,219
there was a pervert in Jiuxiao City.

642
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,739
He targetted women

643
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,219
who wore peony patterns

644
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,000
or carried peony sachets.

645
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:23,030
My mother was one of the victims.

646
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,190
Isn't the case over?

647
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:28,489
I heard

648
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,489
the murderer jumped into the river and died

649
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,750
while evading arrest.

650
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,060
He didn't die,

651
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,610
it's still uncertain.

652
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,560
Although no similar cases

653
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,030
have happened ever since,

654
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,199
my father and I

655
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,719
still want the truth.

656
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,050
We want to know

657
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,620
who killed my mother.

658
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,060
Didn't the Inspection Bureau

659
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,989
send people to search for the body?

660
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,659
Yes.

661
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,159
Several corpses

662
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,929
were retrieved from the moat.

663
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,120
The time of death matched up

664
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,530
for four of those bodies.

665
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,160
Sister Jiu'er's father

666
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,850
investigated them one by one,

667
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,710
but he didn't find out who the murderer was.

668
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,710
Jiu'er's father?

669
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,820
The person in charge of this case

670
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,620
were Inspector Su and Uncle Liu.

671
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,060
It's a pity that

672
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,050
Inspector Su was seriously ill then

673
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,580
and passed away soon after.

674
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,190
Otherwise, given his capabilities,

675
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,520
he would definitely have solved the case.

676
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,680
A cold case left behind by Inspector Su...

677
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,820
This is indeed a case

678
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,940
Jiu'er would be interested in.

679
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,800
But with her condition,

680
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,570
even if she's interested in the case,

681
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,570
her body wouldn't be able to take it.

682
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,510
Only by touching me

683
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,340
can she regain her strength.

684
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,450
But right now,

685
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,460
she doesn't want to see me at all.

686
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,170
What should we do?

687
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:44,770
I have an idea.

688
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,040
What idea? Tell me.

689
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,390
Hit her with a rod,

690
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,510
knock her out,

691
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,880
and drag her here.

692
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,950
-Say that again. -Say that again.

693
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,300
I have an idea

694
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,500
we can try.

695
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,190
You'd better think before you speak.

696
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,980
Jiu'er.

697
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,140
I- I have something urgent to do tonight.

698
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,330
Commander Yan asked us

699
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,550
to switch shifts tonight

700
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,610
Patrol the prison?

701
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,240
Tell Commander Yan

702
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,340
I'm not going.

703
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,940
I won't go even he deducts my salary.

704
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,130
Then...

705
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,460
what should we do?

706
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,120
I have another way.

707
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,540
Why are you looking at me?

708
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,190
Come here.

709
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,200
Hurry up.

710
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,720
Have you heard?

711
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,030
I heard that Prince Han

712
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,820
is very close with Sister Jiu'er.

713
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,550
They used to work cases together every day.

714
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,740
They have been through thick and thin together.

715
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,390
Really?

716
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,010
-Yes. -What are you talking about? I can’t hear you.

717
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:58,820
What are you talking about?

718
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,860
He said Prince Han and Inspector Su

719
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:01,660
solved cases

720
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,370
and went through thick and thin together.

721
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,060
What are you talking about?

722
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,690
That man is the Prince of the Qi.

723
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,580
Inspector Su wants to

724
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,900
be with him forever.

725
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,060
Then their love

726
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,730
will be till death does them part?

727
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,890
What are you talking about?

728
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,750
Go back inside.

729
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,700
It's done.

730
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,420
Inspector Su and Prince Han

731
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,220
are together?

732
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,100
It's spread all over the prison.

733
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,480
Your idea

734
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,020
is rather soul-crushing.

735
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,580
Do you have a better idea?

736
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,240
She's coming.

737
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,200
Boss, have you heard?

738
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,430
Actually, Su Jiu'er and Prince Han

739
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,830
have long been a couple.

740
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,150
Who would believe that?

741
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,190
Jiu'er has never

742
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,840
visited him in prison.

743
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,680
Their love has long faded.

744
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,480
She's gone.

745
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,840
Boss, you don't know.

746
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,960
Actually,

747
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,540
Su Jiu'er has already fallen irrevocably in love

748
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,900
with Prince Han.

749
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,530
But because of Hu...

750
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,060
Because of this,

751
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,750
she's angry.

752
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,380
That's why she's avoiding.

753
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,260
But this love

754
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,250
never faded.

755
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:17,990
Where did you

756
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,680
hear this kind of gossip from?

757
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,300
It's spreading all over the prison.

758
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,520
Prince Han

759
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,680
said it all himself.

760
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
That's too much.

761
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:26,890
Jiu'er.

762
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,300
Aren't you going to

763
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,180
teach this arrogant man a lesson?

764
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,090
Brother Tianyun.

765
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,230
I know what you're trying to do.

766
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,060
But I was living well

767
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,130
before I met him too.

768
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,490
So you all

769
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,890
don't have to bother yourselves with this.

770
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,870
You've been listening for so long.

771
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:48,440
How is it?

772
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:50,850
How is it?

773
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:54,810
Looks like

774
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,480
she has made up her mind

775
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,020
never to see me again.

776
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,740
What should we do now?

777
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,640
If this goes on,

778
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,150
her body will get weaker and weaker.

779
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,020
Yesterday, Uncle Liu told me

780
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,080
she fainted again.

781
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,500
She was unconscious

782
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,560
for several hours.

783
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,470
Now,

784
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,420
there's only one method left.

785
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:21,900
What is it?

786
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,660
What have you been busy with recently?

787
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,990
I helped Aunt Zhao find her wallet,

788
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,600
caught the thief

789
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,220
stealing Uncle Li's chickens,

790
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,930
and found

791
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,720
Uncle Zhao's

792
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,320
lost dog.

793
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,410
Look at you.

794
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,580
Your life is so fulfilling.

795
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,630
It is.

796
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,500
But I always feel

797
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,100
I don't have any energy.

798
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,700
Look at you.

799
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,400
Do you need a big case

800
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,880
to make you feel better?

801
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,380
Without cases,

802
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,590
it means Jiuxiao City is peaceful.

803
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,220
The people live and work in peace.

804
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,380
Isn't that good?

805
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,930
You're right.

806
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,180
If I can remain like this,

807
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,140
safe and sound,

808
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,660
it won't be long

809
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,060
before I live out my life.

810
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,110
Why do you sound like an old person.

811
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,300
You don't have the vitality of a young person

812
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,820
at all.

813
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,350
Who said I didn't?

814
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,730
Physician Qin.

815
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:54,580
Prince Jun.

816
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,120
Jiu'er.

817
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,580
Kaka?

818
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,610
Why are you two here together?

819
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,600
We...

820
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,580
I met Prince Jun

821
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,580
at the door.

822
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,340
Kaka.

823
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,970
How did you know Jun is a prince?

824
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,430
Didn't Physician Qin

825
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,420
just say it?

826
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:10,540
Yes.

827
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,070
Why are you a Prince?

828
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,260
You scared me.

829
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,620
What brings you here?

830
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,220
There's something.

831
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,080
Sister Jiu'er.

832
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,870
I want you to solve a case for me.

833
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,500
Kaka.

834
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,800
Your Sister Jiu'er

835
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,540
hasn't been feeling well lately.

836
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,060
Don't trouble her.

837
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,550
Physician Qin,

838
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,160
it's my mother's case.

839
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,570
I always thought she died unjustly.

840
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,470
The murderer is still at large.

841
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:36,780
Please let Sister Jiu'er

842
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,490
help me.

843
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:38,950
Mother.

844
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,350
Physician Qin.

845
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,740
Let Kaka

846
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,640
talk to Jiu'er.

847
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:44,720
If Jiu'er is willing,

848
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,520
I can help her.

849
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,950
I'm here. Don't worry.

850
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,090
Mother.

851
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:55,980
Fine.

852
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:57,650
Kaka.

853
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,010
Let's talk outside.

854
00:41:59,210 --> 00:41:59,580
Okay.

855
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:00,940
Kaka.

856
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,600
Have you found

857
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,540
any new clues

858
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,780
for your mother's case?

859
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,150
Yes.

860
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,200
There is something suspicious.

861
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,870
I know that

862
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,990
since Hu's accident,

863
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,280
Jiu'er has been unhappy.

864
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,350
She hasn't had energy.

865
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:16,950
I

866
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,230
do want her

867
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,580
to be more energetic.

868
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,360
But I'm worried that she'll be put in danger.

869
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,000
Physician Qin,

870
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,880
don't worry.

871
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,910
No matter what happens,

872
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,750
I will protect

873
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,510
Miss Jiu'er.

874
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,890
By the way, Physician Qin,

875
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,890
is Jiu'er illness

876
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,020
getting worse?

877
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,050
Yes.

878
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,320
It's weird.

879
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,060
A while ago,

880
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:42,570
she was getting better.

881
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,430
I thought she had received Heaven's blessings.

882
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,190
But after Hu's accident,

883
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,670
her illness

884
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,780
has been getting worse.

885
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,400
Physician Qin.

886
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,430
I have a secret prescription.

887
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,290
It might be useful for her health.

888
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,420
But

889
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,440
you have to mix it in secretly.

890
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,810
Don't let her find out.

891
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:11,670
Why?

892
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,660
Because I got it...

893
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,260
from Prince Han.
