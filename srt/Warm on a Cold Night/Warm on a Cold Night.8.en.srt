4
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,920
Your Highness.

5
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,430
Her pulse

6
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,610
is very strange.

7
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,660
I'm not talented enough.

8
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,420
I can't say anything.

9
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,850
However,

10
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,060
she is blessed.

11
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,840
She should be safe.

12
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,520
She'll be fine after some rest.

13
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,290
That's good.

14
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,900
This...

15
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,440
young master of Qi.

16
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,050
Do you need my help?

17
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,180
No need.

18
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,420
No way.

19
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,890
Your wound is so serious.

20
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,190
Imperial Physician,

21
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,940
please help my friend

22
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,490
to deal with the wound.

23
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,590
Yes, please.

24
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,340
Where is this place?

25
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,380
You Qi people

26
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,350
recover so fast.

27
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,210
Hanzheng.

28
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,130
Prince Jun.

29
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,740
Miss Jiu'er, are you okay?

30
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,960
I'm fine.

31
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,670
What happened exactly?

32
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,350
Why were you locked

33
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,370
in the ice cellar?

34
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,660
By the way,

35
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,740
I found a female body

36
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,820
in the ice cellar.

37
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,140
If I'm not mistaken,

38
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,500
it should be Chef Zhang's wife.

39
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,590
Also,

40
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,570
the lords involved in the Nursery Crime Case

41
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,360
and Zhamuke

42
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,630
should have been killed by him.

43
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,490
Zhamuke...

44
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:26,960
was dead?

45
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,829
No wonder you went to the theater.

46
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,670
Let's go.

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,760
Meet my Father

48
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,780
and explain the ins and outs.

49
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,390
However,

50
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,390
I'll keep you two safe.

51
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,310
Thank you, Prince Jun.

52
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,730
How could this happen?

53
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,250
Yes.

54
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:55,890
Tell me.

55
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,620
What should we do?

56
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,280
How did the Qi people break in?

57
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,240
What happened to Jun?

58
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,420
Didn't he say to give us an explanation?

59
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,079
Where is he?

60
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:17,640
Father.

61
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,540
Calm down.

62
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,779
I've sent someone to invite him.

63
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,700
Prince Jun is here.

64
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,350
Prince Jun.

65
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,120
Greetings, Father.

66
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,640
Greetings, Your Majesty.

67
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,310
Kneel down.

68
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,550
Jun.

69
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,520
This must be the Qi man

70
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
who made a scene in the palace, is he?

71
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:06,990
Father.

72
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,500
They are my friends.

73
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,930
Miss Jiu'er

74
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,700
is an Inspector from the Inspection Bureau.

75
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,370
She and Young Master Hanzheng came to the palace

76
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,780
to report something important.

77
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,580
Your Majesty.

78
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,180
What is it?

79
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,520
Regarding the culprit of the Nursery Crime Case.

80
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,800
I remember the murderer of the Nursery Crime Case

81
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,890
was a Qi with three scars.

82
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,250
Does he dare to hide in the palace?

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,580
The murderer of the Nursery Crime Case

84
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,510
was not a Qi man,

85
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,960
but

86
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,100
him.

87
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,140
What?

88
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,880
This...

89
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,600
It can't be Chef Zhang.

90
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,580
Impossible.

91
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,820
Your Majesty.

92
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,170
I'm innocent, Your Majesty!

93
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,720
Your Majesty.

94
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,350
Everyone knows

95
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,380
the culprit is a Qi man.

96
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,210
They're distorting the truth.

97
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,940
They must be helping the Qi man get rid of the crime

98
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,420
so that they slander me.

99
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,360
Your Majesty.

100
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,190
Although the lords who died

101
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,980
had claw marks on their bodies,

102
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,910
those claw marks

103
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,840
were in the same spot

104
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,040
and of the same depth.

105
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,230
They are as precise as made by a tool.

106
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,620
Besides,

107
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,340
those claw marks were caused after death.

108
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,080
It's apparent that someone deliberately framed the Qi.

109
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,480
The last headless corpse

110
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,960
was not a Qian official

111
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,650
but a Qi man named

112
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,820
Zhamuke.

113
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,930
He was the one

114
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,090
who took Chef Zhang's wife for elopement

115
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:28,890
in the rumor.

116
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,660
Your Majesty.

117
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,020
Zhamuke's body

118
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,110
is now

119
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,680
in the coroner's room of the Investigation Bureau.

120
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,610
Please look into it, Your Majesty.

121
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,740
You said Zhamuke was dead?

122
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,710
Didn't they already go to Shuobei?

123
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,100
Your Majesty.

124
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,560
Zhamuke indeed

125
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,880
seduced my wife.

126
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,480
It's true that I hate him.

127
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,420
But I'm no match for Qi.

128
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,659
I can only let them

129
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,130
live together, Your Majesty.

130
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,760
Chef Zhang.

131
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,350
Was your wife

132
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,620
wearing a purple agate bracelet?

133
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,440
That's a token of love I gave her.

134
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,860
Did you drop

135
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,020
this hairpin

136
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,250
when you hid the body?

137
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,100
Your wife is now wearing

138
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,580
the love token you gave her

139
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,220
and being hidden in the cabinet in the ice cellar.

140
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,480
You're slandering me!

141
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,120
Your Majesty.

142
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,870
I didn't kill anyone.

143
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,210
Please do me justice, Your Majesty.

144
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,890
Your Majesty!

145
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,180
Guards!

146
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,430
Yes, sir.

147
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,100
Assign someone to check the ice cellar.

148
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,460
Yes.

149
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,840
Search carefully.

150
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,300
Your Majesty.

151
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,690
Your Majesty.

152
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,170
We have searched the ice cellar thoroughly.

153
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,170
No body was found.

154
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,450
What did I say?

155
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,170
What?

156
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,300
This is slander.

157
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,430
How is that possible?

158
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,760
I saw the body.

159
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,470
There's a cabinet inside.

160
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,060
Have you checked it carefully?

161
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,460
There's indeed nothing.

162
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,900
You may leave now.

163
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,299
Yes.

164
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,340
Did you hallucinate

165
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,429
when you were weak?

166
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,460
Impossible.

167
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,450
At that time,

168
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,580
I was just locked up.

169
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,740
I was still sober.

170
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,310
Your Majesty.

171
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,670
I'm innocent.

172
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,980
I didn't kill anyone.

173
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,690
Please do me justice, Your Majesty.

174
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,250
You wronged an innocent person.

175
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,980
As an Inspector from the Inspection Bureau,

176
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,500
you should know the punishment.

177
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:07,890
Your Majesty.

178
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,940
It must be

179
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,660
after I was rescued,

180
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,100
Chef Zhang was afraid that I might notice something,

181
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,750
so he moved the body somewhere else.

182
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,700
Until this moment, you are still pestering

183
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,810
and slandering me!

184
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,330
Your Majesty.

185
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,150
Enough.

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,910
What a disgrace

187
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,780
in the hall!

188
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,210
Do you have any other evidence?

189
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,900
Chef Zhang, you may leave.

190
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

191
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,770
Don't move. I'll do it myself.

192
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,420
There are so many places to hide a corpse.

193
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,730
Why did Chef Zhang have to

194
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,260
hide it in the ice cellar?

195
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,460
Why don't you believe me?

196
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,670
I really saw the body.

197
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,470
I believe you.

198
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,380
But you have to answer my question first.

199
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,040
Ice cellar.

200
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,580
Hidden body.

201
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,220
Chef Zhang cherishes a deep-seated affection

202
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:12,960
for his wife.

203
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,240
Although he killed her in anger,

204
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,380
he couldn't bear

205
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,780
to let her flesh perish.

206
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,430
I see.

207
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,130
He hid the body in the ice cellar

208
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,610
because he wanted to

209
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,800
accompany his wife day and night.

210
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,920
That's why

211
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,680
he has frozen wounds on him.

212
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,140
What does the Qi man want?

213
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,520
Exactly.

214
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,380
What are you doing?

215
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,240
Qi people are always so reckless.

216
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,420
No!

217
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,930
My wife!

218
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:46,650
My wife!

219
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,220
My wife!

220
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,580
My wife!

221
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,240
My wife!

222
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,990
Don't touch my wife!

223
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,250
Don't touch my wife!

224
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,750
I want to

225
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,110
be with my wife forever.

226
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,360
I won't allow her

227
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,640
to become a horrible withered skeleton.

228
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,350
How dare you, Zhang Sen!

229
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,610
You deceived His Majesty

230
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,260
and committed a heinous crime.

231
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,520
You'd better admit your guilt now.

232
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,720
I didn't hurt her.

233
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,890
She was determined to leave with the Qi man.

234
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,740
She even risked her life

235
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,180
to drink the poison

236
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,250
I prepared for her.

237
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,750
It was the Qi man who harmed her.

238
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,430
Qi people deserve to die.

239
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,890
Those who are siding with Qi deserve to die.

240
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,480
Let me ask you.

241
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,420
Where is

242
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,190
the real Lord Zhang Yunhe?

243
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,020
He's dead.

244
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,140
They all deserve to die.

245
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,020
I want everyone to

246
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,750
know

247
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,620
there is no good end to

248
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,590
dealing with Qi people.

249
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,560
Guards!

250
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,050
Take him away

251
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,540
and wait for further instructions.

252
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:57,870
Yes.

253
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,920
My wife.

254
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,720
Don't touch her!

255
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,210
Don't touch my wife!

256
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,050
My wife!

257
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,980
My wife!

258
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,580
Jun.

259
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,280
Come here.

260
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,900
My Father

261
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,440
is going to reward you.

262
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,150
Go.

263
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,420
Father.

264
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:29,910
Guards!

265
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,610
Arrest

266
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,340
this lawless

267
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,790
and reckless Qi!

268
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:36,680
Yes.

269
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,070
Miss Jiu'er.

270
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,190
It's late.

271
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,620
Please go back and have some rest.

272
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,750
If there is any news,

273
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,240
His Highness will send someone

274
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,320
to tell you.

275
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,380
But...

276
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,570
Eunuch Liu.

277
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,050
In your opinion,

278
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,560
regarding the matter,

279
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,900
will they be implicated

280
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,780
because of me?

281
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,280
His Majesty detained Young Master Han

282
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,540
because he shapeshifted and trespassed the palace.

283
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,580
You were not caught

284
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,860
because His Majesty knows you're here to investigate the case.

285
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,300
As for His Highness,

286
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,250
he has been taken care of by the Empress

287
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,310
since he was young.

288
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,940
Don't worry too much.

289
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,490
But...

290
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,900
But what about Hanzheng?

291
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,250
I really don't know

292
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,950
what His Majesty is thinking.

293
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,850
Do you think today's incident

294
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,850
is related to the Young Prince again?

295
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,610
Probably.

296
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,270
Miss Jiu'er.

297
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,740
Listen to my advice.

298
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,790
If you wait here,

299
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,810
you will only be in the way

300
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,540
of His Highness saving the guy.

301
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,360
But...

302
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,860
Please go back.

303
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,880
All right.

304
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,030
Eunuch Liu,

305
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,390
if there is any news,

306
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,300
please ask His Highness to

307
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,200
inform me in time.

308
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,930
Don't worry.

309
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,100
Hurry up.

310
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,760
Father!

311
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:53,420
Father!

312
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,840
Why, Father?

313
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,300
Why?

314
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,210
I also want to know

315
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,630
why he had to shapeshift

316
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,190
and break into the palace

317
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,350
to reveal the truth.

318
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,740
That's because Miss Jiu'er

319
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,700
was trapped in the palace.

320
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,380
Trapped?

321
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,050
She is an Inspector.

322
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,560
Doesn't she take the official path

323
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,780
for investigation?

324
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:21,900
Jun.

325
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,670
How do you relate

326
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,080
to this matter?

327
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,110
Father, Miss Jiu'er...

328
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,560
Father.

329
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,500
It's a matter of life and death.

330
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,340
So that Second Younger Brother was too anxious

331
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,070
and disturbed the family banquet accidentally.

332
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,900
But the Nursery Crime Case did affect

333
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,780
the relationship between Qian and Qi.

334
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,020
Now the truth is revealed.

335
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,850
Although the three of them did something wrong,

336
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,580
they had merits for both races.

337
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,880
It's good to know the truth.

338
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,800
But that Qi

339
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,180
dared to shapeshift

340
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,340
in my palace.

341
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,440
If we don't punish him severely today,

342
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,980
in the future, if something happens again,

343
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,520
wouldn't the Qi people

344
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,330
do whatever they want

345
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,920
in my country?

346
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,310
But Father,

347
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,720
Young Master Han is here

348
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,530
to save the Qian people.

349
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,750
Do you think he can despise the law

350
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,350
for saving people?

351
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:16,800
Father,

352
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,790
Jun didn't mean that.

353
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,810
The case has been much debated among the public.

354
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,500
It affects the relationship between the two states.

355
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,180
Not only is the murderer not Qi,

356
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,710
but it turns out to be a Qian.

357
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,930
I'm afraid that it will rouse discontent and indignation among the Qi people.

358
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,860
Let's discuss this matter further

359
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,150
and be careful.

360
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,230
You're indeed considerate

361
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,040
and thoughtful.

362
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,220
This matter concerns the relationship between the two states.

363
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,350
We should interrogate him nicely.

364
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,820
Don't let Qi think

365
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,140
we're mistreating their people.

366
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,100
Ying,

367
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,540
I'll leave it

368
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,090
to you.

369
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,180
Yes, Father.

370
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,420
Also,

371
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:04,910
you

372
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,630
should not make excuses for

373
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,670
your willful brother anymore.

374
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,550
You may leave now.

375
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,300
-Yes, Father.
-Yes, Father.

376
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:26,570
Ah Qi.

377
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,510
Your Highness.

378
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,750
Arrange some men

379
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,620
to protect Father

380
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,310
and Mother.

381
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,750
[Qian, Guard, Ah Qi]

382
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,020
Yes.

383
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,130
Eldest Brother,

384
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,100
you will help me this time.

385
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:39,780
Right?

386
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,740
How dare you say that?

387
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,650
Not seen for a few days,

388
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,260
I knew

389
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,260
you must have known

390
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,590
new friends in Jianghu.

391
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,880
I didn't expect you

392
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,720
to cause trouble in a blink of an eye.

393
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,650
They are not friends from Jianghu.

394
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,730
They are from the Inspection Bureau.

395
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,030
And they really didn't intend

396
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,420
to break into the palace.

397
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,990
They were here to investigate the case.

398
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,920
How long have you

399
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,470
known each other

400
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,010
that you already dare to speak for them?

401
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,050
Later,

402
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,490
tell me

403
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,660
their past history.

404
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,099
It'd be best if they don't have any criminal records.

405
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,730
If there's anything unusual,

406
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,790
Father will not calm down,

407
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,140
even if the Qi man is imprisoned for several months.

408
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,069
Eldest Brother,

409
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,220
I'll now prepare

410
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,140
some wine and cuisine.

411
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,240
Then I'll tell you everything

412
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,480
in your study.

413
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,619
You don't even have time for the banquet.

414
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,069
Why bother preparing food and wine?

415
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,700
That's right.

416
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,230
I knew it.

417
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,069
Eldest Brother must be hungry, right?

418
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,490
I'm going to prepare the food and wine

419
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,970
and make up for my mistake.

420
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,130
I'll be quick.

421
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,090
Eldest Brother, how about this?

422
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,290
Just make a pot of tea.

423
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
I'll be right back

424
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,200
after that.

425
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,600
It's just a pot of tea.

426
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,960
[He'an Hall]

427
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,220
Morning, Mother.

428
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,440
Stop there!

429
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,450
Jiu'er.

430
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,470
What...

431
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,030
What happened to your face?

432
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,300
Didn't you sleep last night?

433
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,550
I think you are having liver fire exuberance.

434
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,810
Let me take your pulse.

435
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm fine, Mother.

436
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,460
I was just handling the case

437
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,700
and thinking too much.

438
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,670
So I lack sleep.

439
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,690
How dare you?

440
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,090
What benefits did the Inspection Bureau give you?

441
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,550
You work on cases every day

442
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,910
instead of goofing off.

443
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,350
Don't worry, Mother.

444
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,900
Anyway, I think

445
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,270
I am going to lose my job.

446
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,220
I'll go back to the Inspection Bureau first to clean up the mess.

447
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,680
Let's talk about it later.

448
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,250
Going to lose?

449
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,320
I wonder if

450
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,450
yesterday's incident

451
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,800
will cause any trouble.

452
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,930
I hope nothing bad will happen to Hanzheng.

453
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,880
Is the lord from the Law Department already here?

454
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh, can I have a break?

455

Come on. Follow me. Let's go.

[Su Jiu'er]

473
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:29,830
I heard

474
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,780
she brought Qi people

475
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,670
to disturb His Majesty.

476
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,070
I thought she would get into trouble.

477
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,900
I didn't expect things

478
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,110
to be like this.

479
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,020
C-Commander Yan.

480
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,700
I was about to explain to you.

481
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,180
If it weren't for the Qi man,

482
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,010
the case wouldn't have been solved.

483
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,630
I was reckless this time.

484
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,540
But...

485
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,600
But the culprit has been imprisoned.

486
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,870
I know everything.

487
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,450
Come over and thank His Highness.

488
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,230
If he hadn't

489
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,250
told me the ins and outs,

with what you did,

491

His Majesty

492
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,670
could cut your head off.

493
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,500
In that case, you can be saved.

494
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,030
Your merits are fulfilled.

495
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,160
Your Highness.

496
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,640
Will Hanzheng be alright?

497
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,570
I won't break my promise.

498
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,350
And Eldest Brother

499
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,950
won't break his promise too.

500
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,960
That's great.

501
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:37,980
Great.

502
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,320
It seems

503
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,120
you care about him.

504
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,790
Since Your Highness helps me so much,

505
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,160
I can't hide it from you.

506
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,940
Actually,

507
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,560
I haven't known him for long.

508
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,280
But he took such a big risk

509
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,250
for me.

510
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,820
Now he's even in prison.

511
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,560
I just feel

512
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,660
very guilty.

513

You haven't known each other for long?

is guilty,

516
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,280
will it implicate

Don't scare her.

520
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,750
Miss Jiu'er has wide experience and extensive knowledge.

521
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,950
The person she trusts must be reliable.

00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,030
Sure.

Don't worry.

525
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,110
Eldest Brother went to the prison early in the morning.

526
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,000
He will let me know at once

527
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,130
if there's a result.

528
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,680
Let's eat at Deyue Restaurant while waiting.

529
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,280
Your Highness is inviting me to Deyue Restaurant again?

530
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,390
You're so nice.

531
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,430
In exchange,

532
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,360
tell me the stories

533
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,890
about your investigation.

534
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:30,700
Let's go.

535
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,770
Let's go.

536
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,500
Come out.

537
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,030
This man

538
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,840
doesn't have any smell at all.

539
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,040
You can't smell me,

540
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,330
right?

541
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,540
I solved the Nursery Crime Case

542
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,820
and brought justice

543
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,980
to your officials.

544
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,000
How could you do this to me?

545
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,340
You even used agarwood

546
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,620
to block my five senses

547
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,880
and weaken my ability.

548
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,390
Why are you so afraid of Qi people?

549
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,950
Do you have to be so careful

550
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,200
even to a Qi man who has saved Qian?

551
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:47,580
It's not fear

552
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,490
but fairness.

553
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,220
Qian people can't tell

554
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,280
the smell of Qi too.

555
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,570
Everyone should take a step back

556
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,370
to understand each other.

557
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,570
Am I right?

558
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,800
Who are you?

559
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,710
I'm your friend,

560
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,280
Wen Jun's brother.

561
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,680
Eldest Prince of Qian,

562
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,730
Wen Ying.

563
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,700
I don't want to be friends with Qian people.

564
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,030
What about the girl

565
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,850
you rescued from the ice cellar?

566
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,490
And Prince Jun,

567
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,150
who runs hither and thither and pleads all day

568
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:23,820
for you?

569
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,900
Tell me.

570
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,060
How long are you going to imprison me?

571
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,260
At least a few months.

572
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,410
At most,

573
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,470
it won't take more than a year.

574
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,430
A year?

575
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,760
I don't have time to waste.

576
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,290
Do you really think this prison

577
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,210
can lock me up?

578
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,850
This prison

579
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,220
is built for you Qi people.

580
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,690
Once you are locked up here,

581
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,140
even the Qi people can't escape.

582
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,870
If you leave,

583
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,430
His Majesty will blame you,

584
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,750
the people you saved will also be implicated.

585
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,210
I saved someone

586
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,100
but troubled myself.

587
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,790
You Qian people

588
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,640
really disappoint me.

589
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,360
The Qi people have a long life.

590
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,410
One year

591
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,180
is nothing.

592
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,370
Hold on.

593
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,180
If it weren't for Jun,

594
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,940
I wouldn't have talked to you.

595
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,540
Do you really think you have the right

596
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,820
to bargain with me?

597
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,270
How do you know I don't?

598
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,140
I advise you

599
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,300
to talk to me nicely.

600
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,070
I'm no different

601
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,700
from you.

602
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:43,950
Who are you?

603
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,690
Tell Jun immediately.

604
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:55,980
Yes.

605
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,280
The rest of you,

606
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,360
return to the palace with me.

607
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,730
Yes.

608
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,000
Father.

609
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,520
What is it?

610
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,000
Your Highness.

611
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,140
Han-

612
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,890
What's wrong with Hanzheng?

613
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:33,950
Did something happen?

614
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,900
That Qi man...

615
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,500
He said he was the only son of the King of Xueqi.

616
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,840
Hanzheng.

617
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,310
He is the Prince of Qi.

618
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,510
A prince?

619
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,950
Miss Jiu'er.

620
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,710
You really don't know.

621
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,890
But how could it be?

622
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,310
He is a prince.

623
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,860
He smuggled here

624
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,980
without the pass.

625
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,620
How couldn't a prince

626
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,740
can't get the pass?

627
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,420
A prince will also sneak out.

628
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,030
He is a prince.

629
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,730
You are also a prince.

630
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,060
I didn't even notice

631
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,320
when I met two princes.

632
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,720
Am I still

633
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,140
from Inspection Bureau?

634
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,600
It's...

635
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,830
It's not your fault.

636
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,010
We did a good job in disguise.

637
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,360
But since he is a prince,

638
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,400
he should be released.

639
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,510
Why does the Crown Prince

640
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,500
so nervous?

641
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,100
The son of the King of Xueqi

642
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,100
violating our law

643
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,520
and being imprisoned

644
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,040
has greatly damaged the reputation of the Qi race.

645
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,100
But he solved the Nursery Crime Case.

646
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,610
This case was tricky.

647
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,190
It was also a set-up of a Qian to Qi people,

648
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,270
implicating the relationship between the two countries.

649
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,000
The punishment of the Young Master of Qi

650
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,200
is really difficult.

651
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,950
The Prince of Qi

652
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,020
disregarded the laws of Qian

653
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,000
and broke into the palace,

654
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,930
with suspicion of assassination.

655
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,190
This is really a great gift

656
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,320
to fall into our lap.

657
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,350
You mean...

658
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,730
Next month,

659
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,340
the state of Qi will send ambassadors

660
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,520
to work out the details of the Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

661
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,440
Qian-Qi Six Treaties?

662
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,740
What is that?

663
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,530
Well...

664
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,450
Your Highness, you are...

665
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,380
The Jiuzhou Continent

666
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,020
is filled with various nations and tribes.

667
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,350
This is where the state of Qian is located.

668
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,410
The state of Qian is located in a rich land.

669
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,680
Qian people excel in wisdom,

670
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,520
mobilized by cooperation,

671
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,520
[The State of Qian]

672
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:03,920
and bound by law.

673
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,000
With planning and strategizing,

674
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,980
the state of Qian has become a powerful country.

675
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,740
The state of Qi is north of us.

676
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,560
Although we are neighbors,

677
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,930
the Qi race enjoys cold

678
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,590
and dislikes the weather in the south.

679
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,320
We had always been harmonious.

680
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,540
But there were countless countries

681
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,600
besides Qian and Qi

682
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,470
coveting the riches of Qian.

683
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,720
Qian had suffered a lot for it.

684
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,380
But later, my ancestor,

685
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,740
Emperor Zhaowu thought that

686
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,640
we could use the power

687
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,420
of the Qi race with strong stamina.

688
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,080
Therefore,

689
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,790
Emperor Zhaowu sent

690
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,060
Dongji Island which is located north of Qian as a gift,

691
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,630
and promised an annual tribute

692
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,630
in exchange for Qi

693
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,840
to guard the northern border for us.

694
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,910
He also promised

695
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,100
Qian and Qi

696
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,670
would befriend from generation to generation.

697
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,330
In fact, Qian-Qi Six Treaties

698
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,270
had already been confirmed.

699
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,190
But it hadn't been signed yet.

700
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,430
After that, the late emperor passed away.

701
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,260
This matter was delayed as well.

702
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,120
Fortunately,

703
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,820
we found that

704
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,870
if the Qi people

705
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,560
get too deep into our country,

706
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,820
we will be in trouble.

707
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,580
So I have to be careful.

708
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,010
Father is thoughtful.

709
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,100
A few years ago,

710
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,400
your Grandfather wanted to use the power of the Qi race.

711
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,940
We thought

712
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,150
the Qi race

713
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,020
would live next to us harmoniously

714
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,210
because of the weather

715
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,740
and never invade each other.

716
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,380
But we didn't expect

717
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,150
the Qi race to start to act unusual.

718
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,710
They insist to sign the agreement

719
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,340
and move to Dongji Island.

720
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,860
So this time,

721
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,570
we can use the reason

722
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,100
for the Prince of Qi disobeying the law

723
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,160
and let them choose

724
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,560
whether to put

725
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,150
the Qian-Qi Six Treaties aside.

726
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,870
Maybe we can find a way

727
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,000
to not sign it forever.

728
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
I understand now.

729
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,960
I'll send ambassadors

730
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,770
to Shuobei

731
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,970
and ask the Qi race

732
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,630
to pick him up in Jiuxiao City.

733
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,230
Go.

734
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,870
Father, I'll take my leave.

735
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,830
It's all my fault.

736
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,620
Hanzheng told me

737
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,450
to be careful.

738
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,270
But I caused such a big trouble

739
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,780
and implicated him.

740
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,930
Don't say that.

741
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,550
Brother Han saw you

742
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,060
you working hard to find out the truth about the Qi race.

743
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,950
He saw your sincerity and kindness.

744
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,550
That's why he did this to you.

745
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,620
Your Highness.

746
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,800
Can we meet him?

747
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,820
He has a special identity.

748
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,540
I'm afraid I can't help you this time.

749
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,510
But don't worry.

750
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,300
Even if he is imprisoned,

751
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,620
my Father will treat him

752
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,820
as an honored guest.

753
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,350
Miss Jiu'er.

754
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,160
Instead of worrying,

755
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,100
why don't you think about

756
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,480
how to wrap up the Nursery Crime Case?

757
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,280
It can help him redeem his fault.

758
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,400
As for the rest,

759
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,630
leave it to the ambassadors of both states.

760
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,230
Am I right?

761
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,060
What should I do?

762
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,030
I'm just an Inspector.

763
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,510
This is

764
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,520
all I can do.

765
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,590
I was born

766
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,610
with strength.

767
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,060
It's a piece of cake

768
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,140
to protect you.

769
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,220
I will prove that

770
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:23,900
I can be

771
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,760
a good partner.

772
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,140
Do you understand now?

773
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,990
Qi people are

774
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,070
stronger than you.

775
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,260
I'm here.

776
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,910
You won't die.

777
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:32,730
Exactly.

778
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,200
You're so strong.

779
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,420
Come out if you dare!

780
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,420
Scare me to death!

781
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,000
Come out if you dare!

782
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,160
Come out and scare me to death.

783
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,260
I knew it.

784
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,680
I told you

785
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,730
no one would come to save you.

786
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,550
You'd better be quiet.

787
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,040
Tell me now.

788
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,220
Where did our p-

789
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,750
young master go?

790
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,230
He hasn't returned for two days.

791
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,680
Did something happen?

792
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,140
Or

793
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,020
did you betray him?

794
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,750
Keha, look.

795
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,270
You tied me up like this.

796
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,700
I can't talk.

797
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,430
Let me go first.

798
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,380
Listen,

799
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,260
don't play tricks in front of me.

800
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,210
Got it?

801
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,610
Got it.

802
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:34,770
Great.

803
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,250
How could I forget you?

804
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:36,980
How dare you!

805
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,720
Do you want to tell on me?

806
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,060
That's not what I meant.

807
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:41,970
I mean

808
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,460
you...

809
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,920
Your young master has been arrested.

810
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,470
Come with me to save him.

811
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:46,910
What?

812
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,070
Hurry up.

813
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,650
No one is here.

814
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,280
Let's go.

815
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,330
Let's go.

816
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,210
Hurry up. Here.

817
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,430
Come down.

818
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,180
There are so many guards.

819
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:21,860
Brother.

820
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,470
His Highness

821
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,900
has such a special identity.

822
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,110
Doesn't he deserve

823
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,240
the most heavily guarded place

824
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,480
in the state of Qian?

825
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,040
Aren't you smart?

826
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,580
Think of something.

827
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,180
Is there a route

828
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,300
with fewer guards

829
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,880
and a higher chance of winning?

830
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Are you asking me?

831
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,920
How would I know?

832
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,850
If I knew, I wouldn't ask you to come.

833
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,400
Besides that,

834
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,340
don't you Qi people

835
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,180
come and go freely?

836
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,890
You can

837
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,110
bring him back in the blink of an eye.

838
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,280
I'm from Cangqi.

839
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,060
I'm not from Xueqi,

840
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,230
like His Highness.

841
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,540
We are of great strength.

842
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,400
If so, what should we do?

843
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,220
I used to think

844
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,450
I was

845
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,430
incredibly smart.

846
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,820
I didn't expect

847
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,700
when my partner was in prison

848
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,860
I couldn't even say a word to him.

849
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,420
Right.

850
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,810
We can't get in.

851
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,770
But I can send a message.

852
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,960
Didn't I tell you?

853
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,520
I can't pass on the message.

854
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,620
You don't understand.

855
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,540
Look.

856
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:16,969
What are you doing?

857
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:21,860
Eat.

858
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:22,980
Thank you, sir.

859
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,940
Thank you, sir.

860
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,449
Why are the wolves in East Mountain

861
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:29,780
coming again recently?

862
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,750
We're in a remote area.

863
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,540
What's wrong with a few wolves?

864
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,219
Wolf?

865
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,600
What are you doing?

866
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,590
I will never leave.

867
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,239
and always be with you.

868
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,780
Keha

869
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,350
is quite smart this time.

870
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,370
I can't believe he found me here.

871
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,870
You Qi people

872
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,890
have such an effective

873
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,950
and primitive way of communication.

874
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,390
What were you

875
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,410
howling just now?

876
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,390
I howled,

877
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,700
"Your Highness, although I can't get in,

878
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,730
I will never

879
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,700
leave you".

880
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,540
If I do the same,

881
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,300
I howl to him,

882
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,620
then

883
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,460
can he distinguish

884
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,360
my voice?

885
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,310
Tell me what you want to howl first.

886
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:18,740
Let me think.

887
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,130
Let me think.

888
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,250
I want to tell him,

889
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,110
"I'm here too

890
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,780
until death does us part."

891
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,960
That's it.

892
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,210
Let me try.

893
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,200
Su Jiu'er?

894
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,210
She brought Keha here.

895
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:54,790
No.

896
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,470
Why is she howling too?

897
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,800
Although I'm weak,

898
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,940
I will never

899
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,870
leave you alone.

900
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,730
Also, Hanzheng.

901
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,570
Thank you for saving me.

902
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,550
I will save you.

903
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,800
What a bold Qi woman!

904
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,580
How dare she shout out those forthright words

905
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,130
to her lover in prison.

906
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,330
She's so shameless.

907
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,270
I can't stand it anymore.

908
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,670
I can't stand it anymore.

909
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,700
Does Su Jiu'er

910
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,710
really know

911
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,120
what she has howled?

912
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,760
The Qian women are shy.

913
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,120
If I tell her

914
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,780
she howled "I wait for you"

915
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,820
as "I want you,"

916
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,430
will she be embarrassed to death?

917
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,340
Such a howling

918
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,260
is killing me.

919
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,470
I'm so thirsty.

920
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,300
It's so tiring.

921
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,180
Keha.

922
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,160
Did I howl

923
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:13,930
correctly?

924
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,920
He should know

925
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,420
it's me.

926
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,350
I can guarantee

927
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,220
His Highness would know it's you.

928
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,370
Great.

929
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,390
Don't worry.

930
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:26,990
Next,

931
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,620
I will try to solve the case as soon as possible

932
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,150
and plead leniency for you.

933
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,640
And every day from now on,

934
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,820
I will come here and howl to you.

935
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,820
I want you to know

936
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,630
I may be weak,

937
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,210
but I'm loyal enough.

938
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,940
Once a day?

939
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:44,950
Yes.

940
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,360
So that he can feel

941
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,310
my power

942
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,010
every day.

943
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,170
Right?

944
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:51,600
Yes.

945
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,580
I can guarantee that

946
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,960
not only His Highness knows

947
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,000
your power,

948
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,340
I suppose

949
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,060
all the Qi people in Jiuxiao City

950
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,410
will know about it.

951
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,340
Please.

952
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,380
I hope the reinforcements of the Qi race

953
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,210
come quickly

954
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,170
and get you out of this suffering.

955
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:11,980
Don't happen

956
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,040
any mishaps again.

957
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,420
Please.

958
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,960
Please.

959
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,110
Come on. Cheers.

960
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:43,790
Kings of Qi.

961
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,720
Come, please.

962
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:49,880
OK. Cheers.

963
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,270
Make yourself at home.

964
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,460
Fill your cup.

965
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:58,940
Your Majesty.

966
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,200
You're still the same.

967
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,510
Although you don't like banquets,

968
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,010
when you get a good hunt,

969
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,060
[Qi, King of Xuanqi]

970
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,350
you're still willing to

971
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,190
share it with everyone.

972
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,330
[Qi, King of Cangqi]

973
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,410
The four tribes should be united.

974
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,290
If there is good prey,

975
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,110
I should share it with you.

976
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,040
[Qi, King of Chiqi]

977
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:15,890
But

978
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,470
why doesn't the King of Xuanqi eat?

979
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,580
Your Majesty,

980
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,950
I'm not feeling well today.

981
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,010
So, I'm not eating.

982
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,760
Didn't I ask you

983
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,140
to invite the Grand Preceptor and Chilan here

984
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,000
to share

985
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,140
the rare divine deer?

986
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,100
Why haven't they arrived yet?

987
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,950
Your Majesty.

988
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,100
It's just a white-neck divine deer.

989
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,500
Why are you making such a fuss?

990
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,070
You tried so hard

991
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,500
to gather us here.

992
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,080
Could it be

993
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,200
because of that rumor?

994
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:54,790
What rumor?

995
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,090
Do you mean

996
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,260
the disappearance of Prince Hanzheng

997
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,190
is because he went to Jiuxiao City?

998
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,270
You only know one.

999
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,640
Not the other.

1000
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,940
His Highness is not only

1001
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,050
in Jiuxiao City.

1002
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:09,960
Now,

1003
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,160
he's even

1004
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,560
in the Imperial Prison.

1005
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,620
Your Majesty gathered us

1006
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,690
to rescue

1007
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,920
your only son, right?

1008
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,670
How dare you!

1009
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,980
The Grand Preceptor is here.

1010
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,120
His Majesty is having a private banquet today.

1011
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,780
King of Xuanqi's speculation

1012
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,950
is too rude.

1013
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,120
Besides,

1014
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,430
Hanzheng is our prince.

1015
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,280
Isn't it reasonable to save him?

1016
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,640
As the Prince of Qi,

1017
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,660
he's in a prison in another country.

1018
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,050
What a disgrace!

1019
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,360
Now the state of Qian must be

1020
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,190
mocking us.

1021
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,170
They're not afraid to

1022
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,390
disobey us anymore.

1023
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,090
After all, Hanzheng is the Grand Preceptor's disciple.

1024
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:06,990
He may be arrogant,

1025
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,250
but he's not reckless.

1026
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,870
There must be a reason for him.

1027
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,270
Even if there is a reason,

1028
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,780
with our skills,

1029
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,330
how could he end up

1030
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,530
in the prison of the state of Qian?

1031
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:17,990
Enough.

1032
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,790
Stop arguing.

1033
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,700
It's just a family banquet today.

1034
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,220
Why are you arguing?

1035
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,790
Did the rare divine deer

1036
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,800
come at the wrong moment

1037
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,510
or did my Hanzheng

1038
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,050
come at the wrong moment?

1039
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
Sit down, please.

1040
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,890
Share the deer.

1041
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,680
Your Majesty.

1042
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:51,830
Bad news!

1043
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,320
Get out.

1044
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,660
Today is my family feast.

1045
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,320
I don't want to hear

1046
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,450
any nonsense.

1047
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:56,880
But...

1048
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,260
Just say it.

1049
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,360
The Qian's ambassadors died at the border

1050
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
before entering.

1051
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,320
What happened?

1052
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,480
I was ordered to

1053
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,260
welcome the ambassadors at the border.

1054
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,390
But when we arrived,

1055
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,480
only two horses

1056
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,980
were carrying two dead Qian men.

1057
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,220
They were already frozen.

1058
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,350
Apparently, they died a long time ago.

1059
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:31,850
Your Majesty.

1060
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,150
Qing'er said

1061
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,310
something happened

1062
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,170
with the horse of an ambassador

1063
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,340
and he had left the troop.

1064
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,670
He might still be alive.

1065
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,070
I'll pick him up myself.

1066
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,570
Okay.
