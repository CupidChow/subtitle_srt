00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,620
I'll go first.

6
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,410
I've figured it out.

7
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,420
My personal feeling shouldn't interfere

8
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,300
with the truth.

9
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,660
I should respect your thoughts.

10
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,250
So,

11
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,430
I asked Liu Fu to investigate.

12
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,920
You investigated it last night?

13
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,030
The longer we take, the more difficult this gets.

14
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,710
I thought I'd better act earlier.

15
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,490
Although the reports of the Law Department

16
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,130
is vague,

17
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,720
there are not many people

18
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,540
in Jiuxiao City who deals with dead bodies after all.

19
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,190
Liu Fu has found the person

20
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,280
who collected Shopkeeper Li's body.

21
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,030
He said

22
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,190
though his tongue was fractured,

23
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,390
and was hung to death,

24
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,210
he had a bruise on the back of his head

25
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,940
and there are signs of struggle on his right hand.

26
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,340
They're all coming together.

27
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,500
So...

28
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,660
My brother is indeed a suspect.

29
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,690
But I also found that

30
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,710
on the night Shopkeeper Li died,

31
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,950
Ah Qi wasn't at home.

32
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,140
How did you know?

33
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,760
My brother's maid

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,220
is also a fan of my scripts.

35
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,420
When Ah Qi left,

36
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,370
it was midnight.

37
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,180
When he returned, it was 3am.

38
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,530
And as soon as he came back,

39
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,260
he entered my brother's study.

40
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,640
So I think

41
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,510
it doesn't seem like he's working for others.

42
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,200
Your Highness.

43
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,200
Thank you for verifying this.

44
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,030
You're welcome.

45
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,510
I'm not

46
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,570
investigating things for you anymore.

47
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,100
It's just that I still think

48
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,220
Brother is not a villain.

49
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,350
Maybe he has his reasons

50
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,440
for doing this.

51
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,540
I also think

52
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:21,100
there are many things I don't understand regarding this.

53
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,780
The Crown Prince has never shown

54
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,520
his dislike for Qi people.

55
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,820
Even if some things can be faked,

56
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,829
I'm sure Jun would have been able to

57
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,810
detect these details, right?

58
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,300
I don't know.

59
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,940
If this is true,

60
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,650
I can only say

61
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,890
my brother has his guard high up

62
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,300
against me too.

63
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,290
Maybe from a Qian person's perspective,

64
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,380
he just wanted to stop

65
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,620
the Qian-Qi Six Treaties from being signed.

66
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,700
This has nothing to do

67
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,030
with your brotherhood.

68
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,290
Besides,

69
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,130
if it's really him,

70
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,579
I think

71
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,150
there is a way to get the antidote.

72
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:02,850
How?

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,010
Kidnap him, and bring him back to Shuobei.

74
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,320
We're not really kidnapping him.

75
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,070
It's just that Crown Prince

76
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,470
knows very well the situation in Shuobei.

77
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,620
If Han Zheng and I kidnap him personally,

78
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,560
he will know that

79
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,080
we're grasping at straws.

80
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,780
By threatening to imprison him

81
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,820
in Shuobei,

82
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,180
he might hand over the antidote.

83
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,610
But...

84
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,310
What if he doesn't give it?

85
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,890
Then we can only

86
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,810
take him back to Shuobei for real.

87
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,500
Your Highness,

88
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,159
this matter involves the war between the two states.

89
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,300
If we don't take the risk,

90
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,060
I'm afraid the war won't be over.

91
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,010
But I promise you

92
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,950
I will never hurt Crown prince.

93
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,090
Then... Promise me,

94
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,580
when you get the antidote,

95
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,090
return him back to me.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,800
I promise you.

97
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,000
By then,

98
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,060
I will send Crown Prince

99
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,060
back to the State of Qian unscathed.

100
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:16,820
Good.

101
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,030
It's a deal.

102
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,790
But Your Highness,

103
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,620
the Prince's Residence is heavily guarded.

104
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,150
The Riverside Building is also in the market.

105
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,640
If we want to bring Crown Prince out

106
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,570
quietly,

107
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,830
I'm afraid we'd need your help.

108
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,430
The day after tomorrow is the death anniversary of my brother's concubine.

Every year on that day,

110
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,230
he would go to the tomb alone.

111
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,270
This would be

112
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,620
the best time for you

113
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,420
to kidnap him.

114
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,110
But you have to promise me.

115
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:48,730
You can

116
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,120
never break your promise.

this is the way the Qi race vows.

I, Han Zheng, swear

121
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,380
regardless of if the rivalry between Qian and Qi

122
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,240
can be settled,

123
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,700
we will definitely

124

protect His Highness and ensure his safety.

176
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,310
Thank you.

177
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,910
Thank you.

178
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:51,770
Thank you

179
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,990
Thank you, Inspector Su.

180
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,880
All right.

181
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,450
Get up, everyone.

182
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,450
Let's eat.

183
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,940
Let's eat.

184
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:24,560
Here.

185
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,330
Let's eat.

186
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:25,790
Let's eat, everyone.

187
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,390
Let's eat.

188
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:29,860
I'm back.

189
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:31,820
How is it?

190
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,610
It's exactly just as

191
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,430
you said.

192
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,500
No one else

193
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,550
has been to the Consort's tomb.

194
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,180
I don't think they've found out about us yet.

195
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,260
We can get ready.

196
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,480
It's settled then.

197
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,260
So fast!

198
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,550
Tomorrow is the day.

199
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,050
Jiu'er,

200
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,180
I have something

201
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,030
to tell you.

202
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,340
What is it?

203
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,190
You sound so serious.

204
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,570
I hope you won't go tomorrow.

205
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,100
Stay at home.

206
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,260
Why?

207
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,950
Even Jun's going.

208
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,750
Wen Jun wants to hear

209
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,620
his elder brother's difficulties himself.

210
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,420
We must fulfill that wish of his.

211
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,680
As to you...

212
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,950
I want to hear it too.

213
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,770
But if you're around,

214
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,970
I can't rest assured.

215
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,070
If anything happens tomorrow,

216
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,020
and he threatens me with you,

217
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,950
then I will be...

218
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,710
easily

219
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,940
manipulated by them.

220
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,170
So,

221
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,080
just think of it as allowing me to be assured.

222
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,460
Fine.

223
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,690
I don't have to go.

224
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,650
But this is not a perfect plan either.

225
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,380
It sounds like

226
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,180
you have an idea.

227
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,370
His Highness doesn't know martial arts.

228
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,710
With your skills,

229
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,480
you can definitely capture him easily.

230
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,940
But he's a noble.

231
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,780
If something goes wrong,

232
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,850
it's very likely that you will be

233
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,020
expelled from Jiuxiao City

234
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,480
and it'd be hard for you to ever return to the State of Qian.

235
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,430
I'm afraid

236
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,550
after we part tomorrow,

237
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,750
I'll just be waiting at home,

238
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,520
just like how

239
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,900
my mother and I

240
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,500
waited for my father at home,

241
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,210
you will never return.

242
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,020
So I plan to

243
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,970
go home in a bit

244
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,470
and pack my things immediately.

245
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,310
If anything

246
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,800
happens over at your side,

247
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,510
I'll meet you immediately.

248
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,900
By then,

249
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,720
just take me back to Shuobei.

250
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,700
Jiuxiao City

251
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,300
can't tolerate a Qi like you,

252
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,080
but Shuobei should be able to

253
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,510
accept me, a Qian, right?

254
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,000
Idiot.

255
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,730
If it fails

256
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,540
tomorrow,

257
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,400
I will no longer be

258
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,750
Shuobei's Prince of Qi.

259
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,320
If that's the case,

260
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,180
would you still

261
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,640
go back to Shuobei with me?

262
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,620
Silly.

263
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,850
I like you,

264
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,070
not your status.

265
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,460
Besides,

266
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,320
if you are no longer

267
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,770
the noble Prince of Qi,

268
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,090
then I don't have to

269
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,010
work so hard

270
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,460
to reach your level.

271
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:30,980
All right.

272
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,350
This

273
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,710
is just a backup plan.

274
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,350
I still hope

275
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,220
we can settle this

276
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
and sign the

277
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,840
Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

278
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,390
In that case,

279
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,980
I can

280
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,060
fulfill your little wish.

281
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,630
My... little wish?

282
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,130
What is it?

283
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,860
Have you forgotten?

284
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,230
You got drunk

285
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:01,830
that day

286
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,340
and told me this yourself.

287
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,800
You said you wanted to be the first couple

288
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,600
who has a Qian-Qi marriage certificate with me.

289
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,730
Have you forgotten?

290
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,160
Jiu'er,

291
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,140
I'll do my best tomorrow.

292
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,860
I also want to sign the Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

293
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,020
In this way,

294
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,820
I can marry you

295
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
in a grand manner

296
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,680
in Jiuxiao City according to Qian culture.

297
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:39,850
I trust you.

298
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:45,940
Han Zheng.

299
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,370
Close your eyes.

300
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,360
Close my eyes?

301
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,530
What for?

302
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,560
Just close your eyes.

303
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,040
I want to do something

304
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,540
that I failed last time.

305
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,000
Fine.

306
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,710
Han Zheng?

307
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,820
How could I meet

308
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,910
someone as lovely as you are?

309
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,380
I'll spend the rest of my life with you

310
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,600
I only wish to see the star map with you in the long night

311
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,910
<i>Wind goes with flowers, rain moistens the plants</i>

312
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:38,940
<i>Hold one person's hand forever and never let down</i>

313
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,870
I thought I found a good friend,

314
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,390
yet I didn't expect him to be another fake.

315
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,920
I don't know if I overestimated you

316
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,250
or underestimated you.

317
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,220
Forget it.

318
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,680
We'll see tomorrow.

319
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,850
As you said,

320
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,780
His Highness only brought Ah Qi with him

321
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,340
and have set off early in the morning

322
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,470
with the offerings.

323
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,660
Let's set off then.

324
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,430
Let's go.

325
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,840
What's wrong, Jiu'er?

326
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:13,910
I...

327
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,970
I've discussed with Jiu'er.

328
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,550
She won't be

329
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,700
going with us today.

330
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,070
That's good.

331
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,760
You don't know martial arts.

332
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,020
It'll be dangerous if you go there.

333
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,260
Stay at home so that he can rest assured.

334
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,100
Okay.

335
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,700
Stay at home

336
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,560
and wait for us.

337
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,710
Let's go.

338
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,730
Jiu'er,

339
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,100
why are you home?

340
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,240
Mother.

341
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,940
What do you mean?

342
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,670
Where else can I be?

343
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,490
Aren't you busy

344
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,579
looking for the antidote?

345
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,339
Why do you have time

346
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,700
to be sitting around at home?

347
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,060
Everyone is busy with their own things today.

348
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,930
As for me,

349
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,530
I was assigned to

350
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,220
to cook for them at home.

351
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,690
Something's wrong.

352
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,160
Why?

353
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,020
What you said just now

354
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,720
reminds me of your father.

355
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:28,940
In the past,

356
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,600
before your father does something big,

357
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,730
he would cook for me.

358
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,240
Jiu'er,

359
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,390
are you planning

360
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,340
something big?

361
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,960
There's nothing big, Mother.

362
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,870
We just found a clue

363
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,890
for the antidote.

364
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,450
So we split up our work.

365
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,780
For someone like me

366
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,920
who's born weak and ill,

367
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,810
can only stay at home

368
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,110
to cook for everyone.

369
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,020
I'm so miserable.

370
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,300
You can cook?

371
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,240
Thank you, Mother.

372
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,780
You

373
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,710
should learn properly.

374
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,810
You'll get married

375
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,190
when the Six Treaties has been passed.

376
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,190
If you don't know

377
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,180
how to cook a single dish by then,

378
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,380
it's inappropriate.

379
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,630
Today, I will teach you

380
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,820
my best dish

381
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,440
that conquered your father.

382
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,690
Old Su,

383
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,880
you didn't expect that, did you?

384
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,890
Jiu'er's going to get married soon.

385
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,570
Jiu'er?

386
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,040
Jiu'er?

387
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,480
Jiu'er!

388
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,460
Jiu'er!

389
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:49,670
Jiu'er!

390
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,540
Jiu'er!

391
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,530
Jiu'er!

392
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,620
Jiu'er!

393
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,520
Where am I?

394
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,410
You're awake.

395
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,310
Your Highness.

396
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,990
Why are you here?

397
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,440
Didn't you plan

398
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,400
to kidnap me in front of my late consort's tomb?

399
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,670
How did you know?

400
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:49,870
Your every move

401
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,820
was part of my plan.

402
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,760
It's the same today.

403
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:54,870
Besides,

404
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,910
it's not that you will kidnap me today,

405
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,900
but I who wants to meet you all today.

406
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,300
But...

407
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,050
But you have to capture me first

408
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
to threaten them.

409
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,300
Threaten?

410
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,700
You think too much.

411
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,220
I want to kill you.

412
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,180
You...

413
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,210
Why do you want to kill me?

414
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,570
You are intellegent,

415
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,500
why don't you take a guess?

416
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,390
Since

417
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,750
you still want to meet them,

418
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,680
you must have a strategy.

419
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,710
Then why

420
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,960
do you have to kill me?

421
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,340
Unless...

422
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,340
Unless I'm an

423
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,800
even bigger threat to you.

424
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:39,520
Go on.

425
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,290
You know we are looking for the antidote.

426
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,820
And you

427
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,340
you must have the control

428
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,960
over the antidote.

429
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,340
Could it be...

430
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,100
Could it be something related to the antidote?

431
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,540
There is a plant called Mount Xie Dragon.

432
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,330
It only grows in Shuobei.

433
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,420
After the ember was lost,

434
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,680
due to the polar night,

435
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,840
Mount Xie Dragon stopped growing.

436
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,540
Could it be...

437
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,030
It's all because of the Ember?

438
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,350
You could deduct so much

439
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,080
just from minimal clues.

440
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,760
I really underestimated you.

441
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:20,530
No.

442
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,360
I should say

443
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,590
I underestimated you

444
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,660
and your father.

445
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,020
My father?

446
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,600
I drew up such a perfect plan back then.

447
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,440
Even Lord Sun who intercepted the secret letter

448
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,040
has no idea

449
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,000
where we traded.

450
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,350
But your father

451
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,150
saw through my plan

452
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,790
and followed me on the boat.

453
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,750
Boat?

454
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,230
No wonder Lord Sun said

455
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,470
there is no record of Mu Yan on the pass.

456
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,730
You traveled on water.

457
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,180
10 years ago,

458
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,580
May 5th,

459
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,690
is the day Daylight Water vessel set sail.

460
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,830
In that case,

461
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,760
the place you made the deal

462
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,230
was on the Daylight Water vessel.

463
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,390
There's a vessel

464
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,420
that goes between Shuobei and Jiuxiao City.

465
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,660
However, when the vessel

466
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,790
arrived at the port,

467
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,960
people on the boat

468
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,830
s-strangely all disappeared.

469
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,250
Unfortunately, the Daylight Water vessel ran into a sea monster

470
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,780
and returned an empty ship.

471
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,480
No, no.

472
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,890
There is no sea monster at all.

473
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,340
You killed them.

474
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,570
You went to kill Muuan

475
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,650
for the Ember?

476
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,220
Yes.

477
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,240
But also no.

478
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,860
So,

479
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,950
the ship is empty,

480
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,810
the ember is lost.

481
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,720
Father was poisoned,

482
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,140
but didn't dare to get treated.

483
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,880
It's all because...

484
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,410
Because he wanted to hide

485
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,670
the fact that he stole the ember himself.

486
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,930
I never understood

487
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,050
who'd steal the ember

488
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,610
and how they escaped unscathed.

489
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,810
I didn't even notice

490
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,880
any trace of him.

491
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,570
So I've been waiting for him

492
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,810
to negotiate with me for the relationship between the Qian and the Qi.

493
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,270
But what I didn't expect is

494
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
this person did it

495
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,880
not for the two races.

496
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,270
He did it for...

497
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,250
He did it for me.

498
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,450
For the me

499
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,940
who was seriously ill

500
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,070
and was going to die...

501
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,050
Physician Qin,

502
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,160
there's nothing I can do.

503
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,440
This disease is incurable.

504
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,300
You two

505
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,010
should be mentally prepared.

506
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,170
Jiu'er,

507
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,190
I won't make any mental preperations.

508
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,080
I believe

509
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,560
you will be fine.

510
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,350
Jiu'er,

511
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,420
hang in there.

512
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,590
Don't worry.

513
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,500
We

514
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,590
will find a way for you.

515
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,840
Hang in there.

516
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,180
Father,

517
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,460
where are you going?

518
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,930
Are you going on a boat to somewhere faraway?

519
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,440
Father

520
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,150
is going on a long trip.

521
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,700
Wait for me at home.

522
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,270
When I

523
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,020
return,

524
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,260
our little Jiu'er

525
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,500
won't cough anymore.

526
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,850
I love you the most.

527
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,710
I didn't expect that...

528
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,680
Ten years later...

529
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:44,660
Just as I'm about to achieve

530
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,100
my goal...

531
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,660
You...

532
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,520
The descendant of that thief,

533
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,160
came out to mess everything up again.

534
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,490
Su Jiu'er,

535
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,340
do you know

536
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,800
how you exposed yourself?

537
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,650
Because of Han Zheng.

538
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,630
Because Han Zheng didn't get poisoned

539
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,560
so you found out.

540
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,260
That's right.

541
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,610
The ember itself is the antidote.

542
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,840
It's all thanks to how special you are

543
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,370
that I found your father.

544
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,740
This thief

545
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,170
that hid himself so well.

546
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,040
But Your Highness,

547
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,100
if you want the ember,

548
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,940
just take it.

549
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,640
Why must you kill me?

550
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,700
As to the reason...

551
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,030
You will probably never

552
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,030
find out about it.

553
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,950
When the river reaches the sea,

554
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,410
no one in this world will ever

555
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,640
find the ember again.

556
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,340
It's time to meet them.

557
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,060
Ah Qi,

558
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,410
you go back to the city first.

559
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,310
Don't let anyone find the antidote.

560
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,550
Make sure our plan

561
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,140
is flawless.

562
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,660
Yes, Your Highness.

563
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,280
Keha,

564
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,830
protect Wen Jun.

565
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,580
Got it.

566
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,310
How could it be?

567
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,700
He doesn't know martial arts.

568
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,860
How can he

569
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,990
be faster than us?

570
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,150
You two

571
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,930
came uninvited.

572
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,120
Don't you

573
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,050
feel surprised?

574
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,970
As to why I didn't bring my right-hand man?

575
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,850
You can't be a Qi.

576
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,940
You're not Wen Ying.

577
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,340
Speak.

578
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,740
Who are you?

579
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,020
If I'm not Wen Ying,

580
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,660
then who is Wen Ying?

581
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,020
And who's been

582
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,510
protecting you in Jiuxiao City?

583
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,120
Do you know why

584
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,540
I prepared wine today?

585
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,100
Why?

586
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,220
Because today

587
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,260
is my dead wife's birthday.

588
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,700
The late concubine

589
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,230
had the same birthday as me?

590
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,260
It's a type of fate.

591
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,950
Happy birthday.

592
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,860
Her Highness was born in spring.

593
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,790
But it was autumn

594
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,270
just a few days ago.

595
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,740
Is that so?

596
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,820
Who are you?

597
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,780
- Mu Yan.
- Mu Yan.

598
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:10,930
It's him.

599
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,300
He is the Mu Yan you have been looking for?

600
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,020
Where is my brother?

601
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,350
Where did you hide him?

602
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,590
Jun.

603
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,790
From beginning to end,

604
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,200
there has been no Wen Ying.

605
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,510
No Wen Ying?

606
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,500
How is that possible?

607
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,670
I don't understand

608
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,200
what you are talking about?

609
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,150
Since the 23rd year of Dingkun,

610
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,590
I have been Wen Ying.

611
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,500
At the beginning of Dingkun's 24th year,

612
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,160
a concubine died in the palace

613
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,640
and left

614
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,590
a poor prince who fell out of favor,

615
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,380
you.

616
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,020
No one takes care of you.

617
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,550
Aren't you curious?

618
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,150
Why would Wen Ying

619
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,880
who has been indifferent to you

620
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,200
suddenly keep you

621
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,160
by his side?

622
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,510
You...

623
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,100
You are Mu Yan?

624
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,420
You hate Qian people.

625
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:12,970
Then why are you

626
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,420
so nice to me?

627
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,920
I don't know either.

628
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,040
Maybe it's because

629
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,300
you're just like him from many years ago.

630
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,010
So...

631
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,820
You are really

632
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,350
the leader of Snow Chamber?

633
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,310
That's not me.

634
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,910
It's the real Wen Ying.

635
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,940
But you have been leading the group

636
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,200
for the past ten years.

637
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,180
Ten years ago,

638
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,430
I came to Jiuxiao City with the ember

639
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,510
to lure out the leader of Snow Chamber,

640
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,530
Wen Ying,

641
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,180
to kill him.

642
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,590
I replaced him

643
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,060
to spread news that

644
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,640
we've got the ember

645
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,980
to force King of Xueqi to declare war on the State of Qian.

646
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,600
Then why didn't you

647
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,380
do that?

648
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,310
Something happened

649
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,600
and the ember was lost.

650
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,160
What?

651
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,750
So what?

652
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,750
The ember has never been

653
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,350
a sacred object of the Qi race

654
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,320
but a shackle.

655
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,820
It trapped us in the far north.

656
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,390
We don't want to own more territory

657
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,040
to defeat those who keep getting stronger.

658
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,970
It's a good thing

659
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,280
that it's lost.

660
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,650
Then you pretended to be Wen Ying

661
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,780
to continue his plan

662
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,820
and led me to Jiuxiao City

663
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,950
with your identity.

664
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,020
What for?

665
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,420
To show you the sad state

666
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,680
of Qi people in the State of Jiuxiao City.

667
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,710
To let you know

668
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,170
that Qian people are not sincere towards Qi people at all.

669
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,900
They are full of deception and only use Qi people.

670
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,130
Do you remember

671
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,780
Zhang Sen from the Nursery Rhyme Case?

672
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,380
He's also from Snow Chamber.

673
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,300
There are many people like him

674
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,430
in the State of Qian who hate Qi people.

675
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,380
Qi people deserve to die.

676
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,590
Those who are siding with Qi people deserve to die.

677
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,190
With the identity of the leader of Snow Cmaber,

678
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,220
it's easier for me

679
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,080
to aggravate the conflict between the Qian and Qi

680
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,210
in the State of Qian.

681
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,800
He bit his tongue and committed suicide.

682
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,000
In the Painting Case,

683
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,260
I planned for Xu Youdao

684
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,660
to take my Qi Vital Stone.

685
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,320
In my dream,

686
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,620
I dreamed about him

687
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,280
many times.

688
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,480
It's to make you notice

689
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,430
Qi Vital Stone in the black market.

690
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,460
By making Su Jiu'er take

691
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,820
the Qi Vital Stone of the Qi men on the boat,

692
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,950
she would be able to find out

693
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,550
the secret of the Qi people's disappearances.

694
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,020
As long as Marquis Xian's

695
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,020
Qi Vital Stone business is exposed,

696
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,360
the conflicts between the Qian and the Qi in Jiuxiao City

697
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,090
will be completely exposed.

698
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,460
In this way,

699
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,980
the Qian-Qi Six Treaties can't be passed.

700
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,850
But in order to get the King of Xueqi to us his military,

701
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,510
we're just one last step away.

702
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,710
So I still can't

703
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,700
expose my identity.

704
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,000
So I asked Ah Qi

705
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,240
to kill Marquis Xian and Shopkeeper Li.

706
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,700
Han Zheng,

707
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,190
do you see what kind of life Qi people

708
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,590
live in the State of Qian?

709
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,400
Ridiculous.

710
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,580
It sounds like

711
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,020
you still care about your race.

712
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,950
You clearly know

713
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,280
the poison you created

714
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,220
will make the poisoned Qi men

715
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,100
never wake up.

716
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,970
Before I become a Wen Ying,

717
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,740
the poison has already

718
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,200
started its development.

719
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,280
Do you know

720
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,480
half of the court officials

721
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,970
are members of Snow Chamber.

722
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,070
Even if I become Wen Ying,

723
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,830
I can't stop

724
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,380
the appearance of this poison.

725
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,790
Since it can't be stopped,

726
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,850
I might as well take the opportunity.

727
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,500
So,

728
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,690
I decided to use this poison

729
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,380
to force the King of Xueqi to declare war.

730
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,750
Have you ever thought about

731
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,990
in order to take down Jiuxiao City,

732
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,320
how much do we have to pay

733
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,730
and how many of our people we have to sacrifice?

734
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,770
Then, have you ever thought about how

735
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,230
with the current growth of the State of Qian,

736
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,290
many years later,

737
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,520
we might never be able to defeat them.

738
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,780
Instead, we'll be stepped on by them.

739
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,659
Han Zheng.

740
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,050
I think you should be clearn

741
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,110
that Jiuxiao City can't tolerate the presence of Qi people,

742
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,460
and Shuobei is not suitable

743
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,790
for Qi people to live in.

744
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:25,980
I planned this

745
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,250
for you to bring people of our race

746
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,310
to trample over the State of Qian

747
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,969
and realize our common dream.

748
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,639
Do you know how hard it is

749
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,100
for me to put on this act for the past 10 years?

750
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,060
What if

751
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,170
I said

752
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,270
I won't do that now?

753
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,060
Don't tell me

754
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,639
it's because of that Qian lady.

755
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,150
You used to

756
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,600
acknowledge me.

757
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:48,820
Yes.

758
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,400
I used to think

759
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,500
the State of Qian isn't the future for Qi people.

760
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,810
But since I met her,

761
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,790
I found that Qian people

762
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,360
is not

763
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,500
as I thought in the past,

764
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,230
weak, greedy, and despicable.

765
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,070
They

766
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,070
deserve our cooperation.

767
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,470
Ridiculous.

768
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,990
How ridiculous.

769
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,490
More Qian people

770
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,600
are like Jiu'er.

771
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,350
They are kind and can tell right from wrong.

772
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,010
They treat Qi people equally.

773
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,300
These days,

774
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,330
I've been in Jiuxiao City

775
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,110
and have gradually understood

776
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,370
my old man's thoughts.

777
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,290
Qian people and Qi people

778
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,230
can have

779
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,190
a better future.

780
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,610
Have you never thought about that?

781
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,750
I might have.

782
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,230
But I know

783
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,980
even if there are

784
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,950
one or two exceptions among the Qian people,

785
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,610
those who part of Snow Chamber

786
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,850
who treasure the Qi Vital Stone,

787
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,580
and treat Qi people as animals.

788
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,330
They

789
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,170
are still the majority of Jiuxiao City.

790
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,170
As expected,

791
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,220
you have let me down.

792
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,550
But it doesn’t matter.

793
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,160
I’ve already spread this poison

794
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
in Shuobei.

795
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,990
The King of Xueqi still has to compromise.

796
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,760
Han Zheng and I

797
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,060
believed that

798
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,580
Mu Yan put the interest of the Qi race

799
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,340
as priority.

800
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,200
No matter what,

801
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,060
he won't put our people in danger.

802
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,380
You've really changed.

803
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,550
Perhaps it wasn't me who've changed,

804
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,920
but that you've never saw who I truly was.

805
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,260
You all

806
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,810
are easily deceived by love

807
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,220
and forget the overall situation.

808
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,510
Don't worry.

809
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,570
As long as you bring the Xueqi and Chiqi tribes

810
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,180
to meet with Cangqi and Xuanqi,

811
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,200
I'll give you the antidote

812
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,800
to you.

813
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,740
As to the position of the King of New Qi,

814
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,340
Han Zheng,

815
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,900
it's still yours.

816
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,780
Is that all to your plan?

817
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:57,890
Yes.

818
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,220
I...

819
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,570
have been waiting for you.

820
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:10,840
From the moment

821
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,440
you helped me

822
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,680
leave 10 years ago.

823
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,280
Han Zheng,

824
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,360
I'll ask you one last time.

825
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,640
Will you stand with me?

826
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:35,920
Mu Yan,

827
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,200
you'll always be my brother.

828
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,760
But no matter what,

829
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,550
I can't declare war on the Qian.

830
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
Even if Qi people die because of you?

831
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,690
Qi people won't die.

832
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,060
Because,

833
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,640
I, the antidote, is still alive.

834
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,360
How could this happen?

835
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,290
Could it be...

836
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,180
That's right.

837
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,950
We separated on purpose.

838
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,350
Besides,

839
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,220
she took my Qi Vital Stone.

840
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,540
I can sense her situation.

841
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,260
I've discussed with my Jiu'er.

842
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:33,920
She won't be

843
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,240
going with us today.

844
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,150
Actually,

845
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,630
we made two plans for it.

846
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,890
Fortunately after Han Zheng

847
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,570
fell into the waters last time,

848
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:13,590
he has completely overcome

849
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,590
his fear of water,

850
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,370
allowing our plan to be successful.

851
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:20,960
I knew there was something amiss

852
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,730
since the poison didn't take effect

853
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,460
on Han Zheng.

854
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,140
Perhaps,

855
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,050
I, who have been in contact with him,

856
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,180
have something to do with the antidote.

857
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,740
So,

858
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,270
you will kill me soon.

859
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,470
So you all know

860
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,720
Su Jiu'er is the antidote

861
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,120
you've been looking for.

862
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,200
But do you know that

863
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,540
only by taking out the ember

864
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,990
and fully utilizing the power of the ember

865
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,730
could allow the poisoned Qi people

866
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,610
to live on?

867
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,380
Han Zheng,

868
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,120
Chilan,

869
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,060
just tell Su Jiu'er to go and die.

870
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,020
Brother,

871
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:05,900
stop it.

872
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:06,900
Please.

873
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,420
I won't let things

874
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,200
go that far.

875
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,250
Mu Yan,

876
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,410
you must

877
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,020
give me the antidote today.

878
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,600
Or else?

879
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,120
You're going to kill me?

880
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,540
Just for Su Xian'er?

881
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,220
Yes.

882
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,320
You said I've changed.

883
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,980
So have you.

884
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,590
I'm only one step away

885
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,460
to our goal.

886
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,450
I must fulfill it.

887
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,490
I'll show you

888
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,580
who is right.

889
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,720
General.

890
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,340
Han Zheng!

891
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:30,970
Jiu'er.

892
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:32,890
Keha!

893
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,140
Watch out, Han Zheng!

894
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,140
Han Zheng!

895
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:15,830
General!

896
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,310
Don't forget,

897
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,740
I trained both of you

898
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,420
personally.

899
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:02,790
Han Zheng!

900
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,060
Han Zheng.

901
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,760
I won't let you hurt her.

902
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,140
Mu Yan.

903
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,940
Stop it.

904
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:21,350
Let's go back to Shuobei together, okay?

905
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,520
Can't we take down

906
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:30,680
Jiuxiao City together?

907
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,190
Give up.

908
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,650
You are so stubborn.

909
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,420
Why should I be kind

910
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,380
to you?

911
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:49,390
No!
