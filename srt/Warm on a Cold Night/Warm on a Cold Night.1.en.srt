00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,990
The locations where the bodies were discovered

175
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,980
match up too.

176
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,940
The beauty's hands.

177
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,130
The stinky ditch.

178
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,190
The beauty's feet.

179
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,480
The Goddess Shrine.

180
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,250
Commander Yan.

181
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,890
His Excellency Li from the Inspection Service

182
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,370
died in a ditch.

183
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,730
He lost his right arm.

184
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,330
His Excellency Liu of the Grain Transport Bureau

185
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,250
died at the Goddess Shrine.

186
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,850
He lost his left leg.

187
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,340
All of them match up with

188
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,990
the Qi nursery rhyme!

189
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,190
They are very similar.

190
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,340
So—

191
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,950
So my godfather means to say is that

192
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,710
this could be

193
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,500
a premeditated murder case.

194
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,230
If we want to know

195
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,809
the whereabouts of the other two officials,

196
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,789
we have to look to the nursery rhyme

197
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,909
for leads.

198
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,919
But

199
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,260
you two are not to meddle

200
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,700
in this matter anymore.

201
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,190
-Why? -Why?

202
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,990
Because Yue Daren

203
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,320
has already caught him.

204
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:49,560
This-

205
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,830
In the 33rd year of Dingkun,

206
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,110
on the 24th day of the 3rd month,

207
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,440
or the 7th day of the missing persons case,

208
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,960
the body of Li Zhinian, the Chief of the Inspection Service,

209
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,060
was found in the canal in the south of the city.

210
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,580
When we arrived at the scene,

211
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,240
it had not been contaminated.

212
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,350
However, the body was not complete.

213
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,020
His right hand was missing,

214
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,870
and there were traces of biting and ripping on the wound.

215
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,590
It looked like it was caused not by an ordinary beast,

216
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,230
but a shapeshifted Qi.

217
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Seven days later,

218
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,730
The body of Li Jingting, the Adjutant of the District Office

219
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,970
was found at the Goddess Shrine in the suburbs.

220
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,370
His left leg was missing.

221
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,930
Similarly, the wound bore traces

222
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,190
of biting and tearing.

223
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,020
Earlier, Liu had discovered a Qi man

224
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,280
in the Zhang Residence

225
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,890
with three scars on his face.

226
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,630
His actions were suspicious,

227
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,730
and he seemed to have been eavesdropping

228
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,460
on the details of the incident.

229
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,080
According to many witnesses,

230
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,870
this Qi man

231
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,670
frequented the locations where the bodies were found.

232
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,400
He is is our prime suspect.

233
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,140
This morning, my informant

234
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,890
found him at the market.

235
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,750
I immediately gathered my men,

236
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,910
and after a battle,

237
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,440
we finally

238
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,920
arrested this Qi man.

239
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,310
It's just that

240
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,640
we have no conclusive evidence right now.

241
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,760
We need to

242
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,630
make him confess as soon as possible

243
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,330
and reveal the whereabouts

244
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,860
of the other two officials.

245
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,220
Does anyone want to take the initiative

246
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,680
to interrogate the Qi man?

247
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,090
Commander,

248
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,470
I really want

249
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,390
to share your burden.

250
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:19,990
Good!

251
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,210
My waist–

252
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,760
The fight was too fierce this morning.

253
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,770
It's made my chronic pain act up.

254
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,480
[Shameless]

255
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,270
You- You know about this.

256
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,270
I-

257
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,400
Commander.

258
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,730
I am the same.

259
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,090
To this day,

260
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,440
my wound hasn't recovered.

261
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,300
[Fake]

262
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,530
Commander,

263
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,170
I want to share your burden.

264
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,760
[Qian, Patrolman, Uncle Liu]

265
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,170
But time hasn't spared me.

266
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,070
I'm unable to help.

267
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,070
Wang Tianyun.

268
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,040
My- My throat.

269
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,440
I-

270
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,360
The Qi man has been tied up.

271
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:00,940
Look how scared

272
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,070
you all are of him!

273
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,270
Hu Badao!

274
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,150
Su Jiu'er!

275
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,340
Godfather, look at my eyes.

276
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,100
Hu Badao! Su Jiu'er!

277
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:15,910
You two go.

278
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,720
Us?

279
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,390
Open the door!

280
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,400
Let's play it how we usually do.

281
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,710
I'll be bad cop, you'll be good cop.

282
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,640
I've got it.

283
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:57,870
Hu.

284
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,870
It's okay.

285
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,830
Put your foot down!

286
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,220
Are you trying to make me feel bad,

287
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,090
getting a woman who's shaking all over

288
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,150
to interrogate me?

289
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,260
I-

290
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,670
I'm just cold.

291
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,950
It's summer.

292
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,680
How could you be cold?

293
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,390
Audacious!

294
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,210
Why do you talk so much?

295
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,110
Fine.

296
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,590
From now on,

297
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,390
I won't talk.

298
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,660
Unless

299
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,340
you beg me.

300
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,650
I-

301
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,020
He's so arrogant.

302
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,350
He dares to threaten me?

303
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,230
Let me tell you.

304
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,760
You should know your place.

305
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:55,950
Now that you've ended up

306
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,830
on our turf,

307
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,350
I—

308
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,240
You must keep your promise.

309
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,400
Mr. Qi,

310
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,970
I'm begging you.

311
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,610
I beg of you.

312
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,610
Just answer

313
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,910
our questions honestly.

314
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,990
Take it as

315
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,790
we're doing each other a favor.

316
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,190
Doing each other a favor?

317
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,710
This girl is rather interesting.

318
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,270
Hu, ask him now.

319
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,980
I've heard that

320
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,860
the Qi people always keep their word.

321
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,150
They always deliver on their promises.

322
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,300
He won't lie to us.

323
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,390
Listen up.

324
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,060
In the 33rd year of Dingkun,

325
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,570
on the 17th day of the 3rd month,

326
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,500
four officials of the state of Qian

327
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,040
invited Qi entertainers

328
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,450
to the banquet hall

329
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,630
in the Zhang Residence.

330
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,230
According to our investigation,

331
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,390
the officials were just curious

332
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,390
and wanted to see the forbidden dance of the Qi

333
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,650
after shapeshifting.

334
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,440
You people can shapeshift into beasts, right?

335
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,900
Let us have a look?

336
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,910
Don't make fun of me, Your Excellency.

337
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,950
In Jiuxiao City,

338
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,490
the Qi are forbidden from shapeshifting.

339
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,780
Otherwise,

340
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,790
we could be expelled from the state of Qian.

341
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,820
Recently, Qi nursery rhymes

342
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,990
have been spreading amongst the people.

343
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,820
Do you all know how to sing them?

344
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,870
Yes.

345
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,630
♫ The full, full, moon sparkles and shines ♫

346
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,430
♫ Long ago, there was a beauty entranced ♫

347
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,670
This nursery rhyme

348
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,670
is about how you Qi people

349
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,100
eat humans.

350
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,380
Yeah.

351
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,840
Go ahead. Sing.

352
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,270
They're not singing.

353
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,670
We'll sing it ourselves.

354
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,390
♫ Sharp teeth bit into the beauty's neck ♫

355
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,180
After the dancers left,

356
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,980
the four officials were killed.

357
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,570
Two mutilated bodies were found.

358
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,030
The other two are missing.

359
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,910
Did you do it?

360
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,260
Why do you suspect

361
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,530
I was the one who did it?

362
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,930
We have evidence.

363
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,710
The mutilated bodies

364
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,670
of the two victims

365
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,350
bore the bitemarks

366
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,550
of a shapeshifted Qi.

367
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,320
The culprit must have been a Qi!

368
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,180
Besides,

369
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:41,880
you

370
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,060
appeared frequently at the scene.

371
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,330
Who else could it be?

372
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,210
Are you going to say

373
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,740
you were merely passing by?

374
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,250
It's true, I just happened to pass by.

375
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,990
You're taking me for a fool?

376
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:56,390
You—

377
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:56,770
Hu.

378
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,700
If you interrogate him like this,

379
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,500
isn't it akin to telling him that

380
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,670
we don't have any conclusive evidence?

381
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,020
You should—

382
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,150
I heard everything.

383
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,590
So you

384
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,280
have no conclusive evidence.

385
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,930
Gosh.

386
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,110
How could I forget?

387
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,630
Their five senses

388
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,160
are much sharper than ours.

389
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,820
You know a lot about the Qi race.

390
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,890
Tell me.

391
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,690
What else do you know?

392
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,600
The Qi people's five senses are sharp,

393
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,010
and their bodies are strong.

394
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,590
Although you live together,

395
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,850
you prefer to be alone.

396
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,030
You're afraid of heat and fire.

397
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,770
You like-

398
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,140
like to eat internal organs.

399
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,380
You're wrong.

400
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,100
We prefer to eat

401
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,090
human meat.

402
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,050
Did you eat

403
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,970
the two officials' meat?

404
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:49,670
Boring.

405
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,590
Who would want the tough meat

406
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,470
from the limbs of a man?

407
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,040
The internal organs of the officials

408
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,260
were indeed still intact.

409
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,350
That means they weren't killed

410
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,830
to be cannibalized.

411
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,990
But tender and delicate girls

412
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,280
are a different story.

413
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,010
Prey trembling before you

414
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,610
have an excellent mouthfeel.

415
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,420
You know?

416
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,180
How dare you!

417
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,510
Stop talking nonsense-

418
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,810
nonsense about eating human flesh.

419
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,010
Who are you bluffing?

420
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,230
I think

421
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,910
you're just making use of

422
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,560
that horrible nursery rhyme to commit crimes.

423
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
You killed people

424
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,680
and dumped their bodies.

425
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,820
This is clearly

426
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,160
premeditated murder.

427
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,430
Answer me!

428
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,310
Where are the other two

429
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,460
missing officials?

430
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,710
Since you said

431
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,390
I'm imitating the nursery rhyme,

432
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,750
wouldn't you get your answer

433
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,630
by humming it?

434
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,360
♫ Severed in one bite, the beauty's hand ♫

435
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,550
♫ Spat it out in the Bai River, in the stinky ditch ♫

436
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,640
♫ Severed in one bite, the beauty's feet ♫

437
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,720
♫ Spat it out in the outskirts, at the Goddess Shrine ♫

438
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,900
♫ At one go, ripped out the beauty's heart ♫

439
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,360
♫ Spat it out at the lush Flower and Willow Park ♫

440
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,109
After- After biting off the legs,

441
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,349
you're going to rip out the heart?

442
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,829
Are you going to spit it out at the Flower and Willow Park?

443
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,040
This Qi man

444
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,040
is a little strange.

445
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,770
Take a guess.

446
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,569
Will this be

447
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,599
my next step?

448
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,849
He seems to be even more eager

449
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,339
to find out the truth than we are.

450
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,040
He doesn't look like a criminal.

451
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,190
This must be a trap.

452
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:17,890
Audacious!

453
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,510
Am I interrogating you

454
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,109
or are you interrogating me?

455
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:21,849
I—

456
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,390
Godfather.

457
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,270
Don't- Don't-

458
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,150
Don't be angry.

459
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:24,829
Mr. Qi,

460
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:25,790
don't be angry either.

461
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,630
Sit down.

462
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,590
Calm down, everyone.

463
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,550
Don't get mad.

464
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,680
Have some water.

465
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,490
Don't get mad.

466
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,450
Mr. Qi, this is how

467
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,830
interrogations always go.

468
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,270
You must be thirsty

469
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,190
after talking so much.

470
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,060
Have some water.

471
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,460
I don't want anything from the Qian people.

472
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,990
What's on his face?

473
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,600
Mr. Qi.

474
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,300
Have a sip.

475
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,500
I've got you.

476
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,140
You liar!

477
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,040
Hu!

478
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,980
The scars are fake.

479
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:07,750
Look.

480
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,350
The three scars on his face were drawn on.

481
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,710
How dare you!

482
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,830
I noticed it just now.

483
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,290
You weren't answering

484
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,490
any of our questions.

485
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,390
Instead, you made up stories

486
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,750
based on what Hu said.

487
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,580
This must be

488
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,990
what you're after.

489
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,350
You're smarter than I thought you were.

490
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,070
Of course.

491
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,890
You can't trick me.

492
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,070
Do you think you are

493
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,890
very clever,

494
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,810
and can see through me?

495
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,310
You?

496
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,500
Of course.

497
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,230
What are you doing? Put me down!

498
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,150
Godfather! Godfather!

499
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,770
What are you doing?

500
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,490
Mr. Qi, don't eat me!

501
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,920
Don't eat me! Please!

502
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,820
No one has ever

503
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,480
poured water on my face.

504
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,230
It hurts so much.

505
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,540
I'll be gentle next time.

506
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,260
Next time?

507
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,440
Hu, he wants the case file.

508
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,200
Take it away.

509
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,910
Hu, run!

510
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,660
Open the door!

511
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,260
Hurry up!

512
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,480
Why are you so stupid?

513
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,040
Hurry up.

514
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,020
Hu.

515
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,680
I can't take it anymore.

516
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,070
I can't.

517
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,040
Let go!

518
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,450
It hurts.
Are you okay?

519
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,910
Boss, are you okay?

520
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,120
What are you waiting for?

521
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,400
Go save Jiu'er!

522
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,470
Save Jiu'er!

523
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,990
Save Jiu'er.

524
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:05,730
I can't get up.

525
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,680
My waist...

526
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,960
Save Jiu'er.

527
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,330
Save Jiu'er.

528
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,390
Don't-

529
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,760
Don't come here.

530
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,120
Don't come any closer.

531
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,790
Do you hear me?

532
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,330
Don't come near me.

533
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,720
Qian people really are cunning.

534
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,140
Listen up.

535
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,660
Don't try to steal the file from me.

536
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,740
Damn it.

537
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,940
Help!

538
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,390
Guards!

539
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,220
Guards!

540
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,020
That Qi man is inside.

541
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,050
Get him!

542
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,500
Guards!

543
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,800
Thank goodness.

544
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,220
I protected you.

545
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,690
Whose is it?

546
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,000
Mine.

547
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,390
I-

548
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,140
Don't tell me

549
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,720
this case is related to the nursery rhyme.

550
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,520
You don't know that for certain!

551
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,570
However, the Qi man who escaped

552
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,570
because of you two

553
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,020
is definitely involved in the case,

554
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,680
even if he isn't the murderer!

555
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,240
You have two choices.

556
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,310
First.

557
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,430
Arrest him, get the case file back,

558
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,630
and find out who he is.

559
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,320
Second.

560
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:57,920
Pack your things

561
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,300
and scram.

562
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,470
Flower and willow park, flower and willow axis,

563
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,270
flower and willow elbow, flower and willow curse.

564
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,260
Keha.

565
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,300
Do you understand?

566
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,570
Your Highness.

567
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,410
I've been studying the Qian language

568
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,540
really hard recently,

569
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,860
[Qi, Guard, Keha]

570
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,620
so I know a little.

571
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,380
But there's only half of it here!

572
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,110
You're holding it upside down.

573
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,630
Put it down.

574
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,750
For- For me?

575
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,350
This ice is so expensive.

576
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,640
You're giving it to me?

577
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,360
Your Highness.

578
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,940
I knew it, you don't look like it,

579
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,740
but you're soft-hearted.

580
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,160
I want to eat.

581
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,400
I- I'll go over there.

582
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,490
Your Highness.

583
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,590
It's just that land is limited

584
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,610
in Northern Shuo.

585
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,670
Otherwise, I would never disturb you

586
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,870
while you're eating.

587
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,240
Don't you think that

588
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,360
you've been becoming a chatterbox

589
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,620
since you came to Qian?

590
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,750
You're right!

591
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,980
I think so too.

592
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,590
I think

593
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,030
the Qian are rubbing off on me.

594
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,460
I've been investigating these past few days.

595
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,960
I've even made it into the Qi circle

596
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,890
in Jiuxiao City.

597
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,430
What did you find out?

598
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,520
It's impressive!

599
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,430
Your question

600
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,510
is the key.

601
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,490
I heard that

602
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,490
their attitude towards the Qi

603
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,020
was pretty good in the past.

604
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,230
Since those officials

605
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,200
were killed,

606
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,650
it has become hard on the Qi people

607
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,580
in Jiuxiao City.

608
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,020
Your Highness.

609
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,470
Do you think this case

610
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,330
was committed by

611
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,570
the long lost Young Master of the Xuanqi tribe, Mu Yan?

612
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,050
I don't know.

613
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,760
But I can't think of any other Qi

614
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,870
with three scars

615
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,310
on the right side of his face.

616
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,190
The Xuanqi tribe has never wanted

617
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,530
the Qi and the Qian to be on good terms with each other.

618
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,530
I think they were the ones who did it.

619
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,010
I'm just curious.

620
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,370
Mu Yan has been missing for ten years,

621
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,010
and that defeated general had so many sons.

622
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:47,890
Why him?

623
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,990
The masters of the Xue, Cang, Chi, and Xuan tribes

624
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,320
are all looking for him.

625
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,680
It's strange.

626
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,500
By the way, Your Highness.

627
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,180
If all the masters from the four tribes are here,

628
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,380
we can head back to Northern Shuo first.

629
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,350
I've said this before.

630
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,330
If I can't find him,

631
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:02,920
I won't go back,

632
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
no matter what.

633
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,710
Why, Your Highness?

634
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,780
Are you here in person

635
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,050
to stay ahead of the

636
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,580
masters of the four tribes?

637
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,750
I've also heard that you and Mu Yan

638
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,070
have been good friends since you were kids.

639
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,110
If you keep asking,

640
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,740
I'll send you back to Northern Shuo.

641
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,300
I- I won't ask anymore.

642
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,910
But I've been with you

643
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,170
for more than 20 years.

644
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,110
All along, I had no way of helping you.

645
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,970
This time, you finally

646
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:30,830
brought me out.

647
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,250
I won't let you down.

648
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,510
Well...

649
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,360
Your Highness, didn't you say

650
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:36,810
the next place you're going to

651
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,470
is the Flower and Willow Park?

652
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,950
I’ll help you ask around.

653
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,110
Stop.

654
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,570
Your Highness, I know I was in the wrong.

655
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,090
Don't chase me away.

656
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,250
It's raining outside.

657
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,790
I knew Your Highness

658
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,820
is kind-hearted.

659
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,850
You're only stern on the outside.

660
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,380
I'm sorry, Godfather.

661
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,390
He's a Qi.

662
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,530
I...

663
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
I can only choose the second option.

664
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,000
It's not that I don't want to arrest him,

665
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,390
but you know

666
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,500
my condition.

667
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,910
It's hard for me even to cut a watermelon.

668
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,410
You're in charge of skiving off

669
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,870
in the Inspection Bureau.

670
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,910
It's just a job.

671
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,670
You're only in it the salary.

672
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,560
Aren't you going to retire

673
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,730
next year?

674
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,610
I just wanted to help you

675
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,110
climb up the ladder a little.

676
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,110
Maybe you could even draw a pension

677
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,000
in the future.

678
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,950
Don't underestimate me.

679
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,880
Without you holding me back,

680
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,700
maybe I can even solve this big case

681
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,610
all by myself,

682
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,930
and help both of us

683
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,380
keep our jobs.

684
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,140
Hu.

685
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,810
You made me promise

686
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,010
to protect myself and never take risks.

687
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,730
Why don't you do it yourself?

688
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,570
I...

689
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,130
I'm all alone in this world.

690
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,610
You, on the other hand,

691
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,040
must stay safe and sound

692
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,200
at the Inspection Bureau.

693
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
That way, your life with your mother

694
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,390
will be more secure.

695
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,720
Are you cold?

696
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,570
Here.

697
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,300
Take this.

698
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,660
Darned rain.

699
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,640
Here, wrap yourself up.

700
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,330
Thank you, Godfather.

701
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,710
Let's go home.

702
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,710
Don't make your mother worry.

703
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,390
Godfather.

704
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,230
Tell me.

705
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,650
If my mother finds out

706
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,820
I've lost my job...

707
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,280
Are you afraid she'll be unhappy?

708
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,240
She won't.

709
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,710
She's not that snobbish.

710
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,970
She will be very happy.

711
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,170
[Qian, Qin Xiangyi]

712
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,800
Mother.

713
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,390
It's so hot in here.

714
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,690
Go out and take a rest.

715
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,320
We'll do the acupuncture later.

716
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,410
Rest for what?

717
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,820
You don't understand.

718
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,750
Acupuncture is the most effective

719
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,950
during a herbal bath.

720
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,020
Don't move.

721
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,330
If my needle is crooked,

722
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,730
I'll stab you into a fool.

723
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,470
What fool?

724
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:00,610
Mother.

725
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,350
Don't be too nervous, okay?

726
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,350
I'm fine.

727
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,010
Actually, this herbal bath...

728
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,060
Mother.

729
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,120
The herbs are so expensive.

730
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,030
Why don't we stop doing this?

731
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,130
Stop what?

732
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,700
We can't stop even for a day.

733
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,910
Our herbs

734
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,940
are out of supply.

735
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,150
Let's wait for two months.

736
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,730
Without this herbal bath,

737
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,310
your body

738
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,800
will get colder by the day.

739
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,110
Who knows, you might end up in the netherworld

740
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,110
with your father.

741
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,820
Su Jiu'er.

742
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,440
Your father promised

743
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,040
to be with me forever.

744
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:38,930
And then what?

745
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,260
He left, just like that.

746
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,220
You can't leave me.

747
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,690
I don't know what kind of strange disease

748
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,040
my daughter has contracted.

749
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
Her pulse is weak,

750
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,460
her body is as cold as ice,

751
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,290
and her five senses are deteriorating.

752
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,280
I'm really worried that she won't make it.

753
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,510
Please ask Physician Wang

754
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,840
to take a look, will you?

755
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,950
He will treat your daughter.

756
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,410
You only have to pay the fee.

757
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,580
It's five taels of silver.

758
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,510
I really don't have

759
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,830
that kind of money right now.

760
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,360
I'll give it to you when I do.

761
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,550
Physician Wang!

762
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,910
I'm also a physician.

763
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,290
But my medical skills are poor.

764
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,370
I can't treat my daughter's illness.

765
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:12,940
Please treat my daughter!

766
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,040
Get lost!

767
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,330
Take your daughter with you!

768
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,170
What are you doing?

769
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,570
Don't touch my daughter!

770
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,720
Jiu'er.

771
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,230
Don't worry.

772
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,230
I won't give up on you.

773
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,000
Hang in there.

774
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,740
Alright, Mother.

775
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,380
I was wrong. I was wrong.

776
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,330
Alright.

777
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,860
I will listen to you.

778
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,040
I will recuperate

779
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,310
and take good care of myself.

780
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,250
I will stay by your side

781
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,380
and never leave you.

782
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,440
Is Physician Qin here?

783
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,010
It's me, Bu.

784
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,690
This old Qi came

785
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,210
just in time.

786
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,290
He hasn't paid me for his consultation

787
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,100
from half a month ago.

788
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,650
Today,

789
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,880
I must get it from him!

790
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,830
I told you last time.

791
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,270
Your disease is in the bones.

792
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,180
You can't carry cargo at the wharf anymore.

793
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,880
[Qi, Bu]

794
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:11,980
Look at you.

795
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,200
Why don't you listen?

796
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,800
If I don't carry cargo,

797
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,660
my son and I

798
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,110
will starve.

799
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,030
Even in the past, the Qi in Jiuxiao City

800
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,560
could only do manual labor.

801
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,150
But a rumor has been going around recently,

802
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,940
saying that some high-ranking Qian officials

803
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,000
were killed by a Qi.

804
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,330
Our bosses' prejudice towards us

805
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,130
has deepened.

806
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,040
I'm lucky to still have a job.

807
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,650
Listen to me.

808
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,500
You

809
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,010
should find another job.

810
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,230
If you really become crippled,

811
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,550
what will your Kaka do?

812
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,470
Physician Qin,

813
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,950
what should I do?

814
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,350
I'll prescribe some medicine for you.

815
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,680
Apply the ointment three times a day.

816
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,410
Drink the medicine twice a day.

817
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,170
Thank you, Physician Qin.

818
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
This is all I have?

819
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,770
Forget it.

820
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,040
I'll just use it.

821
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,830
The medicine shop is barely staying afloat.

822
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,690
If I lose my job,

823
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,360
wouldn't I be making it worse?

824
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,490
I can't let mother suffer for me anymore.

825
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,490
Hu.

826
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,210
I've changed my mind.

827
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,220
What?

828
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,830
I'm going to arrest that Qi man

829
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,370
who pretended to be the suspect.

830
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,450
I will get the case file back

831
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,520
and keep our jobs.

832
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,430
No.

833
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,150
It's too dangerous.

834
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,090
I don't agree.

835
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:26,730
Fine.

836
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,240
You have the right to oppose.

837
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,420
I can arrest him alone.

838
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,900
Arrest what?

839
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,370
Look at you.

840
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,840
You have no strength in you.

841
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,180
You fainted suddenly

842
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,780
while interrogating the criminal yesterday.

843
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,550
How can you arrest anyone

844
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,750
with a body like that?

845
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,570
And a Qi at that.

846
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,540
Godfather.

847
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,800
I have a brain.

848
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,440
I've made up my mind.

849
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,840
Whether you agree or not,

850
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,190
I must arrest

851
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:49,900
that Qi.

852
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,030
Here comes the beancurd.

853
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,440
No!

854
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,890
Go away!

855
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,920
You brat.

856
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,250
Your brain was fine last night.

857
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,870
What's gotten into you today?

858
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,490
Why is your brain

859
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,530
not working?

860
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,000
Your hands are full of oil.

861
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,190
Sit down. Sit down.

862
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,230
Godfather,

863
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,250
Thanks to you,

864
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,400
I was able to

865
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,080
enter the Inspection Bureau.

866
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,990
Although the salary isn't high,

867
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,390
it's relatively stable.

868
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,890
Besides,

869
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,120
what if one day,

870
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,850
I die

871
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,410
all of a sudden.

872
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,570
Then my mother will get

873
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,330
a large sum of compensation.

874
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:26,700
Touch wood.

875
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,690
What are you talking about?

876
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,410
Nonsense.

877
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,870
A little brat like you

878
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,300
will definitely live longer than I do.

879
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,440
Godfather.

880
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,470
Will you help me?

881
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,460
Let's catch that Qi man together.

882
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,130
Okay?

883
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:48,590
It's a deal!

884
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,490
From what that Qi man said,

885
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,760
he's only interested in one thing.

886
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,540
That is, the whereabouts

887
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,200
of the Qi man with three scars.

888
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,280
He baited you into singing

889
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,030
the next line in the nursery rhyme.

890
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,290
At one go, ripped out the beauty's heart.

891
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,710
Spat it out at the lush Flower and Willow Park.

892
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,550
That means

893
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,400
he must also think

894
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,750
the Qi man with three scars

895
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,150
will appear at the Flower and Willow Park.

896
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,450
Stop it.

897
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,910
I've been listening to you say

898
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,170
the same thing all day.

899
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,390
What's the use?

900
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,750
We still don't know

901
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,670
where this

902
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,390
Flower and Willow Park is.

903
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,230
We've made progress, Your Highness!

904
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,090
Your Highness!

905
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,640
Your—

906
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,070
Your Highness.

907
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:43,910
I've asked a dozen porters

908
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,990
in Jiuxiao City

909
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,230
to think carefully about

910
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,910
any places in the city

911
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,350
with a name related to the Flower and Willow Park.

912
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,810
I've listed them all here.

913
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,330
I'll leave it here.

914
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,830
Flower and Willow Alley.

915
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,199
Flower and Willow Hall.

916
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,850
Where are these places?

917
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
Where are you now?

918
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,199
It's not cool enough here.

919
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,190
Qi is already a cool place.

920
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,190
In the future,

921
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,040
if you go to Qian,

922
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,120
you'll feel so hot.

923
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,110
I'm not going to Qian.

924
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,670
[Qi, Mu Yan]

925
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:32,030
Why would I make life hard for myself?

926
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,340
I want to go and see it though.

927
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:37,810
Don't you hate the Qian?

928
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,250
Only by knowing your enemy

929
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,360
can you know how to defeat them.

930
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,280
It's been ten years.

931
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,510
Where are you?

932
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,480
Are you the Qi

933
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,820
with three scars?

934
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,050
If it really was you,

935
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,890
why did you do all this?

936
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,230
He's making Boss and Jiu'er

937
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,400
investigate

938
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,010
that irrelevant Qi man!

939
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,190
Can't you see?

940
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,390
Commander Yan

941
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,950
wants to kick them out.

942
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,270
Uncle Liu.

943
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,230
Are you going to Flower and WIllow Hall for a bath today?

944
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,560
We have no leads anyway.

945
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,640
Let's go relax.

946
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,320
Stop there!

947
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,350
You two…

948
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,550
What did you just say?

949
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,440
Flower and Willow Hall?

950
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:23,710
No.

951
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,830
It's a newly opened bathhouse in the south of the city.

952
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,590
Great!

953
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,400
Flower and Willow Hall.

954
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,590
Do you two

955
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,480
still see me as

956
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,710
the former Commander of the patrolmen?

957
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,470
Hu.

958
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,280
Don't stand on ceremony.

959
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,760
We're brothers.

960
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,220
We will share weal

961
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,250
and woe.

962
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,590
[Drunk]

963
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,900
Why is it so windy?

964
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,200
[Flower and Willow Hall]

965
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,940
Why isn't he here yet?

966
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,270
Hu is too unreliable.

967
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,160
Oh no.

968
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,350
I forgot my medicine bottle.

969
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,310
You want to kill me

970
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,480
with a wooden stick?

971
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,050
I came prepared.

972
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,430
Sir,

973
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,510
don't you think

974
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,360
it's a little hot in here?

975
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,790
You're cheating?

976
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,820
Aren't you afraid I'll eat you?

977
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,180
Come on.

978
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,310
Come on. Hit me.

979
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,150
Move.

980
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,840
You want to eat me?

981
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,620
Come on.

982
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,780
Try moving.

983
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,990
You can't move, can you?

984
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,530
You can't move, can you?

985
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,950
Aren't you very formidable?

986
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,990
Come and hit me!

987
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,790
Aren't you very arrogant?

988
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,640
Come here.

989
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
You're dead meat.

990
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,070
You-

991
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Let go.

992
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,190
What is this?

993
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,310
It's a famous sedative powder.

994
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,130
You...

995
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,440
Why isn't...

996
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,670
What are you doing?

997
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,560
N- Nothing.

998
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,280
Nothing?

999
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,240
I saw it all.

1000
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:55,800
You wanted to touch me?

1001
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,730
Who touched you?

1002
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,380
I just wanted to get

1003
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,230
the half of the case file

1004
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,360
you stole last time.

1005
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,870
You tied me up

1006
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,970
just to find the case file?

1007
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,320
What if I told you

1008
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,010
I didn't bring it with me?

1009
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,110
Will you freak out?

1010
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,330
I'll bring you back

1011
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,640
to the Inspection Bureau first

1012
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,600
and get it later.

1013
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,020
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

1014
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:16,460
I-

1015
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,580
None of your business.

1016
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:21,750
Looks like you haven't learned your lesson

1017
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,650
from last time.

1018
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:23,710
Do you really think

1019
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,630
these chains

1020
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,960
can restrain me?

1021
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,710
Normally,

1022
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,630
a few chains can't restrain you.

1023
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,680
But I know

1024
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,950
the Qi are afraid of the heat.

1025
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,430
Now that you are here,

1026
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,930
you must be feeling weak

1027
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,080
and feverish.

1028
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,130
Am I right?

1029
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,980
I knew it.

1030
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,930
Are you waiting

1031
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,810
for your dunce of a Godfather?

1032
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,040
How did you know?

1033
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:51,910
You also think

1034
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,440
he's a dunce, right?

1035
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,550
You are the dunce.

1036
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,060
You can tie me up

1037
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,210
and sneak up on me.

1038
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,530
But you could never

1039
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,830
bring me back to the Inspection Bureau

1040
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,760
all by yourself.

1041
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,190
You're not stupid.

1042
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,740
That said,

1043
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,020
I'm not going to sit here doing nothing.

1044
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,510
I'm going

1045
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,770
to ask the Inspection Bureau to send men.

1046
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,970
They will

1047
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,300
haul you back, all tied up.

1048
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,180
No way.

1049
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,060
Why now?

1050
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,880
What now?

1051
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,510
Trying to trick me again?

1052
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,310
What is happening to you?

1053
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,980
Why are you suddenly fainting?

1054
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,440
Untie me before you faint!

1055
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,210
The fire is too strong.

1056
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:06,730
I can't afford to dawdle any further.

1057
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,000
Don't go.

1058
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,090
Help me.

1059
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:23,850
Help me.

1060
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,770
Help me.

1061
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,550
So comfortable.

1062
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,160
So comfortable.

1063
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,440
What's wrong with you?

1064
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,970
Why are your hands so cold?

1065
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:09,310
His body

1066
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,880
is so warm.

1067
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,650
He saved me.

1068
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,470
Why do I feel

1069
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,160
rejuvenated

1070
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,540
when I touch him?

1071
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,230
Get up.

1072
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,990
Ouch!

1073
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:01,950
This fire...
