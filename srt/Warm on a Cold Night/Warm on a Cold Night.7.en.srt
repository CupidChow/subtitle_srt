[Episode 7]

4
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,720
You want me to pretend to be a... eunuch of

5
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,910
the state of Qian?

6
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,340
Do you think it's possible?

7
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,910
Why not?

8
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,050
You're just pretending to be one.

9
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,720
Given my identity,

10
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,650
to be a eunuch...

11
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,060
No way.

12
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,640
What identity?

13
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,580
I thought you were rich.

14
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,830
You always look

15
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,030
so proud all day long.

16
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,410
In the end,

17
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,450
you took Liu Fu's gold

18
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,880
behind my back.

19
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,320
You must be

20
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,550
a nobody who's lying.

21
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,350
Do you want to know?

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,240
If I tell you,

23
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,820
you will be killed.

24
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,420
Tell me quickly then.

25
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,780
See how scared I will be.

26
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,460
Forget it.

27
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,450
I'll spare your life for a few more days.

28
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,280
When you

29
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,170
hold that chef back tomorrow,

30
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,610
I'll go check out his house again.

31
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,130
We can work on different things.

32
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,730
You don't have to insist on having an identity.

33
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,990
You better be careful.

34
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,290
Don't let Chef Zhang

35
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,850
find out about your motive.

36
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,700
If he really is

37
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,990
the murderer of the Nursery Crime Case,

38
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,730
it's highly likely that

39
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,940
the fifth body.

40
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,670
That is the palace.

41
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,000
Who dares to kill in the palace?

42
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:48,790
Besides,

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,000
for someone as eloquent

44
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,280
and good at lying as me,

45
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,630
who can kill me?

46
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,200
What eloquent?

47
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,850
I think what you said to Wen Jun

48
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,080
were all from the bottom of your heart.

49
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:01,530
I...

50
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,820
I just think

51
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,900
he's not a bad person and is generous.

52
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,990
I just want to flatter him,

53
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,650
that's all.

54
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,950
But I know

55
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,780
he's naive.

56
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,410
If he really wants to join us,

57
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,329
I'm afraid

58
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,910
he'd be a burden.

59
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,600
As for you...

60
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Just keep eating.

61
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,050
I'll go try my pig's brain.

62
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,579
A burden.

63
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,170
This is for you.

64
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,829
It's from Qixiang Pavilion.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,829
Your Highness,

66
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,110
we are so poor,

67
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,430
how can you

68
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,240
buy such a delicacy

69
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,570
for a mere guard?

70
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,530
Your Highness,

71
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,920
did you steal or rob?

72
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,220
I earned it.

73
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,230
You earned it?

74
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,270
There are 72 types of businesses in Jiuxiao City.

75
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,400
None of them can make you so much money.

76
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,620
Did you...

77
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,870
What are you thinking about?

78
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,360
Eat up.

79
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,019
After eating it,

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,899
I have an important task for you.

81
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,329
Open up the last layer.

82
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:19,660
Okay.

83
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,320
I'm not asking you to eat it.

84
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,790
I'm asking you to go

85
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,190
look for where the person who made this lives in.

86
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,790
But there are not many clues.

87
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,870
His surname is Zhang.

88
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,450
He's an imperial chef.

89
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,690
He should be living

90
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,190
somewhere near Prince Jun's Residence in the east of the city.

91
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,050
But I don't know

92
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,270
where it is exactly.

93
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,670
I need your nose for this.

94
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,260
Your Highness, don't worry.

95
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:45,909
Leave this task

96
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,110
to me, the search dog.

97
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,700
I will complete the task

98
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,230
and find him within one day.

99
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,190
One day?

100
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,390
He won't be home tomorrow.

101
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,340
It's the perfect time for me to investigate.

102
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,940
If you can't find it tonight,

103
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,330
then you have no right

104
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,930
to follow me around anymore.

105
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,070
I will do my best.

106
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:04,930
Go eat.

107
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:05,820
Okay.

108
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,300
Delicious dumplings.

109
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,350
Here.

110
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,040
Take it.

111
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,360
Here's the money.

112
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,960
Five wen for a rice dumpling.

113
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,040
Sachet.

114
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,000
Sir, have another look.

115
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,620
Colour rope.

116
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,130
I just entered the Prince's Residence yesterday.

117
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,790
Today, I am someone

118
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,650
who has entered the palace today.

119
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,810
The Imperial Kitchen is right ahead.

120
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,670
You rarely come here.

121
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,030
How about I take a detour

122
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,330
and take you around the Imperial Garden?

123
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,060
No, no.

124
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,310
What if

125
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,090
I run into His Majesty or Her Majesty

126
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,610
and get scared?

127
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,530
By the way, Your Highness,

128
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,300
you didn't tell your friend that

129
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,700
I'm an inspector, right?

130
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,550
No.

131
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,550
I told him that

132
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,450
you're coming to ask him about

133
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,870
the snacks served fpr afternoon tea.

134
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,590
But...

135
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,350
I'm going to

136
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,490
pay my respects to Father in a bit.

137
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,490
Please wait for me

138
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,909
in the Imperial Kitchen for a while.

139
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,930
No rush.

140
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,130
It's a

141
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,110
rare chance for me.

142
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,530
I can take the chance to learn

143
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,560
from Chef Zhang.

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,400
This knife skill...

145
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,210
It's a piece of cake

146
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,830
or him to severe up cows, pigs, and even humans.

147
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,610
Chef Zhang.

148

[Qian Zhang Sen]

149
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,810
Your Highness?

150
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,280
Your Highness is here.

151
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,330
- Sorry for not welcoming you at the door.
- All right.

152
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,480
This must be Miss Jiu'er.

153
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,130
Greetings, Chef Zhang.

154
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,700
His Highness already said

155
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,090
he's going to bring you here

156
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,620
to learn how to cook from me.

157
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,350
He even told me that I have to teach you everything I have.

158
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,190
Thank you, Chef Zhang.

159
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,030
Take your time.

160
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,120
I'm going to go pay my respects.

161
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,520
I heard that the palace has

162
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,460
prepared a lot of ingredients

163
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,659
for the dinner party.

164
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,350
How about this?

165
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,790
Cook something up for Jiu'er

166
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,810
and let her taste it.

167
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,080
Don't worry, Your Highness.

168
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,400
I will treat Miss Jiu'er

169
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,180
well.

170
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,600
Let's go.

171
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,030
Your Highness, Your Highness!

172
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:24,490
Come on.

173
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,490
Your Highness.

174
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,470
The danger is lifted.

175
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,070
It's here.

176
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,530
Your Highness!

177
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,170
Your Highness.

178
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,590
You're too fast.

179
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,720
Listen.

180
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:42,909
Listen.

181
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,550
I may not have slept all night,

182
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,490
but I can still

183
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,400
work here.

184
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,030
And I have an idea.

185
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,440
In the case

186
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,659
anything happens,

187
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,700
I can remind you

188
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,030
with a wolf howl.

189
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,530
How's that?

190
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,870
This is a residential area of Jiuxiao City,

191
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,270
right?

192
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,630
Yes.

193
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,240
If you howl here,

194
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,670
are you trying to attract more people here?

195
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,480
Oh right.

196
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,920
I am stupid.

197
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,360
I let Your Highness down again.

198
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,410
If someone comes,

199
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,530
just knock him out.

200
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,880
Don't hit them too hard.

201
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,720
These Qian men

202
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,660
can't hold your Cang Qi punch.

203
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,500
Yes.

204
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,200
I'll open the door for you, Your Highness.

205
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,190
If you break the lock,

206
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,270
you're basically letting everyone know

207
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,200
we've been here.

208
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,780
I will guard you here then, Your Highness.

209
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,510
You live up to your reputation, Chef Zhang.

210
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,110
Not only do you make good desserts,

211
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,630
your knife skills are amazing too.

212
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,230
Miss,

213
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,110
I'm good at many things.

214
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,110
Take your time to taste them in a bit.

215
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:44,950
Okay.

216
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,520
Chef Zhang,

217
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,190
you're a good cook,

218
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,790
your wife and child

219
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,870
are so blessed.

220
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,720
What's wrong, Chef Zhang?

221
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,380
Did I

222
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,550
say something wrong?

223
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,150
No.

224
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,140
I thought given your relationship

225
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,540
between you and His Highness,

226
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,790
His Highness would have told you

227
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,990
everything about me.

228
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,510
No.

229
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,130
What is it?

230
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,510
It's embarrassing to say it.

231
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,590
But there's nothing

232
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,630
to hide.

233
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,230
My wife

234
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,180
eloped with the some man from Qi.

235
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,880
I'm sorry, Chef Zhang.

236
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,670
Chef Zhang,

237
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,620
don't be too sad.

238
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,350
A heartless woman like her

239
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,930
doesn't deserve you to be sad for her.

240
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,850
But in my heart,

241
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,510
I can't let her go.

242
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,720
This is...

243
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,690
This is my wife's portrait.

244
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,630
After she left,

245
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,550
I've been carrying it with me

246
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,080
so I can see her as and when.

247
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,300
- But your wife treated you so poorly–
- You don’t know.

248
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,040
My wife and I

249
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,060
have been engaged since childhood.

250
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,630
We grew up together

251
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,230
and accompanied each other every day.

252
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,630
She's in all my memories.

253
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,970
How can I forget her so easily?

254
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,340
I think she has me in her heart.

255
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,550
She was just blinded

256
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,350
temporarily by that man from Qi.

257
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,050
You love her so much.

258
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,830
Haven't you thought about looking for her?

259
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,510
I did.

260
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,300
She eloped with someone,

261
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,360
so I went after her.

262
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,530
But that man from Qi knew I was chasing

263
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,410
and stopped me.

264
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,860
He also told me,

265
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,300
if I insist on taking her away,

266
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,720
he will kill both of us.

267
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,960
If I were you,

268
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,500
I would hate

269
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,260
this unruly man from Qi so much.

270
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,850
Hate?

271
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,370
Of course I hate him!

272
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,330
I want to cut him up

273
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,440
into many pieces.

274
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,880
But when I mustered up the courage

275
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,990
after knowing that he hasn't left the the state of Qian,

276
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,880
I brought a knife to fight him.

277
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,400
But the moment I saw him,

278
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,030
I got scared.

279
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,630
I know

280
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,890
we're no match

281
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
to Qi people.

282
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,280
I'm still afraid of death.

283
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,160
He doesn't even hide

284
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,790
his hatred towards Zhamuke.

285
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:48,990
He doesn't act like

286
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,720
how a murderer would normally.

287
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,670
Could it be...

288
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,510
Zhamuke's death

289
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,890
has nothing to do with him?

290
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,350
Miss Jiu'er,

291
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,270
I wanted to teach you how to make desserts.

292
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,270
But I accidentally told you

293
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,900
so many violent things instead.

294
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,850
Did I scare you?

295
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,070
No.

296
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:09,870
It's fine.

297
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,100
In that case,

298
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,340
let me give you a small gift.

299
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,020
No rush.

300
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,360
Chef Zhang,

301
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,880
I don't need a gift.

302
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,270
Don't stand on ceremony.

303
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,330
- I really don’t need it.
- You’re welcome, Miss Jiu'er.

304
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,880
Miss Jiu'er, please move aside.

305
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,590
What's wrong?

306
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,420
That scared me.

307
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,840
Have a seat, Miss Jiu'er.

308
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,570
What's that smell?

309
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,610
Miss Jiu'er.

310
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,610
This little rabbit

311
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,530
shall be an apology

312
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,530
for the wrong things I said just now.

313
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,310
Thank you.

314
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,060
But Chef Zhang,

315
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,200
why did you

316
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,510
carve a rabbit for me?

317
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,460
Because I like rabbits.

318
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,870
I just thought

319
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,950
not that many men would like rabbits.

320
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,040
Because my wife likes them.

321
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,890
I like anything she likes.

322
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,070
This sounds funny

323
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,480
but those rabbits I was going to use

324
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,340
as ingredients

325
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,430
ended up being raised by my wife.

326
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,840
She really is

327
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,360
a very kind person.

328
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,030
Why are there so many

329
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,050
rotten rabbits?

330
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,220
Miss Jiu'er,

331
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,990
let me bring you to make some desserts.

332
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,350
Chef Zhang,

333
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,240
did you get injured?

334
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:47,630
No.

335
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,610
I got a bruise

336
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,620
when moving things a few days ago.

337
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,090
This is obviously a frostbite.

338
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,260
Master,

339
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,520
the fresh fish has been put in the ice cellar.

340
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,780
I'll hang the key here.

341
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,580
Got it. Get back to work.

342
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,130
A frostbite...

343
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,570
Ice cellar?

344
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,250
Master,

345
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,790
I saw the mushrooms

346
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,970
the Purchase Department brought over were not that fresh.

347
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,050
I asked them to change them.

348
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,910
But their chief is very arrogant.

349
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,170
Why don't you try talking to them?

350

00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,470
Yes.

525
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,800
Her Majesty has arrived.

526
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,750
Greetings, Mother.

527
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,900
Rise.

528
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,800
[Qian Empress]

529
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,460
His Majesty is here.

530
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,160
Your Majesty.

531
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,090
[Qian Emperor Dingkun]

532
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,510
Long live the Emperor!

533
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,280
Greetings, Father.

534
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,690
Everyone, rise.

535
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:45,930
Take a seat.

536
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,550
Thank you, Your Majesty.

537
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,880
Everyone, a toast to His Majesty.

538
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,510
I wish a prosperous Dragon Boat Festival to Father.

539
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,770
Wishing you good health and prosperity.

540
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,650
We wish Your Majesty good health

541
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,640
and prosperity.

542
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,560
Drink.

543
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,670
Everyone,

544
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,070
today is the Dragon Boat Festival.

545
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,030
Make yourself comfortable.

546
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,230
Just enjoy yourself.

547
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,510
Take a seat.

548
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

549
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,680
If Wen Jun is half as sensible as you,

550
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,280
I would be relieved.

551
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,960
Jun seems unwell.

552
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,880
He was just resting in Ning'an Hall.

553
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,410
Maybe he overslept.

554
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,760
I've sent someone to call him.

555
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,070
He was fine

556
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,390
when he came to greet us.

557
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,330
Is he all right?

558
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,310
You,

559
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,670
don't make excuses for him.

560
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,110
Last time at the Lantern Festival,

561
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,870
he also claimed to be sick and didn't come.

562
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:54,930
And what happened?

563
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,770
I heard he went to the theater.

564
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,270
This time,

565
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,510
I must punish him.

566
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,310
By the way, Father,

567
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,520
in the documents passed up,

568
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,380
many ministers

569
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,260
have signed a petition for the Nursery Song Case.

570
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,300
They think Qi people

571
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,910
are disturbing the peace of Jiuxiao City.

572
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,460
I hope you can restrict

573
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,920
Qi people's activities in Jiuxiao City.

574
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,830
How can I

575
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,170
deal with what your grandfather

576
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,600
has agreed with the Qi?

577
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,860
Do I drive all of them back

578
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,140
given the Nursery Song Case?

579
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,790
I think

580
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,920
despite the Nursery Song Case,

581
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,080
we still need Qi people

582
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,140
to guard the North.

583
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,600
If we expel them all,

584
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,330
it may cause chaos.

585
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,650
But if we don't restrict them now,

586
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,650
I'm afraid it'll be harder to deal with it in the future.

587
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,810
Father,

588
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,250
I have an idea.

589
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,270
We can collect taxes

590
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,400
from the Qi people.

591
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,030
Most of the Qi people in the state of Qian

592
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,830
do labor work

593
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,270
and have poor income.

594
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,590
They will leave on their own

595
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,190
when they can't afford the burden.

596
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,630
As for the few remaining Qi people who can afford the taxes,

597
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,660
they won't pose a threat.

598
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,540
Good idea.

599
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,670
Only Wen Ying can help me.

600
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,580
I'll reward you well.

601
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,160
Tell me.

602
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,600
What do you want?

603
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,890
When Jun comes,

604
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,570
I hope you won't blame him.

605
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,090
Today's family banquet,

606
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,620
Father shouldn't be angry.

607
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,320
You...

608
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,640
Never mind.

609
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,270
Today is a family banquet.

610
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,470
Everyone is waiting.

611
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:27,870
Forget it.

612
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,470
I promise you.

613
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,350
Have a seat.

614
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,980
Thank you, Father and Mother.

615
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,410
Chef Zhang.

616
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,140
Prince Jun.

617
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,910
The banquet has begun.

618
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,690
Why isn't Prince Jun there yet?

619
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:51,350
Chef Zhang,

620
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,880
are you sure Su Jiu'er has left?

621
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,680
That's what she just said.

622
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,090
Could she be

623
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,290
delayed by something

624
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,160
and didn't manage to leave?

625
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,870
What do you mean?

626
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,610
I'm just wondering

627
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,030
why she forgot

628
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,350
her promise with me?

629
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,280
I...

630
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,950
This...

631
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,200
Your Highness.

632
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,520
I finally found you.

633
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,550
The banquet has begun.

634
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,080
His Highness wants you to attend the banquet.

635
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,620
Your Highness.

636
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,280
I was busy preparing.

637
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,610
I really don't know

638
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,140
what you're talking about.

639
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,130
Please excuse me.

640
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,430
I'll go prepare the dishes.

641
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,080
Your Highness, the dishes are all delivered.

642
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,850
Let's go too.

643
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:39,920
Let's go.

644
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,130
It's freezing.

645
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,590
Mother, look.

646
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,900
Father was led astray by Godfather.

647
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,530
Why are you drinking in secret again?

648
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,460
Father usually doesn't drink.

649
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:20,650
It's cold today,

650
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,060
so I drank some wine

651
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,040
to wam myself up.

652
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,500
Wine.

653
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,760
Have to warm myself up.

654
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,560
I should drink some wine.

655
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:57,870
Eunuch Liu.

656
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,630
Sir Han.

657
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,670
Sir Han!

658
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,100
Sir Han!

659
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,800
The Purchase Department is right ahead.

660
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,460
The palace gate is on the east.

661
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,480
Do you smell

662
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,820
Miss Jiu'er's scent?

663
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,070
No.

664
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,780
Could it be that Miss Jiu'er

665
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,190
really didn't leave the palace?

666
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,170
How much have we searched?

667
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,970
We only gone through one-fifth.

668
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,000
One-fifth?

669
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,560
We can't go on like this.

670
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:37,730
You...

671
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,900
No, no!

672
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,160
Qi people can't shapeshift

673
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,860
in Jiuxiao city.

674
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,310
Besides, this is the palace.

675
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,330
If anyone finds out, you'll be killed.

676
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,420
- You...
- If I don’t transform,

677
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,660
I can't find her in a short time.

678
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,380
The state of Qian's Palace is so big.

679
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,270
- Fine.
- What do you want me to do?

680
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,270
I'll keep watch for you.

681
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,110
Hurry up and

682
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,080
shapeshift back.

683
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
It's getting too late. I'm leaving.

684
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,760
Sir Han!

685
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,510
Su Jiu'er,

686
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,230
where are you?

687
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,680
Damn Han Zheng.

688
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,000
You're right.

689
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:12,920
I...

690
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,570
Looks like...

691
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,460
Looks like I'm really going to be

692
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,380
the fifth body.

693
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:26,990
Who is it?

694
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,290
A Qi has broke into the palace!

695
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:29,910
Catch him!

696
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,980
Han Zheng.

697
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,700
I'm cold.

698
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,350
Han Zheng.

699
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,300
Come save me.

700
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,160
Su Jiu'er?

701
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,940
Father.

702
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,910
I don't want to die yet.

703
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,390
Father, are you going to

704
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,170
somewhere far away for work?

705
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,410
Where are you going?

706
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,320
Over there.

707
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,830
I want to go too. Is that okay?

708
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:02,850
No.

709
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,810
It's too far.

710
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,100
Children can't get there.

711
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,370
Only adults can go.

712
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,030
Jiu'er,

713
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,080
you must live well.

714
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,890
And accompany your mother

715
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,530
for me.

716
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:21,950
Promise me.

717
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,120
Mother too.

718
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,230
Come.

719
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:39,920
Father.

720
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:41,660
Mother.

721
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,390
Su Jiu'er, wake up.

722
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:19,630
I'm here.

723
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:00,350
Jiu'er.

724
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,010
Jiu'er.

725
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,630
Father.

726
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,440
Father.

727
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,440
Am I dead?

728
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,230
Don't be silly.

729
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,600
You won't die with me here.

730
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,970
Father.

731
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,670
I want to accompany mother too.

732
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,780
But it was too cold just now.

733
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,150
I can't stand it anymore.

734
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,580
Don't be silly.

735
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:38,940
I'm here.

736
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,420
Why?

737
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,970
Why didn't you

738
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,260
keep your promise to me and mother back then?

739
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,380
I can't do it now.

740
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,900
Neither can I

741
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,670
stay with mother forever.

742
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,520
Father,

743
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,190
will you blame me?

744
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,850
I'll take you away.

745
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,310
Your Majesty.

746
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,150
Your Majesty.

747
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,030
Why are you so flustered

748
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,020
at a banquet?

749
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,150
Your Majesty.

750
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,460
A Qi man broke into the palace

751
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,630
and has shapeshifted, causing injuries to many.

752
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,230
What?

753
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,970
[Ice Cellar]

754
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,810
How dare you, a Qi!

755
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,690
Surrender now!

756
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,640
Get out of my way!

757
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,240
Why are you awake now?

758
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,270
Go back to sleep.

759
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,010
I'm here.

760
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,470
Han Zheng?

761
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,890
Get him!

762
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:42,530
Han Zheng.

763
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,020
Han Zheng, no!

764
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,080
Han Zheng!

765
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:45,930
Stop!

766
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,530
They are my friends.

767
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,070
Let's see who dares to touch them!
