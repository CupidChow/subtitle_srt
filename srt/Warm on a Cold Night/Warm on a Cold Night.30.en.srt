[Episode 30]

4
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,620
To find the truth,

5
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,550
I won't let go of

6
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,470
any clue.

7
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,060
If we really

8
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,610
wronged Marquis Xian,

9
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,560
you can deal with me, Inspection Bureau Inspector,

10
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,420
Su Jiu'er, any way you want.

11
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,870
If there is any bias,

12
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,440
I promise as the Young Master of Cangqi,

13
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,470
I will find out the answer for

14
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,220
Crown Prince and Marquis Xian.

15
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,480
That's right.

16
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,730
If my uncle is wronged,

17
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,920
I'm willing to plead guilty.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,970
You're such a busybody.

19
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,670
But the reputation of an empress's brother

20
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,250
can’t be tarnished.

21
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:16,950
If you can't find out

22
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,590
the truth,

23
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,280
the Inspection Bureau will be convicted.

24
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,160
The Young Master of Qi will also be involved.

25
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,690
I can't get involved in this matter.

26
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,840
Qi is familiar with

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,510
the western suburbs' hunting ground.

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,180
He will take you there tomorrow.

29
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:34,660
Yes.

30
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,940
For tomorrow's journey to go smoothly,

31
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,770
I apologize

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,640
but you have to disguise as guards.

33
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,260
Don't bring too many people

34
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,700
to avoid suspicion.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,490
Thank you.

36
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,300
Thank you.

37
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:48,940
Take care.

38
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:53,860
Let's go.

39
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,829
Jun.

40
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,290
What are you looking at?

41
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,900
I suddenly thought of

42
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,680
something strange.

43
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,730
What is it?

44
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,340
I don't even know about

45
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,010
my brother's side chamber.

46
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,270
How did General Chilan find out about it?

47
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,470
I'm curious too.

48
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,130
You're right. General,

49
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,370
how did you know?

50
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,540
You've been busy the entire day, you haven't eaten yet right?

51
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,610
Aren't you hungry?

52
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,530
Now that you mention it, I'm a little hungry.

53
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,660
But I still want to know

54
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,340
how you

55
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,170
know about it?

56
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:22,940
Let's go eat.

57
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:23,900
Wait.

58
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,040
How about Deyue Restaurant?

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:27,829
It's been a long time since we had it.

60
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:29,860
No.

61
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,290
We just went to Deyue Restaurant two days ago.

62
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,300
To be fair,

63
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,980
let's eat at Qiwei Restaurant today.

64
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,220
Don't you

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,840
not like raw food?

66
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,130
Let's just go to Deyue Restaurant.

67
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,370
It's okay. It's just once in a while.

68
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,780
No need. Deyue Restaurant.

69
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,850
Did the sun

70
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
rise from the west today?

71
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,710
Why are you two

72
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,820
being so modest to each other?

73
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,340
Judging from what you said,

74
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,390
are we

75
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,570
always very calculative?

76
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,470
That's right.

77
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,850
Brother Han and I are modest and friendly.

78
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:54,760
Right, Brother Han?

79
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,240
We are modest and friendly,

80
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,750
but there's no need to be so clingy.

81
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,310
Let's go, to Deyue Restaurant.

82
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,940
No, we have to eat at Qiwei Restaurant.

83
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,260
Wait.

84
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,170
I have a good idea

85
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,220
We can have both.

86
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,220
What is it?

87
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,140
Follow me.

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,400
Where are we going?

89
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,020
After all, Marquis Xian

90
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,130
is Her Majesty's brother.

91
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,180
If we let them investigate it,

92
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,440
and they find anything wrong...

93
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,020
Han Zheng is right.

94
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:49,659
Paper

95
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,540
can't put out fire.

96
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,280
If we find any sparks,

97
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,830
we have to put it out in time

98
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,780
in case the entire forest is destroyed.

99
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,380
Am I right?

100
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,500
Your Highness is thoughtful.

101
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,370
Prince Jun.

102
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,050
That day at the banquet,

103
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,950
I saw that Marquis Xian is

104
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,140
prejudiced against Qi people.

105
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,620
What kind of person is he?

106
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,420
I don't know if he's prejudice against

107
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,020
Qi people.

108
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,340
But he's a proud person.

109
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,540
He seems to look down upon everyone.

110
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,230
But he only cares about me,

111
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,020
a prince who does nothing

112
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,300
all day long.

113
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,240
Maybe it's because

114
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,500
we are both not interested in politics.

115
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,320
He likes collecting rare paintings.

116
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,880
I like researching scripts.

117
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,900
Maybe he thinks we get along well

118
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,220
so he set me and Heyin up.

119
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,030
His standard of choosing a husband

120
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,940
is quite interesting.

121
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,020
What's wrong, Jun?

122
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,220
No, I'm thinking...

123
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
If the investigation is done,

124
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,490
and Uncle Xian is the person

125
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,240
behind this,

126
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,520
what would happen to Heyin?

127
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,230
She's so annoying,

128
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,520
yet you still care about her?

129
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,000
She is my sister.

130
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,700
Of course I care about her.

131
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,980
Heyin lost her mother since she was young.

132
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,690
Uncle Xian dotes on her.

133
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,830
Although she is

134
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,780
a little wilful,

135
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,360
but she's lonely on the inside.

136
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,440
She just wants attention.

137
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,980
If something happens to my uncle,

138
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,770
what should Heyin do?

139
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,310
No matter how wilful a person is,

140
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,280
they will grow up

141
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,780
after experiencing some things.

142
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,420
Don't worry.

143
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,900
Judging from your tone,

144
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,340
you seem to have a story to tell.

145
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,310
Was Chilan a wilful mistress

146
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,540
when she was young?

147
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,140
You think too much.

148
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,180
Chilan has always been

149
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,460
very serious since she was little.

150
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,640
She is hardly wilful.

151
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,260
Except for one person...

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,440
Uncle.

153
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:15,890
Where is Muyan?

154
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,700
I can't find him

155
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,490
anywhere.

156
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,770
The old Xuanqi King is dead.

157
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,720
The Qi race is now

158
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,380
led by Xueqi Tribe.

159
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,380
Chilan,

160
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,830
you must judge the situation

161
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,960
and cut ties with Muyan.

162
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,600
You arrested him?

163
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,590
He's innocent.

164
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,820
Why are you taking it out on him?

165
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,159
Muyan is missing.

166
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,290
Impossible.

167
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,560
He must be

168
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,460
captured by you.

169
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,100
Uncle.

170
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,540
Please let me see him once.

171
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,580
Please.

172
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,020
Not only did he disappear,

173
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,530
but he also stole our Holy Fire.

174
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,220
What?

175
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,310
This is an serious matter.

00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:52,900
Jiu'er.

352
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,430
Jiu'er,

353
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,810
we are disadvantaged.

354
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,490
As long as Uncle Xian doesn't admit it,

355
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:57,430
we can do nothing

356
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,300
to him.

357
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,640
Don't worry, Jiu'er.

358
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,670
Chilan is still

359
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,740
looking for Han Zheng.

360
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,570
I've already told Keha about this too.

361
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,420
They should be meeting up now.

362
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,420
No, no.

363
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,030
I'm still worried.

364
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:09,590
I have to–

365
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,060
Jiu'er,

366
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,110
you are already

367
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,780
so sick,

368
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,120
how can you find him?

369
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,640
That's right, Jiu'er.

370
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,480
Just listen to Physician Qin.

371
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,500
We don't even know if

372
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,230
Han Zheng is still in the hunting ground.

373
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,620
You're already so sick.

374
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,970
What if something else

375
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,250
happens to you?

376
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:25,990
But...

377
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,340
All right. Be good.

378
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,180
Listen to me.

379
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,190
It's my fault.

380
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,940
It's all my fault.

381
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,100
All right.

382
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,460
What should we do?

383
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,610
Your Highness.

384
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,370
This...

385
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,660
Your Highness.

386
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,360
Let's take the cart.

387
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,320
Don't catch a cold.

388
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,820
You fell into the water today.

389
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,680
Well...

390
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,800
How about we return to your residence first

391
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,270
for a warm bath?

392
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,700
Your Highness.

393
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,740
You can just speak your mind.

394
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,100
If you do this,

395
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,750
I don't know

396
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,500
what to do.

397
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:29,660
It's okay.

398
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,770
I'm fine.

399
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,120
I'm completely fine.

400
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,500
Qi was injured all over to save me.

401
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,100
Brother Han

402
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,540
went missing too.

403
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,420
Jiu'er

404
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,580
is also so sick.

405
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,260
Yet look,

406
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,330
I'm completely fine.

407
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,260
Your Highness.

408
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,330
Liu Fu.

409
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,740
Aren't I useless?

410
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,050
Who said you're useless?

411
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,480
You're the nicest person in the world.

412
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,850
- The nicest person.
- What’s the use of being nice?

413
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,040
A nice person?

414
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,390
I can't even protect the person

415
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,400
I care about the most.

416
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,890
A nice person...

417
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,150
It's all my fault.

418
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,410
I should have gone with you today.

419
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,940
I could have...

420
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:26,880
a-at least

421
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,520
helped a little.

422
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,530
Liu Fu.

423
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,810
I got it.

424
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,540
I'll go look for Father.

425
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,940
After all, Han Zheng is someone with an status.

426
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,470
I can't get

427
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,620
Uncle Xian to hand over the people,

428
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,860
but father can!

429
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,740
Your Highness.

430
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,070
Prince Han might not be

431
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,060
in the Marquis's hands.

432
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,290
Even if he is,

433
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,780
do you have evidence?

434
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,360
He won't admit it either.

435
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:51,980
Instead, he will question you and

436
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,590
the Crown Prince instead.

437
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,200
What are you going to do then?

438
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:56,650
Wh–

439
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,980
What should we do then?

440
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,630
What...

441
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:01,860
Your Highness,

442
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,040
how about this,

443
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,710
let's go back first and wait for the news.

444
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:06,800
Who knows,

445
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,300
General Chilan might be able to find

446
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,650
Prince Han tonight.

447
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,500
Stop thinking. Let's go.

448
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:16,930
Let's go.

449
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,260
Let's go.

450
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,650
I knew it.

451
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,870
You finally

452
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,000
suspect me.

453
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,320
Are you looking for this?

454
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,010
How is it?

455
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,890
Is the voice of the sea monster beautiful?

456
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,210
You only captured me.

457
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,210
Jiu'er and the rest

458
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,680
are safe, right?

459
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,310
Since you arrived

460
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,410
in the western suburbs' hunting ground,

461
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,430
you have been in my sight.

462
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,500
However,

463
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,100
they are not a threat.

464
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,300
Only you

465
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,980
are my target.

466
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,590
Prince Han,

467
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,070
do you feel weak all over

468
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,020
and can't use your strength?

469
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,880
Normally, when the Qi people arrive at my place,

470
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,700
I give them a bowl of bone softening powder.

471
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,780
Where did you

472
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,820
lock those Qi people up in?

473
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,220
They are all here.

474
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,260
But they don't receive

475
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,220
such a good treatment as you do,

476
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,280
to have a prison cell to yourself.

477
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,470
Did you kidnap them

478
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,580
just for the Qi Vital Stone?

479
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,060
What else could it be?

480
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,600
Is there anything else

481
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,960
that's valuable on you Qi?

482
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,870
You're crazy.

483
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,340
Normally, I only take a little bit

484
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,160
of Qi Vital Stone

485
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,100
from those Qi people at a time.

486
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,660
I can't rush it.

487
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,080
Just a little bit at a time.

488
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,660
Qi Vital Stone can be regenerated.

489
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,510
But if I take too much,

490
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,040
those Qi people

491
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,430
would either become crippled

492
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,900
or die.

493
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,070
I can only toss them

494
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,900
into the sea to feed the fishes.

495
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,800
With my careful operation,

496
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,660
the Qi Vital Stone is worth thousands of gold.

497
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,090
The Qi Vital Stone of the Young Master of Cangqi

498
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,960
should fetch an even better price.

499
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,390
But do you think it's better for me to sell it

500
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,460
or keep it

501
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
for my own use?

502
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,040
Your Highness,

503
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,780
save your energy.

504
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,660
When the Qi Vital Stone has recovered,

505
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,310
I'll keep you for a few more days.

506
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,540
But it won't be too long.

507
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,320
It will cause more trouble.

508
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,500
Usually those Qi people

509
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,730
can only stay for seven days here.

510
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,980
In these eight years,

511
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,940
not only did Qi people go missing,

512
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,180
but also Qian people.

513
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,080
They were also kidnapped by you

514
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,250
and tossed into the sea, right?

515
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,150
They should have stayed

516
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,470
in Jiuxiao City.

517
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,330
Yet they insisted on going to the State of Qi.

518
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,430
For money,

519
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,260
you'd even kill your own race.

520
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,500
You're out of your mind.

521
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,140
Those paintings and antiques

522
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,330
cost me a lot of money.

523
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,520
Using the cheap lives of you Qi people

524
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,150
in exchange for my exquisite art

525
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,230
to exist for an eternity...

526
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,300
The future generations

527
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,500
might even thank me.

528
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,770
Muyan will bring the Ember

529
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,710
to Jiuxiao City

530
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,820
to trade with us.

531
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,910
This "us" refers to–

532
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,090
It should be referring to this

533
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,670
organization with a snowflake emblem.

534
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,610
Could this Marquis Xian

535
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,020
be related to this organization?

536
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,180
You have read

537
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,020
that letter, right?

538
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,220
Letter?

539
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,700
What letter?

540
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,930
"This man

541
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,790
has been wanted by Shuobei.

542
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,070
Rumor has it that he has the Holy Fire

543
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,100
and is on his way to Jiuxiao City

544
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,080
to make a deal with us."

545
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,820
You know about this letter too?

546
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,500
I knew it.

547
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,110
He has something to do

548
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,220
with the organization with the snowflake emblem.

549
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,940
Unfortunately,

550
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,940
your information is not accurate.

551
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,520
The Holy Fire

552
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,140
is still in our country.

553
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
Impossible.

554
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,550
Us Snow Chamber's information

555
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,580
can never be wrong.

556
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,010
This organization

557
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,660
is called Snow Chamber.

558
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,200
You're trying to get me to talk.

559
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,580
But it doesn't matter.

560
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,340
For someone who's going to die,

561
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,360
even if you know about us Snow Chamber,

562
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,250
who can you tell?

563
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,500
You're right.

564
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,060
Then tell me

565
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,760
what your ulterior motive is.

566
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,040
You Qi people

567
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,940
are born arrogant and barbaric.

568
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,890
With the battle skills you have,

569
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,750
you want to blend in with us

570
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,990
and stay in Jiuxiao City.

571
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,380
If you all die,

572
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,450
we'll be safe.

573
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,620
What is your motive?

574
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:11,810
Marquis Xian,

575
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,020
are you still afraid

576
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,860
of a dying man like me?

577
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,860
I will make you die with regret.

578
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,770
It's a pity that you can't see it.

579
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,750
Us Snow Chamber

580
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,350
prepared a big gift

581
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,980
for the Qi race.

582
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,140
Jiu'er,

583
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,060
at this moment,

584
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,240
you should be safe, right?

585
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,690
Han Zheng!

586
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,110
Jiu'er.

587
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,460
Jiu'er?

588
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,340
Jiu'er.

589
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,050
What's wrong?

590
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,300
What's wrong?

591
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,110
Mother.

592
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,700
Is there any news about Han Zheng?

593
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,730
There's still a long way to go for tonight.

594
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,910
Maybe

595
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,300
we'll get news soon.

596
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,690
Jiu'er,

597
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,460
your pulse is weak.

598
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,770
Take the medicine.

599
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:42,230
Here.

600
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,060
I remember now.

601
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,700
A few days ago,

602
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,580
Prince Han

603
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,060
gave me his Qi Vital Stone.

604
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,620
He said

605
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,180
he didn't want you to dream of other Qi people

606
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,560
so he asked me to put this

607
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,960
in the medicine you usually take

608
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,620
and give it to you secretly.

609
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,530
Mother, take it.

610
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,620
You mean

611
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,020
this is Han Zheng's Qi Vital Stone?

612
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,660
Jiu'er!

613
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,560
What are you doing?

614
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,570
You can't take too much

615
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,180
of this Qi Vital Stone in one go.

616
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,530
This is great.

617
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,510
Mother,

618
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,540
go get some rest.

619
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,660
I'm going to sleep.

620
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,100
Jiu'er.

621
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,020
This is great.

622
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,280
Go to sleep.

623
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,380
Go to sleep.

624
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,820
Go to sleep, Su Jiu'er.

625
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,300
When you fall asleep,

626
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,000
you can see Han Zheng.

627
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:15,930
Han Zheng?

628
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,570
Han Zheng!

629
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,030
Han Zheng?

630
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,410
Is that you?

631
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,660
Jiu'er.

632
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,410
Han Zheng!

633
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:49,860
It's really you.

634
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,050
You finally came to my dream.

635
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,140
Great!

636
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,740
This is great, Han Zheng.

637
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:55,670
I knew

638
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,890
you would find me.

639
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,850
What's wrong?

640
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,370
Why is your body

641
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,139
so hot?

642
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,030
I'm fine.

643
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:14,739
But...

644
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:16,870
But you,

645
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,409
why are you so cold?

646
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,580
What's wrong with you?

647
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,389
Marquis Xian

648
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,340
took some of my Qi Vital Stone.

649
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,090
What?

650
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,139
Doesn't it hurt a lot?

651
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:38,880
No.

652
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:39,800
Han Zheng...

653
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:42,219
You...

654
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:44,620
You are so cold all over.

655
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,170
Are you...

656
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:47,750
going to...

657
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,929
Don't curse me.

658
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:51,810
I will be fine.

659
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,130
Oh right, Han Zheng.

660
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,060
Tell me

661
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,260
where you are now.

662
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,330
I'm going to save you.

663
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,300
This is a cave.

664
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,380
I can hear the crows

665
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,700
and the sound of water.

666
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,530
I think I am still in the hunting ground.

667
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,140
It's very likely that

668
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,260
I'm near that river.

669
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:15,760
Okay.

670
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,180
I got it.

671
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,840
I have memorized it.

672
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,140
You are about to wake from your dream.

673
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,460
Han Zheng.

674
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,030
Hang in there.

675
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,620
You must wait for me to save you.

676
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,800
You must wait for me.

677
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,470
Jiu'er,

678
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,220
I miss you so much.

679
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,240
I just realized today

680
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,870
that I'm not afraid of death.

681
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,750
But I'm afraid of leaving you.

682
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,780
You fool.

683
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,950
Don't worry.

684
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,830
I won't let you

685
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,620
leave me.

686
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,830
I will find you.

687
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,300
You must wait for me.

688
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,900
Do you hear me?

689
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,460
Any news from Chilan?

690
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,420
No, I can't wait any longer.

691
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,690
If I can't find Father,

692
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,850
I can find my elder brother.

693
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,990
Your Highness.

694
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,470
Don't be impulsive.

695
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,750
It's a matter of life and death.

696
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,270
Brother Han's life is uncertain.

697
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,460
I'll ask my brother

698
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,800
to ask for him from Uncle Xian.

699
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:44,620
Your Highness.

700
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,620
Think about

701
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,630
why His Highness sent Ah Qi

702
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,180
to help you sneak into the hunting ground?

703
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,190
It's because he didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

704
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,660
Now we don't have any evidence,

705
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,670
and His Highness doesn't want

706
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,000
to fall out with Marquis Hou.

707
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,320
- You have no evidence.
- We can’t wait any longer.

708
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,100
Your Highness.

709
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,010
Your Highness!

710
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,220
Wait for me!

711
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:04,770
You're back?

712
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,340
This brother Jun...

713
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,190
I've been sleeping all day.

714
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,700
Why isn't he back yet?

715
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,320
Jun.

716
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,410
Jun!

717
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,060
Jiu'er?

718
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,390
I know where Han Zheng is.

719
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,260
No, wait.

720
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:23,980
What are you talking about?

721
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:24,760
Why are you here?

722
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,590
Are you feeling better?

723
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,220
I'm fine.

724
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,370
He's still at the hunting ground.

725
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,990
Marquis Xian imprisoned him.

726
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,700
He is now picking out his Qi Vital Stone

727
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,900
bit by bit.

728
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,050
Han Zheng definitely can't stand this.

729
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,260
He's going to die.

730
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:35,840
How did you know?

731
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,190
I took Han Zheng's

732
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,330
Qi Vital Stone he left for me.

733
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,050
I saw him in my dream.

734
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,310
He told me

735
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,160
he was...

736
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,020
in a cave

737
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,580
with water sounds.

738
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:47,980
Jun.

739
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,350
Let's go and save him.

740
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,690
If we are too late

741
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,910
something will happen to Han Zheng.

742
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,330
How can we get in?

743
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,100
If Prince Han is really

744
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,240
captured by Marquis Hou,

745
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,590
the guards wouldn't

746
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,420
let us in.

747
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,460
Chilan and Keha

748
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,520
are still in the western suburbs' hunting ground,

749
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,460
we just can't

750
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,080
contact them.

751
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:04,750
Let me think.

752
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,500
What should we do?

753
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,330
What should we do?

754
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,260
Don't worry, Jiu'er.

755
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:11,980
Got it!

756
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:12,900
Liu Fu,

757
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,590
ask the guards and servants

758
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,220
to the western suburbs's hunting grounds.

759
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:15,760
Go!

760
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,030
Forcing our way in?

761
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,620
It's heavily guarded.

762
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,650
Even with us,

763
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,990
we can't get in.

764
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,780
We don't have to force our way in.

765
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,300
We just have to make

766
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,980
a huge fuss.

767
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,700
- Go. Go quickly.
- I’m good at this.

768
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,110
Go.

769
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,190
What about us?

770
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,130
Let's go.

771
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,620
What are they talking about?

772
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,440
Why did Father harm Han Zheng?

773
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,540
He even wants to kill Han Zheng?

774
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,150
Everyone,

775
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,620
be it male, female, old, or your,

776
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,190
gather at the door!

777
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:39,950
Yes!

778
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,410
Go get help! Hurry!

779
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,390
Someone broke in!

780
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,070
Hurry up!

781
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,700
It's them.

782
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,900
Who are you?

783
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,860
How dare you break into the royal hunting ground?

784
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,370
We're from Prince Jun's Residence.

785
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,690
We are here to look for our prince.

786
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,780
After His Highness

787
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,880
has been to your hunting ground,

788
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,940
he hasn't returned to his residence.

789
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,900
Our entire residence is very worried.

790
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,480
Hurry up,

791
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,900
give him to me!

792
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,320
His Highness didn't come to the hunting ground today.

793
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,560
You may leave.

794
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,640
If you continue to go further,

795
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,490
I won't be so kind.

796
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,230
Let me ask you.

797
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,330
Was the Crown Prince's bodyguard Ah Qi

798
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,380
here today?

799
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,180
So what if he was?

800
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,800
That's right.

801
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,040
His Highness

802
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,160
was feeling playful today

803
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,000
so he disguised as a guard

804
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,480
and went in with Ah Qi.

805
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,340
Cut the crap.

806
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,980
Let us in.

807
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:44,670
If anything happens

808
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,060
to His Highness,

809
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,190
you can't afford it!

810
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:48,640
Search!

811
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,150
Don't move.

812
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,480
How dare you touch His Highness's people?

813
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,260
Come.

814
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,740
Slice here!

815
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,220
Let alone our prince,

816
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,750
if the Crown Prince finds out tomorrow,

817
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,420
he will chop you into half.

818
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,380
Come!

819
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,500
Come on!

820
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:09,780
Be gentle.

821
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,470
Hurry up.

822
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,620
You have to send these

823
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,960
Qi Vital Stone out by dawn.

824
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:14,780
Yes.

825
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:18,780
Maquis,

826
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,400
rest early.

827
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,940
It's midnight.

828
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,150
I think

829
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,650
nothing will happen today.

830
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,000
My eyelids keep twitching today.

831
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,660
I feel uneasy.

832
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,640
Wenjun asked me for him.

833
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,900
They won't let it go.

834
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,260
Should we

835
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,100
move Prince Qi to somewhere else?

836
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,980
Everything aside,

837
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,850
they can't guess that

838
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,500
His Highness is still at the hunting ground.

839
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,060
Even if they have guessed it,

840
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,690
they won't know

841
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,090
where His Highness is hidden in.

842
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,880
Moreover, the cave is heavily guarded.

843
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,450
I'm afraid they can get in but can't get out alive.

844
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,180
Marquis Xian.

845
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,180
Marquis.

846
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:14,750
A bunch of servants

847
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,500
from Prince Jun's Residence are here

848
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,860
saying they want to look for Prince Jun

849
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,280
and barged into the hunting ground with their men.

850
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,120
We couldn't stop them.

851
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,810
We dare not hurt them.

852
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,470
Please give your orders.

853
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,740
Hasn't Wenjun

854
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,170
already gone back?

855
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,420
Could he have

856
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:31,520
not returned to his residence?

857
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,220
Who is leading

858
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,260
this chaos?

859
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,760
He called himself Liu Fu.

860
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,060
Liu Fu?

861
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,130
Liu Fu has always been steady.

862
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,180
He brought a bunch of thugs

863
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,060
to barge into the hunting ground.

864
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,460
It doesn't seem like something he'd do.

865
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,180
Could it be a trap?

866
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,660
Take some men to keep an eye on the cave.

867
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,220
Tell me if anything happens.

868
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:03,860
Yes.
