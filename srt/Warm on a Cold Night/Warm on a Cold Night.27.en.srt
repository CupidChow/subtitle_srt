[Episode 27]

4
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,140
It's done.

5
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,930
I've bandaged you up.

6
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,520
It's getting late.

7
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,850
Should you return?

8
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,390
Wait.

9
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,230
Follow me.

10
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,260
Where are we going?

11
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,950
Where are we going?

12
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,310
Today, the moon

13
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,870
is big and round.

14
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,579
I can't see clearly from this angle.

15
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,790
Just a little.

16
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,170
It's not big and round.

17
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,820
Let's go somewhere else.

18
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,820
Viewing from here,

19
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,610
the moon is really big

20
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,630
and round.

21
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,120
It's so beautiful.

22
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,820
I haven't looked up at the starry sky

23
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,120
for a long time.

24
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,540
If you want to see it in the future,

25
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,740
I'll take you up here.

26
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,860
By the way,

27
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,220
I'm home.

28
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,320
Well,

29
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,240
I'll go back first.

30
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,040
Jiu'er.

31
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,180
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,700
Regarding what has happened to Mr. Hu,

33
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,360
I've been looking for a chance

34
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,710
to apologize to you.

35
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,060
Hu's biggest wish

36
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,340
is for Jiuxiao City

37
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,580
can be peaceful.

38
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,279
So you must take his place

39
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,450
to maintain public order.

40
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:21,779
Okay?

41
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,530
Okay.

42
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,170
But today,

43
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,970
not only do I want to apologize to you,

44
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,770
but thank you.

45
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,870
I like what you said.

46
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,550
Go on.

47
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,900
After joining the Inspection Bureau,

48
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,620
we've been through

49
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,950
ups and downs together.

50
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,240
I have become more aware of

51
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,710
what Father often said that

52
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,750
Qian people are no match for Qi,

53
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,820
no matter in longevity,

54
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,420
physique,

55
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:51,130
or strength.

56
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,810
But the state can develop

57
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,010
to this scale.

58
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,870
What it relies on

59
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,550
is the law

60
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,870
and system

61
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,260
which are ahead of the entire Jiuzhou.

62
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,140
There's no distinction between the noble and the base

63
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,200
in front of the law.

64
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,100
As long as a country has its legal system,

65
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,160
it won't be chaotic even if in danger.

66
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,310
The law is the foundation of the country's stability.

67
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,740
Do you realize it now?

68
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,460
From now on,

69
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,080
you should follow me to learn and observe more.

70
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,690
Hey.

71
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,960
You are getting arrogant.

72
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:23,730
By the way,

73
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
in a short period,

74
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,330
I'm going back to Shuobei

75
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,530
to attend the Xuandong Grand Ceremony.

76
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,500
You're going back soon?

77
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,240
I think I heard before that

78
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,590
every king of Qi

79
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,570
would hold

80
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,580
the coronation for the future king

81
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,909
when he is 200 years old.

82
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,750
The successor needs to accept

83
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,820
challenges from the warriors from different tribes.

84
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,880
Only if you survive

85
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,110
can you become the real King of Qi.

86
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,310
Are you confident of it?

87
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,220
Of course.

88
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,460
But

89
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,350
I'll be back soon.

90
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,730
After all...

91
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,360
After all,

92
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,660
I haven't finished investigating

93
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Mu Yan's case yet.

94
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:11,980
Right?

95
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,780
How is that possible?

96
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,210
When you are the King,

97
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,620
you can't simply leave

98
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,820
like that.

99
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,740
Are you trying to say that

100
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,240
you don't want me to leave?

101
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,750
If I say I'm reluctant for you to leave,

102
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,900
you won't, right?

103
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,470
I'm just kidding.

104
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,800
It's great that you leave.

105
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,500
After you leave,

106
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,980
no one will pick on me anymore.

107
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,440
Then I'll be more at peace.

108
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,060
But...

109
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,950
But don't worry.

110
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,900
I will get to the bottom of the case

111
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,300
about Mu Yan.

112
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,380
Su Jiu'er.

113
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,720
Do you really want me to leave?

114
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,000
Qi people have long lives.

115
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,440
He said it's a while.

116
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,200
Maybe it'll be a few years.

117
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,720
I don't know whether I'm still alive

118
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,580
until then.

119
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,900
Don't you always want to know

120
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,200
about Mu Yan?

121
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,070
Why don't you ask me now?

122
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,790
You don't treat me as one of yours.

123
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,060
Every time I asked, you didn't answer.

124
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,460
And you even yelled at me.

125
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,750
I'll tell you now

126
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,480
everything about Mu Yan.

127
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,500
So your father

128
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,420
usurped the throne of the King of Xuanqi.

129
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,820
Then the King of Xuanqi committed suicide.

130
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,230
The Crown Prince, Mu Yan,

131
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,360
also disappeared.

132
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,100
It blows down to

133
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,360
the reign of the King of Xuanqi

134
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,400
was too strict.

135
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,050
He fought with other countries endlessly,

136
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,450
causing people to suffer

137
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:52,920
and chaos everywhere.

138
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,500
That's why Chiqi and Cangqi

139
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,850
supported my father.

140
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,409
If so, wouldn't Mu Yan

141
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,390
hate your father to death?

142
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,820
When Qi wanted to arrest Mu Yan,

143
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,320
Could it be...

144
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,500
Could it be you trying to get rid of him?

145
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,220
No.

146
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,620
It's because he stole the Ember

147
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,130
when he left.

148
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:17,900
Ember?

149
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,710
The Ember

150
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,020
is the Holy Fire that has been passed down

151
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,950
for thousands of years in our race.

152
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,040
Shuobei is very cold.

153
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,490
Every 100 years,

154
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,680
there will be one polar night.

155
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,450
Without sunlight,

156
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,140
we can only rely on

157
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,340
the power of the Ember

158
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,500
to survive.

159
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,220
I see.

160
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,540
No wonder you keep saying

161
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,670
Mu Yan's matter

162
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,500
is related to Qi's secret.

163
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,450
Didn't you always say

164
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,500
I wouldn't tell you anything,

165
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
and only treat you

166
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,110
as a tool for investigation?

167
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,670
Now I'm telling you this

168
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,860
because I want you to know

169
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,690
that I trust you

170
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,610
completely.

171
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,660
I swear

172
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,430
I will seal

173
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,100
my lips

174
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,380
and won't abuse

175
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,310
your trust in me.

176
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,380
I know it.

177
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:10,950
I trust you too.

178
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:13,740
What?

179
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,830
Give me five.

180
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,020
I announce

181
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,150
from now on,

182
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,840
we'll be new partners.

183
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,610
You, who are unreserved,

184
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,590
and I,

185
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,930
who have never been reserved

186
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,060
will find Mu Yan

187
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,420
and the Ember together.

188
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,230
Okay.

189
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,000
What are you doing?

190
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,360
You look too weak.

191
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,470
I'm replenishing your health.

192
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,500
Don't you want it?

193
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,430
Forget it, then.

194
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,290
I want it.

195
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,820
As for health,

196
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,300
the more, the better.

197
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,500
The more, the better.

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,460
Jiu'er.

199
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,980
I can't let go of my responsibility.

200
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,770
And also you.

201
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,970
Give me some time.

202
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,060
Finally, I don't have to sleep on a small bed.

203
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,520
Now I can have a good sleep.

204
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,240
Why can't I fall asleep?

205
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,800
Your Highness.

206
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,890
You've been turning over for two hours.

207
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,270
Get some sleep.

208
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,800
What are you doing?

209
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,220
Why are you still up?

210
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,340
How dare I sleep if you don't?

211
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,720
Your Highness.

212
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,210
I saw you

213
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,210
turning over and over

214
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,570
with a grinning face.

215
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,720
Shut up!

216
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,950
Your Highness.

217
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,420
Do you have any good news?

218
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,940
I already told you.

219
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,180
Did you?

220
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:16,900
Yes.

221
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,330
I said, shut up!

222
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,220
What's the use of

223
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,710
thinking about all these?

224
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,580
He has a throne

225
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,730
to inherit.

226
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,500
The two of us?

227
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,410
It's impossible.

228
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,180
Liu Fu.

229
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,780
Liu Fu!

230
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,270
Your Highness.

231
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,690
Y-Your Highness.

232
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,230
Did I interrupt your sleep?

233
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:02,970
No.

234
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,240
I'm still up.

235
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,890
I couldn't fall asleep

236
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,110
so I would like to have a chit-chat.

237
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,630
Your Highness.

238
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,420
It's my profession.

239
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,340
Do you want to talk about operas, life,

240
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,890
or romance?

241
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,480
I want to talk about

242
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,080
Jiu'er.

243
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,740
That's romance.

244
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,010
Your Highness.

245
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,140
Are you worried that

246
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,100
Prince Han is out of prison now

247
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,390
and he and Jiu'er...

248
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,840
always work together,

249
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,730
so you're a little worried?

250
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,250
Brother Han not only can

251
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,940
meet her in her dream every night,

252
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,860
but they investigate cases together justifiably

253
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,210
in the daytime.

254
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,820
Their relationship

255
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,990
are already closer than Jiu'er and mine in the beginning.

256
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,800
I'm now left far behind them.

257
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,770
Your Highness.

258
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,780
Don't worry about that.

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,140
As far as I know,

260
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,920
the Xuandong Grand Ceremony of Qi

261
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,340
is around the corner.

262
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,640
The Xuandong Grand Ceremony?

263
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,260
After the Xuandong Grand Ceremony,

264
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,490
Prince Han

265
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,970
will be the new King of Qi.

266
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,410
By then,

267
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,140
Qi people won't allow him

268
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,620
to stay in Jiuxiao City,

269
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,690
not to mention

270
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,360
have connections

271
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,590
with a Qian woman.

272
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,310
That means

273
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,340
Brother Han will leave eventually.

274
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,030
What about Miss Jiu'er?

275
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,960
Miss Jiu'er

276
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
is a smart person.

277
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,340
She'll know when to take it

278
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,860
or leave it.

279
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,190
That's not right.

280
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,800
If Han Zheng leaves,

281
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,480
who will replenish the health of Jiu'er?

282
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,410
This...

283
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,620
By then,

284
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,340
not only will Jiu'er be upset,

285
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,020
but she'll suffer from her illness.

286
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
What should we do?

287
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,660
Your Highness.

288
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,830
Can't you think

289
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,780
for yourself?

290
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,780
By then,

291
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,280
your chance will come.

292
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,760
The chance of winning will be higher.

293
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,030
I've suddenly figured it out.

294
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,310
Compared to Jiu'er,

295
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,430
my feelings

296
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,080
is not that important.

297
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,980
[Prince Jun's Residence]

298
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,360
Jiu'er.

299
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,970
-Jun.
-What brings you here

300
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,780
that early?

301
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,340
Jun.

302
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,870
I want to go to the Law Department.

303
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:25,760
What official business

304
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,890
do you need to go to the Law Department?

305
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,460
If it is an official business,

306
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,500
I'll go by myself

307
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,180
without bothering you.

308
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:32,900
Not at all.

309
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,900
Take a seat first.

310
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,600
Sit here and I'll tell you.

311
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,100
Before my father passed away,

312
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,380
he visited Shuobei.

313
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,060
And he likely

314
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,660
went to investigate Mu Yan.

315
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,700
But I've checked through

316
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,410
everything my father left at home

317
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,550
and the Inspection Bureau.

318
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,880
I didn't find anything.

319
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,820
So I think

320
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,890
if my father went to Shuobei for work,

321
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,940
then the Law Department

322
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,670
must have left a record, right?

323
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,610
The officials

324
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,980
who left Jiuxiao City on a business trip

325
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,720
have basically left records

326
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,980
in the Law Department.

327
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,320
But I don't have the permit.

328
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:01,900
I can't

329
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,380
look into it justifiably.

330
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:03,980
Jun.

331
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,570
Do you have any idea?

332
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,220
No.

333
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:11,700
But

334
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
I'm the idea.

335
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,980
Little Yellow Peach.

336
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,370
Little Yellow Peach.

337
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,030
Lord Sun.

338
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,360
Prince Jun is here.

339
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,970
Sorry for not welcoming you.

340
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,720
My apologies.

341
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,520
My apologies.

342
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,350
No worries, Lord Sun.

343
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,280
Let me introduce

344
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,740
Senior Inspector Su

345
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,710
from the Inspection Bureau to you.

346
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,310
Lord Sun.

347
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,820
Senior Inspector Su.

348
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,750
Nice to meet you.

349
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,970
May I know

350
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,210
what can I do for you?

351
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,830
Senior Inspector Su

352
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,380
is investigating a strange case recently.

353
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:50,780
So,

354
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,970
she needs to browse the files in your department.

355
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,300
I don't think Lord Sun will stop us, right?

356
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:57,640
Well...

357
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,370
Since it's an investigation,

358
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,780
you're supposed to have a permit.

359
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,910
The permit

360
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,970
hasn't been approved yet.

361
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,430
You don't have the permit?

362
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,660
That's inappropriate.

363
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,740
Inappropriate.

364
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,150
Lord Sun.

365
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,990
With our friendship,

366
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,680
do I still need the permit?

367
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,330
But Your Highness,

368
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,900
we've only met twice.

369
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,060
I always regret

370
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,060
not having met earlier with you.

371
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,290
Although we are friends,

372
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,660
you still need a permit.

373
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,130
When investigating a case,

374
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,760
the faster, the better.

375
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,180
Right?

376
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,930
Otherwise, when the permit is approved,

377
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,680
we have already wasted so much time.

378
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,080
But...

379
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,290
Lord Sun.

380
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,310
You should take a long view.

381
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,290
Senior Inspector Su is the top

382
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,460
in the Inspection Bureau.

383
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,650
She has become the second-in-command at such a young age.

384
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,060
Have you heard of the Qian-Qi Partners?

385
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,070
Is Senior Inspector Su

386
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,329
the one

387
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,180
who partners with the Young Master of Qi?

388
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,700
Yes.

389
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,579
Exactly.

390
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,140
Everyone in Jiuxiao City

391
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,460
knows about this.

392
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,640
[The 23rd year of Dingkun]

393
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,069
Found it.

394
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,040
In the 23rd year of Dingkun,

395
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,180
my father went to Shuobei.

396
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,619
She solved countless cases in just a few months.

397
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,220
She's really young and promising.

398
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,060
So,

399
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:21,940
Lord Sun,

400
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,700
don't make it difficult for Senior Inspector Su

401
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,839
because of the bureaucracy.

402
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,160
Please turn a blind eye

403
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,390
and help your junior.

404
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,150
Why is there no record

405
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,980
of my father serving as an envoy?

406
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,300
Lord Sun.

407
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,710
Did you miss

408
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,960
any of the records of the officials

409
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,100
being out of Jiuxiao City?

410
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,740
Don't worry, Senior Inspector Su.

411
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,540
The motto of the Law Department

412
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,600
is to be strict and rigorous,

413
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,330
honest and true.

414
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,560
There's no way we would make a mistake.

415
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,620
This is weird.

416
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,140
Before my father passed away,

417
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,440
he went to Shuobei for the last time.

418
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,870
But there's no relevant record in the Law Department.

419
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,150
Could it be that it was not a business trip

420
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,680
but a private leave?

421
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,100
Lord Sun.

422
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,170
What is this?

423
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,140
Your Highness.

424
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,180
Is this the legendary

425
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,700
yellow peach-faced lovebird

426
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,670
coming far away from Japan,

427
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,870
with seven out of nine

428
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,430
in Jiuxiao City having died?

429
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,290
Your Highness.

430
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,380
Please keep your voice down.

431
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,700
Many people in Jiuxiao City

432
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,530
are coveting my Little Yellow Peach.

433
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,260
If not, why would I bring it here

434
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,300
to clock in?

435
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,760
Indeed.

436
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,670
Be careful.

437
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,720
[Confidential]

438
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,950
The Mu Yan my father drew

439
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,100
is the same as the one on the warrant.

440
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,200
What is this totem about?

441
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,440
Senior Inspector Su.

442
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,910
This is the top-secret file

443
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,170
of the Law Department.

444
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,570
How could you open it without permission?

445
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,500
When I came here,

446
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,600
the cabinet was like this.

447
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,880
So I thought I could have a look.

448
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,610
Impossible.

449
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,420
The motto of the Law Department

450
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,060
is to be strict and rigorous,

451
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:24,990
honest and true.

452
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,920
How could we forget

453
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,780
to lock the cabinet

454
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,980
for the secret files?

455
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:28,860
Lord Sun.

456
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,060
No matter what, I've seen the file.

457
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
I have a question.

458
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:32,990
Lord Sun.

459
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,660
Is this the warrant of Qi?

460
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,070
But the words on it

461
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,730
are not in Qi's language.

462
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,250
Can you resolve it for me?

463
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:40,990
You've read

464
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,140
the confidential file without permission.

465
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,490
Now,

466
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,580
you're asking me shamelessly to help you

467
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,980
to crack the secret code.

468
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,460
Lord Sun.

469
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,030
Do you know

470
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,580
in Jiuxiao City, apart from this one,

471
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,640
where the other is?

472
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,500
Your Highness.

473
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,300
This is not the right timing.

474
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
I'm not in the mood

475
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,470
to talk about this with you.

476
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,470
You are indeed...

477
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,970
That one seems to be

478
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,900
in my eldest brother's residence.

479
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,720
His one

480
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,540
is a girl.

481
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,340
And yours

482
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,650
is a little boy.

483
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,950
Don't you want them to

484
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,090
get married

485
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,550
and have a full house of children?

486
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,150
Have a full house of children

487
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,650
and get married.

488
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,980
But...

489
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,530
Lord Sun.

490
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,220
This secret report

491
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,720
is more than ten years ago.

492
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,640
Even if there is any information,

493
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,920
it's already expired.

494
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,300
Just tell us.

495
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,520
Well...

496
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,640
Fine.

497
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,970
Ten years ago,

498
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,400
there was a civil unrest in Qi.

499
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,990
The Law Department secretly intercepted

500
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,940
the secret letters

501
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,550
between the state of Qi and Jiuxiao City.

502
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,790
This is one of them.

503
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,940
After I cracked the code,

504
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,230
I found the content very shocking.

505
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,960
It was written that

506
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,460
the three-scar Qi man

507
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,150
wanted by the state of Qi

508
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,030
would take the Holy Fire of Qi

509
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,470
to Jiuxiao City

510
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,070
and make a deal with us.

511
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,570
Us?

512
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,300
Who is "us" referring to?

513
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,260
I have no idea.

514
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,660
I'm afraid it's related to the snowflake-like totem

515
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,460
on the secret letter.

516
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,110
Based on my experience,

517
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,180
it's not an ordinary pattern.

518
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,370
It should be a secret mark of an organization.

519
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,120
Lord Sun.

520
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,710
Do you know

521
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,380
who the Qi in the painting is?

522
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,860
I've never seen him before.

523
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,430
That issue couldn't be taken lightly.

524
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,410
That's why we reinforced

525
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,220
the guard

526
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,460
at each checkpoint of the state of Qi.

527
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,660
We also informed the Inspection Bureau

528
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,200
so that they would arrest

529
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,680
the person on the warrant immediately once they met

530
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,810
for interrogation.

531
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,420
We didn't expect this person

532
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,070
to be absolutely absent in Jiuxiao City.

533
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,480
You did talk to the Inspection Bureau.

534
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,100
Is he Su Huan, Commander Su?

535
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,220
Do you know him too?

536
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,970
Su Huan is my father!

537
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,450
It turns out that we are friends spanning generations.

538
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,130
Great.

539
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,090
Uncle Sun.

540
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:15,830
[Law Department]

541
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,810
Uncle Sun.

542
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,430
Don't you serve us a glass of water?

543
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,160
I haven't finished asking yet.

544
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,290
Lord Sun would never

545
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,350
work collaboratively

546
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,380
with Commander Su.

547
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,780
Because every time solving a case,

548
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,510
Commander Su

549
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,910
was faster than Lord Sun.

550
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,380
So the higher-ups thought

551
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,780
Lord Sun was incompetent

552
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,160
and sent him

553
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,020
to work in a small warehouse.

554
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,150
I used to think

555
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,840
my father was so outstanding.

556
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,510
He must be very popular.

557
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,290
I didn't expect that...

558
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,200
Being excellent is also a sin.

559
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,550
Let's go.

560
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:46,980
Jiu'er.

561
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,930
Let me tell you a joke.

562
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,170
It's already at this hour.

563
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,030
Why hasn't Jiu'er clocked in yet?

564
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,000
Isn't this funny?

565
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:00,390
Right?

566
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,690
My stomach hurts from laughing.

567
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,750
How should I put it?

568
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,820
Su Jiu'er.

569
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,320
Han Zheng.

570
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,750
Why are you here?

571
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,750
Brother Han.

572
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,100
Am I funny?

573
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,620
No.

574
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,700
Just now, Jun

575
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,620
told me a joke.

576
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,140
Let me share it with you.

577
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,650
He said

578
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,170
there was a crab, right?

579
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,900
-When it went out...
-It bumped into a loach.

580
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,760
The loach said,

581
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,820
"Are you blind?"

582
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,180
It said, "I'm not."

583
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,940
"I'm not a shrimp. (The words 'blind' and 'shrimp' share the same pronunciation)

584
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,260
I'm a crab."

585
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,510
Why are you so free today

586
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,140
that you came to the Inspection Bureau?

587
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,470
Just now, Jiu'er and I...

588
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,280
We went to investigate a case.

589
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,250
I'm your partner.

590
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,140
Why didn't you take me to investigate the case?

591
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,780
No.

592
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,270
It's...

593
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,710
Only I can help with the case.

594
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,790
A while ago, I...

595
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,840
My goodness.

596
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,230
They are going to fight.

597
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,910
I couldn't accompany Jiu'er.

598
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,120
As a member of the Inspection Bureau,

599
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,820
I feel very guilty.

600
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,520
So, now I can't wait anymore

601
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,720
to patrol the streets

602
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,820
with Jiu'er.

603
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,880
Let's take attendance first.

604
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,540
Brother Han seems to be

605
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,880
different from before.

606
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,840
Amazing.

607
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,630
Prince Han used to

608
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,780
seethe silently in the corner.

609
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,660
Now, he's going to fight head-on.

610
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,590
You have no idea.

611
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,300
Prince Jun is the best at

612
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,800
rolling with the punches.

613
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm unoccupied anyway.

614
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,930
I'll go with you.

615
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,790
It sounds like

616
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:36,290
-you had something important to do before this.
-Don't leave the melon peel littered on the floor.

617
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,940
Is Prince Han busy now?

618
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,120
I'm accompanying Jiu'er to take attendance.

619
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,530
Then we're going on patrol.

620
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,060
Let's go.

621
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,700
Your Highness, please wait.

622
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,840
May I have a word with you somewhere else?

623
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,530
Can't we

624
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,610
talk here?

625
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,940
Your Highness

626
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,470
was wronged before,

627
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,740
yet you still let bygones be bygones

628
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,690
and solved the Peony Case

629
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,550
with Su Jiu'er.

630
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,000
How sagacious you are.

631
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,300
But...

632
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,120
But what?

633
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,840
I heard from you guys

634
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,930
that the words before "but" could be ignored.

635
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:16,620
But

636
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,190
as one of the Inspection Bureau,

637
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,230
you tried to abuse your power

638
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,540
and set the murderer free.

639
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,110
You also caused chaos in public.

640
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,440
We can't let this slide.

641
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,790
It's just that you've redeemed yourself.

642
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,850
So you are spared from imprisonment.

643
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,020
But

644
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,160
you are no more qualified

645
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,360
to be a Patrol in the Inspection Bureau.

646
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,120
Commander Yan.

647
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,260
Is there any room for negotiation?

648
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,820
This is the decision

649
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,260
of the head of the Law Department and me.

650
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,860
You've said so much

651
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,050
just to discharge me.

652
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,310
I don't even care about it.

653
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,480
Han Zheng.

654
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,540
Han Zheng.

655
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,290
Brother Han.

656
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,040
Brother Han.

657
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:06,430
[Inspection Bureau]

658
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,710
Watermelon.

659
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,500
Han Zheng.

660
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,500
Han Zheng.

661
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,260
-Brother Han.
-Wait for me.

662
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,470
Han Zheng.

663
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,200
Brother Han.

664
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,840
Han Zheng.

665
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,310
Don't be too sad.

666
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,500
Do I look sad?

667
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,790
Finally, I don't have to

668
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,580
follow the orders

669
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,990
of those idiots in the Inspection Bureau.

670
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,070
I should be happy.

671
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,760
He seems to be really sad.

672
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,910
Let me comfort him.

673
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,710
Brother Han.

674
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,580
You have to think this way.

675
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,430
You made such a big fuss at that time.

676
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,960
At least you would be imprisoned

677
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,290
for more than ten years.

678
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,270
Now you're just being suspended.

679
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,290
It's actually a good return.

680
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,350
Are you saying that

681
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,920
I made a fortune instead?

682
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,460
I mean

683
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,220
you have to look at the bright side.

684
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,630
Even if you leave the Inspection Bureau,

685
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,450
you're still

686
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,600
a rich young master.

687
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,250
But if the Inspection Bureau is without you,

688
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,110
it is the same as lacking a pillar.

689
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:51,930
Yes.

690
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,780
I also feel sorry

691
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,330
for the Inspection Bureau.

692
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,980
But you look cheerful.

693
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,020
You finally don't have me as your partner.

694
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,420
And you can be free from now on.

695
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,540
Not at all.

696
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,160
Is it not?

697
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,480
How is that possible? I...

698
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,210
Brother Han.

699
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,800
How about this?

700
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,220
Let's go to Deyue Restaurant to have a good meal

701
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,820
and celebrate your freedom.

702
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,890
I prefer the Qiwei Pavillion.

703
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,110
Jiu'er doesn't like raw food.

704
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,220
You don't know her well.

705
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:20,970
She can eat

706
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,900
three portions of beef liver

707
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,140
in one meal.

708
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:29,820
Well,

709
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,550
she does prefer

710
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,410
the Jade Rabbit Bun in the Deyue Restaurant.

711
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,170
She can eat six portions a meal.

712
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,800
Tell us, then.

713
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,020
Are we going to the Deyue Restaurant

714
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,240
or Qiwei Pavillion?

715
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,280
Then...

716
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,360
Then...

717
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,520
I choose Qiwei Pavillion.

718
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,690
He was just disemployed.

719
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,510
Give in to him.

720
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:01,750
Let's go.

721
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,210
What's written on it?

722
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,580
Let me see.

723
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,180
Letter of employment.

724
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,220
Su Jiu'er, Senior Inspector of the Inspection Bureau,

725
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,120
has hired Han Zheng as the Senior Inspector's assistant

726
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,630
to uphold justice

727
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,580
and maintain the peace of Jiuxiao.

728
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,660
There are 20 taels of monthly salary.

729
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,930
The employment is effective immediately.

730
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:30,800
It's just a token.

731
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,530
Just a token.

732
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,200
I don't have that much money.

733
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,970
Han Zheng paying for himself will do.

734
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,970
The Senior Inspector's assistant?

735
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,010
It sounds

736
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,030
not classy at all.

737
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,210
That's easy.

738
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,660
Let me see.

739
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,220
The classy assistant of the Senior Inspector.

740
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Give it back to me.

741
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:09,900
Here.

742
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,310
I can't believe that Jiu'er has invited

743
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,080
Brother Han for a job.

744
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,380
Here.

745
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,350
Look.

746
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,430
Since we're full,

747
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,140
I'll patrol the streets with you.

748
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,470
Sure.

749
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,010
By the way,

750
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,220
Your Highness said

751
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,420
you wanted to visit the Eldest Prince's residence.

752
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,880
We won't disturb you then.

753
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,630
Let's go.

754
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,940
Jun, take your time.

755
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,810
Thank you for helping me

756
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,800
this morning.

757
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,260
Tomorrow,

758
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,820
I'll ask Jiu'er to give me an employment letter too.

759
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,150
I also want to be a classy assistant to the Senior Inspector.

760
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,230
I can't believe that the Law Department

761
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,160
intercepted such a secret letter.

762
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,930
When I was young,

763
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,190
I just thought Father

764
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,850
was drawing while recalling.

765
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,290
Now that I think about it,

766
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,220
I find that he was

767
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,490
copying the portrait

768
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,150
of Mu Yan

769
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,360
with his memory

770
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,250
on the warrant.

771
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,020
The secret letter also said

772
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,240
Mu Yan would bring the Ember

773
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,120
to trade with us

774
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,780
in Jiuxiao City.

775
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,780
The "us"

776
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,140
might refer to the organization

777
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,460
with a snowflake mark.

778
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,500
I don't believe that

779
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,700
Mu Yan stole the Ember

780
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,900
to make a deal with the Qian people.

781
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,310
Maybe

782
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,290
he wanted to take revenge on your father.

783
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,150
Impossible.

784
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,790
Mu Yan

785
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,360
always prioritizes the interests of the Qi race

786
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,690
and treats the Qian people as his enemies.

787
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,820
He won't cooperate with the Qian people

788
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,750
just because of personal grudges.

789
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,360
Only by finding Mu Yan

790
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,340
can we know where the Ember is

791
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,660
and what the organization

792
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,590
is all about.

793
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,390
Don't worry.

794
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,900
Now we have collected

795
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,260
critical information.

796
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,380
As long as we work together

797
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,550
and join forces,

798
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,510
we can solve the mystery in the end.

799
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,770
You took the advantage to touch my hand again.

800
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,450
I'm not taking advantage,

801
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,740
but doing it openly.

802
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:26,960
Don't move.

803
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,200
What?

804
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,220
There's something on your nose.

805
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:31,990
What is it?

806
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,150
It's the fingerprint just now.

807
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,610
Have you cleaned it?

808
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,000
Why are you laughing?

809
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,080
Han Zheng, you did it on purpose.

810
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,070
I want to draw one on your face too.

811
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,100
-I must draw one.
-Stop it.

812
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,630
How about I draw a tortoise?

813
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,620
It's done.

814
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,340
Your Highness.

815
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,710
I guess this must be

816
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,940
a valued piece of calligraphy from somebody noble.

817
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,520
Otherwise, Your Highness

818
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,100
wouldn't care so much about it.

819
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,340
This is the employment letter

820
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,670
written to me by Jiu'er.

821
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,990
Employment letter?

822
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,980
She hired me

823
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,730
as her classy assistant.

824
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,560
Your Highness.

825
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,470
Do you know

826
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,660
what an assistant means?

827
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,320
It means one is big and the other is small.

828
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,130
One, one...

829
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,210
One is superior,

830
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,780
and the other obeys the orders.

831
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,340
Just like you and me.

832
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,140
I know.

833
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:48,730
Oh no.

834
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,580
Oh no.

835
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,220
Your Highness, you've been

836
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,280
driven mad by love.

837
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,540
Are you even willing to self-humiliate

838
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,900
for the sake of Miss Jiu'er?

839
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,230
Am I that kind of prince?

840
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,250
I'm not doing this because of Jiu'er.

841
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:02,980
She only offered me

842
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,340
twenty taels each month.

843
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,940
I even need to pay for myself.

844
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,920
Do you think I'm that stupid?

845
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,650
Then who are you doing this for?

846
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,220
Uncle Hu's biggest wish

847
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,270
is to ensure Jiuxiao City

848
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,020
can be peaceful.

849
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,760
Helping Jiu'er

850
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,450
or the Inspection Bureau

851
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,790
is actually helping Jiuxiao City.

852
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,900
But I don't know

853
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,770
how long I can hold on.

854
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,460
Your Highness is really different

855
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,640
from before.

856
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,430
Prince Jun.

857
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,550
You came at the right time.

858
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,150
I was just about to remind you

859
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,480
to attend the family feast in the palace

860
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,240
tomorrow.

861
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,300
I'm not in the mood.

862
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,160
Tomorrow's family banquet

863
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,780
was arranged specially for you and He Yin

864
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,380
by your mother.

865
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,900
Of course.

866
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,610
This is also what Uncle Xian wants.

867
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,469
If you don't go,

868
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,949
the feast will be meaningless.

869
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,070
But I don't like He Yin.

870
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,550
Eldest Brother, do you know?

871
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,670
Jiu'er has given Brother Han an offer.

872
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,199
Offer?

873
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,750
No, it's not that kind of offer.

874
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,409
She's hiring Brother Han as her assistant.

875
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,960
In this way,

876
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,889
won't their time together

877
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:32,780
be much longer?

878
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,199
Eldest Brother.

879
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,929
Please help me to think of a way.

880
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,620
You...

881
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,409
I think you're possessed.

882
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,580
You're not going to repent until you have experienced the failure.

883
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,940
You have her in your heart.

884
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,670
But does she?

885
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,130
Not now.

886
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,110
It doesn't mean she won't have in the future.

887
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:51,630
Eldest Brother.

888
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,420
How did you and Sister-in-law

889
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,020
know each other's feelings?

890
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,810
We didn't confess

891
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,800
to each other.

892
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,590
Although we used to meet frequently,

893
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,030
I never confessed

894
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,250
my affection for her.

895
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,580
Until by accident,

896
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,340
she thought

897
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,190
I would marry

898
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,080
the other woman

899
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,140
and changed her attitude toward me,

900
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,400
leaving me in the cold.

901
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,870
I realized that

902
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,470
she was jealous.

903
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
It turned out that

904
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,870
she also favored me.

905
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,610
Are you saying that

906
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,720
if the male lead and female lead

907
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,070
stuck from being closer,

908
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:33,130
they would need some stimulation from the surroundings?

909
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,190
Is that what I mean?

910
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:36,410
I got it.

911
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,010
You got it?

912
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,710
Every time I come to Eldest Brother,

913
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,370
I become enlightened at once.

914
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,730
Didn't Uncle Xian

915
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,780
want to matchmake He Yin and me?

916
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,540
Let him do it.

917
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:45,800
Not only that,

918
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,060
but I would also let Jiu'er be aware of it.

919
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:48,730
In this way,

920
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,710
Jiu'er

921
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,260
will find out that she has a crush on me,

922
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,420
just like what Eldest Brother and Sister-in-law did.

923
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,980
What if she doesn't favor you,

924
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,580
and it's useless to stimulate her in every way?

925
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,220
No way.

926
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,800
At least

927
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,790
a little bit.

928
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,310
I mean if...

929
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,380
I'll ask her

930
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,460
to help me extricate myself from

931
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,860
the marriage with He Yin.

932
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,270
That's also another reason

933
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:08,890
to see her.

934
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,620
Eldest Brother.

935
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,280
I have to go.

936
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,220
I'm leaving.

937
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,460
You brat.

938
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,260
Just wait.

939
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,300
Are you running away from home?

940
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,120
No way I will leave Your Highness.

941
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,740
It's just that

942
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,780
the Xuandong Grand Ceremony is coming.

943
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,550
I'm packing our bags

944
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,750
to go back to Shuobei.

945
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,490
We still have more than a month.

946
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:30,930
Yes.

947
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,520
I'm packing the things

948
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,010
that we don't need one by one.

949
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,000
After all, we won't come back anymore

950
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,680
this time.

951
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,060
What do you mean by not frequently used?

952
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,320
I use this quite often.

953
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,910
Your Highness, have you used this before?

954
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,650
We haven't found Mu Yan yet,

955
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,900
but you're thinking of not coming back anymore.

956
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,760
Your Highness.

957
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,250
Are you looking for Mu Yan

958
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,000
or Miss Jiu'er?

959
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:54,750
Both.

960
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,830
Put the things back.

961
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,090
Your Highness.

962
00:36:59,090 --> 00:36:59,790
If you win

963
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,290
in the Xuandong Grand Ceremony,

964
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,010
you'll be the real King of Qi.

965
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,660
As for the throne and Miss Jiu'er,

966
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,270
I don't think

967
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,060
you can have both.

968
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,470
Tell me.

969
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,050
If I invite Jiu'er

970
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,740
to go back to Shuobei with me,

971
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,600
will she agree?

972
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,840
Your Highness.

973
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,280
Are you trying to

974
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,230
announce that

975
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,520
you're going to be together with Jiu'er

976
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,980
in the Xuandong Grand Ceremony?

977
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,260
You've become smarter.

978
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,480
No, I...

979
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,700
Even if the old man

980
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,970
and the four tribes are against it,

981
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,170
I'll use my capability

982
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,060
to shut them up.

983
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,760
But, Your Highness.

984
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,850
E-Even if you win

985
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,210
and convince everyone,

986
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,550
will Miss Jiu'er agree?

987
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:38,730
Won't she?

988
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,500
Why?

989
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,670
It's true that you like her.

990
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,100
But, does she like you?

991
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,900
If she doesn't,

992
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,220
who else can she like?

993
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,630
That Wen Jun?

994
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,450
Maybe.

995
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,590
You're always

996
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,540
fierce toward her.

997
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,440
Look at Prince Jun.

998
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,380
He is gentle, considerate, and generous.

999
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,270
If Jiu'er

1000
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,250
doesn't have the tendency to be abused,

1001
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,650
why would she choose you?

1002
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,180
Then I'll treat her nicely.

1003
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,100
Here, take a look at this.

1004
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,090
Your jars

1005
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,110
are pretty good.

1006
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,350
Look at this.

1007
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,260
The long one

1008
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,150
is handmade by my family.

1009
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,970
It looks

1010
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:11,930
too long.

1011
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,560
Let me see.

1012
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,510
Show me that.

1013
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:16,790
Take a look.

1014
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,120
This must be an old item.

1015
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,780
The quality

1016
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,760
is better than that.

1017
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,800
Try it on.

1018
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,000
Take it if you like it.

1019
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,790
This black jar is really good.

1020
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,400
Let me see.

1021
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,800
The glaze color is quite bright.

1022
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,280
You indeed have good taste.

1023
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,870
This is quite unique.

1024
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,700
I think both are beautiful.

1025
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,760
These are all handmade by our family.

1026
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,400
Hello, sir.

1027
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,340
Madam.

1028
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,600
Hello.

1029
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,430
Madam?

1030
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,020
You are the one

1031
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,980
who sells medicine and wears red shoes

1032
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,110
in the rumor, right?

1033
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,950
I only sell one kind of medicine

1034
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,550
which can cure all diseases.

1035
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Let me have a look.

1036
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,120
What's inside?

1037
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,540
I can't tell.

1038
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,820
But don't worry.

1039
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,500
No matter what disease it is,

1040
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,460
with one bottle,

1041
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,750
you'll be radiant

1042
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,060
and full of energy.

1043
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,310
How much?

1044
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,620
Twenty taels.

1045
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,030
It's not too expensive.

1046
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,480
But it's also not cheap.

1047
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:18,740
Here.

1048
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,380
Gold.

1049
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,200
So expensive.

1050
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,460
Sir,

1051
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,940
do you have

1052
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,410
a trial pack with a smaller size?

1053
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,270
If it weren't for your good looks,

1054
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,080
I wouldn't entertain you.

1055
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,090
Here.

1056
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,920
Twenty taels of silver.

1057
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:38,580
Here.

1058
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,100
Thanks.

1059
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,410
Don't use it too much.

1060
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,210
As you ordered,

1061
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,010
I've given her the medicine.

1062
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,040
Physician Qin.

1063
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,760
I have a secret recipe.

1064
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,500
It might be helpful for the health of Jiu'er.

1065
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:17,940
But

1066
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,210
you have to mix it for her secretly

1067
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,140
because this is

1068
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,510
from Young Master Han.

1069
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,250
Why does

1070
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,730
the medicine bought from the black market

1071
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,420
have such a similar color and smell

1072
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,150
to Prince Han's secret recipe?

1073
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,350
Could it be from the state of Qi?

1074
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,150
Although Young Master Han

1075
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,680
can save the life of Jiu'er,

1076
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,870
who knows

1077
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,260
when he will leave?

1078
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,560
It's better to rely on ourselves than to rely on others.

1079
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,190
I hope this medicine works.

1080
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,570
The Siren is coming!

1081
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,000
It's Siren's voice!

1082
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,460
The Siren is here! Hide!

1083
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,550
Listen, what's that sound?

1084
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,150
It's the Siren.

1085
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,530
Is that the Siren?

1086
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,600
It's the Siren.

1087
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,730
It must be the Siren.

1088
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,590
Listen.

1089
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,380
It's really the Siren.

1090
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,510
The Siren is coming!

1091
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,930
The Siren is coming!

1092
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,080
Siren!

1093
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,160
The Siren is coming!

1094
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,070
What should we do?

1095
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,110
The Siren is here.

1096
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:40,810
Hurry!

1097
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,650
Hide inside.

1098
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,780
Hide!

1099
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,460
Run!

1100
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,000
Whose hand is this?

1101
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,110
It turns out the rumor about the Siren

1102
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:50,780
is true.

1103
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,460
Don't open your eyes.

1104
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,040
It is said that only by closing your eyes

1105
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,970
you can survive.

1106
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,200
Those who open their eyes

1107
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,230
will die.

1108
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,880
It's weird.

1109
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,950
Why do I feel so familiar

1110
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:19,950
with this person?

1111
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,770
Stop fighting.

1112
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,820
Talk nicely and stop fighting.

1113
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,720
Stop fighting!
