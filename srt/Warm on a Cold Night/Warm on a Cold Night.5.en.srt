4
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,780
Han Zheng

5
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,580
is really quite impressive.

6
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,400
Look.

7
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,539
I have no experience in bone identification.

8
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,200
But he could tell from one look

9
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,120
that the body

10
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,900
belonged to someone in his prime,

11
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,970
about the same age as

12
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,810
Lord Zhang.

13
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,710
But the old wounds and wear and tear

14
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,390
on his knee

15
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,310
have existed for 40 to 50 years.

16
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,880
However, Lord Zhang

17
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,440
was only 39 years old.

18
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,910
What does this mean?

19
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,590
It means that this body

20
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,350
belonged to a Qi.

21
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,780
What is going on here?

22
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,419
Why is there another Qi?

23
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,979
Besides,

24
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,330
if we deduce his time of death,

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,940
this Qi

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,170
was the first to die.

27
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,670
But his body was disposed of last.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,450
So, according to my analysis,

29
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,990
the identity of this Qi

30
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,440
should be the key to solving the case.

31
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,190
Don't worry.

32
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,190
I'll go look into

33
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,160
the records of Jiuxiao City's missing Qi

34
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,310
right away.

35
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,079
Hu, take it easy.

36
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,020
I've looked into it already.

37
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,820
There were no matching results.

38
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,540
Also, Han Zheng told me that

39
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,150
he will follow this lead.

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,190
All I need to do is

41
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,920
meet him at his house tomorrow.

42
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,730
At his house?

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,750
You told me that he has no feelings for you.

44
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,900
Isn't he interested in you?

45
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,370
What?

46
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,150
How is that possible?

47
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,210
Since he has a lead,

48
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:53,730
he should tell you

49
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,420
tonight.

50
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,820
Why would he ask you to go to his house tomorrow?

51
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,950
He is obviously using the lead as bait.

52
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,190
You're like a fish on his hook,

53
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,900
made to go on dates with him every day.

54
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,310
He...

55
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,810
Godfather.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,820
You are thinking too much into it.

57
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,870
I would love to be around him every day

58
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,060
so I can get a bit more

59
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,030
health and longevity.

60
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,510
You silly girl.

61
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,070
Let me tell you.

62
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,150
I'm not thinking too much into it.

63
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,260
L-Listen to me.

64
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,510
Stop talking.

65
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,410
I feel sleepy, Godfather.

66
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,060
I'm not overthinking.

67
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,700
I'm going to bed.

68
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,780
-You should go to bed too. -He likes you.

69
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,440
Go to sleep.

70
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,240
You're covering it up!

71
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,300
He definitely have feelings for you!

72
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,520
I don't care!

73
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,540
I'm going with you tomorrow!

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,600
I can't let

75
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,890
my innocent daughter

76
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,620
run away with some uncouth boy.

77
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,750
I'm definitely going with you!

78
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,329
There's something

79
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,860
I need you to do right now.

80
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,840
Isn't it too soon to assign me to a mission?

81
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,700
I need you to look into something.

82
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,980
The identity of the headless corpse is unknown.

83
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,410
However, I found some herb residue

84
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,870
in the old wound on his leg.

85
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,610
It's exactly

86
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,020
the same as the kind

87
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,420
you applied on me.

88
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,579
So, you want me to investigate

89
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,330
the identity of this headless corpse?

90
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,060
What an important assignment.

91
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,880
Don't think too much into it.

92
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,320
You only have to find out

93
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,970
where those herbs came from.

94
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,150
What about the identity of the deceased?

95
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,190
I will personally investigate it

96
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,250
along with the silly girl, of course.

97
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,140
I can't leave this

98
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,680
to the two of you.

99
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,230
I'll go right away.

100
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,840
I almost forgot about you.

Come here.

102

You must do your best.

104
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,210
Do not let me down.

105
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,020
Do you hear me?

106
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,150
How dare you touch me!

107
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,830
Come and have a look!

108
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,330
Come and have a look.

Just follow me.

What does it say?

120
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,400
None. Of. Your. Business.

121
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,290
None. Of. Your...

122
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,640
None of your business!

123
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,400
I've long known that

124
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,159
you Qi

125
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,380
have your own market.

126
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,090
I didn't expect it to be here.

127
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,240
But it makes sense.

128
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,100
It's cold underground. It's suitable for you guys.

129
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,100
To think that you, an officer of the Inspection Bureau,

130
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,300
have a blind spot in your jurisdiction.

131
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,670
How ignorant of you.

132
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,060
Who would come to

133
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,750
a place full of Qi people for no reason?

134
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,810

First-grade deer hide from Shuobei.

It's warm and lightweight.

When you put it on,

141
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,530
you'll feel the passion of the Qi.

142
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Passion?

143
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,370
That's not right.

144
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,770
Why didn't I feel anything when I touched him?

145
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,960
Let me try touching someone else.

146
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,320
I really don't feel anything.

147
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,290
Hello.

148
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,220
-She's even targeting a child. -What are you looking at?

149
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,620
I'm looking at this ball.

150
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,260
Why can't I feel it from anyone

151
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,390
other than Han Zheng?

152
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,390
And she says

153
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,750
she doesn't like the Qi.

154
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,250
Young Master Han.

155
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:00,980
You...

156
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,020
Can you please hold out your hand

157
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,060
and let me touch it?

158
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,540
Listen.

159
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,050
I have mysophobia.

160
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,700
You've touched other people,

161
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,460
so don't even think about touching me.

162
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,670
I just want to know

163
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,020
why it only works with you

164
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,150
and not anyone else.

165
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,230
I'm warning you.

166
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,360
The people here

167
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,820
hate Qian people.

168
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,390
After we go inside,

169
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,590
keep to yourself.

170
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,880
If the people inside

171
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,410
want to cook you and eat you,

172
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,860
I couldn't care less.

173
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,860
Are you trying to scare me again?

174
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,260
Jade, iron, and various gems.

175
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,720
We have it all. Take a look.

176
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,430
Wait for me.

177
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,040
It doesn't look like

178
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,310
you're seeking treatment.

179
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,930
One tael for asking about your fortune.

180
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,460
Asking about anything else

181
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,710
will cost ten taels.

182
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,910
What if I'm asking about someone you've treated?

183
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,630
As a rule,

184
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,550
I don't talk about my living patients.

185
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,260
As for the dead, that'll be 100 taels.

186
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,660
Also,

187
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,950
I can choose not to answer.

188
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,630
Male,

189
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,620
Qi, around 70 years old.

190
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,080
You've set his leg bone three times over the past ten years.

191
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,140
The latest was only three months ago.

192
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,700
You used your own bone nails

193
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,900
and herbal ointment.

194
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,390
He should have come a month ago

195
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,039
for a dressing change,

196
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,720
but didn't.

197
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,510
He refused to talk about anything

198
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,970
other than his treatment.

199
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,710
People who are so reserved

200
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,640
and only have injuries from combat

201
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,270
are usually fugitive

202
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,230
bounty hunters.

203
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:58,940
What else?

204
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,840
I don't know anything

205
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,350
except for his name.

206
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,320
I think his name is

207
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,340
Zhamuke.

208
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,560
Zhamuke?

209
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,640
According to him,

210
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,560
this Zhamuke

211
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,920
was also a fugitive.

212
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,240
I'm afraid he was one of the Qi people

213
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,820
who don't have their customs clearance papers

214
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,380
and

215
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,460
are undocumented.

216
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,020
At least we've proven that

217
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,480
this last headless corpse

218
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,870
was not a Qian official,

219
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,230
but a Qi.

220
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,340
If that's the case,

221
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,300
shouldn't the Inspection Bureau

222
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,340
start looking for clues again

223
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,800
to hunt down the murderer?

224
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,780
Don't keep trying to pin it on

225
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,700
us Qi people.

226
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,010
Firstly,

227
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,540
you should withdraw

228
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,510
those checkpoints

229
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,770
targetting Qi people.

230
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,010
As soon as I get back to the Inspection Bureau,

231
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,820
I'll be sure to report on our new findings.

232
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,370
However, just because this headless body

233
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,840
wasn't Lord Zhang's,

234
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,600
we cannot conclude that

235
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,610
the murderer of the Nursery Rhyme Case

236
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,780
was not a Qi.

237
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,450
But it's indeed strange.

238
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,590
That Zhamuke

239
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,180
sounds like he was

240
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,580
a battle-hardened Qi.

241
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,820
How difficult would it be to kill him?

242
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,010
Why would the murderer choose to kill him

243
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,810
as a replacement for Lord Zhang?

244
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,210
Where is

245
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,360
the real Lord Zhang?

246
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,700
Is he dead or alive?

247
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,640
You're right.

248
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,220
So you need to give me the answer

249
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,280
within three days.

250
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,500
Aren't you going help me investigate the case?

251
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,160
It's your job, as an Inspector,

252
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,560
to investigate the case.

253
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,490
Are you expecting me to help you

254
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,350
solve the case?

255
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,510
But...

256
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,420
But aren't we

257
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,550
partners now?

258
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,340
Are you really not going to help me?

259
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,600
What's wrong with you?

260
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,010
Oh my goodness.

261
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,100
Why are there so many snakes?

262
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,760
Who will help me catch snakes?

263
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,390
I'll do it!

264
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,230
Hurry up!

265
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,400
Faster!

266
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,550
Catch them all!

267
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,660
Don't leave!

268
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,580
Don't leave!

269
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,310
Don't leave!

270
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,780
Get down.

271
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,090
Young Master Han.

272
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,640
I haven't gotten today's portion of

273
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,780
health replenishment yet.

274
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,740
Besides,

275
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,960
I was scared by those snakes.

276
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,670
I'm feeling a little dizzy

277
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,430
and weak now.

278
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,210
I don't have any strength left.

279
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,220
Then, tell me about the case.

280
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,310
Let's talk outside, okay?

281
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,240
It's so dark here.

282
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,620
It's scary. Come on.

283
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,200
According to the coroner,

284
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,940
the time of death of the four corpses

285
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,700
from the Nursery Rhyme Case

286
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,450
was only a day before the corpses were disposed of.

287
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,730
If that's the case,

288
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,190
the murderer

289
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,800
didn't deliberately

290
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,020
keep them around to kill them.

291
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,510
It was...

292
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,300
If you keep stalling,

293
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,390
I'll throw you off.

294
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,330
I'm a patient.

295
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,150
And I've never seen it before.

296
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,920
By the way, Young Master Han,

297
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,780
I have a question

298
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,750
for you.

299
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,380
-Go ahead. -Are you rich?

300
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,860
I find that your everyday food and clothing

301
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,610
are really good.

302
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,570
I've heard that Qi people

303
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,270
who come to Qian for the fur trade

304
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:00,980
are all very rich.

305
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,060
Are you just like them?

306
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,700
Does it mean our funds for future investigations

307
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,050
have been secured?

308
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,900
Then everything will be—

309
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,550
It hurts so much!

310
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,790
My butt!

311
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:11,890
Nonsense!

312
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,420
Strange disease?

313
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,740
Looks like I need to reconsider

314
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
your claim again.

315
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,100
Don't leave me here, Young Master Han.

316
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Young Master Han!

317
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,770
I'm really out of strength!

318
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,180
Being around a Qi is really like being around a tiger.

319
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,030
It's so hard for me.

320
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,480
Herbs from Qi.

321
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,500
Young lady, you seem badly hurt.

322
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,220
Here are some herbs for you.

323
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:54,730
[He'an Hall]

324
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,390
What time is it now?

325
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,150
Why isn't she back yet?

326
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,210
-Godfather. -Come on.

327
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,140
Why have you come out?

328
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,140
Lass.

329
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,370
What time is it already?

330
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,110
Your mother will definitely scold you.

331
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,440
I'll be implicated too.

332
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,490
Don't worry.

333
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,410
I'm the best at coaxing my mother.

334
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,140
Look at this.

335
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,940
You're quite bright.

336
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,330
What is this?

337
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,190
Let me tell you.

338
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:14,950
I found this

339
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:15,850
at an underground market

340
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,460
run by the Qi.

341
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,460
What a coincidence!

342
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,100
I accidentally

343
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,920
found it.

344
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,690
How is it? Aren't I clever?

345
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,460
I told you

346
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,380
I wanted to go with you.

347
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,090
-It’s okay. I know what I'm doing. -You left me behind

348
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,020
-and went by yourself in secret. -By the way,

349
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,060
we also found...

350
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,690
Mother.

351
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,140
What's wrong with you two?

352
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,070
I closed shop at 3:00 p.m.

353
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,180
just to prepare this meal.

354
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,420
I waited for you guys to come back.

355
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,100
You've only just come back

356
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,020
when the dishes have already gone cold?

357
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,480
Well...

358
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,170
Su Jiu'er.

359
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,900
Is dinner included now

360
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,400
at the Inspection Bureau?

361
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,160
Mother.

362
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,530
Don't be angry.

363
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,070
Look.

364
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,470
Look what I've brought you.

365
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,130
She prepared it for you!

366
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,660
Not bad, you guys still remember

367
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,790
what day it is today.

368
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,120
-Of course we remember. -Of course.

369
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,310
Pour some wine.

370
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,070
Here, Su.

371
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,480
This is for you.

372
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,890
[Memorial Tablet of a Loving Father, Su Kuai]

373
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,760
Su,

374
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,550
if you're watching over us,

375
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,820
please come back tonight

376
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,380
and take a look at your daughter.

377
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,180
She's getting

378
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,270
harder and harder to discipline.

379
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,470
She comes back later every day.

380
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,850
Don't you think

381
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,150
she is just like you?

382
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,270
She only thinks about solving cases,

383
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,670
and not about her safety.

384
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,500
No, Mother.

385
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:26,800
I...

386
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,900
Calm down.

387
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,570
Eat more.

388
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,310
Father.

389
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,990
If you are watching over us,

390
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,140
please go to my mother

391
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,160
and tell her

392
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,390
your daughter cherishes her life.

393
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,510
She doesn't wish for good fortune,

394
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,550
she only wishes for longevity.

395
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,410
That's enough.

396
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,530
Go and placate your mother.

397
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,860
-Okay. -Go placate her.

398
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,000
-Mother. -Su.

399
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,430
Please watch over your daughter.

400
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,860
Make sure she eats well and sleeps well,

401
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,460
and doesn't run into danger.

402
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:51,740
Try this. Try this.

403
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,220
Try this.

404
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,940
Come on.

405
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,330
Come on.

406
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,550
No more talking!

407
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,780
Jiu'er.

408
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:57,900
Tell me then.

409
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,670
Where did you get the nine-tailed herb

410
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,980
that can only be found in the state of Qi?

411
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,220
I'll drink by myself.

412
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,310
It was in a remote market.

413
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,010
I found it by chance.

414
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,230
I've been to every single market in Jiuxiao City,

415
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,680
big or small.

416
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,040
Where is this remote market

417
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,320
you're talking about?

418
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,100
Hu.

419
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,270
What's the name of that alley?

420
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,190
It's...

421
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,680
-It's called... -It's...

422
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,390
Cotton Alley, right?

423
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,610
Yes, Mother.

424
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,460
Cotton Alley.

425
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,070
But the vendor who sells herbs

426
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,510
pushes a small cart around.

427
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,530
It doesn't mean

428
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,700
he's always at the same place.

429
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,560
Have some meat.

430
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,920
Thank you, Hu.

431
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,920
Su,

432
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,280
you know

433
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,070
your daughter

434
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,300
is full of lies.

435
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,830
How about you tell me the truth?

436
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,020
You never lie to me.

437
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,460
Jiu'er's mother.

438
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:02,820
I...

439
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,750
We really didn't go anywhere.

440
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,950
We just went to

441
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,420
the Qi's underground market.

442
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,160
Why did you...

443
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,810
What?

444
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,780
You guys even went on the Qi's turf!

445
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,900
Why did you go there?

446
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,830
To work on a case?

447
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,360
What case

448
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,180
needs the two of you to work on it?

449
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,760
Could it be

450
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,620
the infamous Nursery Rhyme Case?

451
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,460
No, no, no.

452
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,980
Mother, listen to me.

453
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,230
Sit down first.

454
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,790
Sit down.

455
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,330
We're having dinner now.

456
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,850
Why are you so agitated?

457
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,380
Let me explain it slowly.

458
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,860
Hu and I

459
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,580
were temporarily deployed there.

460
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,180
Yes.

461
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,700
It's indeed related to the Nursery Rhyme Case.

462
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,110
But Commander Yan only asked us

463
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,060
to check out the neighborhood

464
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,140
and look for clues.

465
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,140
It wasn't dangerous.

466
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,340
It wasn't dangerous.

467
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:43,840
Really.

468
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,100
Those were all

469
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,510
the cowardly kind of Qi.

470
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,880
Many of my good friends

471
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,870
were among them.

472
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,100
It was just like

473
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,100
taking a stroll around our neighborhood.

474
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,150
That's all.

475
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,180
Really?

476
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,490
-Yes. -Of course.

477
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,200
Fine.

478
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Let’s eat.

479
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,820
-Come on. -Let’s eat.

480
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,660
Have some meat.

481
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,390
Eat while the food's still hot.

482
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,119
You too.

483
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,960
By the way, Mother.

484
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,630
As the Great Physician Qin

485
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,650
who has been everywhere,

486
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,460
have you heard of

487
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,150
a Qi called Zhamuke?

488
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,700
What an ordinary name!

489
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,770
Even if I've heard it before, I would have forgotten.

490
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,220
Why are you talking about the case again?

491
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,880
Let's eat.

492
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,740
Okay, let's stop talking.

493
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,470
Let's drink.

494
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,339
Come on.

495
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,500
Make a toast to your father.

496
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,410
Here.

497
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,700
Here, Su.

498
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,670
Your Highness.

499
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,070
Although the name Zhamuke

500
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,930
is very common,

501
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,970
if you give me

502
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,940
this assignment,

503
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,570
I definitely won't

504
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,580
let you down.

505
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,240
How long will you take?

506
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,570
Maybe three to five days.

507
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:44,900
No.

508
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,020
It's too long.

509
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,270
Give me an answer

510
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,080
within a day.

511
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,620
Your Highness.

512
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,030
We are not in Shuobei.

513
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,320
Our means are limited.

514
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,270
I only have

515
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,020
my own nose

516
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,280
and mouth to work with.

517
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,440
Your Highness.

518
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,500
Isn't Muyan the only person

519
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,900
you're concerned about?

520
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:01,700
Why are you paying attention to

521
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,030
the Nursery Rhyme Case?

522
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,960
Your Highness.

523
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,830
Are you trying to

524
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,350
help the girl keep her job?

525
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:09,780
Keha.

526
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,580
Wait.

527
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,920
Who told you

528
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,060
I want to help her?

529
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,180
It seems this case

530
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,310
has nothing to do

531
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,390
with Mu Yan.

532
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,490
If he just wanted to

533
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,210
worsen the relationship between the two races,

534
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,500
the murderer could have

535
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,040
killed any four Qian people

536
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,740
before composing the nursery rhyme,

537
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,330
and he would have achieved his goal.

538
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,260
But the murderer

539
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,840
chose four Qian from the Pro-Qi faction.

540
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,520
Why is that?

541
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,350
Besides,

542
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,140
if the murderer wanted to frame the Qi,

543
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,870
anyone could be the scapegoat.

544
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,420
Instead, he pretended to be Mu Yan.

545
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,010
This case

546
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,120
is more complicated than I thought.

547
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,380
But the inner workings

548
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,020
can only be uncovered

549
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,790
by solving the case.

550
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:49,990
Yes.

551
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,390
You're right.

552
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,290
Bring me

553
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,220
some more of Qian's currency.

554
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,030
Your Highness.

555
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,220
Why is there only this much left?

556
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,620
Right.

557
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,330
When we came to Qian,

558
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,380
we spent on the best clothing, food,

559
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,520
accomodations, and daily necessities.

560
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,550
Whether the leads were useful or not,

561
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,290
we had to trade gold bars for them.

562
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,690
T- This is all we have now.

563
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,180
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

564
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,240
Hu.

565
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,410
Before I came home,

566
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,350
I went to the Inspection Bureau.

567
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,860
The name Zhamuke

568
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,480
is indeed not in our records.

569
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,840
To find any clues related to him

570
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,550
with this name alone

571
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,740
will be as difficult as

572
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,330
looking for a needle in a haystack.

573
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:35,790
Jiu'er,

574
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,770
stop thinking about these things.

575
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,420
You've tried your best.

576
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,300
I know that.

577
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,700
If we really can't find the murderer,

578
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,810
there is nothing we can do

579
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,810
about being kicked out of

580
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,330
the Inspection Bureau.

581
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,210
But remember one thing.

582
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,680
No matter the time,

583
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,010
the place,

584
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
or the situation,

585
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,100
protecting yourself must always come first.

586
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,830
Understand?

587
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,750
If my father were here,

588
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,620
this case

589
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,260
would long have been solved.

590
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,550
Why talk about that?

591
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,580
If your father were still alive,

592
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,730
there would be no Commander Yan or Commander Kuan.

593
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,930
That's all bullshit.

594
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,980
There'll only be Commander Su.

595
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,440
How great would that be!

596
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,310
And you,

597
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,150
Lass,

598
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,780
would be a normal young lady,

599
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,580
who doesn't go outside

600
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,640
of the house at all.

601
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,740
You would play the zither, embroider,

602
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,500
and write calligraphy at home.

603
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,760
How nice would that be?

604
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,570
Hu.

605
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,560
I'm not that kind of person.

606
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,850
What kind of person do you want to be?

607
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,750
Actually,

608
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,450
I've always wanted to be

609
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,000
like my father.

610
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,260
Well,

611
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,900
although

612
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,160
you are very weak,

613
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,310
you

614
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,060
are full of crafty ideas.

615
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,710
Just like your father!

616
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,720
Since I was young,

617
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,980
my father was always away.

618
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,750
But every time he came back,

619
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,620
he told me about

620
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,040
many interesting cases.

621
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,130
He had been to many places

622
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,720
and helped many people.

623
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,900
Although

624
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,110
he didn't have much time

625
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,850
to spend with my mother and I,

626
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,970
in my heart,

627
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,580
he was still the best.

628
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,140
I was really proud of him.

629
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,100
So,

630
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,430
I hoped

631
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,520
to grow up quickly,

632
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,470
so that I could follow him

633
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,510
and broaden my horizons

634
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,570
together with him.

635
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,650
But who knew,

636
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,090
Father died

637
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,390
and I fell sick.

638
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,200
My mother

639
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,290
kept crying and telling me,

640
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,710
"You can't die young

641
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
like your father.

642
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
All you need to do is

643
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,150
stay by my side.

644
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,550
Don't go anywhere."

645
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,010
Stop thinking about that.

646
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,040
Life

647
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,870
is full of all sorts of

648
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,730
possibilities.

649
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,770
Maybe one day,

650
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,800
you'll chance upon a famous doctor

651
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,930
or a miraculous event,

652
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:55,800
and your illness

653
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,530
will be gone in a blink of an eye.

654
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,730
When that time comes,

655
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,860
don't give your old partner, me,

656
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,920
the cold shoulder.

657
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,390
You must bring me

658
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,350
wherever you go.

659
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,340
Of course.

660
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,110
Hu.

661
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,390
I miss my father so much.

662
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,010
If you keep staring at it,

663
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,470
your eyes will hurt.

664
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,510
Mother.

665
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,480
Is Father still here?

666
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,630
When he left, he promised me

667
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,980
he would be back in 30 days.

668
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,740
But it's been 37 days.

669
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,990
Why didn't he keep his promise?

670
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,840
Your father

671
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:40,920
must have met

672
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,050
someone in trouble,

673
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,880
so he went to help them.

674
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,510
If that's the case,

675
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,800
I'll forgive him.

676
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,000
Good girl.

677
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,200
Commander Su is back.

678
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,240
Long time no see.

679
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,770
Visit me when you have time.

680
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,660
Father.

681
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,790
My dear Jiu'er.

682
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,920
Let me take a good look at you.

683
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,860
Do you miss me?

684
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,090
Yes.

685
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,520
My love.

686
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,250
You jerk!

687
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,700
You still remember you have to come back?

688
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,500
This is my home.

689
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Can't I come back?

690
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,620
Father is tired.

691
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,350
I'll go fetch water for Father.

692
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,480
Be careful.

693
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,430
Don't fall down.

694
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:15,650
This girl.

695
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,410
Why is your face so pale?

696
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,640
Is it?

697
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,060
Are you not feeling well?

698
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,740
I'm fine.

699
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,880
Let me take your pulse.

700
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:34,780
Why is your pulse

701
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,880
so strange?

702
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,130
You're thinking too much.

703
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,780
I'm just tired.

704
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,090
Besides, I've been out for so long.

705
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,020
I haven't been eating or sleeping well.

706
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,420
And...

707
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,940
And I miss you.

708
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,830
You miss me?

709
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,000
It's a good thing you're back,

710
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,330
or I would have remarried!

711
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,440
I brought you a gift

712
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,950
as an apology.

713
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:56,160
Look.

714
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,970
The nine-tailed herb that can cure any poison.

715
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,690
I have only seen it in books.

716
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,090
Did you find it in the state of Qi?

717
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,340
The stems

718
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,950
are even bigger than the books described.

719
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,300
These patterns

720
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,940
are even more complex than the books described.

721
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,740
This is great.

722
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,400
She...

723
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,340
She's asleep?

724
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,030
Yes.

725
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,130
She's too tired.

726
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,370
Did you really just check out the neighborhood,

727
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,940
and not get involved in any trouble?

728
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,630
Yes.

729
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,380
Our mission is

730
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,990
to find out the identity

731
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,780
of Zhamuke.

732
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,840
That's good.

733
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,340
Jiu'er is full of crafty ideas

734
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,300
and curiosity.

735
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,620
I'm afraid

736
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,090
she'll be like her father.

737
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,330
The more troublesome a situation is,

738
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,990
the more she'll want to get involved.

739
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,550
You

740
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,060
should keep an eye on her.

741
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,530
I haven't finished yet!

742
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,930
Come on.

743
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,580
Again?

744
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,570
Don't you need the money?

745
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,480
Zhamuke?

746
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,300
I actually think

747
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,960
I've heard this name before.

748
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,890
Get up.

749
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,960
Or else you might lose your job.

750
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,820
Didn't you tell me to prioritize my safety?

751
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,750
Why are you concerned about my job

752
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,010
all of a sudden?

753
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,560
If it were just you,

754
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,590
it would be fine to lose the job.

755
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,420
But your godfather is getting on in years.

756
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,270
He has always been taking care of us.

757
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,070
Aren't you going to help him out?

758
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:09,920
Get up.

759
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:10,930
Here.

760
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,120
Take this.

761
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,550
Okay.

762
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,970
I'll give it to him later.

763
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,540
Are you really just investigating

764
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,210
the man named Zhamuke?

765
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,260
I thought about it

766
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,230
last night.

767
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,750
I think

768
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,000
I have heard this name before.

769
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,500
You've heard it before?

770
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,900
-You scared me. -Mother, have you really heard it before?

771
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,550
Who is he?

772
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,180
Where did you hear this name?

773
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,390
Don't be happy too soon.

774
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,190
I don't know if it will be of use.

775
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,770
It might sound a little strange.

776
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,620
I'll sing for you.

777
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,010
Sing.

778
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,750
♫How regrettable it is♫

779
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:06,220
♫How regrettable it is that our love has been wasted♫

780
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:10,620
♫How hateful, that unfaithful and heartless man♫

Is anyone there?

787
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,620
Is anyone there?

788
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,350
Is anyone there?

789
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,000
Stop shouting.

790
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,450
There's no one inside.

791
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,390
That's strange.

792
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,040
Where is

793
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,130
the opera crew?

794
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,140
You treated a line of lyrics

795
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,400
as a clue,

796
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,790
and dragged me out on such a hot day .

797
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,250
Do you think I'm very idle?

798
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,010
Don't go.

799
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,340
I don't have time anyway.

800
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,560
Besides,

801
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,630
I can't

802
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,810
miss any clues

803
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,020
during an investigation.

804
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,080
Are you expecting me

805
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,340
to solve the whole case

806
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,270
before reporting to you?

807
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:08,930
What else?

808
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,990
Did I find myself a partner

809
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,570
or a boss?

810
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,620
Dog?

811
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,520
Brother Han.

812
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,530
I have an idea.

813
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,690
I remember you have a good nose.

814
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,300
You can use your nose

815
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,590
to take a whiff.

816
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,260
The scent of their makeup

817
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,090
is very strong.

818
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,360
You should be able to smell it.

819
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:35,820
Right?

820
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,430
What's wrong?

821
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,800
I'm thinking

822
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,790
if steamed, braised, or raw will be better.

823
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,860
What for?

824
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,720
Eating you.

825
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,620
I...

826
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,540
It was just a suggestion.

827
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,710
If you don't like it,

828
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,860
we can talk it over.

829
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,730
Why are you always so fierce?

Why do you keep looking at me?

842
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,290
Here, Miss.

Young Master!

847
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,870
Are you helping her up

848
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,570
or trying to

849
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,860
take advantage of her?

Please excuse me.

851
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,490
This lady looks familiar.

852
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,000
It made me recall some past memories.

853
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
But Young Master,

854
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,220
you saw your young lady fall down.

855
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,480
Why didn't you help her up?

856
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:06,940
Hold it.

857
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:07,860
First,

858

she is not my young lady.

860
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,220

00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,180
Young Master, here’s the thing.

873
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,810
We need to find someone from the opera troupe

874
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,140
to ask about something.

875
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,660
Do you know

876
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,990
where they usually go?

877
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,500
Go to the Eastern Garden.

878
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
They rehearse there during the day.

879
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,620
Thank you, Young Master.

880
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,220
So cute.

881
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,570
Let's go.

882
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,850
I finally found her.

883
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,470
You know that

884
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,620
time is running out,

885
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,300
yet you still

886
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,500
flirted with that man.

887
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,630
I was just asking him

888
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,990
about the opera troupe.

889
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,930
That was an official matter.

890
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,500
Do you often

891
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,740
use that as an excuse

892
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,600
to get close to men?

893
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,740
I'm curious then.

894
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,870
Have I been close to anyone

895
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,100
other than him?

896
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,880
Could it be..

897
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,440
You thought that day...

898
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,990
You are about to be in dire straits,

899
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,510
but you still have time

900
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,440
to make fun of me.

901
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,850
Prove yourself to me.

902
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,290
Who is it?

903
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,070
Did Hechun Hall send you

904
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:41,910
to steal

905
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,020
our new script?

906
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,140
I am Inspector Su Jiu'er

907
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,190
from the Inspection Bureau.

908
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,900
I was ordered to investigate a murder case.

909
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,190
I want to ask

910
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,780
if there is a script

911
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,680
in which there is

912
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,010
a Qi man called Zhamuke.

913
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,050
Nonsense!

914
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,760
How could a murder case

915
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,020
be related to a script?

916
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,760
You said you are an Inspector.

917
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,350
Where is your badge?

918
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,020
I've lost it.

919
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,270
The new one is underway.

920
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,360
Scram!

921
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,660
You really are useful.

922
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:17,970
Please spare my life.

923
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,170
Please spare my life.

924
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,230
That's amazing.

925
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,080
I found it.

926
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,140
I found it.

927
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,540
Yes, I almost forgot.

928
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,800
He can't read the Qian script.

929
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,580
He's illiterate here.

930
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,580
You must have read this script.

931
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,270
Tell me

932
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,860
what kind of person

933
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,180
Zhamuke is.

934
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,590
The Zhamuke in this script

935
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,000
is a lecher

936
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,470
who abducted a Qian man's wife.

937
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,930
The Qi have long lifespans

938
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,500
and they spend their whole lives with only one partner.

939
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,650
How could he set his eyes on

940
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,650
a Qian woman who wouldn't live long?

941
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,150
Abducting her, at that.

942
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,270
What a shameless and trashy story.

943
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,160
I agree.

944
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,470
I also told

945
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,650
the master who wrote this script

946
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,730
that it doesn't make sense at all,

947
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,660
but he insisted.

948
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,290
He even killed this Qi

949
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,860
in the script.

950
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,300
How did he die?

951
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,860
Someone cut his head off.

952
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,340
He died as a dismembered corpse.

953
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,890
Who is that master?

954
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,950
Where is he now?

955
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,090
These masters who write scripts

956
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,650
all have different identities.

957
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,310
He's the weirdest of them all.

958
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,500
He calls himself "Secret Guest."

959
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,890
He dresses like

960
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,770
a nobleman,

961
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,640
but

962
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,770
he only wants us to call him "Master."

963
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,540
By the way,

964
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,050
he bought a room

965
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,640
in the Eastern Garden.

966
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,620
He said he wanted it as a study.

967
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,840
But he wouldn't let anyone in.

968
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,950
As for where he is now,

969
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,280
I don't know either.

970
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,730
Where is this study?

971
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,810
[Secret]

972
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,050
This is it.

973
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,210
Do you have the key?

974
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,090
No.

975
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,500
Experienced Inspectors in opera scripts

976
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,960
all use this to pick locks.

977
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,340
I don't know if it works.

978
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,520
Please take your time.

979
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,650
I'll keep a lookout.

980
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,179
Why did you scare him?

981
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,350
I can take my time to find clues.

982
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,179
But how much time do you have

983
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,179
to deal with them?

984
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,449
You mean...

985
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,469
You frightened him because of me?

986
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,380
Cut the crap.

987
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,750
Come here and have a look.

988
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,630
This house may look

989
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:50,590
quite ordinary,

990
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,659
but there's something wrong with it

991
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,920
that I can't pinpoint.

992
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,050
Be more efficient. What's wrong with it?

993
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,110
Look at this table.

994
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,180
The items on both sides

995
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,610
are fully symmetrical.

996
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,920
Not only here,

997
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,300
but the other decorations in this room

998
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,560
are also symmetrical.

999
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,950
The characters on it

1000
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,260
are exactly the same size.

1001
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,190
There's not a single discrepancy.

1002
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,520
This person is so restrained and tidy,

1003
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,840
but all four corpses

1004
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,440
were in disarray.

1005
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,350
I feel that this Secret Guest

1006
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,310
wasn't the murderer.

1007
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,330
Idiot.

1008
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
Couldn't he have had an accomplice?

1009
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,340
What's wrong?

1010
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,890
There's a handprint.

1011
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,090
I knew it.

1012
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,350
If my five senses were as sharp as yours,

1013
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,730
I could solve any case.

1014
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,160
Guys,

1015
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,010
I just saw the Secret Guest come back

1016
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,930
to the Eastern Garden.

1017
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:20,860
You should hide.

1018
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,710
I'm leaving.

1019
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,020
I...

1020
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,780
I'll stall him outside.

1021
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,800
You look for clues here.

1022
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,360
Hurry up.

1023
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,500
Miss.

1024
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,550
Why are you here?

1025
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,980
I...

1026
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,450
Why are you here?

1027
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,830
It's you...

1028
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:06,700
Idiot.

1029
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,180
Couldn't he have had an accomplice?

1030
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,890
I didn't expect

1031
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,610
to see you here.

1032
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,820
When you asked me

1033
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,100
where the Western Chamber's opera troupe

1034
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,860
went,

1035
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,170
I wondered

1036
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,030
if I would see you here.

1037
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,210
Young Master.

1038
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,680
Why would you want to see me again?

1039
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,390
Our master loves tidiness.

1040
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,440
He can't tolerate any dirt.

1041
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,070
Who's Jiu'er?

1042
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,450
Miss, is your name Jiu'er?

1043
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,100
How did it know my name?

1044
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,500
It knows a lot.

1045
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,380
Master.

1046
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,670
Qiuqiu is tired.

1047
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,980
I'll take him to rest.

1048
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,220
Miss.

1049
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,270
Is your name really Jiu'er?

1050
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,170
This...

1051
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,840
Was it really Qiuqiu

1052
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,690
who told you?

1053
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,480
It's so strange.

1054
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,580
But he looks so innocent

1055
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,670
and he doesn't seem to be lying.

1056
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:42,900
Miss.

1057
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,590
I saw you standing in front of my door.

1058
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,250
Are you here

1059
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,300
to see me?

1060
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,850
I am.

1061
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:12,020
♫How regrettable it is that our love has been wasted♫

1062
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:20,420
♫How hateful, that unfaithful and heartless man♫

1063
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:21,780
You...

1064
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,100
Are you really the Secret Guest?

1065
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:26,730
Yes.

1066
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,460
Did you...

1067
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:29,980
Did you come here

1068
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,780
just for this?

1069
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:31,870
Of course.

1070
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,130
I'm your fan.

1071
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,000
I had been wondering all along

1072
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,710
what kind of

1073
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,990
romantic

1074
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,660
and worldly

1075
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,050
scriptwriter

1076
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,670
could have written

1077
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,660
such a touching story.

1078
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,660
I didn't expect

1079
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,640
him to be

1080
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,420
a handsome young man like you.

1081
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,000
Do you really think this script is touching?

1082
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,270
Do I look like I'm lying?

1083
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,010
I once imagined

1084
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,630
I would meet a bosom friend through opera.

1085
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,870
But I didn't expect it

1086
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,230
to be you again.

1087
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,680
Again?

1088
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,160
I'm Wen Jun.

1089
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,310
Miss Jiu'er.

1090
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,790
I need your help.

1091
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,580
Are you free?

1092
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,070
Go ahead.

1093
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,460
One of my operas is about to begin showing.

1094
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,590
I want your advice.

1095
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,810
Are you free tomorrow

1096
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,740
to look through the script with me?

1097
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,610
If he really is the murderer,

1098
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,650
is this a trap

1099
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,020
to lure me in?

1100
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,820
I have something to do tomorrow.

1101
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,020
Let me think about it.

1102
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,420
It's okay. I'll show you the script.

1103
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,270
Young Master Wen Jun.

1104
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,470
Young Master Wen Jun.

1105
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,660
Are you going back into your room so soon?

1106
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,350
I'm getting you the script.

1107
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,550
Young Master Wen Jun.

1108
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,710
I just remembered.

1109
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,190
I'm free tomorrow.

1110
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,900
I can talk about the script with you.

1111
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,360
Really?

1112
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,920
Then it's a promise.

1113
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,760
Why is my lock...

1114
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,470
Why is my lock broken?

1115
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,610
What is it?

1116
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,050
The quality of this lock

1117
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,050
is bad.

1118
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,770
I'll introduce you to

1119
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,620
a good locksmith next time.

1120
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,380
The quality is very good,

1121
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,220
and doesn't spoil even after a long time.

1122
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:12,700
Really?

1123
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,520
Thank you.

1124
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,580
How about this?

1125
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,940
Let's meet at Deyue Restaurant tomorrow at noon.

1126
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,340
Let's talk while eating.

1127
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,230
De...

1128
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,000
Is it the Deyue Restaurant

1129
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,120
where the dishes are costly

1130
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,950
and the waiters

1131
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,880
outnumber the customers?

1132
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,010
Yes, that's the one.

1133
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,660
Young Master.

1134
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,270
You're too generous.

1135
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,500
If you

1136
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,410
don’t like it,

1137
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,710
-we can go to another one. -No.

1138
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,350
It's okay.

1139
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,070
No matter what happens,

1140
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,110
I'll see you tomorrow.

1141
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,730
See you tomorrow.

1142
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,240
Are you playing with your dog?

1143
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,050
I'm looking for you.

1144
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,680
Do you want me to shout loudly,

1145
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,380
"Han Zheng.

1146
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,960
Where are you?"

1147
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:08,660
Like that?

1148
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,160
Can you show me again

1149
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,930
how you

1150
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,090
jumped out from his room

1151
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,730
so quickly?

1152
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,580
You want to know?
