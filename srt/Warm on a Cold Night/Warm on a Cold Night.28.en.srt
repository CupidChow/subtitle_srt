4
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,180
Alright.

5
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,340
Stop arguing.

6
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,370
Your Highnesses,

7
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,440
why are you here

8
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,820
today?

9
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,090
I have something important

10
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,560
to talk to you about.

11
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:48,330
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,180
Jiu'er is busy with work today,

13
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,039
she's not free.

14
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,570
Let's go.

15
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:52,789
I...

16
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,020
-Your Highness. -Jiu'er.

17
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,070
I haven't changed yet.

18
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,690
Go inside and change.

19
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,150
Jiu'er.

20
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,380
Great, you haven't left yet.

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,660
Your Highness is here too?

22
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,180
Brother Tianyun.

23
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,830
What is it?

24
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,880
The Empress is holding a banquet

25
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,540
at the Imperial Garden today.

26
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,210
She sent someone to the Inspection Bureau

27
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,130
to ask you to go.

28
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,100
What does Her Majesty holding a banquet

29
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,280
have to do with me?

30
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,940
Her Majesty is hosting

31
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,020
several royal relatives

32
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,710
who are very interested

33
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,940
in the cases you handled.

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,530
That's why

35
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,329
she's asking you

36
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:20,730
to go and talk about them.

37
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,079
You mean Her Majesty

38
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,730
specially asked me to go?

39
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,110
Is it because I solved many strange cases,

40
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,500
and my reputation has spread

41
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,460
all the way

42
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,320
to the Empress?

43
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,100
Of course.

44
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,470
I'm going to the banquet today too.

45
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,620
Let's go together.

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,370
We solved many strange cases.

47
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,340
Since I'm your partner,

48
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,630
we should

49
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,610
talk about the cases together.

50
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,190
But Her Majesty didn't invite you.

51
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,150
It's not appropriate for you to go.

52
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,120
Your Highness.

53
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,820
Prince Jun obviously

54
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,730
came prepared.

55
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,560
We might lose this time.

56
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,460
Lose?

57
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,300
Impossible.

58
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,410
Is Her Majesty holding a family banquet

59
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,140
because she misses her family?

60
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,540
There is a reason

61
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,260
for this family banquet.

62
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,890
What is this reason?

63
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,300
Why is it making you sigh?

64
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,190
You two,

65
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,590
go get some oranges.

66
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,360
Brother Jun loves oranges.

67
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:24,880
Yes.

68
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,760
The reason is here.

69
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,440
Jiu'er.

70
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,520
You must save me later.

71
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,350
Greetings, Your Highness.

72
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,430
Brother Jun.

73
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,740
Please save me

74
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,160
later...

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,940
Brother Jun!

76
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,770
Brother Jun!

77
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,980
Brother Jun, did you miss me?

78
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,360
I've missed you so much.

79
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,940
Why don't you want to kiss me?

80
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,140
Heyin.

81
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,620
Mind your manners.

82
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,800
Why?

83
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,080
When we were young,

84
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,300
didn't we kiss each other all the time?

85
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,910
You were only eight years old.

86
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,910
You were still a little kid

87
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,510
back then.

88
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,690
Brother Jun.

89
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,240
It's been so long.

90
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,860
Why didn't you come to see me?

91
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,220
This is your—

92
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,100
If Aunty

93
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,530
didn't set up a banquet in advance,

94
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,260
I wouldn't be seeing you today.

95
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,100
This princess

96
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,850
doesn't need anyone to talk to.

97
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,080
She can talk to herself.

98
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,520
Also,

99
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,550
I've heard that you have been

100
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,510
going to the Inspection Bureau very often.

101
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,600
They are all brutish men

102
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,760
over there.

103
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,900
You can't go. It's dangerous.

104
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,490
Heyin.

105
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,670
Let me introduce you.

106
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,220
This is Sister Su Jiu'er,

107
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,750
a Senior Inspector from the Inspection Bureau.

108
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,680
Princess Heyin.

109
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,960
So you're the one.

110
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,380
I thought you would be more impressive.

111
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,470
Not only are you of lowly birth

112
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,100
and ordinary-looking,

113
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,630
you hang out with brutish men

114
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,440
all day long.

115
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,610
You're not like a girl

116
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,500
at all.

117
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:01,600
I...

118
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,180
Why not?

119
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:12,810
Heyin.

120
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,800
Mind your manners.

121
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,850
I really don't know

122
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,140
why Aunty is giving you the honor

123
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,870
of inviting you to the banquet.

124
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,660
Seriously...

125
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,060
She knows

126
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,330
I like Brother Jun.

127
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,370
Jiu'er.

128
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,660
Do you see how difficult she is?

129
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,080
Later, tell her that

130
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,250
I already have someone I like.

131
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,180
You like someone?

132
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,370
Who is it?

133
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,380
You.

134
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,300
Me?

135
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,500
Stop joking around.

136
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,620
Why are you two

137
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,650
standing so close to each other?

138
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,260
Get away.

139
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,780
I'm warning you.

140
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,980
You'd better stay away from Brother Jun.

141
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,110
Otherwise, I'll have it coming to you.

142
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,380
Princess Heyin.

143
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,260
Actually, His Highness...

144
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,390
Actually, His Highness...

145
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,480
already has someone he likes.

146
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,020
Who?

147
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,570
It's...

148
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,290
It's...

149
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,170
It's...

150
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,240
Han Zheng!

151
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:43,820
Yes.

152
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,150
It's him.

153
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:46,790
Brother Jun.

154
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,310
Is that the name of the person you like?

155
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,040
It's Han Zheng.

156
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,980
Are you Han Zheng?

157
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,230
Why are you calling my name?

158
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,620
You?

159
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,540
A man?

160
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:11,530
Heyin.

161
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,140
This is Prince Han of Qi

162
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,290
and General Chilan.

163
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,730
What are two Qi people

164
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,830
doing at

165
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,990
our family banquet?

166
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,600
Are you kidding me?

167
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,750
Why would Brother Jun like him?

168
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,750
What?

169
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,820
Thank you

170
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,250
for persuading Her Majesty

171
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,290
to allow Han Zheng and I

172
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,020
to attend your family banquet.

173
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,730
Actually, even if you didn't ask,

174
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,659
I would have

175
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,070
sent you an invitation.

176
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,590
Is it because of Prince Jun?

177
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:45,720
Why do you say that?

178
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,730
Prince Jun likes Jiu'er.

179
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,080
Everyone can see that.

180
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,530
But I think

181
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,110
from your standpoint,

182
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,870
you don't want them

183
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,780
to be together.

184
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,780
After all,

185
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,710
their statuses are too different.

186
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,430
I've heard that the Qian

187
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,140
attach great importance to family background.

188
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,470
You feel bad for your brother,

189
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,950
so you're unwilling to forcibly separate them.

190
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,910
Asking Han Zheng to come and intervene

191
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,900
is the best way.

192
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,890
You think so much about everything.

193
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,890
Isn't it tiring?

194
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,510
Am I wrong?

195
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,450
Today,

196
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,140
urgent couriers from the state of Nan

197
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,310
sent tribute crabs.

198
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,230
I'm sure you haven't had it before,

199
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,740
so I wanted you to try it.

200
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,500
That's all?

201
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,040
Also,

202
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,630
the two lakes have sent

203
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,890
fresh osmanthus wine.

204
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,620
It can neutralize the chilliness of the crabs.

205
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,480
I also wanted to share it with you.

206
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,630
So I've really overthought this.

207
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,620
I know

208
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,010
life isn't easy on you.

209
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,360
You need to balance, evaluate,

210
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,260
and consider many things.

211
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,310
But I still hope

212
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,090
you can be more relaxed

213
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,160
and more at ease.

214
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,240
Thank you.

215
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,600
Let's forget about

216
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,850
doubling the tribute

217
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,320
and releasing the two spies

218
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,920
then.

219
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,830
No way.

220
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,130
I've already sent an envoy

221
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,590
to Shuobei to pick them up.

222
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,030
But it has been proven that

223
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,350
Han Zheng hadn't killed anyone.

224
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,330
The terms we discussed previously

225
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,530
don't count anymore.

226
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,620
But it's true that

227
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,030
he harbored Prince Keyuncha.

228
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,900
I pulled some strings with

229
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,030
the Law Department.

230
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:36,890
Otherwise,

231
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,180
Han Zheng wouldn't have been let off so easily.

232
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,050
But he also solved

233
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,910
the Peony Case.

234
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,270
Those are two different things.

235
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,470
Don't conflate them.

236
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,900
These must be

237
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,840
vermilion-topped carp.

238
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,820
There's a small dot of red on their heads.

239
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,400
So cute.

240
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,380
We can do away with the doubled tribute.

241
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,500
But those two travelers

242
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
must be released.

243
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,590
Spies are spies.

244
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,620
Why are you calling them travelers?

245
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,720
What is this for?

246
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,340
General Chilan,

247
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,970
let's talk about releasing the travel—

248
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,300
releasing the spies.

249
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,420
Didn't you say

250
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,850
I should be more relaxed

251
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,520
and less calculative?

252
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,980
You haven't answered me.

253
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,710
What is this?

254
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,360
This is a Qian chess board.

255
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,300
Well,

256
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,960
will you teach me how to play?

257
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,310
Sure.

258
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,210
[Hall of Supreme Principle]

259
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,130
Prince Han said nothing more.

260
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,100
Just like that,

261
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,090
he split open the buck specimen.

262
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,790
Guess

263
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,120
what happened next.

264
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,240
What happened?

265
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,910
What could have happened?

266
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,240
You weren't even there.

267
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,470
A round head,

268
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,710
wouldn't you believe it,

269
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,600
tumbled out!

270
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,090
We finally found

271
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,390
Wang Jirong's head.

272
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,780
Look.

273
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,930
We finally found it.

274
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,090
That works?

275
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,780
Not only was

276
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,230
Wang Jirong's head

277
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,360
hidden in Xu Youdao's room,

278
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,430
he even recorded

279
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,220
the tragic scene of Wang Jirong's death

280
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,160
in his painting.

281
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,260
It was exactly the same.

282
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,480
He must have been the murderer!

283
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,420
Yes!

284
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,270
That's what we thought.

285
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,370
But...

286
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,040
But he was almost dying.

287
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,520
Well...

288
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,490
He Yuqin once asked me something.

289
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,500
He asked,

290
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,330
"If the law were fair,

291
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,170
would they not have been

292
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,430
forced to that point?"

293
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,140
I told him

294
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,220
that of course the law is fair.

295
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
They might just be

296
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,670
cold, hard words,

297
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,730
but as long as

298
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,990
all of us stand by them,

299
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,080
we can live

300
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,300
more peaceful lives.

301
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,890
Of course, I reflected on it too.

302
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,650
The Legal Code of the Great Qian prides itself on its rigor and justice.

303
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,800
But it still needs to be continually amended

304
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,920
and improved,

305
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,390
because this is the only way

306
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,940
more and more people

307
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,070
will believe in it and protect it.

308
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,850
Greetings, Your Highness.

309
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,270
What Miss Jiu'er said

310
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,770
is very inspiring to me.

311
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,460
The last time the legal code was amended

312
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,390
was 20 years ago.

313
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,760
I will write a memorial to Father.

314
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,370
It's time to reform the Legal Code of the Great Qian.

315
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,630
Your Highness is wise.

316
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,830
Greetings, Mother.

317
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,490
Marquis Xian is here.

318
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,620
Father.

319
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,960
Greetings, Marquis Xian.

320
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,200
Father.

321
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,350
Heyin.

322
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,380
Father, why are you so late?

323
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,390
Father.

324
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,440
I have a backache.

325
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,240
Marquis Xian.

326
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Why are you late?

327
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,880
Your Majesty.

328
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,580
Your foolish brother is having a backache.

329
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,180
Everyone,

330
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,020
don't blame me.

331
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,280
Please don't blame me.

332
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,010
This...

333
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,210
Your Majesty.

334
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,730
Didn't you say it's a family banquet?

335
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,330
Why are there Qi people here?

336
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,300
They are my guests.

337
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,140
Have a seat.

338
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,460
May Your Majesty be blessed and healthy.

339
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,190
We're having a family banquet today.

340
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,590
Everyone, you may relax.

341
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,770
Marquis Xian.

342
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,540
Unfortunately, you came late.

343
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,830
You didn't get to hear

344
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,190
Miss Jiu'er's stories.

345
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,910
Aren't they just the absurd things

346
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,910
Qi people have been doing in Jiuxiao City?

347
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,660
I've heard about them.

348
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,350
Don't talk nonsense in front of my distinguished guests.

349
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:52,750
You...

350
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,180
Am I wrong?

351
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,370
Those Qi people are barbaric.

352
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,770
They're hard to control.

353
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,250
If they leave,

354
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,030
Jiuxiao City will be peaceful.

355
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,920
My brother has a sharp tongue.

356
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,610
Please forgive him.

357
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,040
Fortunately, most people in the Qian court

358
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,480
are open-minded

359
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,370
and can tell right from wrong.

360
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,240
They see Qi people's mistakes

361
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,330
but won't ignore their oppression by Qian people,

362
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,820
and thus judge them fairly

363
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,940
without bias.

364
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,970
Speaking of distinguishing right from wrong,

365
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,630
a few days ago,

366
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,330
you covered up for a murderer

367
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,510
and threw the whole city into chaos.

368
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,550
Is this considered telling right from wrong?

369
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,180
It seems that you were

370
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,780
imprisoned because of this.

371
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,910
Why have you been released so soon?

372
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,880
Han Zheng.

373
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,840
Marquis.

374
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,090
Prince Han solved the Peony Case,

375
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,420
a cold case of ten years.

376
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,620
His merit and mistake balanced each other out.

377
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,780
The Inspection Bureau has already

378
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,860
removed him from his position.

379
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,520
This punishment is too light.

380
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,570
Is it the Inspection Bureau

381
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,830
or you, little inspector,

382
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,410
who is bending the law?

383
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,540
Marquis.

384
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,600
You're overestimating me.

385
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,210
I don't have that kind of power.

386
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:09,720
Really?

387
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,910
I also heard that your Qian-Qi romance

388
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,130
caused quite the fuss.

389
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,340
Prince Han.

390
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,060
You Qi

391
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,350
are quite romantic.

392
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,320
Although you only take one partner in your life,

393
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,770
you can have countless lovers.

394
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,020
Your Highness,

395
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,250
during your excursion to Jiuxiao City,

396
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,780
you even found a Qian woman

397
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,260
to keep you company.

398
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,210
Let me tell you all.

399
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,420
She

400
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,370
is my ideal—

401
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:51,950
Partner.

402
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,130
Partner?

403
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,270
In your heart,

404
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,390
are we

405
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,090
just partners?

406
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:20,960
Marquis.

407
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,470
We are just

408
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,490
partners at work.

409
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,670
Don't listen to

410
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,300
the gossip of the commoners.

411
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,260
But I've heard that–

412
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:28,840
Uncle.

413
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,130
You don't know.

414
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,700
Miss Jiu'er is not

415
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,390
like that.

416
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,370
There are many people in Jiuxiao City

417
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,670
who are enamored by her.

418
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,420
For example,

419
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,700
me.

420
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,080
You...

421
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,270
Jun, what are you talking about?

422
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,410
I'm helping you two out.

423
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,170
How can you

424
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,430
joke about something like this?

425
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,010
How can you like this girl?

426
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,780
I'd rather you like Han Zheng.

427
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,340
Heyin.

428
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,890
Everyone knows how Jun is.

429
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,800
He has always admired talented people.

430
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,210
Alright.

431
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,830
The story made me sad.

432
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,700
Let's have some song and dance instead to relieve the depression.

433
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,560
Your Highness!

434
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,020
Your Majesty.

435
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,420
Your Highness.

436
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,440
Something happened at the dock.

437
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,790
Something happened to the Starry Night.

438
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,730
It seems to be related to the siren.

439
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,420
The siren?

440
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,800
The siren appeared?

441
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:18,859
The siren?

442
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,520
This ship

443
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:36,940
is really exactly the same

444
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,140
as the one in my dream.

445
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,340
But I've never seen this ship

446
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,270
before.

447
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,260
Greetings, Your Highness.

448
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,720
Lord Hu.

449
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,600
How is it?

450
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,520
Your Highness.

451
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,360
Over 100 people on the Starry Night

452
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,960
disappeared just like that.

453
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,770
There are no traces

454
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,840
of a fight.

455
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,300
I’m afraid they have really

456
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,830
been captured by the siren.

457
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,880
What is this siren

458
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,490
they're talking about?

459
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,190
Over the past few years,

460
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,160
once in a while,

461
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,530
a ship will leave full and return empty.

462
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,250
Sometimes, there were a few survivors.

463
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,980
They said

464
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,040
they heard the singing of a siren.

465
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,530
No one could say

466
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,700
what the siren looked like.

467
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,910
The survivors all said

468
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,590
their eyes had been closed,

469
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,830
so they didn't see what the siren looked like.

470
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,630
That's why the siren let them go.

471
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,300
Anyone whose eyes had been open

472
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,830
were captured by the siren.

473
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,250
Is the siren extremely ugly?

474
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,570
Is that why its afraid of being seen?

475
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,940
Keep your voice down, Brother Han.

476
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,260
Don't let the siren hear you.

477
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,120
Why did you come

478
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,370
if you're so scared?

479
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,930
I'm here to investigate the case.

480
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,930
The hands in the dream

481
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,120
weren't my hands.

482
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,900
Every family has lost someone.

483
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,260
Every family has lost someone.

484
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,700
They were all strong men. How could we not worry?

485
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,430
My son.

486
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:30,960
Look how worried the elderly man is.

487
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,800
My son.

488
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,450
Why isn't he back yet?

489
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,740
My son.

490
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,220
What should we do?

491
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,450
How tragic.

492
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,280
Why did they insist

493
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,930
on going to Shuobei?

494
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,800
Was this ship

495
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,120
on its way to Shuobei?

496
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:50,820
Yes.

497
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,770
So most of the missing people

498
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,980
are Qi people.

499
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,900
Your Highness.

500
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,170
Since the siren has reappeared,

501
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,500
everyone in Jiuxiao City will be fearful.

502
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,780
Why don't we ask a shaman to conduct a ritual

503
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,930
to pacify the people,

504
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,300
like we did a few years ago?

505
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
What do you think?

506
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,380
Let's do as you said.

507
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:08,820
No.

508
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,060
It's not a siren.

509
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,730
It's not a siren?

510
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,070
Jiu'er.

511
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,920
Did you find anything?

512
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,820
The Princess is here!

513
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,080
Inspector Su, you're here.

514
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,700
Have you found any clues?

515
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:26,830
Heyin.

516
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,770
What are you doing here?

517
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,340
This is

518
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,810
the famous Inspector Su

519
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,450
of the Inspection Bureau.

520
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,740
Have you all heard of her name?

521
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,160
Of course.

522
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,120
Who hasn't heard of Inspector Su?

523
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,090
Inspector Su

524
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,040
is Jiuxiao City's star inspector.

525
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,030
Her Qian-Qi partnership with Prince Han

526
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,120
is unparalleled,

527
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,710
and a match made in heaven!

528
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,090
As long as Inspector Su is here,

529
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,380
no case is too difficult to be solved.

530
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,330
Even if the siren is making trouble,

531
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,860
she can bring it to justice.

532
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,140
Am I right?

533
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,600
Yes!

534
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,720
With Inspector Su here,

535
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,160
anything can be solved.

536
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,080
Listen up.

537
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,970
Everyone is cheering you on.

538
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,150
They're counting on you to solve the case.

539
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:08,950
Inspector Su.

540
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:09,820
Yes.

541
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,180
Yes, Inspector Su.

542
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,620
Heyin.

543
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,100
Stop messing around.

544
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,700
Come here.

545
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,690
Inspector Su.

546
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,210
Inspector Su, I beg of you.

547
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,030
Please help us.

548
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,360
Please catch the siren.

549
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,280
My husband was on the boat.

550
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,150
He can only come back

551
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,600
if you catch the siren.

552
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,700
Me too.

553
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,170
My son was on the boat too.

554
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,690
Please!

555
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,410
Please help us catch the siren.

556
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,750
Get up first.

557
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,290
Get up first.

558
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,390
Please.

559
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,880
Please.

560
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,740
Okay.

561
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,210
Don't worry.

562
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,360
The Inspection Bureau

563
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,220
will do our best

564
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,990
to help you find your loved ones.

565
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,180
No matter what kind of monster it is,

566
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,580
it must have left traces.

567
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,990
It's all Heyin's fault.

568
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,040
Why did she have to make a fuss?

569
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,610
Otherwise,

570
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,150
you wouldn't have had to

571
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,610
get involved in this case.

572
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,310
Don't think too much.

573
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,040
Jiu'er herself wanted to

574
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,370
investigate this case.

575
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,020
Even if Heyin wasn't there,

576
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,710
I would still want to investigate this case.

577
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,410
You're right.

578
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,760
Our Jiu'er has a strong sense of curiosity.

579
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,630
Maybe you just wanted to see

580
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,960
what the siren looks like, right?

581
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,130
My Jiu'er...

582
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,160
Do you really think

583
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,620
there's a siren?

584
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,130
Qi people exist,

585
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,320
so why can't a siren?

586
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,650
What do you mean?

587
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,630
You're saying we're monsters?

588
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,650
Brother Han, you're being overzealous again.

589
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,550
I meant that

590
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,830
the world is full of surprises.

591
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,630
That's right.

592
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,450
I'm an overzealous demon.

593
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,940
So what?

594
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,600
What, do you want to—

595
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,400
Alright.

596
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Stop arguing.

597
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,750
You're too noisy.

598
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,110
Exactly. Why are you making so much noise?

599
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,200
It's been such a long day.

600
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,930
Let's go eat.

601
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,020
Jiu'er.

602
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,530
Deyue Restaurant is right ahead.

603
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:40,920
Wait.

604
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,640
It is time to eat.

605
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,800
But we don't have to go to Deyue Restaurant.

606
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,300
We're already downstairs.

607
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,720
Qixiang Pavilion is right ahead.

608
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,980
Deyue Restaurant is right here.

609
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,550
So what?

610
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:51,860
Fine.

611
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,090
To be fair,

612
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,380
let's take a vote.

613
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,800
Raise your hand if you want to eat at Deyue Restaurant!

614
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,130
Go to Qixiang Pavilion!

615
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,270
Brother Han.

616
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,890
I won't let you win this time.

617
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,060
I'm definitely going to Deyue Restaurant.

618
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,060
Go by yourself then.

619
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,780
I'll bring Jiu'er to Qiwei Pavilion.

620
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,980
Jiu'er, let's go to Deyue Restaurant.

621
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,020
Stop it.

622
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,550
Both of you, shut up!

623
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,320
Listen to me.

624
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,370
Two things.

625
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,700
First,

626
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,700
I'm not investigating the Starry Night Case

627
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,900
because of the siren,

628
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,690
but because I had a dream.

629
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,990
In this dream,

630
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,870
there was a boat that looked exactly like the Starry Night.

631
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,600
It also got into an accident because of the siren.

632
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,030
Second,

633
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,640
for the sake of fairness,

634
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,500
we're eating at Deyue Restaurant today.

635
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,410
We ate at Qiwei Pavilion last time.

636
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,210
It's settled.

637
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,290
Let's go.

638
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:44,950
Let's go.

639
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,240
Let's go to Deyue Restaurant.

640
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,690
You said you dreamed of the Starry Night?

641
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,820
Mu Yan was there too?

642
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,630
I'm not sure

643
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,220
if it was Mu Yan.

644
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,230
His physique

645
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,870
looked almost exactly the same

646
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,790
as Mu Yan's.

647
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,630
When I first heard about the siren,

648
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,630
I thought it was just a coincidence.

649
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,560
But when I got on the ship,

650
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,650
all the details on it

651
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,660
matched up with those

652
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,740
in my dream.

653
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,250
Isn't it too strange?

654
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,760
Yes.

655
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,340
Could it be...

656
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,370
What?

657
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,330
Qi Vital Stone?

658
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,860
Qi Vital Stone?

659
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,060
What else do you know?

660
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,560
My Eldest Brother told me

661
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,940
that consuming Qi Vital Stone

662
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,200
can not only confer you

663
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,630
a Qi's physical prowess,

664
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,540
it can also grant you

665
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,820
some special effects.

666
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,720
Can you finish talking at one go?

667
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,610
What special effects?

668
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,130
I can.

669
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,320
You will experience synchronicity with the Qi,

670
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,280
and you will keep dreaming of him.

671
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,060
You may also dream about

672
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,500
what he is currently experiencing.

673
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:54,960
He will also know

674
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,290
what you dreamed about.

675
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,000
That's all.

676
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,260
You mean

677
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,150
I consumed the Qi Vital Stone

678
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,620
of a Qi on the Starry Night,

679
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,330
so I could see

680
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,580
everything he saw?

681
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,620
No wonder.

682
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,150
I felt like

683
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,830
the hands I saw in my dream

684
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,520
weren't my hands.

685
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,660
Whose hands were they then?

686
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
Why are your ears in my dream

687
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,700
not fluffy?

688
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,590
Why is your nose

689
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,470
so sharp?

690
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,110
Not only have I dreamed about the Starry Night,

691
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,350
I've also dreamed of you.

692
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,420
Many times at that.

693
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:32,630
Yes.

694
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,470
So you consumed

695
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,560
his Qi Vital Stone!

696
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,180
What?

697
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:36,950
Thank you for your help,

698
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,030
Prince Jun.

699
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,240
Otherwise,

700
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,570
how could she have eaten it

701
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,830
without realizing it?

702
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,910
-What?
-Stop.

703
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,000
I did it for your sake.

704
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,560
But he...

705
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,730
he was the one

706
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,240
w- who wanted you to dream of him

707
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,870
everyday.

708
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,420
What are you talking about?

709
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,920
I learned a Qian phrase recently,

710
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,870
"To gorge the heart of a gentleman with one's own mean measure.”

711
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,200
It's talking about you.

712
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,600
"Gauge."

713
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,330
Brother Han.

714
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,980
It's "to gauge the heart of a gentleman with one's own mean measure.”

715
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,640
I don't care.

716
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,770
I can say it however I like.

717
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,480
-It's...
-Your Highness.

718
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,100
It's "gauge."

719
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,610
So...

720
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,230
At that time,

721
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,780
I dreamed of you every night

722
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:09,860
because

723
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,280
I ate your Qi Vital Stone?

724
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,960
You could see

725
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,120
and hear everything

726
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,210
in the dreams

727
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,410
you were in?

728
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,830
You know everything?

729
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:24,820
This...

730
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,470
Help!

731
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,850
Where are you going?

732
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,080
It's too embarrassing!

733
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,050
Don't follow me!

734
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,670
Su Jiu'er!

735
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,390
Why did she run away?

736
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,120
Is she mad at me?

737
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,540
Of course.

738
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,790
You're only this obedient

739
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,860
in your dream, right?

740
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,790
What did you say?

741
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,490
Nothing.

742
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,070
Anyway, you're dreaming now.

743
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,030
Let's just

744
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,120
stay like this, quietly, for a while.

745
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,960
You...

746
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,310
are so gentle

747
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,600
in my dreams.

748
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,040
Keha.

749
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,220
Keha!

750
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,830
Will she

751
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,920
ignore me forever?

752
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,020
It's possible.

753
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,480
What should I do?

754
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,670
Since you're a fake,

755
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,200
let me practice on you.

756
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,580
Maybe in the future,

757
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,620
when I lie to you,

758
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,580
I won't blush

759
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,930
and my heart won't race.

760
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,940
OK. Go ahead.

761
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,480
Oh, Heavens.

762
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,520
Gosh.

763
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,620
Why would I say

764
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,100
such stupid things to him?

765
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,150
Oh no.

766
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,970
I can't face Han Zheng anymore.

767
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,630
Although she's ignoring me,

768
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,190
I can take the initiative to find her.

769
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:42,620
Right?

770
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,000
By the way,

771
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,740
what time is the appointment with Chilan?

772
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,340
Forget it.

773
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,870
Help me deal with her.

774
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,790
Where are you going?

775
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,010
I...

776
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,070
Nothing.

777
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,760
I'm just doing some exercise.

778
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,790
What do you want?

779
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
To talk business.

780
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,360
I've seen the Qian language version.

781
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,540
Back then, the bilingual version

782
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,000
hadn't been released yet.

783
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,350
I...

784
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,660
I have something to do.

785
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,000
I didn't expect

786
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,170
the secret medicine Prince Jun gave me

787
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,350
to be Prince Han's

788
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,320
Qi Vital Stone.

789
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:30,970
Mother.

790
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,850
Listen to you.

791
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,880
How could

792
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,980
you and Jun

793
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,400
drug me behind my back?

794
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,390
Drug you?

795
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,720
That's too harsh.

796
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,170
By the way, Mother,

797
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,740
was the bottle of Qi Vital Stone

798
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,340
you bought from the Qi market

799
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,370
sold to you

800
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,500
by a Qi

801
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,300
with three scars on his face?

802
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,670
What three scars?

803
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,930
It was an old man.

804
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,400
What did you dream about with Prince Han?

805
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,690
Nothing much.

806
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,770
Mother, why are you interrupting again?

807
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,360
I'm asking you

808
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,620
about the three scars.

809
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,110
No, no, no.

810
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,880
You keep talking about the three scars.

811
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,540
I'm talking about Prince Han.

812
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,770
I was worried.

813
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,700
It was 20 taels for a small bottle of medicine.

814
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,020
I couldn't afford it

815
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,960
even if I tried.

816
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,170
Now it seems

817
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,010
I don't need any money.

818
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,960
We just need Prince Han here.

819
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,100
Mother, let me tell you.

820
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,680
What are you doing?

821
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,600
You can't have designs on him.

822
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,310
Stop it.

823
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:40,740
Jiu'er.

824
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,230
I

825
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,900
was really worried

826
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,790
you two wouldn't end up together.

827
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,250
What do you mean, Mother?

828
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,160
S- So you're saying

829
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,420
you think it'll work out now?

830
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,120
What are you thinking about?

831
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,070
Qian and Qi

832
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,150
can't intermarry.

833
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,990
He is a prince of the Qi race.

834
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,650
Do you expect him to marry you?

835
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,590
What are you talking about?

836
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,290
It doesn't matter if you don't end up together.

837
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,730
Staying alive is the most important.

838
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,290
Do you also think

839
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,530
Jiu'er dreamed of the Starry Night

840
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,140
because of Mu Yan's machinations?

841
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,890
Just like with the previous case,

842
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,350
I think Mu Yan is pointing you towards

843
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,860
investigating the siren.

844
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,660
After leaving the palace,

845
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,840
I looked into it.

846
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,550
I found that it wasn't only the Starry Night.

847
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,490
Every ship that ran into trouble

848
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,290
was traveling

849
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,570
between Shuobei and Jiuxiao City.

850
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,370
Most of the people who went missing were Qi people.

851
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,400
So

852
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,360
this is another case

853
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,640
targetting Qi people.

854
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,420
Maybe this is the reason why

855
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,680
Mu Yan wants you to investigate the case.

856
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,310
I just don't understand

857
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,620
why he isn't showing up

858
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,080
to make everything clear.

859
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,150
Why is he acting so mysteriously?

860
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,810
I keep feeling like

861
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,950
Mu Yan is planning something big.

862
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,230
He wants to control the whole situation

863
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,090
instead of discussing it with us.

864
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Maybe this matter

865
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,610
has something to do with

866
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,020
him stealing the Ember.

867
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,620
If we

868
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,820
follow his plan,

869
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,660
can we really find the Ember?

870
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,110
Just like you,

871
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,100
I don't believe Mu Yan

872
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,180
will put the whole Qi race in danger.

873
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,490
I hope so.

874
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,640
Chilan.

875
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,060
If

876
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,630
I can really find the Ember,

877
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,310
can I decline

878
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,220
to ascend to the throne?

879
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,740
What are you talking about?

880
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,420
You are the only son of the King of Xueqi.

881
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,610
Who will ascend to the throne if you don't?

882
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,010
You.

883
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,520
Are you crazy?

884
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,250
How could they possibly

885
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,850
accept a woman as their King?

886
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,060
Han Zheng.

887
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,530
I have always believed

888
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,430
you're not an emotional person.

889
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,520
It's fine for you to throw tantrums,

890
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,940
but you won't give up the whole Qi race

891
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,180
for Su Jiu'er.

892
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,330
You will go back for the

893
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,930
Xuandong Grand Ceremony,

894
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:05,610
right?

895
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,470
I will go back.

896
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,280
I will also

897
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,470
defeat everyone

898
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,180
in my own way.

899
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:16,880
However,

900
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,680
I will also announce to everyone

901
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,270
I want to be with Jiu'er,

902
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,330
and that I can give up the Qi throne for it.

903
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,460
You're crazy.

904
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,880
You've really gone crazy

905
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,910
for Su Jiu'er!

906
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,730
It’s my job

907
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,950
to get the Ember back.

908
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,610
But I did not choose

909
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,760
this throne!

910
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,200
Since when

911
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,320
did he stop being that arrogant,

912
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,850
cold,

913
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,310
and fierce Prince Han?

914
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,260
How could someone who despises the Qian so much

915
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,880
give his Qi Vital Stone

916
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,870
to me?

917
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,270
I think

918
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,270
he must like me too.

919
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,230
If only he didn't have to

920
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,270
go back to become the King of Qi.

921
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,130
Su Jiu'er,

922
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,239
what are you thinking about?

923
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,350
You are just a measly inspector

924
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,420
with no talents and a short life.

925
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,770
Why should he

926
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,310
give up everything for you?

927
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,070
But

928
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,489
since we can't be together,

929
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,659
why did I have to

930
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,010
meet him?

931
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,850
But Godfather said

932
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,190
reciprocated love is the most important thing.

933
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,480
Other problems are not problems at all.

934
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,880
That's right.

935
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,460
Lass.

936
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,190
Let me tell you.

937
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,510
Whether someone is a Qian or a Qi,

938
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,760
whatever their identity or status is,

939
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,420
those are not problems at all.

940
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,640
In this world,

941
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,340
you liking him

942
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,970
and him liking you

943
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,850
is the most important

944
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,130
and precious thing.

945
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,380
I support you.

946
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,190
But Godfather,

947
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,090
don't you think

948
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,640
I'm being too selfish?

949
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,130
My father often told me

950
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,840
a great man should shoulder important tasks

951
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,860
and a good horse should run long distances.

952
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,970
I can't make him

953
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,420
give up everything to be with me.

954
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,130
Yes.

955
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,320
There are many things in this world

956
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,490
that are more important than love.

957
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,030
You want Han Zheng to stay with you.

958
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,810
But in Shuobei,

959
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,880
his father and his clansmen

960
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,700
are waiting for him to return

961
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,660
to fulfill his duty

962
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,460
as the son of the King of Qi.

963
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:53,850
In this world,

964
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,870
many people

965
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,610
will sacrifice petty love

966
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,720
for grand love.

967
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,890
Old man!

968
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,750
You...

969
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,990
You're handsome, yes.

970
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,310
But on this matter,

971
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,790
I must disagree with you.

972
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,020
What grand love? What petty love?

973
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,500
I don't care.

974
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,300
Our Jiu'er's happiness

975
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,970
is the most important.

976
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,610
Shut up!

977
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,970
Don't you understand Jiu'er?

978
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,340
Even if Han Zheng gives up everything,

979
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,290
in her heart,

980
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,320
could she really be at ease?

981
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,130
Could she live comfortably?

982
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,900
I'm so angry.

983
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,130
Godfather.

984
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,270
Father.

985
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,330
I suddenly feel like

986
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,840
what Mother said was right.

987
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,500
He and I

988
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,560
can't be together.

989
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,520
I never thought that

990
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,160
in my short life,

991
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,770
I would meet someone that I like

992
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,390
who likes me too.

993
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,110
Being protected and cared for by him

994
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,970
seems to have made me braver

995
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,960
and more confident.

996
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,810
Why should I think so much?

997
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,440
Since he's still here,

998
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,460
I should cherish

999
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,660
every day from now on.

1000
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,680
What do you think?

1001
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,660
Your mother is right.

1002
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:19,970
Jiu'er.

1003
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,590
Mother.

1004
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,200
Why are you still up?

1005
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:23,740
Jiu'er.

1006
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,470
I just remembered something.

1007
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,610
I've been looking for you.

1008
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,550
Here you are.

1009
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:28,770
What is it?

1010
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,320
The sorceress in the west of the city

1011
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,180
came to buy medicine two days ago.

1012
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:33,880
She

1013
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,520
kept talking

1014
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,400
and talking

1015
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,120
about how she had a dream.

1016
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,530
She dreamed that something happened to a ship.

1017
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,880
And she said

1018
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,520
it's a sign from heaven.
