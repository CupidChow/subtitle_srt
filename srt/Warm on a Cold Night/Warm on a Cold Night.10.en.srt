00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,970
[Episode 10]

4
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,830
Although I was flogged today,

5
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,360
I'm happy.

6
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,190
The flogging has earned me

7
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,830
two candid friends

8
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,190
and friendship between the two races.

9
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,190
Isn't that great?

10
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,280
Two friends?

11
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,910
I think it's just

12
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,700
that patrolwoman, Su Jiu'er.

13
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,840
Who is she to you?

14
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,060
Why are you so protective of her?

15
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,470
She's a very important old friend.

16
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,100
Jun.

17
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,180
No matter how much you cherish old friendships,

18
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,780
you mustn't be so naive.

19
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,370
Your statuses are different.

20
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,480
It's rare enough

21
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,230
for you two to be friends.

22
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,490
If you disregard your identity,

23
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,340
do something unbefitting of your status,

24
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,600
and lose the commoners' respect for you,

25
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,829
it will not only

26
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,210
be a problem for you.

27
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,520
If you lose your status,

28
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,180
you won't even be able to protect her.

29
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,640
Brother,

30
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,120
you are always so considerate

31
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,900
and you always think ahead.

32
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,400
As your older brother,

33
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,570
I only wish that your life would be smooth-sailing

34
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,829
and have few setbacks.

35
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,079
Brother,

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,640
my butt hurts.

37
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,680
Fan it for me.

38
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,910
Here.

39
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,670
Jiu'er.

40
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,770
What are you doing?

41
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,180
Do your hands grow on your back?

42
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,410
Can you apply medicine on yourself?

43
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,060
Didn't I ask you to wait for me?

44
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,829
Mother.

45
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,090
I'm afraid you'll be tired.

46
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,230
I think

47
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,880
you'd better

48
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:33,960
quit your job.

49
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,750
The Emperor has already had you flogged.

50
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,710
I don't think you'll last long there.

51
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,930
Don't say that.

52
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,550
Mother.

53
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,550
I asked for the punishment myself

54
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,160
to protect my subordinates.

55
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,840
I didn't make a big mistake.

56
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,329
Mother.

57
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,510
This time,

58
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,800
I solved a big case.

59
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,660
Maybe I'll be promoted

60
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,450
soon.

61
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,410
I don't want you

62
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,070
doing such dangerous things.

63
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,790
There's no danger.

64
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,260
My subordinate is very formidable.

65
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,390
I protected him so well today.

66
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,250
In the future,

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,840
he will give it his all and spare no effort

68
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,760
in working for me.

69
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,640
Don't worry.

70
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,960
Fine. Come on.

71
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,790
I'll apply the medicine for you.

72
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,870
Be careful.

73
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,940
Be gentle.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,360
Here.

75
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,670
This lass.

76
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,770
When did she

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
become so ambitious?

78
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,150
She just got a subordinate,

79
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,620
and she's already getting flogged for him.

Su,

82
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,970
talk to your daughter.

83
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,360
If anything happens to her,

84
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:56,680
I...

85
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,190
Mother.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
I promise you.

87
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,060
I will be careful in the future.

88
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,390
Why are you here?

89
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,320
I just—

90
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,360
W- When did you get here?

91
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,310
Just now.

92
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,230
You are here...

93
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,030
I'm here

94
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,270
to visit

95
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,110
an invalid.

96
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,990
You were flogged so many times.

97
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,790
I wanted to know if you would die.

98
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,300
I didn't expect

99
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,760
to hear the truth the moment I got here.

100
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,770
It turns out that

101
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,020
you took the flogging for me

102
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,990
because you wanted me to give my all and spare no effort

103
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,060
in working for you?

104
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,610
No, it's not like that.

105
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,270
It's me—

106
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,860
My butt hurts.

107
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,640
You haven't changed at all

108
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,060
since I last saw you.

109
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,250
You're still pretending to fall

110
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,620
as an excuse to touch me.

111
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,490
I didn't do it on purpose.

112
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,330
No.

113
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,690
Why are you like this?

114
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,630
I went there to

115
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,310
call and shout everyday.

116
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,900
I was cheering for you on the outside.

117
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,290
How could you say that to me?

118
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,530
How could you point your finger at me?

119
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,500
Let go.

120
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,840
Let go!

121
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,720
What if I don't?

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,670
Aren't you

123
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,610
mysophobic?

124
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,430
Aren't you afraid of being touched?

125
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,470
Let me tell you.

126
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,110
I touched a lot of things outside

127
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,230
just now.

128
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,420
There were cats, dogs,

129
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,470
frogs, hedgehogs,

130
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,630
and a whole lot of stinky things.

131
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,050
Smell my hands if you don't believe me.

132
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,909
Stinky, right?

133
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,250
Enough.

134
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,310
I haven't replenished your health

135
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,040
in a few days.

136
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,140
I'll make it up to you today.

137
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,750
Life and death are predestined.

138
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,550
Who was the one screaming and crying

139
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,550
in the ice cellar,

140
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,909
saying she didn't want to die?

141
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,090
Looks like I saved her for nothing.

142
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,350
I should have let her

143
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,310
freeze to death.

144
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,740
Aren't you still the same as well?

145
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,400
You don't mean what you say.

146
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,210
You're cold on the outside but you're actually soft-hearted.

147
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,220
Your mother is here.

148
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,220
My mother is here—

149
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,190
Jiu'er, I've prepared some—

150
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,390
Where is she?

151
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,950
This girl.

152
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,080
She ran out after applying the ointment.

153
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,520
Well.

154
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,880
Your complexion looks good.

155
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,390
Your health must already be sufficently replenished.

156
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,740
I'll... get going now.

157
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:58,740
Wait.

158
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,030
Well.

159
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,390
Tomorrow morning,

160
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,630
come to the Inspection Bureau a little earlier.

161
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,350
Are you really treating me

162
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,390
as a patrolman?

163
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,240
Do I have to start working at dawn from now on?

164
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,430
Idiot.

165
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,080
It's my fault.

166
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,690
I can't get Chef Zhang

167
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,910
to name his accomplice.

168
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,690
He insists that

169
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,800
he did it himself.

170
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,830
I...

171
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,220
I need you.

172
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,310
The one who thinks she is the cleverest person

173
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,910
in the Inspection Bureau...

174
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,790
What did you just say?

175
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,740
I said,

176
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,549
Your Highness, the pride of the Qi race,

177
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:39,620
I

178
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,530
need you

179
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,919
to work with me on this case.

180
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,450
Alright.

181
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,270
See you tomorrow morning at the Inspection Bureau.

182
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,120
Wait a minute.

183
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,390
I have another question.

184
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,400
Why do you have so many questions?

185
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,500
I'm thinking,

186
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,510
since you are the prince of the Qi race,

187
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,110
why didn't you issue an order

188
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,500
for the whole of the Qi race to come out

189
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,160
and look for that Qi man with three scars for you?

190
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,070
Because

191
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,700
he is an old friend

192
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,640
all of us are looking for.

193
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:08,800
I must

194
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,760
find him

195
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,310
before they do.

196
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,150
You can go now.

197
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,500
Put this on. I'm leaving.

198
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,420
Teacher.

199
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,580
You can't sleep either?

200
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,610
I was just waiting for you.

201
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,900
Hanzheng.

202
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,200
Your father asked me

203
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,300
to bring you back.

204
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,350
We're leaving tomorrow.

205
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,640
But Teacher,

206
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,650
I'm now a patrolman

207
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,270
newly hired by the Inspection Bureau.

208
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,120
If I disappear

209
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:37,750
from the Inspection Bureau

210
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,350
so soon after I was released,

211
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,030
the Qian will make a big fuss

212
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,920
out of it.

213
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,910
So what if they do?

214
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,730
If so soon after I was released,

215
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,170
I become someone

216
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,940
who went back on his word,

217
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,790
I think

218
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,630
it won't be easy for you all

219
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,690
to push for the Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

220
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,000
You've gotten good at manoeuvring

221
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,850
since you've been away.

222
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,220
I was always good,

223
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,330
I just didn't do it often.

224
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,740
Sit down.

225
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,300
No.

226
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,250
Preceptor.

227
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,320
Don’t worry.

228
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,220
I'll keep an eye on him.

229
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,430
You?

230
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,990
Why are you looking at me?

231
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,350
Chilan was going to come to Jiuxiao City

232
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,110
on a diplomatic mission next month.

233
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,870
We're just here to make preparations

234
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,710
in advance.

235
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,380
Fine.

236
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,390
Chilan is the main emissary,

237
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,450
you'll be her aide.

238
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,950
If the Qian-Qi Six Treaties

239
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,230
can be signed successfully,

240
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,090
you can earn your father's trust.

241
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,150
You must make this happen.

242
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,180
I understand, Teacher.

243
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,470
But

244
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,410
can you take her back

245
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,290
with you?

246
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,760
I'm used to being alone.

247
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,020
I'm not comfortable with assisting her.

248
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,330
You're not comfortable with assisting me?

249
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,540
Are you comfortable

250
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,810
working with a Qian?

251
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,790
You—

252
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,790
Enough.

253
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,750
Stop teasing him.

254
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,280
You must come clean to me

255
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,490
about the reason

256
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,830
you sneaked out of Shuobei.

257
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,260
Teacher.

258
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,410
Chilan.

259
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,680
Do you guys

260
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,890
already know about the ember?

261
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,990
So you do know.

262
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,040
Forget it.

263
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,130
I asked your father

264
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,400
not to tell you.

265
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,470
You and Mu Yan

266
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,930
grew up under my tutelage.

267
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,780
I know

268
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,750
how close you are.

269
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,710
Teacher,

270
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,590
do you also think

271
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,420
he took the ember away?

272
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,470
Whether we believe it or not,

273
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,340
we can't change the fact that

274
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,670
the Qi race is in danger.

275
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,410
Now that the holy ember has been lost,

276
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,300
deep night will descend upon us.

277
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,790
The Qi race

278
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,190
might be annihilated.

279
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,630
You must find him.

280
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,070
Don't let your emotions get the better of you.

281
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,050
You are the son of the King of Xueqi,

282
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,870
and the future of the Qi race.

283
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,580
Also,

284
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,190
your father has always thought highly of you.

285
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:02,950
He asked me

286
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,870
not to bring more men with me.

287
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,350
He only asked Chilan

288
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,150
to stay in Jiuxiao City with you.

289
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,340
You should know

290
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,280
what this means.

291
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,830
You're gravely misunderstood about His Majesty.

292
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,420
Really?

293
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,330
I think

294
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,070
you are more suitable than I am

295
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,850
to be his son.

296
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,350
You ignore me whenever things get serious.

297
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,350
When will you kick

298
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:32,850
your bad habit

299
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,720
of acting wilfully

300
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,990
and isolating yourself from others?

301
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,650
Standing apart from the crowd

302
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,830
allows one to calmly

303
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,830
assess the entirety of a situation.

304
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:47,790
Hanzheng.

305
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,590
In the whole world,

306
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,610
only your father, Chilan, the King of Chiqi, and I

307
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,050
know about the ember.

308
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,740
Now that you know,

309
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,000
you must keep it a secret.

310
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,590
No matter how much you trust someone,

311
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,850
you must not tell them.

312
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,970
Especially not a Qian.

313
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,310
Chilan, let's go.

314
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,000
It's time.

315
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,270
Well, I...

316
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:31,470
Keha!

317
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,050
Your Highness!

318
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:37,990
What's wrong?

319
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,520
Where did you put

320
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,030
my clothes?

321
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,040
They're in the cabinet.

322
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,040
Is Lord Chilan here?

323
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:45,790
Are we running away?

324
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,910
I'll pack up now.

325
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,370
Wait.

326
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,230
How confused are you?

327
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,350
This is the first time

328
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,710
I am showing up in Jiuxiao City

329
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,620
as the Young Master of the state of Qi,

330
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,150
as well as a special hire

331
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,630
of the Inspection Bureau.

332
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,970
You have one joss stick's worth of time.

333
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,080
Get me an outfit

334
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,710
befitting of my status

335
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,320
and help me get changed.

336
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,990
If you fail,

337
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,310
I will...

338
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,360
Rip out a tuft of fur from your tail

339
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,020
and burn it.

340
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,920
I'll go now.

341
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,760
[Inspection Bureau]

342
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,470
The doors are closed.

343
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,000
Get lost!

344
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:35,840
Yes, Sir.

345
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,080
Commander Yan.

346
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:43,990
I’ve

347
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,100
closed the doors for you.

348
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,110
No one will come in.

349
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,350
You see,

350
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,880
I've done my best to preserve your dignity.

351
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,700
Let's begin.

352
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:56,830
Let’s begin.

353
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,390
I spoke out of turn

354
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,150
and offended Brother Su

355
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,339
as well as his precious, eloquent, daughter.

356
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,680
Like father, like daughter indeed.

357
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,390
Su Jiu'er managed to catch the murderer

358
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,069
before the deadline.

359
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,569
She managed to prove Brother Su and herself.

360
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,819
I hereby

361
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,170
apologize!

362
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,780
Dismissed!

363
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,640
No, no, no.

364
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:25,630
That's it?

365
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,569
What about Brother Hu?

366
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,070
Let me tell you.

367
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,290
I'm her godfather.

368
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,350
I should definitely be included too.

369
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,990
Don't pile on here.

370
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,490
Commander Yan!

371
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,630
Hu is

372
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,670
my able partner.

373
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,310
Without him,

374
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,030
this case wouldn't have been solved.

375
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,190
If the case hadn't been solved,

376
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,270
you would be humiliated.

377
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,600
If you were humiliated,

378
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,430
it wouldn't simply be a matter of

379
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,840
an apology anymore.

380
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,370
Brother Hu,

381
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,190
I've offended you many times in the past.

382
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:58,890
Please

383
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,110
forgive me.

384
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,790
It's okay.

385
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,360
I forgive you.

386
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,470
He forgives you.

387
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,330
I'll watch over him in the future.

388
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,880
Dismissed.

389
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,670
Dismissed.

390
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,600
Okay. Dismissed.

391
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,350
Coming.

392
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,350
Coming.

393
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,350
You're back.

394
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,490
I've bought the last of the

395
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,790
Qi-repellent sachets.

396
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,670
Liu, what are you doing?

397
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,670
I've bought them.

398
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,440
This...

399
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,890
What's that smell?

400
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,980
Not bad.

401
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,230
Yue Daren.

402
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,990
Our new colleague is coming.

403
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,270
You're acting like an unwelcome guest is coming.

404
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,070
Can't you treat him

405
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,330
as an ordinary person?

406
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,260
Exactly.

407
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,910
Why did you prepare all these?

408
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,420
Our new colleague is coming,

409
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,260
so we must

410
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,100
be well prepared.

411
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,630
But I didn't buy your share.

412
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:37,990
Why?

413
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,710
Boss, give me one.

414
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,490
No.

415
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,430
No!

416
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,230
Don't grab it.

417
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,070
Stop it.

418
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,710
Give me one.

419
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,570
Stop fighting.

420
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,360
Stop fighting!

421
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,590
No.

422
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,030
This...

423
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,710
Wasn't she here just now?

424
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,350
How did she get there so fast?

425
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,110
I remember it like that too.

426
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,910
So fast?

427
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,270
You can't stand up again?

428
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,920
Did you get hurt

429
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,950
or did your illness act up again?

430
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,520
I almost fell down.

431
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,390
Then you suddenly showed up

432
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,590
and flew me around.

433
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,980
I feel a little dizzy.

434
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,390
You almost got hurt

435
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,740
because of these fools.

436
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,800
How stupid.

437
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,810
I thought

438
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,400
the prince of the Qi

439
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
would be a burly man with thick hair.

440
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,680
I didn't expect him

441
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,590
to be so elegant.

442
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,450
I thought the Qi

443
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,640
hate physical contact with other people.

444
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,290
But he was willing to rescue Jiu'er

445
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,320
from a crowd.

446
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,920
He's quite considerate.

447
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,450
Indeed.

448
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,610
He's not as the rumors described.

449
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,070
Let's get down to business.

450
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,180
Why don't you say hello to everyone

451
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,950
and get to know them?

452
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,810
It doesn't matter.

453
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,870
They're prejudiced.

454
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,830
It's not a problem if I don't get to know them.

455
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,240
You heard it wrong. You—

456
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,330
-Stop explaining. -You misunderstood them.

457
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,260
With my hearing,

458
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:27,950
I can hear you all whispering

459
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,350
from three streets away.

460
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,160
Qi-repellent sachets?

461
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,380
Hanzheng, listen to me first.

462
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,980
Liu, I'll return mine to you.

463
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,130
Mine too.

464
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,820
What are you doing? Wait.

465
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,310
Hu.

466
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,940
Ren.

467
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,790
No.

468
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,370
I paid for these!

469
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,680
Chen Li, stop there!

470
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,190
I thought that

471
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,890
after all that had happened,

472
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,010
the mindset at the Inspection Bureau would change.

473
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,740
To think that

474
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,370
they're still a bunch of fools.

475
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,570
Don't talk nonsense.

476
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,170
My godfather and I aren't.

477
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,130
I know it very well.

478
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,640
Your Highness

479
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,530
saved me first.

480
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,340
Even though nominally,

481
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,760
you're only a patrolman,

482
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,020
in private,

483
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,990
I'll follow your orders.

484
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,340
But your clothes...

485
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,710
Our clothes

486
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,270
are not befitting of your status.

487
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,100
I'll make the call.

488
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,700
You don't have to change out.

489
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,590
Alright.

490
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,810
And this.

491
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,110
[Han Zheng]

492
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,260
This is not bad.

493
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,190
Let's go.

494
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:38,720
Let's go.

495
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,730
Which cell

496
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,750
is the chef in?

497
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,300
The innermost one on the left.

498
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,980
The innermost one?

499
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,420
What's wrong?

500
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,330
There are no signs of life

501
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,810
in that cell.

502
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,280
Open the door.

503
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,140
He bit his tongue and committed suicide.

504
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,600
He has been dead for hours.

505
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,160
The door lock

506
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,150
isn't damaged.

507
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,950
He died out of the blue before the trial.

508
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,230
It doesn't seem like an ordinary suicide.

509
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:53,960
I suspect...

510
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,950
You suspect the murderer was someone else?

511
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,330
That's possible.

512
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,270
Why can't it be?

513
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,580
Did you examine the body?

514
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,820
Are there any wounds?

515
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,530
What about the cell?

516
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,790
Are there any signs of a fight in the cell?

517
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,880
Did anyone damage

518
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,190
the cell's door lock?

519
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,350
It's intact.

520
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,110
Indeed.

521
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,400
Everything seems to point towards

522
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,710
this being a suicide.

523
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,370
-But... -Come.

524
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,610
Commander.

525
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,260
Everything points towards

526
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,580
Zhang Sen knowing

527
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,750
he was doomed,

528
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,610
and committing suicide to avoid punishment.

529
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,670
I think

530
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,270
we can close the case.

531
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,550
That seems to be the only way.

532
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,580
Wait.

533
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:49,350
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

534
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,750
Even if it were suicide,

535
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,130
there's a difference between voluntary suicide

536
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,590
and suicide under duress.

537
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,660
We have investigated

538
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,910
everything.

539
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,670
Zhang Sen had no visitors.

540
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,780
There are no signs of a fight

541
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,620
in the cell.

542
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,060
So what?

543
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,360
Is it hard to find master fighters who could do this

544
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,290
without a trace?

545
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,350
What do you mean, Your Highness?

546
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,500
Are you not satisfied

547
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,270
with a petty chef as the murderer,

548
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,480
and want to uncover a greater conspiracy?

549
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,280
Not only that.

550
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,510
I'm not satisfied with you.

551
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:17,910
You...

552
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,370
He died

553
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
in your prison.

554
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,270
As the chief here, not only are you not reflecting on yourself,

555
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,800
but you're trying to close the case in a hurry.

556
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,510
What are you talking about?

557
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,400
What do you mean, "your prison"?

558
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,750
It's ours.

559
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,530
Our prison.

560
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,390
Ours.

561
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,070
Yes.

562
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,760
Couldn't there be anyone amongst us

563
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,510
who is secretly

564
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,130
consorting with outsiders?

565
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,080
That's too much.

566
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,200
That's too much.

567
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,130
What do you mean?

568
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,060
What do you mean?

569
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,750
Commander Yan.

570
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,280
Have some tea and calm down.

571
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,710
Brother Han,

572
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,270
I don't like what you said.

573
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:51,940
You...

574
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,550
We are all on the same side.

575
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:55,710
Right?

576
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,390
I promise you.

577
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,070
Commander Yan.

578
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,870
He is just a young man, he speaks—

579
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:03,590
He looks young,

580
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,350
but he's actually an old monster.

581
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,280
He is used to being a prince.

582
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,490
He's a bit official.

583
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,890
Please understand.

584
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,960
Nonsense!

585
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,590
This is not Shuobei.

586
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,260
I’ve been working diligently at the Inspection Bureau

587
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,580
for over ten years.

588
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,470
My service can be considered meritorious,

589
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,310
can't it?

590
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,310
No one has dared

591
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,340
to criticize me!

592
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,190
Really?

593
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,670
Greetings, Your Highness.

594
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

595
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,600
I was flogged because of this case.

596
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,430
Even when I'm dreaming,

597
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,960
I want to find the murderer.

598
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,190
Now, you're telling me the case is closed.

599
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,050
Are you afraid that I'll hold you accountable?

600
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,150
I just thought that

601
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,950
because we are out of leads,

602
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,790
this case

603
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,210
cannot be investigated any further.

604
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,810
Don't you know that this case

605
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,480
has caused two princes to suffer?

606
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,190
It also involves the relationship between our two states.

607
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,860
Father takes it very seriously.

608
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,630
I finally

609
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,400
got the case,

610
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,700
but Zhang Sen committed suicide in prison.

611
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,310
What am I

612
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,730
supposed to tell Father?

613
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,830
Your Highness.

614
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,110
His Majesty

615
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,210
wants to hear about this case?

616
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,060
Of course.

617
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,510
Father takes it very seriously.

618
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,100
Patrolman Su.

619
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:21,850
Yes.

620
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,090
Come with me.

621
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,280
Where...

622
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,610
Where are we going?

623
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:27,970
Where?

624
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,430
We are going to see my older brother,

625
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,310
then my Father,

626
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,820
and finally discuss closing the case.

627
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,540
You have to report

628
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,900
the details of this case clearly to me.

629
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,540
If anyone has been negligent in their duty,

630
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,000
you have to tell me as well.

631
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,600
My eldest brother and Father

632
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,870
are extremely intelligent.

633
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,220
You won't be able to hide it from them

634
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,910
even if you wanted to protect someone.

635
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,040
Yes, Your Highness.

636
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,770
Jiu'er.

637
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:52,520
What?

638
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,090
Godfather.

639
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:57,900
What's wrong?

640
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,790
Look at my eye.

641
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,210
Is there something in it?

642
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:03,880
Okay.

643
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,730
I'll leave you to it.

644
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,390
Let's go.

645
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,120
Goodbye, Your Highness.

646
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,620
Your Highness.

647
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,110
Since Prince Han is your assistant,

648
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,050
he must know a lot about this case.

649
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,480
Let's go together then.

650
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,290
Thank you, Your Highness.

651
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,410
-Let’s go. -Let’s go.

652
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,350
Commander, I need to go to the toilet.

653
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,120
[Deyue Tower]

654
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,110
How was it?

655
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,290
Did I look like

656
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,310
a prince just now?

657
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,020
What do you mean?

658
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,180
You are a prince.

659
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,530
Miss Jiu'er.

660
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,040
You don't know about this.

661
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,880
His Highness

662
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,550
is afraid of dealing with those officials.

663
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,390
Then why did you

664
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,180
come to the Inspection Bureau?

665
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,610
I wanted to observe

666
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,760
your investigation

667
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,670
as inspiration for my novella.

668
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,380
But I couldn't bear to see them

669
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,230
pick on you.

670
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:06,910
That's why—

671
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,500
That's why you pretended to be a spoiled brat.

672
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,290
Right?

673
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,990
How unexpected, Your Highness.

674
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,920
You're such a good actor.

675
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,360
You could probably even play the young scholars

676
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
in your novellas.

677
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,870
I'm not that good.

678
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,670
That means

679
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,590
the Emperor didn't say he wanted to review the case,

680
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,250
and nor did you claim the case.

681
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,160
I'll just have to

682
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,140
talk to my eldest brother

683
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,340
about the case later.

684
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,300
I think

685
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,970
it's more important to close the case first.

686
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,120
You want to brush off the case too?

687
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,450
Brother Han, calm down.

688
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,060
Investigating and closing the case are not mutually exclusive.

689
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,300
Do you remember

690
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,200
Miss Jiu'er getting pushed off

691
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,040
that tower?

692
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:41,850
Plus, Chef Zhang

693
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,670
isn't capable of killing Qi people.

694
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,670
The Inspection Bureau has already interrogated Zhang Sen

695
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,540
many times.

696
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,250
He insisted that he didn't have an accomplice.

697
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:48,650
Right?

698
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,430
It would be fine if he hadn't committed suicide.

699
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,470
Now that he has committed suicide in prison,

700
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,820
all the more it makes people believe

701
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,460
he was just a lackey.

702
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,060
There must be a true culprit

703
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,110
instructing him.

704
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,690
Since you want to find him,

705
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,310
why should we close the case?

706
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,460
This person

707
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,990
once said he wanted to kill Miss Jiu'er.

708
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:11,380
Besides,

709
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,480
he can send messages to Zhang Sen

710
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,200
in prison.

711
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,010
He also had Zhang killed

712
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:15,790
without a trace.

713
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,590
What does this mean?

714
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,700
It means only one thing.

715
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,160
Zhang Sen tried to hide the person

716
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,220
who is behind this.

717
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,270
If he finds out that Miss Jiu'er

718
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,240
is determined to crack the case,

719
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,170
what would he do?

720
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,480
I saved Su Jiu'er once,

721
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,400
I can save her a second time.

722
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,570
What happens

723
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,720
if you go back to Shuobei?

724
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,770
You mean to say

725
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,330
I can't solve the case?

726
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,640
I mean

727
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,740
it's better for us

728
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,040
Su Jiu'er.

729
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,950
What do you think?

730
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,080
I think it's delicious.

731
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,110
It's not about this.

732
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,010
Oh, this?

733
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,750
I think

734
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,400
since Zhang Sen is dead,

735
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,760
if there really is a true culprit,

736
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,390
we might as well let him get what he wants.

737
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,110
Maybe this would make him

738
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,170
give himself away.

739
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,810
You're both Qian people,

740
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,140
of course you're thinking the same thing.

741
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:32,710
Miss Jiu'er.

742
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,400
Here, on your mouth.

743
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,120
Where?

744
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,750
-Here? -No, there.

745
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:40,550
Here?

746
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,030
There.

747
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,530
Let me help you.

748
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:44,990
Here.

749
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,610
Your Highness.

750
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,170
Well...

751
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:57,770
I'm sorry.

752
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,960
I'm still not very good at using

753
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,150
Qian chopsticks.

754
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,670
You—

755
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,670
It's fine.

756
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,390
It's no big deal.

757
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,920
Don't be nervous, Your Highness.

758
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:08,990
Have some food.

759
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,320
Stop staring at

760
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,480
the oil stain on your left.

761
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,000
There isn't any on your right, is there?

762
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,610
It's fine.

763
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,760
Excuse me.

764
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,160
What's wrong with him?

765
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,440
I'll go check on him.

766
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,310
I'm here. Don't worry.

767
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,720
I've prepared clean clothes for you.

768
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,120
They're in the carriage.

769
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,820
He really went to get changed.

770
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,050
You're so cunning.

771
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,990
You know he's particular,

772
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:58,880
but you still made him wipe his left,

773
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,550
then his right,

774
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,220
then his left again,

775
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,620
and then his right again.

776
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,030
I'm not picking on him.

777
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,350
I just wanted to eat.

778
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,590
It's just that

779
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,140
Qian restaurants

780
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,220
are not only small,

781
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,230
but have nothing in them

782
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,150
I want to eat.

783
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,900
Fine.

784
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,150
If you say so.

785
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,220
But, my good partner,

786
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,480
we rely on our friends when we're outside.

787
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,660
You need friends to help you with the investigation too.

788
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,060
He's a prince after all.

789
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,300
He can make the investigation

790
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,620
a breeze.

791
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,110
It's good for you

792
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,630
to keep him happy.

793
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,110
I don't know

794
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,350
how to make people happy.

795
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,670
That's why

796
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,310
you should leave the coaxing

797
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,020
to me.

798
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,460
I'll keep him happy.

799
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,790
You can just keep quiet.

800
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,440
I'm not allowed to talk?

801
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,390
Fine.

802
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,820
For your sake,

803
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,030
I'll do it.

804
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,350
I promise you.

805
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,830
It's settled then.

806
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,630
Here's what.

807
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,720
You go eat something delicious first.

808
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,850
I'll go check on him.

809
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,030
Your Highness, you can open your eyes now.

810
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,340
Okay.

811
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:11,770
Let's go back.

812
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:25,850
Mu Yan.

813
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,880
Why is Mu Yan's scent here?

814
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,320
Brother Han was worried about you

815
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:36,950
so he asked me

816
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,910
to check on you.

817
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,550
I said I'm fine.

818
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:39,990
It's okay.

819
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,590
Hanzheng.

820
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,670
Where's Brother Han?

821
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,530
Where did he go?

822
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,540
Maybe

823
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,760
he went to the bathroom?

824
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,630
My flour!

825
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,430
Stop!

826
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,580
Kid.

827
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Did you see anyone going over there?

828
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,980
Me?

829
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,250
Where did you get this?

830
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,250
That man said he was giving it to me.

831
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,510
That man said he was giving it to me.

832
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,680
That man said he was giving it to me.

833
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,500
What man?

834
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,270
A man

835
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,510
with this on his face.

836
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,330
Where did he go?

837
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,400
Did he say anything?

838
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,150
He said,

839
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,930
"Don't worry.

840
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,530
I'll appear again very soon."

841
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,470
Brother Han is indeed a Qi.

842
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,950
He used the toilet

843
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,130
until the sky got dark.

844
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,870
Have you found him?

845
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,730
Your Highness,

846
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,060
the waiter said he didn't see

847
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,860
anyone who looks like Brother Han go to the toilet.

848
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,140
He didn't?

849
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,540
He left me

850
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,920
without saying anything?

851
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,470
Tell me.

852
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,850
His Highness

853
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,120
treated him warmly.

854
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,850
How could Brother Han

855
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,410
leave just like that?

856
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,140
He won't.

857
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,710
He must have found

858
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,590
a new lead,

859
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,110
and went to investigate.

860
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,110
Qi people are

861
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,040
always hasty

862
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:54,990
like this.

863
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,340
By the way,

864
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,080
before he left, he was telling me about how

865
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,900
impressive Your Highness is.

866
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,230
You know so many people.

867
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,850
As our partner,

868
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,270
could you help us

869
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,620
look into something?

870
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,460
What is it?

871
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,370
The Qi man on the tower

872
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,150
is still the key to this case.

873
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,360
Hanzheng said

874
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,580
there were three scars on his mask.

875
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,580
Three scars?

876
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,300
Your Highness, you're well connected.

877
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,310
Could you help us

878
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,190
ask around?

879
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,310
Don't worry.

880
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,400
Leave it to me.

881
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,290
It's a small matter.

882
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,290
Consider it done.

883
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,310
We'll wait

884
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,370
for your good news.

885
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,560
Miss Jiu'er.

886
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,180
How about I send you back?

887
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,080
No, Your Highness.

888
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,370
I can walk by myself.

889
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,620
Then...

890
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,640
Your Highness, let's get on the carriage.

891
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,330
Well...

892
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:55,970
Be careful.

893
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,760
His Highness went through so much trouble,

894
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,980
but Miss Jiu'er wouldn't even let you

895
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,780
send her home.

896
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,790
Your Highness.

897
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,790
Do you think Miss Jiu'er

898
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,650
has already forgotten about you?

899
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,510
It's better that way.

900
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,010
I embarrassed myself

901
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:31,700
in front of her when I was young.

902
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,380
I'd love for her to forget about it.

903
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,700
Now, Your Highness and Miss Jiu'er

904
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,950
have different statuses.

905
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,150
I'm afraid His Majesty and His Highness

906
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,440
will oppose

907
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,130
the two of you being together.

908
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,310
But I think

909
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,940
Jiu'er is really smart.

910
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,320
As long as she interacts more with my eldest brother,

911
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,850
he will be impressed by her.

912
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,400
If he is willing to help me,

913
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,510
do I still have to worry

914
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,710
about anything else?

915
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,970
But Your Highness—

916
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,270
It's rare to encounter an obsession in life.

917
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,400
She is my obsession.

918
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,860
No matter how hard it is,

919
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,740
I want to try.

920
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,630
Hanzheng is too much.

921
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,670
He never gives me a heads up

922
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
before he acts

923
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,620
and runs away.

924
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,430
I was left there for a whole day for nothing.

925
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,770
I didn't get to solve my case,

926
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,090
nor replenish my health.

927
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,980
Where

928
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,010
did he go?

929
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,150
The craftsmanship is intricate. It's not a common item.

930
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,150
But there are no special marks on it.

931
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,810
Are you sure it's the culprit's?

932
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,420
I can't be mistaken.

933
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,000
In your opinion,

934
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,140
was that person Mu Yan?

935
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,210
His physique is different.

936
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,270
But I can't be wrong

937
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,470
about Mu Yan's scent.

938
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,990
Even if it wasn't him,

939
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,040
it was someone

940
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,640
who can get in touch with him.

941
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:05,980
In that case,

942
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,120
Mu Yan is in Jiuxiao City.

943
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:09,670
Maybe

944
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,450
he'll come to us soon.

945
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,470
What's wrong?
