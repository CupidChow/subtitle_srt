After speaking,

6
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,729
he took the water bottle from Jiu'er's waist

7
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:45,810
and left in a hurry.

8
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,960
This is too sweet...

9
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,350
Too sweet!

10
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,120
It doesn't make sense

11
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,950
for them not to get married on the spot.

12
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,890
I'll get them a matchmaker.

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,810
What are you looking at?

14
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,160
This...

15
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,770
Morning.

16
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,690
Nothing—

17
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,270
Alright.

18
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,260
Go on.

19
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,490
Let me have another look.

20
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,410
Didn't you say you weren't looking at anything?

21
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,810
There must be something!

22
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,260
What is it?

23
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,320
The Jiuxiao City News.

What are you hiding?

26
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,340
Let me see.

27
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,470
What are you hiding?

28
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,000
Nothing.

29
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,140
Where's the book?

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,220
What's the title of this book?

31
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:27,770
It's...

32
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,450
Your Highness.

33
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,210
You're holding it upside down.

34
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
What's it called?

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
He's illiterate.

36
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,200
Pretty girl...

37
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:41,770
Say it.

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,660
Fine.

39
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,510
What's the title of the book?

40
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,460
The Tale of Jiuxiao City.

41

43
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,290
He can't read.

44
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,780
But can't he count?

45
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,579
Prince Han pinned the Little Inspector

46
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,530
firmly against the wall,

47
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,110
saying,

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,250
"I never knew what it felt like

49
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,380
to be rejected.

50
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,830
Very well, Little Inspector.

51
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,820
You have successfully

52
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,200
attracted my attention."

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,270
This is all fake!

54
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,580
Are you stupid?

55
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,690
If a Qi shoves me,

56
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,240
w- wouldn't I be flattened?

57
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,190
It's lying!

58
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,600
It's like this, dummy.

59
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,000
Why are you scaring me?

60
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,120
Do you Qian think that

61
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:37,500
the Qi

62
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,420
are brainless brutes,

63
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,700
just like the novel describes?

64
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,420
It's not as romantic

65
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,750
as the novel describes.

66
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,590
They can argue about even this?

67
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,630
I don't believe

68
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,650
they are in a Qian-Qi relationship.

69
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,450
Isn't it true?

70
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,770
This is absolutely...

71
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,620
How many people have read it?

72
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,820
Why does that matter?

73
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,390
Why are you always like this?

74
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,510
Like what?

75
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:53,940
You...

76
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,820
What?

77
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,040
Let's break up.

78
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,660
I can't be your partner anymore.

79
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,720
Fine.

80
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,080
Whoever doesn't break up is a puppy.

81
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,250
That's not right.

82
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,340
You are a puppy!

83
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,980
Su Jiu'er, say it again!

84
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,180
Stop fighting!

85
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,690
Stop fighting.

86
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,730
There's a new case!

87
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,880
A new case?

88
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,220
Here's the thing.

89
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,940
I just received a report.

90
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,470
The body of a woman who had committed suicide by hanging

91
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,899
was found in the suburbs.

92
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,829
It has been sent to the coroner's office.

93
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,670
Which one of you will be going?

94
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,930
-She’ll go. -He’ll go.

95
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,250
So who's going?

96
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,060
She will.

97
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,340
I'm going to investigate Ren Fengyang's case.

98
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,600
I’m going to investigate Ren Fengyang’s case.

99
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,730
What a coincidence!

100
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,060
It's related to Ren Fengyang!

101
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,930
The deceased

102
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,340
was Ren Fengyang's maid.

103
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,540
Her name was...

104
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,620
Mei!

105
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,440
Yes!

106
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,620
Mei.

107
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,750
Who's going?

108
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,650
There's bleeding from her eyes.

109
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,780
Her tongue is protruding slightly.

110
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,880
There are indentations from strangulation on her neck.

111
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,340
It does look like suicide.

112
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,530
She was fine yesterday,

113
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,040
but today, she's lying here.

114
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,140
So,

115
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,310
your conclusion is...

116
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,540
Judging from the degree of rigor mortis,

117
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,560
Mei should have died

118
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,200
sometime between 1:00 and 5:00 in the morning.

119
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,500
Yesterday, she was still

120
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
pestering Keyuncha to protect her.

121
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,170
There's no reason for her to

122
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,980
commit suicide as soon as she got home.

123
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,900
Moreover,

124
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,750
even if it were suicide,

125
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,090
most people would instinctively

126
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,770
grip the rope and struggle.

127
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,370
Look at her.

128
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,020
There are no traces of a struggle.

129
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,760
In other words,

130
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,630
the murderer knocked her out

131
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,670
before creating the appearance

132
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,440
of a suicide.

133
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,220
Last night,

134
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,710
it was Keyuncha who sent her home.

135
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,220
Do you think...

136
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,020
Impossible.

137
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,370
I was with him

138
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,840
at midnight last night.

139
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,220
I took him

140
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,150
to my residence.

141
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,780
With the sharpness of my senses,

142
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,950
he couldn't have left the house

143
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,150
without my noticing.

144
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,310
Ren Fengyang and Mei

145
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,800
died one after the other

146
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,710
in what looks like suicides.

147
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,540
There must be a connection

148
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,470
between the two.

149
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,650
Let’s go.

150
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,090
Let’s report to

151
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,320
Commander Yan first.

152
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,220
You haven't solved

153
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,370
Ren Fengyang's case.

154
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,659
Now, his maid is dead!

155
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,720
Your investigation

156
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,920
is too slow!

157
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,250
Split up to investigate.

158
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,730
Who will take charge of Ren Fengyang's case?

159
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,659
Who will take charge of Mei's case?

160
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,180
Well...

161
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,540
Once we get down to business,

162
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,540
look at you.

163
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,020
There is only one spot this year

164
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,020
for promotion to Senior Inspector.

165
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,150
Whoever solves this case first

166
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,100
gets the promotion.

167
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,380
Lass.

168
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,770
I have faith in you.

169
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,720
Go on.

170
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,420
Go on.

171
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,950
Go on, lass.

172
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,880
Commander.

173
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,580
I've heard that

174
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,730
Inspector Su was at the scene

175
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,060
when Ren Fengyang died.

176
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,160
She must have a good understanding

177
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,050
of this case.

178
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,760
I'll take care of Mei's case then.

179
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,970
Daren, you are so smart.

180
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,650
He knows Ren Fengyang's case

181
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,430
is tough,

182
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,860
so he picked the new case.

183
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,040
Alright. That's it then.

184
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,300
Inspector Su,

185
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,490
you will investigate Ren Fengyang's case.

186
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,960
Inspector Yue will be in charge of Mei's case.

187
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,950
All of us have a lot of work

188
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,680
on our hands.

189
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,600
I won't delegate manpower to you.

190
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,580
Inspector Su, Inspector Yue.

191
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,930
Find help by yourselves.

192
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,220
Yes.

193
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,340
Get a move on!

194
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,170
Dismissed.

195
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,550
Dismissed.

196
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,220
Dali,

197
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,190
let's go to the scene.

198
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,520
Okay.

199
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:49,870
Wait.

200
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,540
Your Highness.

201
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,470
I'll go with you.

202
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,750
You and I?

203
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,030
She...

204
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,220
Isn't it good for me to team up with you?

205
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,020
That's not it.

206
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,550
If I go with Inspector Su,

207
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,680
I'm afraid it'll create

208
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,310
unnecessary rumors

209
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,070
and ruin her reputation.

210
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,210
That's great.

211
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,900
Hu.

212
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,910
Let's go!

213
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,890
Let's continue to investigate Ren Fengyang.

214
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,570
Alright!

215
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,420
Your Highness.

216
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,010
I can't trouble you.

217
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,900
Let's go to the scene of the crime.

218
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,340
It's in the bag this time.

219
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,809
Your Highness, wait for me!

220
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:36,700
Boss, I...

221
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:37,809
Get lost!

222
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,960
Your Highness!

223
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,120
Love really will fade!

224
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,540
Brother Han

225
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,890
is quite good at acting.

226
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,610
He's such a smooth talker.

227
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,190
We owe him one.

228
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:52,950
Your Highness.

229
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,570
Your Highness, wait for me!

230
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,180
Your Highness.

231
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,780
Did you partner with me today

232
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,590
because you're tired of

233
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,860
Jiu?

234
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,960
I'm here to investigate the case.

235
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,520
Yes.

236
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,400
We're investigating the case.

237
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,210
In my opinion,

238
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,750
as the prince of the Qi,

239
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,300
you shouldn't have to play second fiddle to her.

240
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,160
Think about it.

241
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,810
Her body is weak

242
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,650
and she's incompetent.

243
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,160
She's only sponging off

244
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,370
the Inspection Bureau

245
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,520
because of her father.

246
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
How could you

247
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,480
take her orders?

248
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,400
We should be partners instead.

249
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:24,880
Right?

250
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,220
You mean

251
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,910
you want me to be your follower?

252
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,270
Your Highness, that's not what I meant.

253
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,000
Before this,

254
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,940
I was too ignorant.

255
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,230
Please forgive me.

256
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,570
From now on, we'll be partners.

257
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,620
With your capability and my experience,

258
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,470
we can definitely

259
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,780
make something of ourselves

260
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,400
and become the heroes of the Inspection Bureau.

261
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,260
Your Highness.

262
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,280
Think about it.

263
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,570
We can really do it!

264
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,610
We'll at least do better than Jiu.

265
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,400
Officer Yue,

266
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,310
your stamina isn't that good.

267
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,940
I'm afraid

268
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,990
you're close to retirement.

269
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,520
If you want to be my partner,

270
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,180
I'm afraid you won't be able to keep up with me.

271
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,100
Your Highness!

272
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,460
I'm only 30.

273
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,680
I only look old.

274
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,030
I can keep up with you.

275
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,790
Your Highness.

276
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,760
No matter what, I'm still better than Jiu.

277
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,990
Did you know that ten years ago,

278
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,790
I was the fastest runner in the Inspection Bureau?

279
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,340
Your Highness,

280
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,300
I can do it!

281
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,130
Impressive. Truly impressive.

282
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,830
Han's move is called

283
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,890
a feint.

284
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,080
In this way,

285
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,910
we can continue to investigate Ren Fengyang

286
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,140
without being cut off from

287
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,070
intel about Mei.

288
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,490
Your promotion to Senior Inspector

289
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,220
is in the bag.

290
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,640
If I get promoted,

291
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,870
I'd be a registered official of the imperial court.

292
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,110
Of course.

293
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,780
Listen.

294
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,270
Your salary will triple.

295
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,880
A money-grubber like you will die of happiness.

296
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,690
That means

297
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,610
if I die,

298
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,180
my mother will receive a death gratuity

299
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,920
-every month. -No, no, no.

300
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,400
Nonsense!

301
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,360
Touch wood!

302
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,890
One fell to death,

303
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,110
the other was hanged.

304
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,170
The Western Chamber

305
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,370
is really cursed.

306
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,590
I've heard that

307
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,780
they were both killed by

308
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,000
Shi Luqing,

309
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,850
the one who jumped off the city wall.

310
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,550
Yes.

311
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,670
Have you heard?

312
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,930
Shi Luqing came back

313
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:05,460
just to take

314
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,540
their lives.

315
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,760
Shi Luqing wasn't easy to deal with

316
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,490
even when she was alive.

317
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,470
I've heard that all the men in the Western Chamber

318
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,070
have been involved with her.

319
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,300
Really?

320
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,430
This was a crime of passion?

321
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,590
It must be.

322
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,150
Crime of passion.

323
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,010
Looks like

324
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,780
we need to thoroughly investigate

325
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,840
what kind of person

326
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,260
Shi Luqing was.

327
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:27,870
Your Highness!

328
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,030
Your Highness!

329
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,890
Your Highness.

330
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,040
Officer Yue, you're only in your 30s.

331
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,910
You're too weak.

332
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,050
You're out of breath after running a few steps.

333
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,110
No, Your Highness.

334
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,560
You are an ace.

335
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,490
Ordinary people can't compete with you.

336
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,490
Let me practice.

337
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,510
I'll be able to keep up next time.

338
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,940
Your Highness.

339
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,120
Did you find anything?

340
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,720
I smell it.

341
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
It's Mei's scent.

342
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,420
What? Where?

343
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,940
It's...

344
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,120
Right here.

345
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,650
Over there?

346
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,090
Heyang Gate in the west of the city,

347
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,490
ten miles away from here.

348
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,010
About 100 feet north of the main gate.

349
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,490
And

350
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,390
there's a rotten smell.

351
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,210
Ten miles away? Heyang Gate in the west of the city?

352
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:20,570
Yes.

353
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,350
I also smelled

354
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,590
something that belonged to Mei.

355
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,800
If I'm not mistaken,

356
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,230
it's very likely where

357
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,490
the murderer is selling the stolen goods.

358
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,260
You can smell it from so far away.

359
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,900
Is it for real, Your Highness?

360
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,930
Evidence doesn't wait for anyone.

361
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,900
I'll go there first.

362
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,430
Hurry up.

363
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,840
Your Highness!

364
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,860
Your Highness,

365
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,590
you should at least wait for me!

366
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,400
Your Highness.

367
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,360
Your Highness!

368
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,480
Your Highness!

369
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,230
Wait for me, Your Highness!

370
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,250
Your Highness!

371
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,230
These trees don't even have forks.

372
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,030
How could she hang herself here?

373
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,010
In this case,

374
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,120
we can prove that

375
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,540
the murderer had indeed

376
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,800
knocked the victim out

377
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,510
before creating the appearance of a suicide.

378
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,070
This footprint smells weird.

379
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,060
I've never heard about

380
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,680
Mr. Ren and Miss Shi having anything to do with each other.

381
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,140
They performed together.

382
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,770
They didn't talk much

383
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,890
after performing.

384
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,490
I don't know.

385
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,260
I just came here.

386
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,210
Mr. Ren was such a kind person.

387
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,180
How could he pass away just like that?

388
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,470
It's all Shi Luqing's fault!

389
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,830
She kept seducing people when she was alive.

390
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,300
Now that she's dead, she's still making trouble.

391
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,640
I...

392
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,330
Did I say it?

393
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,420
God bless me.

394
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,690
I didn't mean it.

395
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,620
I didn't mean it.

396
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,410
Alright.

397
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,200
Next.

398
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,040
Shi Luqing?

399
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,220
I remember her.

400
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,280
This girl had a bad reputation.

401
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,280
But I think

402
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,850
those were just rumors.

403
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,510
They all said...

404
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,780
she was promiscuous

405
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,440
and seduced men everywhere she went.

406
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,280
But I think

407
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,260
it was all because

408
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,430
she was too pretty,

409
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,640
which invited these kinds of gossip.

410
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,100
In my memory,

411
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,150
that child was quite sensible.

412
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,230
She didn't interact much with men.

413
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,220
The only person she talked to

414
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,290
a little more

415
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,110
was Mr. Ren's Mei.

416
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:19,770
By the way,

417
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,120
I've heard you were in charge of

418
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,250
Mr. Ren's meals.

419
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,160
Yes.

420
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,860
I’m the one who cooks

421
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,190
for all the actors in the Western Chamber.

422
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,590
Was there

423
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,180
anything special

424
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,220
about his dietary requirements?

425
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,630
For example, the addition of

426
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,720
any special herbs?

427
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,020
No.

428
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,430
Well...

429
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,810
It's just that before every performance,

430
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,170
Mr. Ren would drink

431
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,530
a bowl of warm pear soup.

432
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,890
Pear soup?

433
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,700
Did he drink it

434
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,870
the day he died?

435
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:46,890
Yes.

436
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,220
There had been ghost sightings,

437
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,500
so Mr. Ren hadn't been coming to the Western Chamber

438
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,920
when he didn't need to perform.

439
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,180
That day, I think he arrived at the theater

440
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,370
right before the performance.

441
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,720
After hurriedly drinking a bowl of pear soup,

442
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,320
he changed into his costume.

443
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,620
Hu.

444
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,350
Let's go to the kitchen to take a look.

445
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,060
We must go take a look.

446
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,060
He followed me here so soon.

447
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,580
These are all

448
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,940
ordinary ingredients.

449
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,340
There isn't the medicinal smell

450
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,540
Keyuncha mentioned.

451
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,890
Could it be that

452
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,110
the pear soup he drank

453
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,300
had been spiked?

454
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,460
Lass.

455
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,180
I think the cook

456
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,880
was probably telling the truth.

457
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,520
Otherwise, wouldn't she be getting herself in trouble

458
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,570
by going into all that detail?

459
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,550
Anyone here

460
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,860
can come to this kitchen

461
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,860
at any time.

462
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:43,860
Even outsiders

463
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,720
could come here to spike the food.

464
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,230
We need to figure out

465
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,650
what medicine it was.

466
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,590
Are you sure

467
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,080
it's still in the kitchen?

468
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,220
But isn't it like trying to find a needle in a haystack

469
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,850
if we keep searching like this?

470
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,640
Even so, we have to keep searching.

471
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,830
What if there is some residue

472
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,630
in there?

473
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,589
I wish Han were here.

474
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,960
His nose is more sensitive than mine.

475
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,589
What's this smell?

476
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,569
Hu.

477
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,440
Just wait.

478
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,770
I'll get him.

479
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,420
Come out.

480
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,190
I noticed you long ago.

481
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,819
Are you looking for me?

482
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,900
Why are you here?

483
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,140
Where is Han Zheng?

484
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,710
Didn't Han Zheng

485
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,589
go with Yue Daren?

486
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,800
They said it'd be faster

487
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,599
if we split up.

488
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,020
Then why are you here?

489
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,670
Han Zheng asked me to come.

490
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,510
Han Zheng told me

491
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,220
he couldn’t protect you in the open,

492
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,350
so he asked me to protect you in secret.

493
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,000
This

494
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,080
is my new job.

495
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,240
Why is he so worried about me?

496
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,340
Seriously.

497
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,950
You came at the right time.

498
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,190
Your nose

499
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,300
must be as good

500
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,580
as Han Zheng's, right?

501
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,560
Did you smell

502
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,540
Ren Fengyang's medicinal smell

503
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,860
at the theatre?

504
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,030
No.

505
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,570
W- What about here?

506
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,430
Here?

507
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,050
How is it?

508
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:17,900
No.

509
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,340
That's it?

510
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,070
No.

511
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,040
That means this medicine

512
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,790
isn't in the Western Chamber.

513
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,540
If we want to know

514
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,740
what medicine it is,

515
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,380
there is only one way.

516
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,740
Are you sure

517
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,910
this is the only way?

518
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,870
Big fat sheep, big fat goose.

519
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,940
Have a look.

520
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,420
Sir, have a look.

521
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,440
Big fat sheep, big fat goose.

522
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,680
Come and have a look.

523
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:12,960
Sir.

524
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,210
Have a look.

525
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,820
Do you want to buy my pork?

526
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,260
You just stepped on pig dung.

527
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,260
Aren't you going to wash your shoes?

528
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,010
Who are you? It's none of your business.

529
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,670
Inspection Bureau?

530
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,510
Go ahead, run.

531
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,070
Officer!

532
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,860
Please spare my life!

533
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,180
Please spare my life!

534
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,620
Ah Qi.

535
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,460
What time is it?

536
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,480
Your Highness.

537
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,860
It's already dusk.

538
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,690
It's going to be night soon.

539
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:01,860
Soon, you'll see

540
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,990
many river lanterns

541
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,090
floating downstream with the water.

542
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,590
It's wonderful.

543
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,560
Don't you think

544
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,140
your overly serious expression

545
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,670
is incongruous with this beautiful scenery?

546
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,030
Here.

547
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,860
Look at my painting.

548
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,160
Your Highness,

549
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,230
I'd better inspect

550
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,230
our surroundings

551
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,580
so I can protect you.

552
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,180
You are

553
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,200
always so boring.

554
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,830
If I had known,

555
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,560
I wouldn't have chased away the servant who served tea.

556
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,090
At least she would have been a little more fun.

557
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,040
Strange.

558
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,380
The maid there

559
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,930
used to be a plump girl.

560
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,810
Why did she become

561
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,580
so thin?

562
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,160
Maybe it's someone else.

563
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,820
The price this time

564
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,700
is too high.

565
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,130
Can we negotiate?

566
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,510
Because of the Qian-Qi Six Treaties,

567
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,980
many Qi envoys have come.

568
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,340
We dare not sell too much

569
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,230
in the black market right now.

570
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,380
If the Qi found out

571
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,350
we are selling Qi Vitality Stones,

572
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,530
it'll be a serious matter

573
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,880
between the two races.

574
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,800
Even so,

575
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,580
you can't

576
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,010
triple the price.

577
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,690
To be honest with you,

578
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,820
actually,

579
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,950
you're not the only one

580
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,030
who wants in

581
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,930
on this deal.

582
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,260
If you think the price is too high,

583
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,860
don't force yourself.

584
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,180
Don't.

585
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,580
Eunuch Li.

586
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,180
You...

587
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,530
Young Master Li,

588
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,740
we've known each other for so many years.

589
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,600
We still have to

590
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,840
make this deal.

591
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,460
Triple the price it is, then.

592
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,470
Here's the wine. Let's drink.

593
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,440
How dare you!

594
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,870
Where are your manners?

595
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,400
Apologize.

596
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,490
Do you feel weak all over

597
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,850
and are unable to speak?

598
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,260
It’s all because of my

599
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,430
daze powder.

600
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,770
I'm a regular here,

601
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,940
but I've never seen anyone

602
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,870
serve wine in such a casual manner.

603
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,350
Why can't I speak?

604
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,170
You're not a servant.

605
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,230
Let me see who you are.

606
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,430
You have this much strength?

607
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,280
It's her.

608
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,760
I've seen her

609
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
among the Qi envoys.

610
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,330
She's that female general.

611
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,540
What's her name?

612
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,300
Chilan!

613
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:17,990
She must be here

614
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,020
to investigate

615
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,760
the secret of our Qi Vitality Stones.

616
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,290
Kill her!

617
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,880
But don't leave any evidence.

618
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,810
Take off her clothes

619
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,610
and throw her into the river!

620
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,630
In a few days, when the body surfaces downstream,

621
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,160
they'll think she drowned.

622
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,720
It'll have nothing to do with us.

623
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,180
General.

624
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,390
I'm sorry.

625
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,010
You came here yourself today.

626
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,730
Don't blame me

627
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,070
when you become a water ghost.

628
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,500
No one can save you!

629
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,580
Ah Qi.

630
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,110
Who are you?

631
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,510
Eldest Prince.

632
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,540
Eldest Prince.

633
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,010
Eunuch Li.

634
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,220
Yes.

635
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,590
What are you doing?

636
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,220
Your Highness,

637
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,070
my good friend and I

638
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,940
were admiring river lanterns here.

639
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,970
We didn't expect to encounter

640
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,700
a female assassin in disguise.

641
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,750
It was a crisis,

642
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,350
so we had to fight back.

643
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,010
Fight back?

644
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,930
Why are you degrading her?

645
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,740
I'm not.

646
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:56,940
I just wanted

647
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:58,350
to see who she is.

648
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,380
Yes.

649
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,480
Eunuch Li.

650
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,300
Yes, Your Highness.

651
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,230
Raise your head.

652
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,630
You really don't know who she is?

653
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:08,600
I...

654
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,120
I really don't know.

655
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,860
I'll take her away.

656
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,310
I'll punish you two

657
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,090
after I get to the bottom of this.

658
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,440
Your Highness.

659
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,510
How about

660
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,320
you change your clothes?

661
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,910
It's inappropriate for you

662
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,920
to be alone with me like this.

663
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,280
Then should I

664
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,480
or Ah Qi

665
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,410
help you?

666
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,390
I'll do it then.

667
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,140
What's wrong?

668
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,560
So you want me

669
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,670
to close my eyes?

670
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,390
Alright.

671
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,350
How dare you!

672
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,200
Looks like you've recovered.

673
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,430
I apologize.

674
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,660
I...

675
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,630
The last time I saw you,

676
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,980
you looked like

677
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,110
a majestic...

678
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,940
tigress.

679
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,350
I didn't expect

680
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,990
to see you as a ferocious kitty cat

681
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,150
today.

682
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,490
Don't tell anyone

683
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,020
about what happened today.

684
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,180
Otherwise...

685
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:12,840
Otherwise?

686
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:14,570
Could you

687
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,610
take my life?

688
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,370
You...

689
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,060
Fine, I promise you.

690
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,260
I'll have to warn Ah Qi later

691
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,310
that if he lets this slip,

692
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,310
you will kill him.

693
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,350
Did you disguise yourself as a maid today

694
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,680
to get close to Eunuch Li

695
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,080
in order to get

696
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,740
some intel?

697
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,100
Well,

698
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,830
is there anything I can help you with?

699
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,570
Did you know that Eunuch Li

700
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,220
is selling Qi Vitality Stones?

701
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,620
What?

702
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,620
Really?

703
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,010
There are two possibilities.

704
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:57,010
The first is that you knew about this

705
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,800
and are involved in it.

706
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,720
That's why you showed up today.

707
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,400
I'm here

708
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,420
to see the river lanterns tonight.

709
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:03,980
I didn't know

710
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,510
Eunuch Li would be here too.

711
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,730
Have some tea.

712
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,480
Let's go.

713
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,100
Because you're colluding with them,

714
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,030
you already know

715
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,960
I've found out about your secret,

716
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,920
so it's fine for me to tell you.

717
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,270
There's another possibility.

718
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,060
You just found out

719
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,370
Eunuch Li

720
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,060
is involved in trafficking Qi Vitality Stones.

721
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,830
As an eunuch,

722
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,300
there must be someone more powerful behind him.

723
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,010
Perhaps they are

724
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,740
a member of the imperial court.

725
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,410
Your Highness.

726
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,510
Will you help me

727
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,140
find the person behind this?

728
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,430
I once heard that

729
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,340
a small dosage of Qi Vital Stone

730
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,000
can enhance a Qian's physique

731
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,420
and his five senses.

732
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,000
But excessive and prolonged usage

733
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,460
will damage a Qian's body,

734
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,990
or even cause death.

735
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,660
If someone

736
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,940
is doing this kind of business,

737
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,420
even if it's someone from the court,

738
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,510
I won't tolerate it.

739
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,320
Then go back,

740
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,470
arrest Eunuch Li,

741
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,810
and interrogate him.

742
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,260
You'll find out everything then.

743
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,060
But Eunuch Li could also explain

744
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,710
what happened today

745
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,220
as you approaching him in disguise

746
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,180
to try to obtain Qian's state secrets,

747
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,830
even trying to kill him in the process.

748
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,960
If I only interrogate him, but not you,

749
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,130
how could I answer to the public?

750
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,870
Where is the black market you mentioned?

751
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,730
I'll send someone to check it out.

752
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,270
That's difficult.

753
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,230
I don't know

754
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,650
what news they've gotten lately,

755
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,220
but they've gone silent all of a sudden.

756
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:27,900
I finally found

757
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,220
Eunuch Li.

758
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,930
If they find out we're onto them,

759
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,220
I'm afraid this lead would become a dead end too.

760
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,950
It's not that I don't trust you.

761
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,130
But so far,

762
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,030
I've only heard your side of the story.

763
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,750
But if I find the evidence,

764
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,070
will you help me

765
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,490
end this from its source?

766
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,090
Of course.

767
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,510
Anyone who dares to do such a business

768
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,970
is definitely not simple.

769
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,930
Maybe

770
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,840
he's a royal, like you.

771
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,210
Your Highness.

772
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,030
Goodbye.

773
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,330
Thank you.

774
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,510
General Chilan.

775
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,130
I promise you.

776
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,280
No matter who he is,

777
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,310
I will bring him to justice.

778
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,550
This is how the Qian

779
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,540
make promises.

780
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,610
Ironically, Your Highness,

781
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,770
there is no law in your country

782
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,750
stipulating the punishment for someone

783
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,810
who has harmed a Qi.

784
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,170
That is why

785
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:34,980
we must go through with

786
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,440
the Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

787
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,780
It seems to be protecting

788
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,110
the interests of the Qi,

789
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,050
but it is actually maintaining

790
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,270
the order of the Qian.

791
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:43,830
Alright.

792
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,050
As long as you find the evidence,

793
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:46,850
I promise you.

794
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,150
I will continue pushing for

795
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,080
the Qian-Qi Six Treaties at court.

796
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,550
This is how the Qi make promises.

797
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,530
Have a seat.

798
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,330
We're not tired.

799
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,730
There's no need to sit.

800
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,090
Today, I found—

801
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,770
It's okay.

802
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,510
A butcher.

803
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,350
And then,

804
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,890
I brought him to that—

805
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,310
Keyuncha, what's wrong?

806
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,850
H- He's fine.

807
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,640
He's fine.

808
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,480
Are you okay?

809
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,590
It's just his first day working a case.

810
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,790
He must be tired.

811
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,660
-He's tired. -He's tired.

812
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,140
Why is he tired?

813
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:37,980
Prince Han.

814
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,420
I almost forgot

815
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,530
to report to you.

816
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,220
We found

817
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,970
Ren Fengyang's cause of death.

818
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,400
Go on.

819
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,570
Ren Fengyang fell to his death.

820
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,360
That's true.

821
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,020
But before he died,

822
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,940
he was drugged by daze powder.

823
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,490
This is a medicine

824
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,260
that can paralyze a human's body and throat.

825
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,920
So at the time of the incident,

826
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,400
he couldn't make a sound,

827
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,740
and felt weak all over.

828
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,380
Plus, because of the ghost sightings,

829
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,990
he was already almost scared to death.

830
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,330
He was singing on stage,

831
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,260
and suddenly,

832
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,930
he heard Shi Luqing's voice.

833
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,830
He got scared,

834
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,860
so he fell.

835
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,180
Right?

836
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:14,640
Impressive.

837
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,800
Truly impressive.

838
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,200
I finally understand now.

839
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,180
Ren Fengyang

840
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,180
had been drugged.

841
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,310
Someone

842
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,690
took the occasion of the Ghost Festival

843
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,590
to make use of Shi Luqing's return

844
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,820
to stir up trouble.

845
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:30,580
Not bad.

846
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,320
There's progress.

847
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,260
So,

848
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,030
what happened to Keyuncha?

849
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,820
What is it?

850
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,180
Godfather.

851
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:46,940
Is there

852
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,160
something on my head?

853
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,930
Let me see.

854
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,760
Up.

855
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,760
Hu.

856
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,470
My mother isn't here.

857
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,170
Let's go!

858
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,390
Hurry up.

859
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,780
I'll keep watch for you.

860
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,000
Hurry up.

861
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:13,920
Come on.

862
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,520
It's up to you now.

863
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,510
Smell it.

864
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,260
Is it this?

865
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,480
No, no, not this.

866
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,570
What's wrong with you?

867
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,060
It's a little pungent.

868
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,580
Then...

869
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,750
Keep your voice down.

870
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,650
Try to control it.

871
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,330
Control it.

872
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,020
Why is it so noisy?

873
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,660
I- I can't control myself.

874
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,460
We know you're not feeling well,

875
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,500
but we can only rely on you.

876
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,300
Hang in there.

877
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,020
Hu, hurry up. Let him smell it again.

878
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:55,560
It's not this.

879
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,160
Is it this?

880
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,150
Not this.

881
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,860
This one.

882
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,420
This one.

883
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,100
This one.

884
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,550
So it was daze powder.

885
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:13,780
We did it!

886
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,770
It’s daze powder.

887
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,500
Daze powder?

888
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:16,690
Alright.

889
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,659
Let's go.

890
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,590
Hurry up! Let's go.

891
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,120
Let's go.

892
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,090
Stop!

893
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,840
Your mother looks very formidable

894
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,560
wielding that broom.

895
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,250
She looks just as mighty as she did in her prime.

896
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,030
I asked him to protect you out of the kindness of my heart.

897
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,560
How could you do this to him?

898
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,840
I- I'm sorry.

899
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,800
Are you okay?

900
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,150
I'm fine.

901
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,530
Don't you know?

902
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,429
The Qi's five senses are very sensitive.

903
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:49,040
For him to smell so many scents

904
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,100
in such a short time

905
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,940
is akin to

906
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:51,780
throwing you

907
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,580
into a bucket full of excrement!

908
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,150
I can't take it anymore.

909
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,170
I can't take it anymore.

910
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:56,949
It's okay.

911
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,010
I'm fine now.

912
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,690
Don't be angry.

913
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,090
I'm fine. Really.

914
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,970
Don't be angry.

915
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,740
Sit down.

916
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,630
I'll go wash my face.

917
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,660
Okay.

918
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,460
You guys talk first.

919
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,320
Don't be angry.

920
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,180
I'm sorry.

921
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,080
We only did that

922
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,220
because we wanted to crack the case

923
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:18,850
as soon as possible.

924
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,650
Exactly.

925
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,150
-We won’t do it again. -We won’t do it again.

926
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,080
We really won't.

927
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,320
Let’s get down to business.

928
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,500
Is daze powder

929
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,840
very common?

930
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,330
It's not rare.

931
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,200
However,

932
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,280
a small dosage of it

933
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,960
can get rid of heat and toxins,

934
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,030
so it often appears

935
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,590
in various prescriptions.

936
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,860
This time,

937
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,220
we made

938
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,990
a small breakthrough.

939
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:53,680
Yes.

940
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,410
Let me do it.

941
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:56,670
Okay.

942
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,790
What about you, Prince Han?

943
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,840
You investigated personally today,

944
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,820
so you must have

945
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,580
found many significant leads.

946
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,350
There's nothing much.

947
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,240
I've simply

948
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,930
arrested the person

949
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,430
who murdered Mei.

950
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,340
-Impressive. -Impressive.

951
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,600
-Truly impressive. -Truly impressive.

952
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,580
The murderer who killed Mei

953
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,300
is ostensibly

954
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,590
a butcher,

955
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,980
but in truth,

956
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,630
he's an assassin.

957
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,570
However,

958
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,050
his communications with his employer

959
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:33,920
were one-way.

960
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,870
He only knows the time and location

961
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,710
for collecting his pay after the job.

962
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,510
He doesn't know

963
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,840
who ordered the murder.

964
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,370
So,

965
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,620
we still need to find out who the real murderer was.

966
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,390
Then the real murderer

967
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,840
should be the person

968
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,240
who killed Ren Fengyang.

969
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,460
Prince Han, you're formidable.

970
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,310
You found leads and arrested the murderer

971
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,100
even while you were with

972
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,420
an idiot like Yue Daren.

973
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,470
You're really intelligent.

974
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,830
Yue

975
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,610
didn't help much.

976
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,110
I did it all myself.

977
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,890
What about Yue Daren?

978
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,570
Inspector Yue?

979
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,460
He's doing his best at investigating

980
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,540
right now.

981
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,710
One hundred feet north of Heyang Gate.

982
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,010
Isn't this the place?

983
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,510
Didn't he say something about Mei

984
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,170
and something about selling stolen goods here?

985
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,660
My dear Prince Han.

986
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,540
My honorable ancestor.

987
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,180
Where on earth is this place?

988
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,950
-Impressive. -Impressive.

989
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,600
-Truly impressive. -Truly impressive.

990
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,530
Prince Han has delivered justice.

991
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,600
Not only did he catch the murderer,

992
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,910
he also punished Yue Daren,

993
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,290
a petty gossipmonger.

994
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,750
Are you feeling better?

995
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,350
-Much better. -Are you okay?

996
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:05,990
I'm fine.

997
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:06,880
How is it?

998
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,400
I'm fine. Don't worry.

999
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,790
You're strong!

1000
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,160
You're strong.

1001
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:11,940
Sit.

1002
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,290
Han.

1003
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,170
No, no, no.

1004
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,010
Prince Han.

1005
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,290
I don't think

1006
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,480
we should be too proud at this juncture.

1007
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,610
According to my experience,

1008
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,810
even thought we've caught the butcher,

1009
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,970
we might not be able to find the real murderer.

1010
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:25,660
Why?

1011
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,140
Didn't the butcher already tell us

1012
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,400
the time and location?

1013
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,530
Let me tell you.

1014
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,820
Generally,

1015
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,970
for a contract killing case like this,

1016
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,380
it's useless to know the time and location.

1017
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,060
They don't have to come

1018
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,850
personally.

1019
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,180
He can pay

1020
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,100
a begger

1021
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,550
or a servant to show up for him.

1022
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,660
If he doesn't show up,

1023
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,680
what can you do?

1024
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,430
You can't catch him!

1025
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,920
Even if you catch him,

1026
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,620
he won't confess.

1027
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,300
He'll deny that he was involved.

1028
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,560
What would you do then?

1029
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,540
Let me tell you.

1030
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,470
The Inspection Bureau

1031
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,830
upholds the rule of law.

1032
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,140
We can't possibly

1033
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,920
torture a suspect into confessing

1034
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,100
when we have no evidence.

1035
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:06,990
That won't do!

1036
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,620
So, when a case comes to this,

1037
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,250
it's a dead end.

1038
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,110
But as long as we know

1039
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,940
the time and location of the payment,

1040
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,460
can't we just follow the trail

1041
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,540
to find the real murderer?

1042
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:22,860
It's too dangerous.

1043
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,590
You can't go.

1044
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,100
Godfather.

1045
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,200
Don't worry.

1046
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,970
Now,

1047
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:29,700
I have a backer.

1048
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,560
What time is it now?

1049
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,530
It's past five in the afternoon.

1050
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,660
It's past five?

1051
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,640
Strange.

1052
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,670
When the General

1053
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,600
sent me home last night,

1054
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,580
she promised me

1055
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,740
she will go see the river lanterns

1056
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,540
with me today.

1057
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,010
See

1058
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,240
the river lanterns?

1059
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,660
Yes.

1060
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,020
It's the first day of the Ghost Festival.

1061
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,680
It's very lively by the river.

1062
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:15,270
There are so many lanterns there.

1063
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,120
Look over there!

1064
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,240
There are so many lights.

1065
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,370
Isn't it beautiful?

1066
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,110
General.

1067
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,320
General.

1068
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:33,540
So you really

1069
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,890
came to the river directly.

1070
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,150
I had something to do earlier. I'm sorry.

1071
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,040
What was it?

1072
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,890
I'll tell you later.

1073
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,740
Tell me if you need anything next time.

1074
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,670
I'll go with you.

1075
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,180
Come with me.

1076
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,630
Hurry.

1077
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,000
Let's go.

1078
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,340
You can hang this up.

1079
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,040
I buy this flower every year.

1080
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,560
This one.

1081
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,770
Take a look.

1082
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,910
Isn't it beautiful?

1083
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,290
Why do you release river lanterns

1084
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,580
during the Ghost Festival?

1085
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,880
Because they contain

1086
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,780
our remembrances for our deceased family members.

1087
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,640
Remembrances?

1088
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,180
Boss,

1089
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,680
I want four lanterns.

1090
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,250
Okay.

1091
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,250
Four? For us, too?

1092
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:12,960
Yes.

1093
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,060
Take it.

1094
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,240
Thank you, Boss.

1095
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,560
It’s said that after releasing the lanterms,

1096
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,360
you can dream of your loved ones.

1097
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,980
I used to release one for Father

1098
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,020
every year.

1099
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,860
But I seldom

1100
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,610
dream of him.

1101
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,380
There are many people today.

1102
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,100
Perfect, you can all

1103
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:27,830
help me.

1104
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,220
Maybe I will dream of Father this time.

1105
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:30,790
Let's go.

1106
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,560
Follow me.

1107
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,480
Su Jiu'er.

1108
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,310
I promise you

1109
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,030
you'll dream of your father tonight.

1110
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,630
Come here.

1111
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,050
What?

1112
00:41:59,350 --> 00:41:59,710
Look.

1113
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,490
I bought these

1114
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,840
for you.
