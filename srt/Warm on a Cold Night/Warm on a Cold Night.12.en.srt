00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,830
Nanfeng Studio?

8
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,450
Although these three scars

9
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,880
are on the wolf's head,

10
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,700
it's rather similar

11
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,020
to the portrait

12
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,250
Father painted.

13
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,340
Could it be that he saw the Qi man

14
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,340
when he was painting?

15
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,520
She said she broke her leg

16
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,020
and asked me to go patrolling with others,

17
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,460
but she actually went to the art exhibition

18
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,770
with someone else.

19
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,380
It's really because of that girl?

20
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,290
I'm looking for evidence.

21
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,470
Do you still want this rabbit lantern?

22
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:32,940
No.

23
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:33,900
Fine.

24
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,570
I'll send it

25
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,320
to her later.

26
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm sure she'll like it.

27
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Why give it to her?

28
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,850
To thank her for saving you for me,

29
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,680
and toady up to her so she will look for Mu Yan.

30
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,050
You can give it to anyone

31
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,850
but her.

32
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,970
So what?

33
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,980
What are you afraid of?

34
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,270
I...

35
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,940
I'm not scared.

36
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,990
I'll give it to her then.

37
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,750
You...

38
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,400
Isn't that...

39
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,020
Han Zheng.

40
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,500
General.

41
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,680
Who are you?

42
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,660
My partner told me

43
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,500
she broke her leg,

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,120
so she needed to go home to rest.

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,320
Do we know each other?

46
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,140
What do you mean?

47
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,530
You don't know me?

48
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:23,780
Why are you here too?

49
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,310
It's none of your business.

50
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,390
You're usually clever,

51
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,130
but now you're being slow.

52
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,280
Brother Han and General must be dressed up like this

53
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,079
to attend the lantern festival.

54
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,860
Bravo!

55
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,890
Why are you here

56
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,060
instead of working?

57
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,020
How do you know

58
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,980
we're not working?

59
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,220
We're here to investigate a case.

60
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,150
Why would you bring something like this to work a case?

61
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,480
What's wrong with that?

62
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,070
Monster!

63
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,550
Monster! Where is it?

64
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,780
Monster! Run!

65
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:22,810
This...

66
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,030
No matter how I look at it,

67
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,630
it doesn't look like a human.

68
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,830
Why do I feel like

69
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,360
that painting came to life?

70
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,620
He's a Qian.

71
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,100
He died less than a day ago.

72
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,890
His face...

73
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,840
Don't touch it.

74
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,010
It might be a trick.

75
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,280
The head was stitched on.

76
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,580
I just want to see

77
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,380
if he has three scars on his face.

78
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,700
Three scars?

79
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,950
The Inspection Bureau is working a case.

80
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,010
Please stand back.

81
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,900
What happened?

82
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,900
I heard someone died.

83
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,540
Someone died?

84
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,659
-It's a monster. -Someone died.

85
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:48,520
What happened?

86
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,390
How could this happen all of a sudden?

87
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,860
What kind of monster died?

88
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,940
I heard it's a monster

89
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,020
with the body of a human and head of a wolf.

90
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,490
The body of a human and head of a wolf?

91
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,540
It could be a Qi.

92
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,300
I heard someone stitched the wolf's head

93
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,180
onto a human's body.

94
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,940
Who would do something like that?

95
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,860
Wolf fur?

96
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,050
[Wolf Head]

97
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,960
You mean

98
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,540
a wolf's head was stitched onto a human's body?

99
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,500
Yes.

100
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,160
He died and was beheaded

101
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,040
before a wolf's head was stitched on.

102
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,350
But we have not found

103
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,660
the cause of death yet.

104
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,540
Lass.

105
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,230
Did you test the body

106
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,150
for poison yet?

107
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,340
Of course.

108
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
There's nothing.

109
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,090
Are there any scars

110
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,280
on the victim's body

111
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,940
that can verify his identity?

112
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,570
No.

113
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,700
It's strange.

114
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,450
It's too strange.

115
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,920
The murderer deliberately chose to dispose of the body

116
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,080
on the day of the lantern festival.

117
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,180
He even disposed of the body

118
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,300
by a crowded market.

119
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:44,980
Commander.

120
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,060
I understand—

121
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,380
The murderer wanted the body

122
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,650
to be found.

123
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,860
That's too strange.

124
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,200
Pass my order.

125
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,940
We will cooperate on this case with no separation between

126
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,400
main and deputy investigating officers.

127
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,990
We must find out the victim's identity

128
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,340
and cause of death within three days

129
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,590
in order to answer to the people!

130
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:00,920
Yes.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,320
Yes.

132
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:01,890
Yes.

133
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,690
What is this stupid woman hiding from me?

134
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,420
By then,

135
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,830
we can go to the scene...

136
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,170
Who can say for sure

137
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,290
when we're looking for a needle in a haystack?

138
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,350
Let's try our luck.

139
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,550
What...

140
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,020
What's wrong?

141
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,040
Don't you think

142
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,300
there are some things

143
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,580
you need to tell me?

144
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,340
Jiu'er.

145
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,230
Your fried dough sticks are ready.

146
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,290
Thank you, Sister Li.

147
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,150
Take your time.

148
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,220
Auntie Li.

149
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,490
Your Highness, have a taste

150
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,100
of this superlative Qian breakfast

151
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,060
before I tell you

152
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,590
why I appeared at the lantern festival

153
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,590
yesterday.

154
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,420
I don't care about that.

155
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,540
I want to know

156
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,140
how you knew

157
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,950
there were three scars on the wolf's head.

158
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,030
Oh no.

159
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,750
He found out.

160
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,670
Well...

161
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,130
Calm down, Your Highness.

162
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,460
Let me explain it to you.

163
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,390
But before I answer,

164
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,330
could you

165
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,740
answer a question of mine first?

166
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,180
No.

167
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,820
Fine.

168
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,470
I'll ask then.

169
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,270
General Chilan and you

170
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,260
were on a date yesterday, right?

171
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,060
Your eyes are dazed and your face is flushed.

172
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,220
Did I guess right?

173
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,560
Boring.

174
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,810
Do you Qian people

175
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,700
only have romance on your minds?

176
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,710

Fine.

You're a really strange woman.

192

You're horsing around with me

193
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,660
instead of doing your job.

194

Aren't you afraid that you won't find any leads

Since I knew

204
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,420
there were three scars on the wolf's head,

205
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,620

This craftsmanship

231
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,780
looks familiar.

If I weren't familiar with Qi crafts,

this mask and scar

Was the body really

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,030
exactly like the painting?

254
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,220
They were exactly the same.

So

258
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,740
you insisted on seeing if the wolf's head

259
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,790
had three scars

260
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,660
to confirm

261
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,780
if he's an exact imitation

262
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,710
of that painting?

263
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,120
Yes.

264

Even if that's the case,

for that painter right now?

267
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,720
Because the body's

268
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,340
right hand was stronger than its left hand.

269

It had calluses

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,230
was either a scholar

the Third Junior of my Master, Lin Zhixing.

352
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:17,930
Great.

353
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:18,960
Jiu'er.

354
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,980
You're lucky.

355
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:20,860
What?

356
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,020
Lucky?

357
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,520
Master Lin

358
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,450
is the most handsome man

359
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,510
in Nanfeng Studio.

360
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,700
Godfather...

361
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,430
Let's go.

362
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,020
Brother Lin.

363
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,650
Master Ming.

364
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,820
Long time no see.

365
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,990
Long time no see.

366
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,320
Is there a new opera?

367
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,020
Thank you for your concern.

368
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,860
I haven't finished my new work yet.

369
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,520
You're famously meticulous.

370
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,920
Unlike me, I'm too impatient.

371
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,460
Master always said

372
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,790
I should learn from you.

373
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,860
You flatter me.

374
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,740
His Highness is elegant

375
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,660
and eloquent.

376
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,660
Didn't he say

377
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,190
he's the most handsome man here?

378
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,720
He doesn't seem that great.

379
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,100
Of course.

380
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,900
The so-called Master Ming

381
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,030
is just an investor.

382
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,900
As long as you spend enough money,

383
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,160
that could be you, too.

384
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,760
Of course.

385
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,700
Of course.

386
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,630
-Brother Lin. -Godfather.

387
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,580
Do you have any new works?

388
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,580
Let's take a look.

389
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,220
The studio has a few new works

390
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,380
of the Painting Immortal Bridge.

391
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,510
Let me walk with you.

392
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,140
Brother Lin, to be honest,

393
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,920
I'm not here to see paintings.

394
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,100
Well,

395
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,500
a painting from the studio was involved

396
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,180
in something strange that happened recently.

397
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,060
My two friends

398
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,540
are here to investigate this matter,

399
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,860
so we want to talk to the painter.

400
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,260
Which painting?

401
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,060
It's "Wolf-headed Man Roaming at Night"

402
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,650
by Master Xu Youdao.

403
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,760
Eldest Senior?

404
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,350
What?

405
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,230
Can't we see him?

406
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,260
That's not it.

407
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,260
But at this hour,

408
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,310
Eldest Senior must be working.

409
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,780
How about this?

410
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,130
I'll inform him first.

411
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,400
Guards!

412
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:14,550
Senior.

413
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,180
He has to be informed about a simple meeting.

414
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,260
Is he clearing

415
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,720
incriminating evidence?

416
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,750
When Eldest Senior is ready,

417
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,079
I'll take you to see him.

418
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,760
Thank you, Brother Lin.

419
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,700
Everyone,

420
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,680
we have some free time.

421
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,200
Are you in the mood to admire some paintings?

422
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,580
Sure.

423
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,540
Sure.

424
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,220
This is

425
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,060
Nanfeng Studio's Painting Immortal Bridge.

426
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,020
Good name.

427
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,220
I'm sorry.

428
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,500
I was attracted by the parrot

429
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,080
in the garden,

430
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
so I was held back.

431
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,280
Master Ming saw Buzhi?

432
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,650
It doesn't show itself to just anyone.

433
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,250
Really?

434
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,360
What is that painting?

435
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,820
Why haven't I seen it before?

436
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,140
Xu Youdao is his senior.

437
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,380
In other words,

438
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,310
he's the junior.

439
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,180
The junior is standing in as the head of the studio.

440
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,270
The relationships in Nanfeng Studio

441
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,650
seem rather complex.

442
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,460
I wonder

443
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,980
if we can detect anything

444
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,700
from their paintings.

445
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,820
Su Jiu'er,

446
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,200
the Qian have a saying,

447
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,300
"Lust addles the mind."

448
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,970
Do you know what it means?

449
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,300
Yes, I do.

450
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,620
It means that

451
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,590
after Prince Han went to the lantern festival

452
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,060
with the general yesterday,

453
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,460
you became very strange.

454
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Do you want to die?

455
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:52,930
I dare not.

456
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,460
But Your Highness,

457
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,490
I haven't

458
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,920
broken your rule of late.

459
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,730
Why are you behaving so strange

460
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,440
towards me?

461
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,310
Who said you didn't

462
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,210
break my rule?

463
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,750
I have another rule.

464
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,850
Those who work with me

465
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,590
must be focused.

466
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,010
I am focused.

467
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,430
You seem to be investigating the case,

468
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,440
but you're getting distracted by his looks.

469
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,300
Can this count as focusing?

470
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,820
Get rid of that burden

471
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,550
immediately

472
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,750
and go find the culprit.

473
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,600
Your Highness.

474
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,250
Firstly,

475
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,130
the only thing on my mind is the case,

476
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,140
not his looks.

477
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,580
Secondly,

478
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,060
didn't you say it too?

479
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,620
Without His Highness,

480
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,670
it'll be hard to work this case.

481
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,680
What a joke.

482
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,420
Can't I handle this case

483
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,620
without him?

484
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,200
It's not that you can't,

485
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,000
but that it'll take more effort.

486
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,380
Isn't it a waste of time to look at paintings?

487
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,230
Your Highness.

488
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,120
Think about it.

489
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,270
If there is really something wrong

490
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,350
with this place,

491
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,040
shouldn't we take the chance

492
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,460
to scope it out

493
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,990
while they're distracted?

494
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,250
How?

495
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,900
This is called the "Immortal Crane Painting."

496
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,150
Let me scope it out for you.

497
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,490
I'll show you

498
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,170
the Inspection Bureau's basic skills

499
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,460
in interrogation and investigation

500
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,710
right this minute.

501
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,510
There's a flower on the peacock's tail,

502
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,990
a bug in the flower,

503
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,910
a water droplet on the bug,

504
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,070
and a reflection of the peacock

505
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,980
on the water droplet.

506
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,100
How marvelous.

507
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,580
This painter should be

508
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,290
a meticulous person.

509
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,840
He pays such close attention to detail.

510
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,260
I'm afraid even the brushes he uses everyday

511
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,980
must be well-organized.

512
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:44,780
Yes.

513
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,540
This painting is the work of

514
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,300
my master's junior, Ji Fengping.

515
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:48,900
He only uses special

516
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
small brushes.

517
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,340
He is very particular.

518
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,850
He makes them all himself.

519
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,430
This painting is quite exotic.

520
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,420
The painter must have studied in another country.

521
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,820
He's very particular with the use of color.

522
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,440
This painter should be someone who is

523
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,880
gentle and short-spoken,

524
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,530
but meticulous and orderly.

525
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,920
This must be the work of your junior, Feng Muyuan,

526
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,870
right?

527
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:23,670
Yes.

528
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,820
Junior doesn't talk much.

529
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,060
He only loves painting.

530
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,260
And he dislikes being in the limelight.

531
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,790
I don't believe

532
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,250
you could get something out of this one.

533
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,300
This painting...

534
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,860
This painting is really special.

535
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,140
Su Jiu'er.

536
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,450
Just you wait.

537
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,660
What do you mean?

538
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,180
The lush flowers and the grotesque vase

539
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,580
stand in stark contrast.

540
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,630
This painter must be someone

541
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,580
whose appearance is inconsistent

542
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,780
with their true self.

543
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,930
But I don't know

544
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,800
whether he's trying to express

545
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,030
the beauty of the flowers

546
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,890
or the grotesqueness of the vase.

547
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,180
Master Lin,

548
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,810
what do you think?

549
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:19,920
Well...

550
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,380
I can't say.

551
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,060
Why?

552
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,520
Because this was painted by

553
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,470
Master Lin.

554
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,810
Master Lin.

555
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,430
I was just guessing.

556
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,060
Don't take it to heart.

557
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,510
It doesn't matter.

558
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,580
What you said is quite interesting.

559
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,700
You're knowledgeable about painting.

560
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,900
Would you come with me

561
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,730
to look at some other paintings?

562
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,740
Of course!

563
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,240
How is this considered an interrogation?

564
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,670
It's just flattery.

565
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,170
If I don't rope him in,

566
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,570
how would he lower his guard

567
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,300
and tell us what we want to know?

568
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,040
Let's go.

569
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,290
This painting

570
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,660
is good.

571
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,420
You have good taste.

572
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,500
This painting is called "The Immortal in the Painting."

573
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,360
It's my master, Wei Gonglin's

574
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,990
swan song.

575
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,770
There are countless paintings of the Painting Immortal Bridge,

576
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,280
but you chose this one.

577
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,720
This painting smells wrong.

578
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,730
It's a view of the big picture.

579
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,040
Well said!

580
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,560
What you said

581
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,770
is very true.

582
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,820
Right?

583
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,650
You didn't get anything

584
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,670
out of him.

585
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,180
But this is clearly a painting

586
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,820
of snow in Jiuxiao City.

587
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,020
Why is it called "The Immortal in the Painting"?

588
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,500
Well...

589
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,050
there are reasons for it.

590
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,060
Senior.

591
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,280
Everyone.

592
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,710
Eldest Senior is in the courtyard.

593
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,040
I'll take you there now.

594
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,510
But before we go,

595
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,790
could you promise me one thing?

596
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,660
What is it?

597
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,020
Eldest Senior spent many years

598
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,380
in the land of the barbarians.

599
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,110
I hope you all

600
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,020
will not be surprised

601
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,280
by his weird behavior.

602
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,380
Let's go.

603
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,470
This way, please.

604
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,070
What's that smell?

605
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,380
Godfather.

606
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,510
There's a painting.

607
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,880
It's so disgusting.

608
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,210
Is this...

609
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,220
Xu Youdao?

610
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,100
Yet another guy

611
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,500
who likes to play tricks.

612
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,120
Don't misunderstand.

613
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,340
This cat died when it ingested a poisonous plant by accident.

614
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,980
Eldest Senior felt bad for it.

615
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,710
Don't worry.

616
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,220
There's no misunderstanding.

617
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,830
We just think

618
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,110
it's a little strange.

619
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,090
I'm out of spiritual energy today.

620
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,520
[Qian, Xu Youdao]

621
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,900
I shouldn't paint anymore.

622
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,520
Eldest Senior.

623
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,910
These are friends of Master Ming.

624
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,420
They heard about one of your paintings,

625
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,020
so they came to meet with you.

626
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,660
Everyone.

627
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,000
Senior asks which painting it is.

628
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,590
"Wolf-headed Man Roaming at Night."

629
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,260
He asks

630
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,920
what you want to know.

631
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,530
We want to ask,

632
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,100
Master Xu,

633
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,810
when you were working on this painting,

634
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,940
did you have a model?

635
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,260
Senior means to say

636
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,900
inspiration came to him all of a sudden.

637
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,260
There was no model to speak of.

638
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
He's not a mute.

639
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,860
Why do you have to speak for him?

640
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,180
Eldest Senior

641
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,110
doesn't like to talk to strangers.

642
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,520
What did that mean?

643
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,260
He meant to say you all don't understand painting.

644
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,790
He wants to go and rest,

645
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,780
and doesn't want to talk to you all anymore.

646
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,160
Wait!

647
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,210
Han Zheng.

648
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,530
Han Zheng.

649
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Don't act rashly.

650
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,500
This is a famous painting studio.

651
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,630
It has many backers.

652
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
Young Master Han.

653
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,880
Senior wants you to step aside.

654
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,950
It's a waste of time

655
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,630
to talk the way you're talking.

656
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,230
Xu Youdao,

657
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,090
I'll be honest with you.

658
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,000
A headless corpse

659
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,210
appeared in the market yesterday.

660
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,280
A wolf's head

661
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,220
was stitched onto it.

662
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,580
The pose and the setting

663
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,860
were exactly the same

664
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,100
as those in your painting.

665
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,560
What...

666
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,630
What?

667
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,740
A headless corpse?

668
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,280
Also,

669
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,130
we are not

670
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,700
not painting aficionados.

671
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,000
We are on duty from the Inspection Bureau

672
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,130
and we're here

673
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,740
to arrest you.

674
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,580
He's not a suspect yet.

675
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,230
Who are you?

676
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,740
So many people have seen my painting.

677
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,200
Why do you only suspect me?

678
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,180
Because

679
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,910
I wanted to provoke you.

680
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,540
What?

681
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,980
Why did you want to provoke me?

682
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,040
If you don't speak,

683
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,690
who will explain the situation to me?

684
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:53,090
Speak.

685
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,030
Why does that room

686
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,860
smell of human blood?

687
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,530
Let’s go.

688
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,630
-Slow down, lass. -Your Highness.

689
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,350
Be careful.

690
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,260
Don't act rashly, Your Highness.

691
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,590
These are my treasures.

692
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,900
Why would there be human blood?

693
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,170
We'll know when we open the door.

694
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,050
You can't open it!

695
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:09,820
I can't let you

696
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,350
taint my spiritual energy!

697
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,660
Senior.

698
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,850
There are so many animal specimens here.

699
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,820
It's normal for the room to smell of blood.

700
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,950
Did you get it wrong?

701
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,170
Look at that.

702
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,020
Don't touch it.

703
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,460
Don't touch it.

704
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,580
Look carefully.

705
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,300
Does its fur color and size

706
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,970
match the head on the corpse?

707
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,480
You tainted my spiritual energy.

708
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,250
You tainted my...

709
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,340
My...

710
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,030
My baby!

711
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,150
Eldest Senior?

712
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,310
Where is my baby's head?

713
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,540
Where is my baby's head?

714
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,200
How would we know?

715
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,020
Who did this?

716
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,310
Who did this?

717
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,660
Who did this?

718
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,190
Get up.

719
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,090
Don't touch me!

720
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,980
You want to make excuses?

721
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,310
I'm not making excuses.

722
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,190
Your Highness,

723
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,060
this room is usually not locked.

724
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,620
Losing the wolf's head

725
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,580
can't prove anything, right?

726
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,380
That's right.

727
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,420
I've been framed.

728
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,340
Eldest Senior.

729
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,940
You've been wronged, right?

730
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,390
Then tell me

731
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,500
what is hidden

732
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,060
inside.

733
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:49,850
Is...

734
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:52,990
Is there anything?

735
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,340
You still won't talk?

736
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,440
Let me help you.

737
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,370
S- Second Senior.

738
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,210
Are you pretending to be dead?

739
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,060
Get up.

740
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,340
You're good at pretending.

741
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,860
Hu, lock this place down immediately.

742
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,740
Don't let anyone damage the evidence.

743
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,100
Yes!

744
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,640
Eldest Senior.

745
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
Stop pretending.

746
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,350
Eldest Senior.

747
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,420
Jiu'er.

748
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,130
Is Xu Youdao really the murderer?

749
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,780
Maybe,

750
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,940
or maybe not.

751
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,560
Why don't I understand?

752
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,300
I keep feeling like if he is the murderer,

753
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,130
then there's something wrong with this studio.

754
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,720
W- What's wrong?

755
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,140
What's wrong with it?

756
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,860
What is it, Your Highness?

757
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,790
I've found the identity of the body

758
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,220
and the evidence for you.

759
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,200
It seems

760
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,610
that is so.

761
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,710
Since we've got him bang to rights,

762
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,070
leave the rest

763
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,690
to our

764
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,720
other partner.

765
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,590
What about us?

766
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,100
We're going to talk about

767
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,820
who it was that helped you

768
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,550
expend less effort, of course.

769
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,300
Let's go.

770
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,120
Where are we going?

771
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,650
Where are you going?

772
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,870
What's going on?

773
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,460
What happened?

774
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,900
The Inspection Bureau is on a case. Stand back.

775
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,160
They're in Senior's room.

776
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,290
Something happened to Second Senior.

777
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,650
I can't wake Xu Youdao up

778
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,230
no matter what.

779
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,390
That wolf's head

780
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,700
was hacked off

781
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,760
from his specimen.

782
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,500
Take him back.

783
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,500
Get someone to watch him.

784
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:06,980
Yes.

785
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,760
I've confirmed it.

786
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,770
That head matches the body.

787
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,540
The victim was Wei Gonglin's second disciple,

788
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,270
Wang Jirong.

789
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,070
Is the case solved then?

790
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,340
It...

791
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,500
It was solved just like that?

792
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,070
Didn't Jiu'er and Hanzheng

793
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,650
find the murderer?

794
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,860
Where are they?

795
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:25,980
Who knows what the two of them

796
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,820
are up to.

797
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,550
In my opinion,

798
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,940
we should go back to the bureau

799
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,910
to take the credit

800
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,780
for some good luck

801
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,840
and close the case.

802
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:33,940
Liu,

803
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,850
thank you for your hard work.

804
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,510
You haven't been home for so long.

805
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,310
Your child...

806
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,570
Bin must miss you.

807
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,240
That's great.

808
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,140
I'll go back now.

809
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,960
Let's drink some other day.

810
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,420
Dali.

811
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,300
Search carefully!

812
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,300
Don't let anything slip!

813
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,380
Yes!

814
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,540
Lass.

815
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,320
Han.

816
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,190
Where are those two?

817
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,450
Where did they go?

818
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,140
-Uncle Hu. -Your Highness.

819
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,580
Your Highness.

820
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,710
Have you found them?

821
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,270
N- No.

822
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,660
Stop hitting it.

823
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,660
I'm scared.

824
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,370
Help!

825
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,940
I'm really scared.

826
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,830
I'll tell you.

827
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,860
A- As your partner,

828
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,340
I was incompetent.

829
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,030
I couldn't help

830
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,440
getting addled by good looks

831
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,100
and almost messed up the case.

832
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,100
Thanks to you, Prince Han,

833
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,710
we found a lead quickly.

834
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,550
In the future...

835
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,910
In the future...

836
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,180
In the future,

837
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,750
I'll listen to

838
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,380
whatever you say.

839
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,260
You're right when you're right.

840
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,380
You're right when you're wrong, too.

841
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,780
I'll follow you closely.

842
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,260
I promise you.

843
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,420
I'll listen to you from now on.

844
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,300
Prince Han.

845
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,470
When can you

846
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,990
let me down?

847
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,840
I'm really going to fall.

848
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,659
You scared me.

849
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,360
You...

850
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,100
But Prince Han,

851
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,500
even though we found the head and wolf's body

852
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,739
in Xu Youdao's studio,

853
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,770
it's likely

854
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,159
he wasn't the murderer.

855
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,290
What evidence do you have?

856
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,150
Think about it.

857
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,699
When you opened the door,

858
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,030
was his studio locked?

859
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,380
I walked around

860
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,199
in his studio.

861
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,429
I found that he had many specimens,

862
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,420
and all of them were intact

863
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,580
with no flaws at all.

864
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,570
This means

865
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,719
he is usually very strict

866
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,820
with the quality of the specimens he collects.

867
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,280
How could someone like him

868
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,960
attach a head onto a body

869
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,580
using such clumsy stitches?

870
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,810
Think about it.

871
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,390
He killed someone and disposed of the body in a crowded market.

872
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,340
How could he return to his own studio

873
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,500
to paint?

874
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,300
Is he stupid?

875
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,480
So in your opinion,

876
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,790
what should we do next?

877
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,420
Let me think about it.

878
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:22,330
He...

879
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,350
I suddenly feel dizzy.

880
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,180
My brain

881
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,400
can't keep up.

882
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,480
You want to replenish your health, right?

883
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,740
How did you know?

884
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,330
In that case,

885
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,680
I'll help you with it.

886
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:45,940
Really?

887
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,060
Why am I up here again?

888
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,180
Could you please let me down?

889
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,040
I knew it,

890
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,640
you didn't reflect on yourself.

891
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,500
How about this?

892
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,720
I'm leaving to investigate the case.

893
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,770
You should think carefully about

894
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,310
what you should do

895
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,550
to have your health replenished.

896
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,100
Hold on to this.

897
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,220
I- I'm scared.

898
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,320
Han Zheng.

899
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,120
Han Zheng!

900
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,790
Don't go, I'm really scared.

901
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,190
What a fool!

902
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,610
Where did those fools

903
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,340
from the Inspection Bureau go?

904
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,790
Your Highness.

905
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,310
I can't run anymore.

906
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,650
The people from the Inspection Bureau

907
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,330
took the suspect away.

908
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,440
Could it be that Miss Jiu'er

909
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,640
has returned to the Inspection Bureau?

910
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,080
I don't believe it.

911
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,710
Jiu'er

912
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,500
won't leave me behind.

913
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,540
Your Highness.

914
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,270
Listen to me.

915
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,060
Your Highness!

916
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,350
Your Highness!

917
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,250
I know I was wrong.

918
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,760
Save me!

919
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,510
There are wolves in the mountain!

920
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,780
She's still not behaving?

921
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,040
Wouldn't I smell it if there were wolves?

922
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,550
It's Jiu'er!

923
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,880
Your Highness!

924
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,740
Wait for me!

925
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,980
Your Highness!

926
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,690
It's good to split up.

927
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,080
I want to see

928
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,660
who cracks the case sooner,

929
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,790
you and that burden,

930
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,010
or me.

931
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,300
Help!

932
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,620
Someone is hanging from the tree.

933
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,130
She can't come down.

934
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,330
There are so many people in Nanfeng Studio.

935
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,120
Why isn't there at least someone

936
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,320
coming to the mountains to fell firewood?

937
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,930
Jiu'er!

938
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,640
I'm here to save you!

939
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,970
Your Highness, slow down.

940
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:22,450
Jiu'er.

941
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,460
Your Highness, wait for me.

942
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,100
Jun.

943
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,400
-Here. -I'm here.

944
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,540
Your Highness!

945
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,970
Let me do it!

946
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:29,680
I'll do it.

947
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,900
-Han Zheng! -Lass.

948
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,140
Wait.

949
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,860
Where's Han Zheng?

950
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,460
Jiu'er,

951
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,060
why were you on the tree?

952
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,540
Jun.

953
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,940
Have you seen Han Zheng?

954
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,580
No.

955
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,240
Liu Fu, did you see him?

956
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,260
No.

957
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,990
Come on, lass.

958
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,760
Drink some water.

959
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,040
Why didn't he save you?

960
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,940
He was the one

961
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,160
who put me on the tree.

962
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,700
-Why? -Why?

963
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,700
Why?

964
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,120
Because...

965
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,940
I can't say he suspects me of

966
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,690
getting addled by men's looks.

967
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,020
Because he thinks

968
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,590
Xu Youdao was the murderer,

969
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,700
but I don't.

970
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,930
So the two of us

971
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,930
had

972
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,230
a small disagreement.

973
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,420
That's impossible.

974
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,790
This young man

975
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,750
is rather domineering,

976
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,980
but he doesn't seem brainless.

977
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,640
Godfather!

978
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,260
Whose side are you on?

979
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,540
Yours.

980
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,940
It's unsurprising that

981
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,540
there's something wrong with his brain.

982
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,100
Lass.

983
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,120
Let's go back to the Inspection Bureau.

984
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,950
Let's go.

985
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,300
Godfather.

986
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,780
We're running out of time.

987
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,140
Why are we going back to the Inspection Bureau?

988
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,720
I know

989
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,820
you're angry with Han Zheng.

990
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,260
But what's most important now

991
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,820
is that Yue Daren, that bastard,

992
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,840
has arrested Xu Youdao

993
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,980
and brought him to the magistrate's office.

994
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,980
What does he want?

995
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,120
He clearly wants to

996
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,530
take credit for the case.

997
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,260
Are we going to let him have his way?

998
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,060
Of course not.

999
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,420
But

1000
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,090
let him do what he wants.

1001
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,690
I don't care.

1002
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,950
Why not?

1003
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,030
Uncle Hu.

1004
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,340
Have you forgotten what Jiu'er said?

1005
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,670
She thinks Xu Youdao wasn't the murderer.

1006
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,260
Jun knows me well.

1007
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm guessing

1008
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,340
you want to stay here

1009
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,820
to find a new lead before Han Zheng does?

1010
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,490
When I find a lead,

1011
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,660
if he still refuses to apologize,

1012
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,120
I'll...

1013
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,820
You'll...

1014
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:15,980
Never mind.

1015
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,440
Let's not talk about this.

1016
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,860
Godfather.

1017
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,890
Next, we...

1018
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,990
Next, let's do this.

1019
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:31,340
Tianyun.

1020
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,480
You've worked hard.

1021
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,600
Leave him to me.

1022
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,910
You've worked hard.

1023
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:47,750
Dali.

1024
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,270
Boss.

1025
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,670
Keep watch outside.

1026
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,080
The credit must be ours.

1027
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,420
Don't worry, Boss.

1028
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,430
I can definitely keep

1029
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,030
a lass

1030
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,250
and a Qi away.

1031
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,270
Come on.

1032
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,030
With me here,

1033
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,090
we'll see who can enter this prison.

1034
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,110
A bunch of fools.

1035
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,660
Can the likes of you

1036
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,720
stop me from investigating the case?

1037
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,040
A murderer who will make a body look like a painting

1038
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,830
and depose of it in a crowded market

1039
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,950
must have

1040
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,760
a motive deeper than murder.

1041
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:35,660
We'll let Han Zheng

1042
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,990
interrogate Xu Youdao.

1043
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,980
We'll take the chance

1044
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,670
to interrogate everyone else.

1045
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,300
We must find out the relationship

1046
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,840
between Wang Jirong and Xu Youdao.

1047
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,320
There must be something

00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,210
hidden deep beneath the surface.

Nanfeng Studio's name list is here.

Let me take a look.

1054
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,340
W- Why are there so many people

1055
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,500
in Nanfeng Studio?

1056
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,400
Not at all.

1057
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,890
There's just over 120.

1058
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,340
100...

1059
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,140
How long

1060
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,160
will this take me?

00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,220
He died like a painting.

1062
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,030
Could you be

1063
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,410
behind this?

[Painting of a Snow Night in Jiuxiao City]

Tell me

1066
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,780
what kind of person

1067
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,620
Wang Jirong was.

1068
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,870
Did he have any enemies?

1069
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,100
What did he have to do with Xu Youdao?

1070
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,940
Wang Jirong?

1071
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,020
He...

1072
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,290
So what if he was good at painting?

1073
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,690
He was rotten.

1074
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,600
He had always been weird.

1075
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,180
He was moody and mean.

1076
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,780
But his relationship with Master Xu

1077
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,580
was very good.

1078
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,530
Master Xu was hard to please,

1079
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,690
but he was very tolerating

1080
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,550
of Master Wang.

1081
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,700
I've heard

1082
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,370
they grew up in the studio.

1083
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,780
They were like real brothers.

1084
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,180
He didn't like painting.

1085
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,380
He only loved money.

1086
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,310
He was greedy and loved gambling.

1087
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,600
None of our disciples

1088
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,460
were willing to

1089
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,610
serve him.

[Qian, Feng Muyuan]

I’m their 6th junior.

1092
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:12,280
I've heard that Eldest Senior

1093
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,430
lent him some money

1094
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,390
and redeemed

1095
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,480
a painting he sold.

1096
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,460
Several disciples

1097
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,180
in Nanfeng Studio

1098
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,380
consigned their paintings

1099
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,850
to collectors.

1100
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,130
He was a child-disciple.

1101
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,620
Master raised him,

1102
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,150
so naturally, he was more arrogant.

1103
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,140
Eldest Senior and Second Senior

1104
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,070
were very close.

1105
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,230
I don't believe

1106
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,220
Eldest Senior would do anything

1107
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,110
to hurt him.

1108
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,470
