[He'an Hall]

5
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,410
Between the 21st and 23rd year

6
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,250
of the Dingkun reign,

7
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,560
there was a serial murder case.

8
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,330
My father passed away

9
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
in the 3rd year of the Dingkun reign.

10
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,530
During the 3rd month of the 21st year,

11
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,540
the first victim appeared.

12
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,720
During the 7th month of the 23rd year.

13
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,740
the fourth victim appeared.

14
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,850
This victim

15
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,430
was a Qi.

16
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,330
Father.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,600
Father.

18
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,530
These victims had all been wearing

19
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,030
clothing,

20
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,430
Am I dreaming?

21
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,700
accessories,

22
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,050
or

23
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,510
sachets with peony patterns on them.

24
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,100
But why can I see Father

25
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,900
so clearly?

26
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,480
Father.

27
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,460
Come in.

28
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,329
Why are you here?

29
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,050
Han Zheng.

30
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,079
Why are you...

31
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,790
So

32
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,030
I really am dreaming.

33
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,470
That victim of the Qi race

34
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,920
was Kaka's mother.

35
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,210
According to Kaka,

36
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,420
his mother was 7 chi tall,

37
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,520
even taller than

38
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,060
than ordinary Qian men.

39
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,260
According to the coroner,

40
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,360
the victims died from

41
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,290
blunt force trauma to their heads.

42
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,610
Therefore,

43
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,970
the weapon was very likely

44
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,200
something like a metal rod

45
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,070
or a hard stone.

46
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,940
In that case,

47
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,710
the murderer should be

48
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,010
a tall man in his prime.

49
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,550
But the victims

50
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,060
were neither raped

51
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,840
nor robbed.

52
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,660
It shows that the culprit's intentions

53
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,970
were elsewhere.

54
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,770
Father seems to agree with you.

55
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,930
If only you weren't the person

56
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,230
who killed Godfather.

57
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,170
How nice would that be?

58
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,110
The Inspection Bureau and the Law Department

59
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,659
have been scouring the moat for three days.

60
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,840
They found eight bodies in total.

61
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,200
Among them,

62
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,460
there are four people whose time of death

63
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,740
matches that of the Peony Case.

64
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,060
Three are male,

65
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,370
and one is female.

66
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,360
Judging from their physiques,

67
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,340
one of the three male corpses

68
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,160
had a tall and large build,

69
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,530
and was at least 8 chi tall.

70
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,260
One of them was small and short,

71
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,880
Short?

72
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,100
around 6 chi tall.

73
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,730
Another one was 7 chi tall,

74
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,040
but rather skinny and feeble.

75
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,930
Thin?

76
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,440
What's wrong?

77
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,190
Nothing.

78
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:20,980
Go on.

79
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,100
Look at your drawing.

80
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,590
Who can understand it?

81
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,330
Jiu'er understands.

82
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,250
You care a lot about Jiu'er, don't you?

83
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,409
Although Jiu'er might never

84
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,810
talk to me again,

85
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,490
it's okay.

86
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,920
I'll still care about her.

87
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,010
It really is a dream.

88
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,080
[Girl, slim, short, tall]

89
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,420
This is great.

90
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,860
I got the details of the case sorted out

91
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,220
in my dream.

92
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,710
But

93
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,520
why did I dream of Han Zheng?

94
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,300
Eldest Brother,

95
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,200
if you feel unwell,

96
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,770
tell me.

97
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,950
Is this pressure suitable?

98
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,350
What? Too hard?

99
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,230
Enough.

100
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,980
You've done enough.

101
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,030
What do you want? Tell me.

102
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,350
Eldest Brother.

103
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,080
It's nothing much.

104
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,420
I just want to ask you something.

105
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,780
Aren't you in charge of

106
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,100
relations with the Qi?

107
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,380
You know them well.

108
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,700
I've heard that after a Qian

109
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,230
ingests the Qi Vital Stone,

110
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,460
it might not only damage their body,

111
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,940
but also cause sudden death.

112
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,100
Is there anything else?

113
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,900
Why do you ask?

114
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,740
Well...

115
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,650
Well,

116
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,620
I've been writing a script recently.

117
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,570
There is a Qian character in it

118
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,820
who is taking Qi Vital Stones.

119
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,820
I just want to know

120
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,659
what will happen to that person.

121
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,890
What you mentioned regarding the damage to the body

122
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,020
and death

123
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,140
will only happen

124
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,670
after prolonged and excessive consumption.

125
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,500
Consumption in small amounts over a short period of time

126
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,590
wouldn't have

127
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,210
such serious consequences.

128
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,830
On the contrary,

129
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,310
it will sharpen your five senses,

130
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,110
energize you,

131
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,810
and strengthen your body.

132
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,100
That's good.

133
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,030
But...

134
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,610
But what?

135
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,100
But taking

136
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,740
a particular Qi's Qi Vital Stone

137
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,620
will cause them

138
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,960
to form a strange connection.

139
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,660
Strange connection?

140
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,470
What do you mean?

141
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,740
This Qi Vital Stone is powerful.

142
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,919
It seems to be able to

143
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,260
connect two people's senses,

144
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,020
allowing them to experience synchronicity.

145
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,820
Synchronicity?

146
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,260
The most common example is

147
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,890
when the Qi

148
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,900
can enter into

149
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,100
this person's dream.

150
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,110
And this person

151
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,260
can see everything

152
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,210
the Qi is going through

153
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,280
in their dream.

154
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,720
I can't believe it.

155
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,330
That means

156
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,700
they can see each other

157
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,210
in their dreams every night.

158
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,140
You can say that.

159
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,370
Oh my god.

160
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,180
T- This isn't right.

161
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,740
How can they meet in their dreams?

162
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,200
This...

163
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:58,640
I...

164
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,130
Tell me.

165
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,190
Since Miss Jiu'er

166
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,020
is dreaming of Prince Han every night,

167
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,550
wouldn't it be easier for her to fall in love with him?

168
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,010
That's what I'm afraid of!

169
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,310
I- I'm not afraid

170
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,660
something will happen between Jiu'er and Brother Han.

171
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,660
I'm afraid my script will be ruined.

172
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,890
You...

173
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,790
I watched you grow up.

174
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,470
There are two things about you.

175
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,170
The first is that

176
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,700
you wake up very late.

177
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,590
The second is that

178
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,060
when you don't need anything,

179
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,620
you will never think of me.

180
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,480
You came to me of your own accord,

181
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,410
and so early in the morning at that.

182
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,510
Is there another possible reason for it

183
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,840
other than Miss Jiu'er?

184
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,290
Well...

185
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,590
I just wanted to...

186
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,410
Tell me.

187
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,340
Why did Miss Jiu'er

188
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,860
consume a Qi Vital Stone?

189
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,220
She...

190
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,640
It has been really hard on her.

191
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,260
She has had a strange disease since she was young.

192
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,130
She is losing her five senses

193
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,100
and her body is weak.

194
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,380
But it's strange.

195
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,500
Whenever she comes into contact with Brother Han,

196
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,160
her symptoms are alleviated.

197
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,460
Really?

198
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,090
Yes.

199
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,550
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

200
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,810
I wouldn't believe it.

201
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,480
Brother Han

202
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,850
is in prison now.

203
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,780
In order to treat Jiu'er,

204
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,540
he had to secretly

205
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,540
make her consume his Qi Vital Stone.

206
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,630
I see.

207
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,360
I was worried at first.

208
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,980
I was worried about

209
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,300
Brother Han's health.

210
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,270
I also suggested

211
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,020
we get some Qi Vital Stone

212
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,140
from other places.

213
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,550
But he didn't agree.

214
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,350
Now that I'm thinking about it,

215
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,410
he's really taking advantage of her.

216
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,540
Then is spending all your time with Miss Jiu'er

217
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,140
while Prince Han is in prison

218
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,990
not taking advantage of her?

219
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,160
You're right.

220
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,470
We'll play fair

221
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,430
and compete fairly then.

222
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,450
Eldest Brother,

223
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,760
I'll take my leave.

224
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,110
Just go.

225
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,280
[He'an Hall]

226
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,860
Jiu'er.

227
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,560
Bring that over.

228
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,180
Okay.

229
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:11,910
Jiu'er.

230
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,180
Jun.

231
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,430
Morning.

232
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,090
Morning, Your Highness.

233
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,430
Jiu'er.

234
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,070
Go talk inside

235
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,060
with Prince Jun.

236
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,730
Let's go, Jun.

237
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,050
Go.

238
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:29,960
Jun.

239
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,790
Why are you here so early?

240
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,350
Is there something urgent?

241
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,000
It's nothing serious.

242
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,450
It's just that

243
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,330
I had a strange dream yesterday,

244
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,760
so I stopped by.

245
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,780
A strange dream?

246
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,420
What strange dream?

247
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,340
Well,

248
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,940
I dreamed of Brother Han yesterday.

249
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,530
You dreamed of him too?

250
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,510
Too?

251
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,860
She did dream of Brother Han.

252
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,830
You dreamed of him too?

253
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,230
What did you dream about?

254
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,580
It's strange.

255
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,830
He appeared in my dream

256
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,740
and discussed the case with my father.

257
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,540
He also said

258
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,980
he cares a lot about me.

259
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,180
He cares a lot about you?

260
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,940
He means he cares a lot

261
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,200
about the Peony Case I'm investigating.

262
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,220
Not only is he seeing you

263
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:33,980
in the dream,

264
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,860
he even dragged your father along.

265
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,750
He's up to no good.

266
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,000
Jun.

267
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,310
Look at this.

268
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:48,890
No.

269
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,410
I can't tell her.

270
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,690
He and Jiu'er meet every night,

271
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
so I'll accompany Jiu'er every day.

272
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,680
Jun.

273
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,760
What did you dream of?

274
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,200
Me?

275
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,590
I dreamed that

276
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,130
he shapeshifted into a huge wolf dog.

277
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,810
I threw a branch for him,

278
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,900
and he picked it up.

279
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,160
I even petted his head.

280
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,800
Jiu'er.

281
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,300
What are you doing today?

282
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,410
I didn't sleep well last night.

283
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,660
I want to take a nap later.

284
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,520
When I wake up,

285
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,880
I'll go to Uncle Liu's

286
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,260
to investigate the Peony Case.

287
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:22,860
There's no need

288
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,820
for a nap.

289
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,500
We don't have much time left.

290
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,320
Kaka wants us

291
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,460
to solve the case as soon as possible.

292
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,640
Let's go find Uncle Liu right now.

293
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,170
Let's go.

294
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,480
Hurry up.

295
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,200
Time is of the utmost importance.

296
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,340
Look.

297
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,870
We're almost there.

298
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,850
It dropped.

299
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,860
Let me help you.

300
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,700
No.

301
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,480
That's against the rules.

302
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,530
You said you wanted to buy a gift.

303
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,390
I didn't expect you to buy so many.

304
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,340
I didn't know how hard Uncle Liu had it

305
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,820
until I talked to you.

306
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,800
Bin's mother died right after

307
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,730
giving birth to him.

308
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,190
He is also a little slow.

309
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,650
All these years, Uncle Liu had to take care of Bin

310
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,650
while working.

311
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,710
How did he get through it alone?

312
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,260
Bin needs someone by his side.

313
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,970
Uncle Liu often comes in late and leaves early

314
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,530
because

315
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,940
he has to return home to take care of Bin.

316
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,740
Otherwise, with his qualifications,

317
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,000
he'll at least be a Senior Inspector now.

318
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:13,870
Here we are.

319
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,510
Uncle Liu.

320
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,020
Bin.

321
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:21,760
Jiu'er.

322
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,020
Are you sure

323
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,160
Bin will like this?

324
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,420
Of course.

325
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,150
All kids like these things.

326
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,060
Open the door. I'm Su Jiu'er.

327
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,910
[Qian, Bin]

328
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,160
Sister Jiu'er!

329
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,730
Why are you here?

330
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:36,860
Good boy.

331
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,590
He is Bin?

332
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,180
Yes.

333
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,660
Sister Jiu'er.

334
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,320
Prince Jun.

335
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,460
You're here?

336
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,190
Uncle Liu, they're here!

337
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,900
Father, Sister Jiu'er is here.

338
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,610
Come in.

339
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,190
Come in.

340
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:56,670
Come in.

341
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,260
Let's go.

342
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,200
Prince Jun

343
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,310
bought these toys

344
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,620
for Bin.

345
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:04,520
Look.

346
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,500
Your Highness.

347
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,760
You bought so many things for him.

348
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,710
Thank you.

349
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,370
Bin.

350
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,700
His Highness bought

351
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,700
so many toys for you.

352
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,630
Haven't you forgotten something?

353
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:14,860
Thank you.

354
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,160
Thank you everyone.

355
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,810
Thank you.

356
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,290
You're welcome, Bin.

357
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,060
They gave you this.

358
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,620
Why are you giving it to me?

359
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,850
Because we're friends.

360
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,760
It's okay.

361
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,110
I'll leave it with you.

362
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,310
I'll come to you if I want to play with it.

363
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,400
Kaka.

364
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,970
Bring Bin out to play.

365
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,380
I'm going to talk

366
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,060
with Prince Jun and Jiu'er.

367
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,460
Okay.

368
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,390
Let's go.

369
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,430
Your Highness.

370
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,420
I'll take them out to play.

371
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,430
Be careful.

372
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,180
Okay.

373
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,220
Your Highness, there's nothing

374
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,450
I can offer you.

375
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,760
This is some biluochun I got from the Inspection Bureau.

376
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,820
It's serviceable.

377
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,760
Your Highness,

378
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,500
please don't mind it.

379
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,740
Of course not.

380
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,910
I love biluochun.

381
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,590
Here.

382
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:13,900
Here.

383
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,180
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

384
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,380
Uncle Liu.

385
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,490
How old is Bin?

386
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,780
Bin is 26.

387
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,500
Something happened to Bin

388
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
when he was seven.

389
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,940
It damaged him here.

390
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,510
Ever since then,

391
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,860
his mental age

392
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,660
has been stuck at seven years old.

393
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,770
So in my eyes,

394
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,650
he is still a child.

395
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,180
From another perspective,

396
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,310
it's not a bad thing.

397
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,690
Everyone says that children

398
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,010
are the happiest.

399
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,100
Look, Bin is so cheerful and kind.

400
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,900
It's obvious.

401
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,990
Within our home,

402
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,920
he is carefree.

403
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,960
But whenever he goes outside,

404
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,250
there will always be someone

405
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,310
commenting on him.

406
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,350
Those kids outside

407
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,750
call him "big fool."

408
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,150
Sometimes, they even bully him.

409
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,849
Bin got hurt a lot.

410
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:07,930
Luckily,

411
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,800
Kaka always helps him

412
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,250
and keeps him company.

413
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,180
No wonder

414
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,890
his hand is injured.

415
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,890
I see.

416
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,619
Uncle Liu,

417
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,210
we're here today

418
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,069
about Kaka's mother's case.

419
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,130
Kaka told me.

420
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,740
Your father and I

421
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,940
handled the case

422
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,890
together.

423
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,310
If you have

424
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,220
anything you want to know,

425
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,000
just ask me.

426
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,550
Most of the information

427
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,920
is already recorded in detail

428
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,850
in the case file.

429
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:39,650
But

430
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,840
there are some gaps

431
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,990
we need you

432
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,950
to fill in for us.

433
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:43,630
Okay.

434
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,220
Why does this case file

435
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,760
look so rumpled?

436
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,310
It rained heavily a few years ago.

437
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,210
The storehouse was flooded,

438
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,300
so most of our case files

439
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,430
got soaked in water.

440
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,400
That's why it became like this.

441
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,440
Look here.

442
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,250
In the 24th year of the Dingkun reign,

443
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,060
the murderer

444
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,220
was caught red-handed

445
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,380
by an Inspector.

446
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,870
During the pursuit,

447
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,840
the murderer jumped into the moat.

448
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,980
Later, the Inspection Bureau found eight bodies in the river

449
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,820
while investigating the case.

450
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,340
Four of them

451
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,060
matched up with the time at which

452
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,870
the murderer jumped into the river.

453
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,180
That's all

454
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,400
my father had recorded.

455
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,330
At that time,

456
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,860
your father's health had already deteriorated.

457
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,690
He only managed to investigate this much

458
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,420
before he...

459
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,660
Uncle Liu.

460
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,140
Did the Inspection Bureau

461
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,980
investigate each of them

462
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,890
for a motive?

463
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,300
We did.

464
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,240
One of these four bodies

465
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,190
belonged to a woman.

466
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,860
She didn't have the physical ability

467
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,060
to commit such a case,

468
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,590
so we ruled her out.

469
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,110
The other one

470
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,070
was a sickly and elderly person.

471
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,540
We ruled him out as well.

472
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,660
As for the other two,

473
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,870
one was a bricklayer

474
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,790
with a large build

475
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,490
and the other

476
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,290
was a waiter with a small figure.

477
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,880
Both of them

478
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,800
were young and healthy.

479
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,670
Both were suspects.

480
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,170
Kaka's mother was a Qi.

481
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,670
She would have been as strong as a Qian man.

482
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,280
From this point of view,

483
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,180
that tall bricklayer

484
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,670
is the most suspicious.

485
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:17,650
Uncle Liu,

486
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,580
can you tell us

487
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,460
in detail

488
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,980
what happened back then?

489
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,610
Yes.

490
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:23,740
Alright.

491
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,850
[Peony Case]

492
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,730
That day,

493
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,980
it was raining very heavily.

494
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,990
We received a report

495
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,640
saying that a woman

496
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,180
had died in an alley.

497
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,320
What's wrong?

498
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
When we arrived,

499
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,280
we realized that

500
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,630
that woman was

501
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,790
Kaka's mother.

502
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,970
It was raining very heavily.

503
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,980
We didn't find any

504
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,740
witness or physical evidence.

505
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,540
However,

506
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,740
Kaka's mother also died

507
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,770
from blunt force trauma to her head.

508
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,180
This was similar to

509
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,860
the victims of the Peony Case.

510
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,180
And Kaka's mother was wearing

511
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:04,980
a hairpin

512
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,820
with a peony flower carved on it.

513
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,790
So we inferred that

514
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,140
the person who killed Kaka's mother

515
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,200
was the culprit of the Peony Case.

516
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,120
Kaka.

517
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,670
Are you sure this hairpin

518
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,460
belonged to your mother?

519
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,230
When I went to the market with her,

520
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,420
she set her eyes on this hairpin.

521
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,980
She didn't bear to buy it.

522
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,780
Later, my father made some money

523
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:35,890
and gave it to her

524
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:36,950
so she could buy it.

525
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,330
Who knew

526
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,100
that same day,

527
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,630
something happened to her.

528
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,970
My father blamed himself for it.

529
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,120
But this hairpin

530
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,790
doesn't have a peony on it.

531
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,950
It doesn't?

532
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,450
Moutan petals are round and smooth,

533
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,110
and don't have many wrinkles.

534
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,910
However, peony petals are tightly packed

535
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,110
next to one another.

536
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,200
Although they are similar,

537
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,350
if you look closely,

538
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,250
you can still distinguish them.

539
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,980
The decoration on this hairpin

540
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,120
is indeed a moutan.

541
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,240
Look.

542
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,900
Could the murderer have

543
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,240
made a mistake

544
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,760
because he couldn't distinguish between them?

545
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,490
Impossible.

546
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,250
The only unifying feature

547
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,370
between the victims was the peony.

548
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,820
It shows that

549
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,700
the peony was the murderer's fixation.

550
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,400
I remember my father

551
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,800
once solved

552
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,960
a serial murder case

553
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,550
where the murder

554
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,580
only targeted women who owned cats.

555
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,940
He was once abandoned

556
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,730
by a woman who loved cats,

557
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,020
causing his mentality to be twisted.

558
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,680
Similarly,

559
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,060
this was someone

560
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,460
who was extremely fixated on peonies.

561
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,300
How could he have been unable to distinguish

562
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,900
between a peony and a moutan?

563
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,320
One more thing.

564
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,380
Uncle Liu.

565
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,610
I understand if the others at the Inspection Bureau

566
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,440
couln't distinguish between them.

567
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,480
Didn't my father

568
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,020
notice the difference

569
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,820
between them?

570
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,640
Commander Su

571
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,540
didn't point that out.

572
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,870
But his body

573
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,430
was very weak at that point.

574
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,420
He had been pushing himself to continue working.

575
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,740
Perhaps he didn't notice

576
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,250
because of his condition.

577
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,350
[Prince Ying's Residence]

578
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,280
General Chilan is here.

579
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,150
You're here.

580
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,670
Your Highness.

581
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,960
There's something

582
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,380
I must talk to you about.

583
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,100
I know

584
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,030
why you're here.

585
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,250
But there's no rush.

586
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,920
Come play chess with me.

587
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,810
I don't know

588
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,100
how to play Qian chess.

589
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,890
Then let's play Qi chess.

590
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,830
Captured.

591
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,260
Captured.

592
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,740
By the way,

593
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,820
about what happened last time,

594
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,820
I've sent Eunuch Li

595
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,020
to the Law Department

596
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,270
for interrogation.

597
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,360
However, he refuses to admit that

598
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,310
he was involved

599
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,840
in the Qi Vital Stone trade.

600
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,840
Not even I could get it out of him.

601
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,650
If he refuses to confess

602
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,900
even to Your Highness,

603
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,380
it means the person

604
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,820
behind the Qi Vital Stone trade

605
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,820
is very powerful.

606
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,580
I'll keep investigating.

607
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,080
I've demoted Eunuch Li to the Laundry Service

608
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,540
for attempted assault,

609
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,910
to take accountability for what he did to you.

610
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

611
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,660
Captured.

612
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,540
Your move

613
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,020
is too hasty.

614
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,700
Really?

615
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,180
I won.

616
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,840
You...

617
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:07,950
When did you

618
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,210
come up with this move?

619
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,990
Everything has been going according to my plan

620
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,920
since the beginning of this match.

621
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,570
This move is called "the rat crosses the river from the left

622
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,660
to kill the tiger and depose the elephant."

623
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,590
Amazing, right?

624
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,920
What strategy is this?

625
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,280
I've never heard of it.

626
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,590
An old friend of mine

627
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,470
came up with it.

628
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,110
He taught me secretly.

629
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,990
I'm curious.

630
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,980
Hundred Beast Chess

631
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,540
is only popular in Qi.

632
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,830
How did you learn it?

633
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,300
You play so well, too.

634
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,880
A few years ago,

635
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,830
a courtier gifted me a set.

636
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,100
My wife liked it very much.

637
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,940
I often played with her.

638
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,300
I've heard about

639
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,900
what had happened to the Crown Princess.

640
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,500
She must have been

641
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,910
a very unique woman.

642
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,980
In my heart,

643
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,710
she has no equal.

644
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,720
I've never even

645
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,610
shown

646
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,700
Han Zheng

647
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,380
this move.

648
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,700
I've taught Your Highness today.

649
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,680
Speaking of Prince Han,

650
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,060
I think

651
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,530
you can't wait

652
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,050
to get down to business.

653
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:28,120
I'll get straight to the point.

654
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,400
What will happen to Han Zheng?

655
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,350
He killed a Senior Inspector by mistake.

656
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,660
After the trial,

657
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,060
if he's found guilty,

658
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,190
according to the legal code of the Qian,

659
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,140
he'll probably be sentenced

660
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,340
to 20 years in prison.

661
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,860
But there's one good thing.

662
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,470
Given the lifespan of a Qi,

663
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,600
20 years later,

664
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,180
Prince Han should still be in his prime.

665
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,830
Your Highness.

666
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,780
Are you making fun of us?

667
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,390
I'm just kidding.

668
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,450
Since Han Zheng is a Qi,

669
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,880
even if he must be imprisoned,

670
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,510
it should be

671
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,760
in a Qi prison.

672
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,210
What do you think?

673
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,330
In my opinion,

674
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,840
allowing Han Zheng to return to Qi

675
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,770
will be to set a dangerous man free.

676
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,500
I'm afraid

677
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,920
he won't even have to walk through the prison doors.

678
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,760
That's not true.

679
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,450
You can send someone

680
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,910
to check on him regularly.

681
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,940
You can just send him to prison

682
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,740
once in a while

683
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,810
as a pretense.

684
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,480
Your Highness.

685
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,850
I'll be frank with you.

686
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,660
If Han Zheng is really found guilty

687
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,660
of manslaughter,

688
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,830
he will be punished.

689
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,500
In exchange for bringing him back

690
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,630
to be punished in Qi,

691
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,800
I will agree to any demand you make,

692
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,460
with the exception of the Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

693
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,750
For the next five years,

694
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,580
we can double our tribute

695
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,820
of white camels, horses, gyrfalcons,

696
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,750
black gold, Qi knives, and grains.

697
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,170
If I remember correctly,

698
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,580
during the beginning of autumn last year,

699
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,260
you captured two

700
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,190
Qian travelers.

701
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,450
The men you are calling travelers

702
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,530
were clearly spies.

703
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,540
Besides doubling the tribute,

704
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
if you let them go,

705
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,830
I'll allow Prince Han to return with you

706
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,630
to receive his punishment in Qi.

707
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,870
These two spies

708
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,710
have been hiding in Qi for years.

709
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,430
They have too much intel.

710
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,060
Even if I agree,

711
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,910
the King of Xueqi might not.

712
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,780
In that case, I feel sorry

713
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,640
for Prince Han.

714
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,390
To the King of Xueqi,

715
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:37,850
his son's life

716
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,320
cannot compare to the Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

717
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,050
That's fine.

718
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,690
But it can't even compare to two spies.

719
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,080
It's settled then.

720
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,820
I will persuade His Majesty.

721
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,260
Your Highness,

722
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,050
don't break your promise.

723
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,360
I have one more condition.

724
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,980
Your Prince Han

725
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,070
repeatedly stirred up trouble in Jiuxiao City.

726
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,690
This time, especially,

727
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,260
he created grievances amongst the people

728
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,190
of Jiuxiao City.

729
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,720
In the future,

730
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,990
he is not allowed to enter Jiuxiao City again.

731
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,220
Only this will appease the anger of the people.

732
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,220
What do you think?

733
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,420
Alright.

734
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,980
Are you sure

735
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,000
you can make Prince Han agree as well?

736
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,300
I heard from Jun that

737
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,300
he has a close relationship

738
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
with Miss Jiu'er.

739
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,440
I'm afraid he'll be unwillng to leave her behind.

740
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,260
Prince Han seems defiant,

741
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,620
but he knows what his responsibilities are.

742
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,750
On crucial matters,

743
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,190
he knows how to make the right choices.

744
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,240
Alright.

745
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,190
Another round?

746
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,230
Sending me this far is enough, Your Highness.

747
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,470
General Chilan.

748
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,350
Please wait.

749
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,920
I've prepared a carriage for you.

750
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,050
It'll send you back.

751
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,300
There's no need to stand on ceremony, Your Highness.

752
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,450
We Qi

753
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,840
don't need carriages.

754
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,600
It's not ceremony.

755
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,780
Consider it

756
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,600
my concern for you.

757
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,010
This way, please.

758
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,360
Be careful.

759
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,020
Send someone to escort her along the way.

760
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,340
Yes.

761
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,590
Captured.

762
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,600
Have you decided?

763
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,330
Are you sure?

764
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,980
What do you mean?

765
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,820
I made a mistake?

766
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,230
Or are you lying to me?

767
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,630
Take a guess.

768
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,700
You must be afraid

769
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,620
I'll capture your leopard.

770
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,380
That's why you got riled up.

771
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:32,980
You're trying to

772
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,240
confuse me on purpose.

773
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,730
I'm making this move.

774
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,500
Forget it.

775
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,480
I gave you a chance.

776
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,780
When did you

777
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,040
come up with this move?

778
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,450
Everything has been going according to my plan

779
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,250
since you made

780
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,840
your first move.

781
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,860
This is called "the rat crosses the river from the left

782
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,260
to kill the tiger and depose the elephant."

783
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,900
The rat crosses the river from the left to kill the tiger and depose the elephant.

784
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,250
What a silly name.

785
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,460
You're the silly one.

786
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,340
Where did you get hurt?

787
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,070
Are you okay?

788
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,590
Does it hurt?

789
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:31,860
Liu Fu.

790
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,660
Yes.

791
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,870
At what time did I

792
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,960
meet Jiu'er today?

793
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
A quarter past seven in the morning.

794
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,360
When did I leave Jiu'er?

795
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,480
I think it was three quarters past five in the afternoon.

796
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,040
One, two, three, four, five.

797
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,530
I spent 10 hours

798
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,640
with Jiu'er!

799
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:52,940
Wait.

800
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,940
Your Highness.

801
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,400
Why are you counting this?

802
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,720
Think about it.

803
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,340
Jiu'er only sleeps

804
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,590
for 8 hours every day.

805
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,040
That means she only spends 8 hours

806
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,730
with Han Zheng in her dream.

807
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,950
In that case,

808
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,770
didn't I spend 2 more hours with her

809
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,020
as compared to Han Zheng?

810
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,460
Yes.

811
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:07,890
Right?

812
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:08,770
Tomorrow,

813
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,600
let's go even earlier to see Miss Jiu'er.

814
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,180
Yes.

815
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,500
Jiu'er has been busy investigating the case lately,

816
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,830
so she hasn't had time to think about Brother Han.

817
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,170
Gradually,

818
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,820
their feelings will fade, right?

819
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,220
Are you hoping Miss Jiu'er

820
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,040
will forget about Prince Han?

821
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,140
But why are you

822
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,920
helping him get out of prison?

823
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,210
That's a different matter.

824
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,660
If Brother Han is innocent,

825
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,180
I will uphold justice for him.

826
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,750
If Prince Han

827
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,110
is released from prison,

828
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,910
what will you do

829
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,010
if Miss Jiu'er's feelings for him are rekindled?

830
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:39,870
I'm not afraid.

831
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,110
It's absolutely impossible

832
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,170
between Brother Han and Miss Jiu'er.

833
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,230
Why?

834
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,580
Like you said,

835
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,840
Brother Han

836
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,520
is the only son of the King of Xueqi.

837
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,650
He has to go back to inherit the throne.

838
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,920
Besides, a Qian and a Qi

839
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,770
cannot have children.

840
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:54,250
Right?

841
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,160
Yes.

842
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,090
How could the King of Xueqi allow

843
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,720
Brother Han to marry Jiu'er?

844
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,180
What's wrong, Your Highness?

845
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,620
Help! Help!

846
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,560
Wait.

847
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,510
Whenever I mention Brother Han marrying Jiu'er,

848
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,800
my heart aches.

849
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,730
I'm going to bed.

850
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,989
I'll take my leave.

851
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,380
Brother Han marrying Jiu'er.

852
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,170
Brother Han must not marry Jiu'er.

853
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,000
Take your hand away.

854
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,280
Brother Han?

855
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,030
It's me.

856
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,270
It's really you?

857
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,219
Aren't you...

858
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,179
Aren't you in prison?

859
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,239
How did you get out?

860
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,909
Didn't you let me out?

861
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:45,969
How is that possible?

862
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,219
That is a crime.

863
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,139
Don't frame me.

864
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,389
I know it wasn't you.

865
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:51,260
You

866
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,760
would love for me to

867
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,260
remain locked up in that prison.

868
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,190
That's not true.

869
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,090
I just told Liu Fu about

870
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,860
how to clear your name.

871
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,050
If you had come earlier,

872
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,380
you would have heard it.

873
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,550
Come earlier?

874
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,020
I have been waiting at your door

875
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,060
since an hour ago.

876
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,740
Even if it's impossible between Jiu'er and me,

877
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,420
do you stand a chance?

878
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,870
Aren't you a prince too?

879
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,750
I'm also a prince.

880
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,590
But I have a brother!

881
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,300
I don't have to inherit the throne.

882
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,830
Besides,

883
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,320
my mother has agreed

884
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,580
to me marrying Jiu'er.

885
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,060
So what if your mother has agreed?

886
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,860
Jiu'er won't.

887
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,180
There's no rush.

888
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,940
After you return to Qi

889
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,280
and inherit the throne,

890
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,270
I'll spend time with Jiu'er.

891
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,830
One day, I will get through to her.

892
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:51,990
Brother Han.

893
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,220
How did you get out?

894
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,010
The agarwood in the prison

895
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,260
has already blocked your five senses.

896
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:55,990
I don't know.

897
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,790
A fog suddenly appeared

898
00:35:59,260 --> 00:35:59,920
and the guards

899
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,650
fainted.

900
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,940
My door was opened,

901
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,110
so I came out.

902
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,990
Someone opened the door for you?

903
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,080
Could it have been Jiu'er?

904
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,550
Impossible.

905
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,360
Even if we don't consider the fact that

906
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,760
Jiu'er still resents me,

907
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,700
the person who saved me

908
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,460
wore black clothes

909
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,370
and deliberately used agarwood

910
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,720
to mask their scent.

911
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,320
Jiu'er

912
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,350
has no need

913
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,490
to go to all that trouble

914
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,090
to hide her identity from me.

915
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,490
Who could it be?

916
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,870
I don't know.

917
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,670
No matter what, it must be a trap.

918
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,890
Why did you come out if it was a trap?

919
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,350
I have to fall into his trap

920
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,440
to find out what he's after.

921
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,210
No wonder girls don't like you.

922
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,140
You're so petty.

923
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,230
I'm going to bed.

924
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,640
What?

925
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,260
Han Zheng is gone?

926
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
Stop pretending.

927
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,460
Exactly. Why are you playing innocent?

928
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,620
Tell us the truth. Where did you hide him?

929
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,260
Me?

930
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:09,900
I...

931
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:10,780
Jiu'er.

932
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,000
If it really was you

933
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,260
who released Prince Han,

934
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,120
send him back in

935
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:14,820
right away,

936
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,750
before things get out of hand.

937
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,190
Yes.

938
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,080
That's right.

939
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,790
If this gets to the Law Department,

940
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:20,790
it'll be serious.

941
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,640
Why do you all have to

942
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,680
blame it on me?

943
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:29,680
Listen.

944
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,910
What are they saying?

945
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,290
They said

946
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,330
it was Jiu'er who released me.

947
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,390
I knew it.

948
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,410
And?

949
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,100
What else are they saying?

950
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,540
There are no signs of a struggle

951
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,690
in the cell, right?

952
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,740
The door of the cell

953
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,140
was opened with the key.

954
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,720
Even a fool would know that

955
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,430
this was done

956
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,140
by someone from the Inspection Bureau.

957
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,060
That's right.

958
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,430
You have the closest relationship

959
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,560
with Prince Han.

960
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,140
I can't think of

961
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,110
anyone else

962
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,920
who would set him free.

963
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
Exactly.

964
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,200
It makes sense.

965
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,410
What do you mean?

966
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,140
I've always been

967
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,400
the closest to Jiu'er.

968
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,110
Doesn't it make sense

969
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,930
that they would suspect it was Jiu'er

970
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,950
who released me?

971
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,840
How does that make sense?

972
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,880
She has already cut ties with you.

973
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,490
Can you understand Qian writing?

974
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,060
Seriously.

975
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,090
You're reading it for nothing.

976
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,300
That's why I called you here.

977
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,000
What does this say?

978
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,070
You'll have to beg me.

979
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:30,830
Forget it.

980
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,630
I'm not investigating the case anyway.

981
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,080
I might as well leave

982
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,660
and save the rest of the case

983
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,500
for Su Jiu'er

984
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,850
to worry about by herself.

985
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:38,780
Don't.

986
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,660
I'll tell you.

987
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,370
I'll tell you.

988
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,140
He hasn't made himself clear

989
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,600
about what happened to Hu.

990
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,010
How could I let him go?

991
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,550
You're investigating the Peony Case right now,

992
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,550
and you need help.

993
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,500
We understand if you did this

994
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,380
impulsively.

995
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,380
Yes.

996
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,840
Since we're all on the same side here,

997
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,780
we can cover it up for you.

998
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,710
Just admit to it.

999
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,100
You...

1000
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:01,510
This...

1001
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,320
Commander Yan,

1002
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,700
I really don’t know

1003
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,630
how Han Zheng escaped from prison.

1004
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,100
If you

1005
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,430
still don't believe me,

1006
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,250
you can report it to the Law Department

1007
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,510
and let them handle it.

1008
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,810
Commander,

1009
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,820
I don't think that's appropriate.

1010
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,370
It's not.

1011
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,370
As one of our patrols,

1012
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,790
Prince Han

1013
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,870
has already gotten someone killed.

1014
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:24,750
Hu—

1015
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,050
Forget it.

1016
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,990
Anyway, that's in the past.

1017
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,440
Now, he's gone missing.

1018
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,900
If we report it to the higher-ups,

1019
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,700
how humiliating would it be

1020
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,670
for the Inspection Bureau?

1021
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,030
It'll be devastating,

1022
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,170
Commander Yan.

1023
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,230
Su Jiu'er.

1024
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,440
Hand me your badge.

1025
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,530
What?

1026
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,520
You are suspended. Go home

1027
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,210
and wait for your punishment.

1028
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:48,780
If we can't find Han Zheng

1029
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,840
within three days,

1030
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,460
we will report it to the Law Department.

1031
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,630
Jiu'er has been suspended?

1032
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,440
Why don't you go out now

1033
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,170
and tell them

1034
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,290
-it wasn't Jiu'er who did it?
-Let go.

1035
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:11,990
Let go!

1036
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,790
What I'm holding now

1037
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,140
is important evidence.

1038
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,930
Why are you still talking about evidence

1039
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:17,930
at this juncture?

1040
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,880
The flower on this hairpin is a moutan,

1041
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,880
not a peony.

1042
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:22,680
Yes.

1043
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,600
Don't change the subject.

1044
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,260
Boss,

1045
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,950
I don't understand.

1046
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,500
Didn't you say

1047
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,770
we should treat Jiu'er better?

1048
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:31,850
Why did you suddenly...

1049
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,510
-I...
-I...

1050
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,400
I just couldn't help it.

1051
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,490
When Hu left,

1052
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,730
she looked very sad.

1053
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,170
But now that she's alive and kicking

1054
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,370
and working cases...

1055
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,730
I'm used to treating her like this.

1056
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,340
Got it.

1057
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:44,910
Got it.

1058
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,230
It's perfect timing.

1059
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,290
Go and tell him now.

1060
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,590
Go with me right now.

1061
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,420
Someone is there.

1062
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Did you hear that?

1063
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,500
Where is he?

1064
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,810
He's not at home,

1065
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,110
and he's not at Qiwei Pavilion.

1066
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,740
He's not with Jun either.

1067
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,300
Where exactly did he go?

1068
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,020
Mother.

1069
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,820
I'm back.

1070
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,430
You're back?

1071
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,010
Han Zheng?

1072
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,180
You're here?

1073
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,940
How dare you come to my house?

1074
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,630
Let's go.

1075
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:52,540
Come with me to the Inspection Bureau.

1076
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,020
-Listen to me... -Jiu'er, you’re back?

1077
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,580
Jiu'er.

1078
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,130
The food is ready. It's time to eat.

1079
00:41:59,140 --> 00:41:59,600
Mother.

1080
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:00,750
Did you know

1081
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,210
he escaped from prison?

1082
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,060
The Inspection Bureau thought I was the one who let him go.

1083
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,570
They've even suspended me.

1084
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,780
Isn't that good?

1085
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,850
I told you, that job of yours

1086
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,670
pays badly, works you too hard,

1087
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,390
and puts you in danger.

1088
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,710
You're better off without it.

1089
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,230
Mother, what's wrong with you?

1090
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,380
He's Han Zheng.

1091
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,950
Have you forgotten about Hu?

1092
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,850
How could you let him into our house?

1093
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,650
Jiu'er, I have something to say.

1094
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,230
What do you have to say?

1095
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,480
I thought about it

1096
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:27,920
over and over again.

1097
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,690
I finally remember now.

1098
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,950
I can be sure that on that day,

1099
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,660
when I left the courtyard of the Western Chamber

1100
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,520
with Keyuncha,

1101
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,120
Hu said to me,

1102
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,620
"Han, you're befuddled."
