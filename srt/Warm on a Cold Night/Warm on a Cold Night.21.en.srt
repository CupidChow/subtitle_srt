00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,490
Su Jiu'er.

5
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,370
I promise you

6
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,910
you'll dream of your father tonight.

7
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,510
Come here.

8
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:01,950
What?

9
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:04,870
Look.

10
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,120
I bought

11
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,910
all of these for you.

12
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,940
So many?

13
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,930
Be careful.

14
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,540
I can build a boat for my father

15
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,180
with all these lanterns.

16
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,700
There's a rabbit lantern like this too.

17
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,550
When your father sees it,

18
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,480
he will definitely recognize you.

19
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,000
Rabbit lantern.

20
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,650
This is so beautiful.

21
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,380
Do you like it?

22
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,390
If you like it,

23
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,180
I'll change all of these

24
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,060
into rabbit lanterns.

25
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,860
No, no.

26
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,620
This is enough.

27
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,350
Do you think he will run Shuobei into the ground

28
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,750
when he ascends to the throne in the future?

29
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,829
What are you waiting for?

30
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:53,710
Help us write.

31
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,540
Yes.

32
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,390
Let's go.

33
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,360
This is too hard.

34
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,670
You can also try writing the names

35
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,180
of the loved ones you wish to memorialize

36
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,940
here.

37
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,970
Give the Qian way

38
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,740
of memorializing our loved ones

39
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,700
a try.

40
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:22,640
Look.

41
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,740
I wrote it with Jiu'er.

[Su Huan]

43
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:30,900
No.

44
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,610
Keyuncha.

45
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,270
Your handwriting is too ugly.

46
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,829
Isn't it better than yours?

47
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,700
You...

48
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,610
The Qi

49
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,380
have a festival like this too.

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,260
It's called the Soul Ferrying Festival.

51
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,460
During the coldest time of the year,

52
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,340
we wear the Qi's most traditional

53
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,660
and most luxurious clothing,

54
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,190
put on hand-painted masks,

55
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,620
and sing and dance

56
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,540
to the sound of booming drums.

57
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,070
We communicate with our ancestors with singing and drumbeats.

58
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,670
This sounds so interesting.

59
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,520
Can your stiff movements

60
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,850
be considered dancing?

61
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,530
It's better than your self-created

62
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,950
head shaking.

63
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,050
What kind of head shaking?

64
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,030
Like this?

65
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,050
Like this?

66
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,040
It's like this.

67
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,500
Watch yourself, General.

68
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,190
How can you reveal the Qi's internal affairs

69
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,269
to a Qian,

70
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,160
just like that?

71
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,230
A certain prince

72
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,420
broke into the palace and got flogged.

73
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,120
He embarrassed himself

74
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,050
in front of the Emperor of the Qian.

75
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,880
Someone came all the way

76
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,000
to clean up after him.

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,130
Aren't you ashamed?

78
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,560
I think

79
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,980
you're getting on in age.

80
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,360
Why are you always going on

81
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,490
about things from so long ago?

82
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,290
That's right.

83
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,130
I need to send a carrier eagle

84
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,580
to deliver a letter to your father to tell him

85
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,659
about your Qian-Qi romance.

86
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:42,920
I...

87
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,060
You keep sending letters using carrier eagles.

88
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,600
It's the mark of a petty person.

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
How could an ageing woman like me

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,130
act magnanimously?

91
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:54,940
Wait.

92
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,180
Why are you...

93
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,340
All right, don't...

94
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,780
Don't bother persuading them.

95
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,610
Don't bother persuading them.

96
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,330
They have been fighting

97
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,180
since they were children.

98
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,670
General Han has never won an argument against Chilan.

99
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,780
Chilan only acts like a lady

100
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,040
when she's with Mu Yan.

101
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,820
Mu Yan?

102
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,070
Is Mu Yan your good friend?

103
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,980
The three of us and Mu Yan

104
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,270
grew up

105
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,340
together.

106
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,240
But don't worry.

107
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,600
I made a promise to you,

108
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,890
so I will find out the truth

109
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,260
about your father's death

110
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,500
and give you a proper explanation.

111
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,900
Even if Mu Yan were the one

112
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,540
who poisoned him.

113
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,260
Han Zheng told me

114
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,880
that your father might have been poisoned

115
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,630
by Mu Yan.

116
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,060
I've sent a message to Grand Preceptor Hanlin.

117
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,060
I'll let you know when there's news.

118
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,030
So Mu Yan

119
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,820
is your good friend.

120
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,060
All of you must be very sad

121
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,420
about all that has happened.

122
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,950
When we were kids, the four of us

123
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,180
were almost inseparable.

124
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,710
We were together every day.

125
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,590
Come on.

126
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,590
Look at me.

127
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,950
You're making trouble.

128
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,490
Go that way.

129
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,380
Like this.

130
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,710
Here.

131
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:19,780
No, no.

132
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,420
Like this.

133
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,570
It should be here.

134
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,300
You cheated!

135
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,770
That was a wonderful time.

136
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,830
But then we went our separate ways,

137
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,540
and even lost contact.

138
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,930
Now, I'm the only one

139
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,580
still in Shuobei.

140
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,750
Don't worry.

141
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,520
We're here.

142
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,180
If you can't stand it in Qian anymore,

143
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,360
remember to go back to Shuobei.

144
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,340
Don't force yourself.

145
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:07,870
I'm here.

146
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,070
Okay.

147
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,690
Alright.

148
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,070
Hurry up and write.

149
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:20,660
Let's go.

150
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,090
It floated away.

151
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,060
How is it?

152
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,110
Do you want to try it yourself?

153
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,080
Are you okay?

154
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,470
I'm fine.

155
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,060
Well.

156
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,820
She just sneezed

157
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,540
and almost fell into the water.

158
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,720
I helped her up.

159
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:12,910
Yes.

160
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,630
I almost fell into the water.

161
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,360
Let's continue.

162
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,350
Your lantern doesn't have a name on it.

163
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,720
I know.

164
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,900
Who are you memorializing?

165
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,659
An old friend.

166
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,240
What about you?

167
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,950
There's no specific person.

168
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,140
I just want to memorialize

169
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,900
those who left Shuobei

170
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,390
and couldn't return home.

171

[May our old friends take care]

172
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,910
[May our old friends take care]

173
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,500
May our old friends take care.

174
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,800
The weather is dry. Beware of fire.

175
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,890
By the way, General,

176
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,150
are you free tomorrow?

177
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,140
And Keyuncha?

178
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,230
I'm free.

179
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,550
I'm free, why?

180
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,640
Han Zheng caught

181
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,080
the person who killed Mei

182
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,530
and found a lead about the person who hired him.

183
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,490
I was thinking

184
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,680
we can set a trap

185
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,120
to catch the person

186
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,380
who's behind all this.

187
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,020
Okay, can you leave it to me?

188
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,600
Of course.

189
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,190
Have you figured out

190
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,550
what kind of trap to set?

191
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,820
I think

192
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,230
the person behind all this...

193
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,390
In my opinion,

194
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,440
Miss Jiu'er is really good.

195
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,220
She's smart and kind.

196
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,850
Most importantly, she has a good personality,

197
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,460
so she can tolerate

198
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,390
your bad temper.

199
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,710
Unfortunately,

200
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,340
she's a Qian.

201
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,630
What do you mean by that?

202
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,300
So what if she's a Qi?

203
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,560
So what if she's a Qian?

204
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,620
So

205
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,600
you don't mind that she's a Qian?

206
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,600
Of course not.

207
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,730
I find that

208
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,130
after being in Qian for a long time,

209
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,940
you've become as crafty as the people here.

210
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,470
No.

211
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,780
Tell me.

212
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,530
I'm curious.

213
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,530
Have you heard too many rumors?

214
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,260
She and I

215
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,040
are just partners.

216
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,290
Back then,

217
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,510
I was as stubborn as you are.

218
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,870
After a while, I realized

219
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,900
I couldn't control

220
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,980
my feelings.

221
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,860
Anyway,

222
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,650
treat Miss Jiu'er a bit better

223
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,310
while you're still together.

224
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,690
Judging from your tone,

225
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,650
although she left you,

226
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,440
you still care about her.

227
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,180
Although I feel sorrow,

228
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,240
I'm not regretful.

229
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,630
It's only been a few years since we last met,

230
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,630
but you've already started to talk like an old person.

231
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,200
How can you not pay heed

232
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,950
to a lesson that your friend learned the hard way?

233
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,950
Where's your baby teeth bracelet?

234
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,860
I lost it by accident

235
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,860
while I was working.

236
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,830
When I found out,

237
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,900
I couldn't find it anymore.

238
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,380
But my baby teeth are on it.

239
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,180
I don't know.

240
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,060

241

Stop right there!

244

What baby teeth bracelet?

245
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,670
When we were kids,

246
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,680
we strung our baby teeth together

247
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,450
into four bracelets

248
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
to commemorate our friendship.

249
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,290
I envy your friendship.

250
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,060

Come on. I'm not afraid.

257

What is this?

258
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,470
We played this when we were young.

259

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,630
The Old Master of the Zhou family...

352
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,020
Isn't that the richest silk merchant

353
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,120
in Jiuxiao City,

354
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,780
Zhou Guanglin?

355
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,660
Yes, that's him.

356
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,720
-Right? -It’s him.

357
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,310
Why would such a big shot

358
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,850
hire someone to kill Mei?

359
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,830
He also killed Ren Fengyang.

360
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,540
He must also be the one

361
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,300
who faked the ghost sightings.

362
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,840
Right, Your Highness?

363
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,530
If Zhou Guanglin

364
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
masterminded this whole incident,

365
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,860
it's probably because of Shi Luqing.

366
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,620
So,

367
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,510
the commonality between

368
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,640
Mei and Ren Fengyang

369
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,560
is that they had indirectly killed Shi Luqing.

370
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,320
This...

371
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,010
makes it sounds like Zhou Guanglin

372
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,810
was trying to avenge Shi Luqing.

373
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,030
I remember something.

374
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,560
Go ahead.

375
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,080
I once heard at the Western Chamber

376
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,530
that a rich man

377
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,100
once pursued Shi Luqing.

378
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,740
Was it Zhou Guanglin?

379
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,450
I remember it too!

380
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,460
Once,

381
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,070
Zhou Guanglin's wife

382
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,020
made a scene

383
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,560
at the Inspection Bureau.

384
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,240
She wanted us to help her

385
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,200
arrest an entertainer

386
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,310
from the Western Chamber

387
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,910
who had seduced her husband.

388
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,140
I see.

389
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,780
Shi Luqing

390
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,830
was Zhou Guanglin's lover!

391
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,660
That's right!

392
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,450
Zhou Guanglin

393
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,360
still has feelings for Shi Luqing,

394
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,970
so he made use of the ghost sightings

395
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,540
to take revenge on the people who killed her.

396
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,000
Doesn't it make sense now?

397
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,300
Keyuncha,

398
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,590
do you have anything to say?

399
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,620
I don't know much about solving cases.

400
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,500
But Zhou Guanglin

401
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,760
is really irritating.

402
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,500
Mei had just hired me

403
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
as her bodyguard

404
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,490
to protect her.

405
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,380
Then she died.

406
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,760
Who would dare hire me from now on?

407
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,080
Take it away.

408
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,140
Don't worry.

409
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,310
We all know

410
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,680
your abilities.

411
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,190
If there are any jobs suitable for you

412
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,070
in the future,

413
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,430
the Inspection Bureau

414
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,690
will come to you first.

415
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,470
Me too.

416
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,980
I know a lot of people.

417
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,630
It won't be hard for me to help you find a job.

418
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,360
I'll keep an eye out for you too.

419
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,840
Stop.

420
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,120
From now on,

421
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,250
you can stay with me.

422
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,730
Let's eat and live together.

423
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,090
Why continue to work menial jobs?

424
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,560
Stop.

Guys.

432
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,740
Why do we keep talking about Keyuncha?

433
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,940
Today, the six of us

434
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,470
Qians and Qis have gathered here.

435
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,730
What are we doing here?

436
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,890
Sorry, my friend.

You're not counted for now.

438
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,780
We're talking about Zhou Guanglin.

439
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:06,990
As I've said,

440
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,660
we can't do anything without evidence.

441
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,050
When the time comes,

442
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,980
Zhou Guanglin just has to deny it,

443
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,700
and there'll be nothing we can do about it.

444
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,460
He also has connections with officials.

445
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,220
You shouldn't

446
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,260
provoke him.

447
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,020
Then we'll have to

448
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,200
try another method.

449
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,440
Is there any way

450
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,940
to make him confess by himself?

451
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,570
I have an idea.

452
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,200
Go home now,

453
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,180
lie in bed,

454
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,130

457
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
the first time I took you

458
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,380
to the immersive novella experience?

459
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,780
Immersive novella experience?

I...

525
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,110
I'll sign the confession now.

526
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,540
I'll sign it now.

527
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,550
It’s too late.

528
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,750
I hate people who make excuses.

529
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,540
Execute the punishment.

530
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:39,430
My Lord!

531
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,270
My Lord!

532
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,330
My Lord. My Lord—

533
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,860
Zhou Guanglin.

534
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,330
I'm dreaming.

535
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:32,840
Yes.

536
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,750
It must be a dream.

537
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,690
It'll be okay when I wake up.

538
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,220
It'll be okay when I wake up.

539
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,420
Are you awake?

540
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,370
W- Where am I?

541
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:48,890
The netherworld.

542
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,380
I...

543
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,430
Why am I here?

544
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,190
Divine retribution got you.

545
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,260
You were killed by a falling flower pot along the street.

546
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:55,650
What?

547
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,590
Why did I die like this?

548
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,140
No.

549
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:58,900
No.

550
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,520
Lord Yama!

551
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,540
Lord Yama!

552
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,150
Lord Yama!

553
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,000
What crime did I commit?

554
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,850
Su Xiaomei.

555
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,070
Did you know her?

556
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:09,610
No.

557
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,230
Then I’ll ask her to come

558
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,070
meet with you.

559
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,510
Who are you?

560
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,560
I'm Mei.

561
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,500
You hung me on the tree.

562
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,470
My neck is already broken.

563
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,380
You caused me such misery.

564
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,030
You strangled me.

565
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,080
You made me a wandering ghost,

566
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,560
unable to find my way home.

567
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,820
I'll take you with me.

568
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,470
I want revenge.

569
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,030
I want to take you home.

570
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,910
Come with me!

571
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,800
It's a mistake.

572
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,680
Lord Yama!

573
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,130
Lord Yama!

574
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,660
I'm a kind man.

575
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
Lord Yama!

576
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,260
I've donated money.

577
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,340
I- I've even built a bridge.

578
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,820
I've built a temple!

579
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,790
Shouldn't I

580
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,010
go to

581
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,220
someplace

582
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,790
like paradise?

583
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,730
Yet another stubborn ghost.

584
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,480
We'll stop talking to him then.

585
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,570
He shall be thrown into a pot of boiling oil,

586
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,220
and never to be reincarnated.

587
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,130
Lord Yama!

588
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,470
I'm innocent!

589
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,620
Lord Yama!

590
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,560
Lord Yama!

591
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,860
I'm innocent!

592
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,310
I'm innocent, Lord Yama!

593
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,170
I'll confess!

594
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:44,910
Lord Yama!

595
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,060
I'll confess.

596
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,390
Sign it.

597
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,590
[Confession]

598
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,590
[Zhou Guanglin]

599
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,410
What now?

600
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,980
Hard labor in the netherworld for 100 years

601
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,600
before being reincarnated.

602
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:01,710
Okay.

603
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,520
Lord Yama.

604
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,370
You finally confessed!

605
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,060
You finally confessed.

606
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,050
You finally confessed.

607
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:35,910
Commander Yan!

608
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,040
We've got it!

609
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,960
Excellent!

610
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:42,700
Take him away!

611
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:42,980
Yes.

612
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,620
Yes.

613
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,530
You did a good job.

614
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,250
Of course.

615
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,140
Tell me.

616
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,470
Why did you kill Su Xiaomei?

617
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,050
That day, I saw...

618
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,020
I saw Mei

619
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:05,990
going to

620
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,570
the Inspection Bureau.

621
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,220
I thought

622
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,810
it must be because

623
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,720
she knew about what I'd done.

624
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,570
That's why

625
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,200
I had to kill her.

626
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,020
What did she know about?

627
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,060
Well...

628
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,170
It's because of that woman.

629
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,450
That woman

630
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,100
called Shi Luqing!

631
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,560
She ruined

632
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,710
my life!

633
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,600
Shi Luqing

634
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,650
was a promiscuous woman.

635
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,430
S- She seduced us

636
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,940
but pretended to be chaste.

637
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,930
She wouldn't let us have her.

638
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,900
You all?

639
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,050
Ren Fengyang had always wanted her.

640
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,690
But Shi Luqing

641
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,240
pretended to be more chaste than anyone else.

642
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,850
She even went from an understudy

643
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,030
to a star.

644
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,580
That made Ren Fengyang

645
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,390
jealous and angry.

646
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,430
One day,

647
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,060
Feng Yang sent someone

648
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,760
to ask me to come to the Western Chamber,

649
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,490
saying that he had gotten his way with Shi Luqing.

650
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:14,970
Shameless!

651
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,260
This...

652
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,260
Jiu'er.

653
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,280
Have a seat.

654
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,030
A- After that...

655
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,150
I heard Shi Luqing died.

656
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,020
But...

657
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,810
But her death had nothing to do with me.

658
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,840
I didn't kill her!

659
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,170
Although she seduced me,

660
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,980
I didn't have a reason to kill her.

661
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,780
Did the haunting of the theatre

662
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,380
have anything to do with you?

663
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,970
It must have been Mei.

664
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,290
Mei was Ren Fengyang's maid.

665
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,790
She knew about this.

666
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,620
Mei

667
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,170
could imitate Shi Luqing's singing.

668
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:54,600
That day,

669
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,270
when I saw Mei go to the Inspection Bureau,

670
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,220
I was sure

671
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,860
she was using Shi Luqing's ghost

672
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:01,950
to scare me.

673
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,770
How could I be controlled

674
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
control by a mere maid?

675
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,320
So I made the first move.

676
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,030
What about Ren Fengyang?

677
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,120
Did you kill him?

678
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
Ren Fengyang and I

679
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,900
were on the same boat.

680
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,530
How could I kill him?

681
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,490
I'm innocent, Your Excellencies.

682
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,220
Yes.

683
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,440
It was all Mei's doing.

684
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,340
She must have wanted to

685
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,020
stand up for Shi Luqing!

686
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,180
I've seen so many Qian people.

687
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,270
You are the most shameless one.

688
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,730
Speaking of which,

689
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,310
I didn't kill Mei

690
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,370
myself.

691
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,440
Your Excellencies,

692
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,030
I have a lot of money.

693
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,170
I'll give you as much as you want.

694
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:55,730
Could you...

695
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,150
We don't want your money!

696
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,100
We just want you face justice!

697
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,630
Sit down!

698
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,430
Sit down!

699
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,340
Will you sentence me to death?

700
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,970
Not only did you assault Shi Luqing,

701
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:07,940
you also killed Mei.

702
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,000
That's two crimes. What do you think?

703
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,020
If...

704
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,380
If I give away another accomplice,

705
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,040
could I get a more lenient sentence?

706
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,610
What do you mean?

707
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,020
That night,

708
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,070
it wasn't only Ren Fengyang and I.

709
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,150
There was one more person.

710
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,030
Who?

711
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,940
Mr. Chen.

712
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,420
Mr. Chen went into the Western Chamber

713
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,290
when I came out.

714
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,130
You mean

715
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,090
Mr. Chen also assaulted Shi Luqing?

716
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,150
He has been in love with Shi Luqing

717
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,490
for a long time.

718
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,630
But how could Shi Luqing

719
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,230
fall for someone

720
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,260
who looks so much like a monkey?

721
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
Zhou Guanglin!

722
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:57,780
You bastard!

723
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,190
What are you doing?

724
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:58,650
Behave yourself!

725
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,850
How dare you frame me?

726
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,420
You did it yourself!

727
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,460
Why are you dragging me into it?

728
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,920
-You dare to blame me? -You bastard!

729
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,720
Mr. Chen didn't confess, right?

730
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,960
He denied it

731
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,830
completely.

732
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,730
To think I treated Zhou Guanglin

733
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,020
like a brother.

734
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,750
He would drag me into this

735
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,720
t- to absolve himself.

736
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,880
Bastard!

737
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,500
No.

738
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,140
I've never touched

739
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,740
Shi Luqing.

740
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,100
Fortunately,

741
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,680
they only colluded because of interest.

742
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,580
Otherwise, Mr. Chen

743
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,090
wouldn't have been exposed.

744
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,540
Although we don't have any evidence,

745
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,350
as long as

746
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,580
he did do such a thing,

747
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,310
there will be traces left.

748
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,760
Let me do it!

749
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,780
Your Highness, that's enough.

750
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,940
What are we talking about?

751
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,080
Your Highness.

752
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,360
Your Highness.

753
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,370
What's wrong?

754
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,850
Are you feeling unwell?

755
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,650
I'm fine.

756
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,480
I didn't sleep all night. I'm sleepy.

757
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,110
Listen.

758
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,110
You must be tired from

759
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,370
working with us recently.

760
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,270
It's been hard on you.

761
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,550
Eat more.

762
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,699
Why do I feel like something is bothering you?

763
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,840
Actually,

764
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,199
there's something I don't know

765
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,060
if I should say.

766
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,699
Usually, this sentence is followed by something

767
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:17,820
that shouldn't be said

768
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,210
but is said eventually.

769
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,239
Fine, forget it.

770
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,270
Just speak.

771
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,480
We are not in the mood

772
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,770
to listen to you beating around the bush.

773
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,030
When I was waiting outside

774
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,210
the Inspection Bureau,

775
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,750
Mr. Chen ran into me when he came out.

776
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,210
He said he wanted to hire me

777
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,170
to protect him.

778
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:33,940
Did you agree?

779
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,409
He offered a good price.

780
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,940
And I can't

781
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,239
freeload off Han Zheng

782
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,560
and do nothing all day.

783
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:45,960
I think

784
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,900
these are separate matters.

785
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:48,650
We all have our own

786
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,560
difficulties.

787
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I understand you.

788
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,780
At least we know now

789
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,080
that Mr. Chen is feeling guilty.

790
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,159
He must have been involved

791
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,300
in assaulting Shi Luqing.

792
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,360
Otherwise, why would he be so scared?

793
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,140
I'm just protecting him.

794
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,060
I won't hinder your investigation.

795
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,500
But I'm afraid

796
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,140
I won't have the time

797
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,860
to help out anymore.

798
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,460
It's okay.

799
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,590
It seems that

800
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,800
Shi Luqing

801
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,820
is still the key to solving the case.

802
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,680
How about this?

803
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,460
I'll ask the higher-ups for a search warrant.

804
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,380
Once it's approved,

805
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,960
we'll go to his previous residence

806
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,820
and have a look.

807
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,900
Sure.

808
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,520
He'an Hall is right ahead.

809
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,050
I won't walk you there,

810
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,280
in case your mother nags at you again.

811
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,380
Here.

812
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,850
Don't worry, Brother Han.

813
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,110
I'll send Jiu'er back.

814
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,240
You can send me off.

815
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,240
I sent you home last time.

816
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,370
It's time for you to return the favor.

817
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,140
But you...

818
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,570
What's with the excuses?

819
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,200
Mother.

820
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,760
Why are you out?

821
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,550
My only daughter

822
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,070
didn't come home all night.

823
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,670
Could your mother be at ease?

824
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,090
Moreover, it's raining.

825
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,140
I must pick you up.

826
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,310
Didn't I ask someone to inform you?

827
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,020
We were working last night.

828
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,690
Look at you.

829
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,370
Come here.

830
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,150
Look at you.

831
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,060
Look at how haggard you are.

832
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,450
Go home and wash your face

833
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,510
and get some sleep.

834
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,740
Prince Jun.

835
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,990
Come over when you have time.

836
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,490
Let's go.

837
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,190
What are you looking at?

838
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:33,860
Your Highness.

839
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,920
You are all Your Highnesses.

840
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,700
Why didn't she invite you

841
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,420
home?

842
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,700
You talk too much.

843
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,510
She knows me well because

844
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,980
I go to He'an Hall often.

845
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:50,850
Physician Qin

846
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,220
wasn't trying to hurt you.

847
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:52,660
I know.

848
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,810
She just doesn't want Jiu'er

849
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,820
to interact with Qi people so often.

850
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,340
Well...

851
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,930
Don't be sad.

852
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,670
I'll send you home.

853
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,140
Can you promise me

854
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,540
not to go to He'an Hall again?

855
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:10,580
No.

856
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:17,980
Why aren't you

857
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,890
saying anything, Mother?

858
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,460
What do you want me to say?

859
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,500
You can say anything.

860
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,790
If you stay silent,

861
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,570
I'll think

862
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,700
I did

863
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,760
something wrong.

864
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,600
I wanted you to only run errands at the Inspection Bureau,

865
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
and not to get involved in any cases.

866
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,120
What did you do?

867
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,790
You solved case after case.

868
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,540
I wanted you to stay away from the Qi.

869
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:47,790
Look at you.

870
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,510
You went ahead and partnered up with a Qi.

871
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,820
Mother.

872
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,560
Alright.

873
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,890
Don't worry.

874
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,480
Han Zheng is protecting me.

875
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,450
I'm safe.

876
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,730
As for the two of us,

877
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,980
we are really just partners.

878
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,240
I promised you.

879
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,450
I promised you.

880
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,950
Mother.

881
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,590
Fine.

882
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,890
I know

883
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,210
you know what to do.

884
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,460
My daughter

885
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,090
is so beautiful.

886
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,540
I wonder

887
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,970
which lucky rascal

888
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,410
will get to marry you.

889
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,020
Mother.

890
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,490
Tell me.

891
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:31,390
What kind of person

892
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,250
should I marry in the future?

893
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,590
There aren't

894
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,800
that many criteria.

895
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,570
Find someone

896
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,420
whom you like,

897
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,510
and who likes you.

898
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,410
Then,

899
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,790
what is it like

900
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,200
to like someone?

901
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,470
One day,

902
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,170
when you like someone,

903
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,940
you'll know.

904
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,220
[Inspection Bureau]

905
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,040
Hu Badao!

906
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:06,020
Here.

907
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,460

Here.

909
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:10,830
Yue Daren.

910
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:11,670
Here.

911
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,900
Su Jiu'er!

912
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,200
Here!

913
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:21,660
Here.

914
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,840
-Here. -Ou Dihua.

915
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,440
Here.

916
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,760
You two...

917
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,650
Did your mother

918
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,940
scold you yesterday?

919
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,800
It's okay.

920
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,540
She just nagged at me.

921
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,560
She can't bear to scold me.

922
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:35,880
Han Jinlun.

923
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,500
Here.

924
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,670
This rascal

925
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,960
is really considerate about Jiu'er now.

926
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,320
Commander.

927
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Everyone is here.

928
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,750
Everyone is here, right?

929
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,420
I'll start

930
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,890
giving you your assignments.

931
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,690
Wang Tianyun.

932
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,230
Here.

933
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,670
Go to the city gate and check the records.

934
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,490
See where Shi Luqing

935
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,810
had gone recently.

936
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,060
Yes.

937
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:57,690
Go.

938
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,300
Yue Daren, Han Zheng.

939
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,690
The search warrant has been issued.

940
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:05,330
You two

941
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,050
go to Shi Luqing's house

942
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,900
and see if there are any leads.

943
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:09,670
I...

944
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:10,680
Take it.

945
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,460
Alright. The rest of you can work on your own things.

946
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,120
Dismissed.

947
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,100
Yes.

948
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,350
Let's go.

949
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,080
Commander!

950
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,220
Commander.

951
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
Here's the thing.

952
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,440
These days,

953
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,330
I've been feeling in over my head

954
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,260
while working with Prince Han.

955
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,100
You know Prince Han

956
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,980
is very strong.

957
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:31,120
My

958
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,730
elderly body

959
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,340
really cannot

960
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,630
keep up with him.

961
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,770
Didn't you tell me

962
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,730
just a few days ago

963
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,400
-that you wanted to work with Han Zheng? -No.

964
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,200
Prince Han...

965
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:41,980
Anyway,

966
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:42,750
these days,

967
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,530
I haven't been cooperating well

968
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,460
with Prince Han.

969
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,460
Of course,

970
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,840
it's because I'm not capable enough.

971
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,770
I'm not like Jiu.

972
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,140
She and Prince Han's minds are in sync.

973
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,270
No, they can cooperate better with each other.

974
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,100
So I think

975
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:54,960
it's better

976
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
for them to continue to be partners.

977
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,660
That's inappropriate.

978
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,230
Although there is nothing

979
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,270
going on between us,

980
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,900
but we cannot withstand gossip.

981
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,540
How many people

982
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,380
are talking about

983
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,510
out Qian-Qi romance

984
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,320
in the Inspection Bureau alone?

985
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,920
I'm a Prince after all.

986
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,890
I don't want

987
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,330
your case—

988
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,260
Our.

989
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,530
Our case

990
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,000
to ruin my reputation.

991
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,020
Who said that?

992
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:24,830
I

993
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,670
believe that you two are innocent

994
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,310
and that you are purely partners.

995
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:29,970
From now on,

996
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,380
if anyone in the Inspection Bureau

997
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,020
dares to gossip about you,

998
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,740
I'll be the first to let them have it!

999
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,170
I'll be the second to let them have it!

1000
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,160
But Daren,

1001
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,380
it's not just the Inspection Bureau.

1002
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,110
The news

1003
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,780
has spread to Jiuxiao City.

1004
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:42,880
Jiu.

1005
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,050
Don't worry.

1006
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,610
I'm going on patrol now.

1007
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,640
If I find anyone

1008
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,220
spreading rumors,

1009
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,380
I'll take them to the Eastern Temple

1010
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,640
to listen to the teacher lecture for three days and nights.

1011
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,570
But...

1012
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,570
Are you done?

1013
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,170
Are you done?

1014
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,440
It's just a small matter.

1015
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,900
Do you have to discuss it for such a long time?

1016
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,970
It's settled then.

1017
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,910
You two

1018
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,060
go to Shi Luqing's house to investigate.

1019
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,190
Yue Daren, Hu Badao.

1020
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,280
You two

1021
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,150
go check out the area around the Western Chamber

1022
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,340
and see if there are any leads.

1023
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,020
Okay?

1024
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:15,980
Yes.

1025
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,660
Dismissed!

1026
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,180
Yes.

1027
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:20,390
Lass.

1028
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,070
Then...

1029
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:26,610
Alright.

1030
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,140
Okay.

1031
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:29,950
Hu.

1032
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,750
I don't want to talk to you.

1033
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:33,970
Let's drink.

1034
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,360
Let's go.

1035
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,720
You said you'll be the first one to ignore it.

1036
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,330
Yes.

1037
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,470
That's right.
