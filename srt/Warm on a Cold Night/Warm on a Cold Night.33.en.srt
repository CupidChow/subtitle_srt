4
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,400
Who is it?

5
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:40,789
Why are they so finicky

6
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:41,660
and coy?

7
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,580
They even made me come to them.

8
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,060
Mother.

9
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,460
You'll understand when you see them.

10
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,789
You have to be prepared.

11
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,900
Who do you think I am?

12
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,830
Nothing can shock me.

13
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,370
Let's go.

14
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,120
Seriously.

15
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,780
This place is so strange.

16
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,910
We're here, Mother.

17
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,700
Mother.

18
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,039
This is it.

19
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,100
Look.

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,840
What's wrong?

21
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:16,930
Jiu'er.

22
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,020
Have I never

23
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,820
told you that

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,170
I'm not a veterinarian?

25
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,600
I can't treat monkeys.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,540
Veterinarian? Mother.

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,070
Look who that is.

28
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,120
Come here.

29
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,010
-Look— -Uncle Bu.

30
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,620
Uncle Bu.

31
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,290
Physician Qin?

32
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,860
Bu!

33
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,710
We caught two more.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,260
They were hiding in their cellars.

35
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:41,940
General.

36
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,050
Don’t arrest me!

37
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,120
I don't want to go back to Shuobei.

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,380
I don't want to go back to Shuobei.

39
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,160
Don't arrest me. I won't go back.

40
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,340
-Stop shouting. -Don't arrest me.

41
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,270
Don't be afraid.

42
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,020
Don't be afraid.

43
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,810
It's okay.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,770
Don't be afraid.

45
00:02:57,329 --> 00:02:58,870
Father, it's okay.

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,100
Why are you shouting?

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,100
General, I couldn't control myself.

48
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,450
He wouldn't stop shouting.

49
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,120
I did it for the greater good.

50
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,430
Why are you shouting?

51
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:08,960
General.

52
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,500
Kaka.

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,880
Help your father rest.

54
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,660
Father, let's go.

55
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,320
Mother, how is it?

56
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,900
It's too strange.

57
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,980
His pulse,

58
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,750
tongue coating, and breathing

59
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,940
are all normal.

60
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,730
He doesn't look sick.

61
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,810
Thank you for your hard work.

62
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,210
Let's talk while eating.

63
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:50,970
This...

64
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,700
What is this?

65
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,020
What is this?

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,480
It's qing bu liang.

67
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,510
Drink some to cool yourself down.

68
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,670
Here.

69
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,080
Please have some, Your Highness.

70
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:11,840
Jiu'er.

71
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,360
You eat first.

72
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,460
Thank you.

73
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,279
Here, Jiu'er.

74
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,550
Thank you, Mother.

75
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,070
General.

76
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,270
I don't eat weird food.

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,410
You go ahead.

78
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,830
I'll go ahead then.

79
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,850
It's so cold.

80
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,760
No wonder you Qi like it.

81
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,170
Mother.

82
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,790
Let's get down to business.

83
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,550
You said

84
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,780
they don't look sick?

85
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,900
Yes.

86
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,570
Apart from his fangs and fur,

87
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,740
and the uncontrollable spasms,

88
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,540
there's nothing wrong with him.

89
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,380
But

90
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,220
they are easily agitated

91
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,640
and sensitive.

92
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,260
Drink it.

93
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:07,860
Especially when

94
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,520
they are feeling frightened.

95
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,140
How about this? Han Zheng, Jiu'er.

96
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,750
You two go back to He'an Hall

97
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,470
and bring me

98
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,000
some sedatives.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,940
-Han Zheng? -Han Zheng?

100
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,520
I'll try to sedate them.

101
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,810
Let's go now.

102
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,460
Let's go.

103
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,960
I'll go too.

104
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,880
Wait for me.

105
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,020
Prince Jun.

106
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,540
Prince Jun.

107
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,970
Take a rest.

108
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,340
It's just a bottle of medicine.

109
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,800
They'll be back in no time.

110
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,860
Physician Qin.

111
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,540
You don't even call Brother Han "Your Highness" anymore.

112
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,880
You don't have to be so formal with me either.

113
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,190
Just call me Wen Jun.

114
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,260
That won't do.

115
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,070
Prince Jun,

116
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,500
your status is too noble.

117
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,270
Han Zheng is different.

118
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,060
He is my future son-in-law.

119
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,690
Future son-in-law?

120
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,420
Physician Qin, you must be mistaken.

121
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:50,980
You...

122
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,300
What's wrong?

123
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,340
The three of us

124
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,730
are together every day.

125
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,060
If they're getting married,

126
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,590
I'd be the first one to know.

127
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,190
I...

128
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,710
Am I the last one to know?

129
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,430
Have they

130
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,140
told you?

131
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,050
They've told you too?

132
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:22,730
Liu Fu.

133
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,100
They've told you as well?

134
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,720
Your Highness.

135
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,690
Your Highness.

136
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,980
I just found out.

137
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,060
I just saw that their tokens' pendants

138
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,220
are the same color.

139
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,920
I've known for a long time.

140
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,600
But you know

141
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,580
my personality.

142
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,260
I keep secrets very well.

143
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,780
They've been discussing marriage

144
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,340
for a long time.

145
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,420
Right.

146
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,510
It has been going on

147
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,350
since that time you said

148
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,340
you didn't like Miss Jiu'er.

149
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,500
Prince Jun, come here.

150
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,380
Take a rest.

151
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,060
-Your Highness. -Come here.

152
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,850
Your Highness, are you alright?

153
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,990
Do I not look alright?

154
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
Your residence was back there.

155
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,660
We walked past it.

156
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,530
I don't know.

157
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,180
My emotions

158
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,930
are very complicated right now.

159
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,910
You can't let go of Jiu'er, right?

160
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,580
I don't know.

161
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,780
I said I've let her go.

162
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,000
But when I heard Physician Qin say

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,500
he's her future son-in-law,

164
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,300
when I heard you mention the matching tokens,

165
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,120
when I heard Keha say

166
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,580
they're getting married,

167
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,560
I don't know why,

168
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:43,600
but my heart started to ache again.

169
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,300
Your Highness.

170
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,930
I know

171
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,710
it's really hard

172
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,730
for you to let go completely.

173
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,340
Think about it from another perspective.

174
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,659
In this vast world,

175
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,230
it takes a great deal of luck

176
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,340
to get to become

177
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,820
not only lovers,

178
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,980
but also friends.

179
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,020
They're all good things.

180
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,710
You're right.

181
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,880
I want to give them my blessings.

182
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,910
I want to give them my blessings.

183
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,280
I want to give them my blessings!

184
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,920
Your Highness, aren't you going home?

185
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,450
It's that bottle.

186
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,130
Don't tremble, Han Zheng.

187
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,570
You're the one who's trembling.

188
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,170
I'm not.

189
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,190
I'll try to control it.

190
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,260
You should have just

191
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,940
asked me to get it.

192
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,340
Why did you have to climb up there yourself?

193
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,179
No.

194
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,740
All of these bottles

195
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,230
are my mother's treasures.

196
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,030
I can only trust myself to get it.

197
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,100
If you and the bottle

198
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,940
both fall,

199
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,940
I won't know what to save first.

200
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,200
Come down. Let me do it.

201
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:49,860
Come on.

202
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,750
You're right.

203
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,210
Yes, that's it.

204
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,900
Why did everything fall?

205
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,450
I...

206
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,210
What's wrong, Han Zheng?

207
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,860
The first stage

208
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,240
of ancestral return

209
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,240
is trembling.

210
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,460
Your Highness, bad news!

211
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,680
Your Highness.

212
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,380
Your Highness.

213
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,090
Is the first stage of ancestral return

214
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,390
the inability to control your body

215
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,520
and trembling?

216
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:31,730
This...

217
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,800
Are you okay, Keha?

218
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,960
Are you okay, Keha?

219
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
Y- Your Highness!

220
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,620
I can't control myself.

221
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,140
H- Help me!

222
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,960
Your Highness.

223
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,620
Why are you trembling so much?

224
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,300
All done.

225
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,590
Thank you.

226
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,420
Han Zheng.

227
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,260
Are you okay?

228
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:15,760
Jiu'er.

229
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,980
Don't come too close to me.

230
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,910
What if I hurt you again?

231
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,260
That was just an accident.

232
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,290
It's okay.

233
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:26,910
No.

234
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,020
D- Don't do this.

235
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,380
Don't avoid me.

236
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,570
Hurry up, go over there.

237
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,720
No.

238
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,660
Don't try to get rid of me.

239
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,020
No.

240
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:37,900
You can't.

241
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,900
Give me this hand.

242
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,000
Don't move.

243
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,110
Don't move.

244
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,280
Jiu'er.

245
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,560
Don't move.

246
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,550
I don't think I came at the right time.

247
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,150
Luckily,

248
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,340
you and Jiu'er are both fine.

249
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,840
Strange.

250
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,050
It seems ancestral return

251
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,260
is only affecting the Qi,

252
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,990
not the Qian.

253
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,020
It's not necessarily

254
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,080
ancestral return.

255
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,880
Maybe you just

256
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,940
lost control

257
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,700
of your body.

258
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,440
Look.

259
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,140
Your emotions are not out of control.

260
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,260
You didn't grow fur

261
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,020
that cannot be shaved off

262
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,220
like they did, either.

263
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,280
-Right? -You fool.

264
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,480
I'm the one who's going to grow fur.

265
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,740
Why are you so anxious?

266
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,740
Don't worry, Jiu'er.

267
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,660
I'll send a message back to Shuobei

268
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,020
and ask if Teacher has heard of

269
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,080
any similar cases.

270
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,610
As for Han Zheng,

271
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,220
you stay here and take care of Keha.

272
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,960
Don't go back to Shuobei Dance Tavern

273
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,020
for the time being.

274
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,080
What if it's really ancestral return?

275
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,010
Qi people are sensitive by nature.

276
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,940
If they see there's something wrong with their prince,

277
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,400
they'll be inconsolable.

278
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:54,770
Okay.

279
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,310
How about this?

280
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,800
You bring Jiu'er away first.

281
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,780
Then, lock Keha and I

282
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,620
in He'an Hall.

283
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,060
Tomorrow at noon,

284
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,980
come back

285
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,740
only if I'm fine.

286
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,220
No.

287
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,670
I want to stay and take care of you.

288
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm not leaving.

289
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,370
Besides,

290
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,860
I can observe

291
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,410
your and Keha's situation.

292
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,740
It might be helpful

293
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,620
for my mother's analysis.

294
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,300
I'm not leaving.

295
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:12,780
No.

296
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,500
What if I shapeshift at night

297
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,360
and injure you?

298
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,430
What...

299
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,740
What if

300
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,920
you lose control at night

301
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,570
and hide yourself away

302
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,700
in a deserted cave?

303
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,030
I won't be able to find you ever again.

304
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,010
What should I do then?

305
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,810
I can't leave.

306
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,590
How could I be so fragile?

307
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,670
Jiu'er is right.

308
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,080
You need

309
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,180
a normal and calm person

310
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,240
to take care of you.

311
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,620
Otherwise,

312
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,150
you can't even drink water.

313
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,960
You're exaggerating.

314
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,360
How is that possible?

315
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,010
Look at you.

316
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,160
Why am I okay?

317
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,660
Han Zheng.

318
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,340
W- What's wrong?

319
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,740
Are you trembling again?

320
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,210
No.

321
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,980
I just wanted to pull out my hand

322
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:29,990
so that

323
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,100
you can sleep more comfortably.

324
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,730
Let me see.

325
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,560
Other hand.

326
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,460
You haven't trembled

327
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,300
for four hours.

328
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,750
Isn't that good?

329
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,840
You can finally

330
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,120
sleep in peace now.

331
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,430
What's wrong?

332
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,370
Tomorrow morning,

333
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,470
if I find that fur has grown

334
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,980
all over your face and body,

335
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,010
and your condition has gotten worse,

336
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,010
what should we do?

337
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,980
If that's the case,

338
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,410
will you be scared of me?

339
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,260
Will you stop liking me?

340
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,700
I won't.

341
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,660
I wish...

342
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,780
I wish your whole body

343
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,030
would be full of fur.

344
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,470
When that happens,

345
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,670
no one will want to take you away from me.

346
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,740
I'm just worried

347
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,660
you won't be able

348
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,000
to attend the Xuandong Grand Ceremony

349
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,100
because of that.

350
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,230
In that case,

351
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,010
I'll resign to fate.

352
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,460
Besides,

353
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,760
I am already prepared

354
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,620
not to ascend to the throne.

355
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,010
Actually, I’ve been thinking.

356
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,860
Isn't it a pity for you to give up the throne

357
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,510
because of me?

358
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,180
I have always thought

359
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,310
you will be

360
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,400
an even better king

361
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,840
than the King of Xueqi.

362
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,440
If I can still attend

363
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,780
the Xuandong Grand Ceremony,

364
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,820
I will do my best.

365
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,160
But if fate wants makes a fool of me,

366
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,900
or

367
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,820
if my people

368
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,220
can't accept our relationship,

369
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,380
there's nothing I can do about it.

370
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,350
It's not a pity.

371
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,660
Besides,

372
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,550
there are many outstanding talents

373
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,830
among the younger generation of Qi,

374
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,190
like Chilan.

375
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,340
How can you

376
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,460
be so calm

377
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,380
when faced with such a serious problem?

378
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,520
Maybe it's because

379
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,390
I have broken into the Qian palace,

380
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,850
gone to jail, fallen into water,

381
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,700
and had my Qi Vital Stone almost entirely dug out,

382
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,300
but

383
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,100
I'm still

384
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,960
alive and well.

385
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,760
As long as I'm with you,

386
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,650
I can get out of danger every time.

387
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,110
It's the same this time.

388
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,140
As long as we are together,

389
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,600
we can solve this problem.

390
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,960
Whether its ancestral return

391
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,760
or the throne,

392
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,820
we can deal with anything.

393
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,580
We just have to stay together.

394
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,300
If we get through it

395
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,130
this time,

396
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,900
I want to bring you back to Shuobei immediately.

397
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,630
At the Under the Moon Festival,

398
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,330
in front everyone, I want to—

399
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,310
What are you doing?

400
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,110
Stop talking.

401
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,070
Why?

402
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,340
Let me tell you a secret.

403
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,140
I'm very afraid of people

404
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,500
making these kinds of promises to me.

405
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,910
My father

406
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,160
once promised me

407
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,220
he would come back

408
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,640
in time to bring me to the lantern festival.

409
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,870
He did come back,

410
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,800
but

411
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,840
he had been poisoned.

412
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,420
Poisoned?

413
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,170
I've got it!

414
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,580
What is it?

415
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:40,700
You guys are undergoing

416
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,220
ancestral return for no reason.

417
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,940
Could it be

418
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,660
because you were poisoned?

419
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,780
It's possible.

420
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,860
How about this?

421
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,720
Tomorrow morning,

422
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,950
I'll look through all the medical books

423
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,020
in Jiuxiao City.

424
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,420
I don't believe

425
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,970
I won't find any clues.

426
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,440
Ancestral return?

427
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,109
This happened to Han Zheng as well?

428
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,460
This is very strange.

429
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,579
If Han Zheng is unable to return to Shuobei

430
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,510
because of this,

431
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,970
it'll be no different from announcing to everyone

432
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,740
that he's giving up his candidacy for the throne.

433
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,540
The Xuandong Grand Ceremony...

434
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,829
If Han Zheng is unable to

435
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,700
make it back in time,

436
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,550
who will benefit the most?

437
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,120
King Mucha of Xuanqi.

438
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
The Xuanqi is adept at making drugs.

439
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,730
Could it be...

440
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,460
If the Xuanqi tribe

441
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,790
really did this

442
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,420
to stop Han Zheng from ascending to the throne,

443
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,700
and in the process

444
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,050
even implicating

445
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,920
our clanspeople in Jiuxiao City,

446
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,840
then I don't have to

447
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,780
tolerate

448
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,340
their ambition any longer.

449
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,990
What does the incident in Jiuxiao City

450
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,020
have to do with me?

451
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,350
Your Majesty’s ability to impute crimes to others

452
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,320
is really admirable.

453
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,510
How dare you!

454
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,180
King of Xuanqi,

455
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,340
King of Cangqi.

456
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,760
Why did you bring troops into the palace?

457
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,660
Why?

458
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,860
I have a question for Your Majesty.

459
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,150
How could you

460
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,490
disregard

461
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,950
the welfare of the Qi race

462
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,820
in order

463
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,300
to protect your throne?

464
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,600
King of Xuanqi.

465
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,620
Do you think nothing

466
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,940
of rites and laws?

467
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,960
That depends on

468
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,270
whether our King

469
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,550
thinks anything about

470
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,240
the safety of the four tribes.

471
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,650
King of Cangqi.

472
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,430
You have always behaved in a measured manner.

473
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,940
Why did you come here

474
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,110
with the King of Xuanqi?

475
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,380
Your Majesty.

476
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,030
Your son

477
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,260
let my son, Keyuncha,

478
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,370
die in front of him,

479
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,370
and did nothing about it.

480
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,330
Considering the bigger picture,

481
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,130
I accepted it.

482
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,290
But now,

483
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,940
the far north has been covered over by ice.

484
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,300
Your Majesty didn't warn the people,

485
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,430
and even blocked the flow of information

486
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,660
to conceal it deliberately!

487
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,990
I cannot stand for this!

488
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,140
Everyone says

489
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,220
the strange weather in recent years

490
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,150
has to do with the loss of the Ember.

491
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,880
I want the truth from Your Majesty.

492
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,220
Is that true?

493
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,080
If Your Majesty doesn't say anything,

494
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,030
that's fine too.

495
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,700
Let’s go together

496
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,100
to the Holy Fire Hall

497
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,780
and we’ll know the truth.

498
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,070
You don't have fur!

499
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,470
Check if your hands are trembling.

500
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,760
I don't think they are.

501
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,240
Great.

502
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,330
Your condition hasn't gotten worse.

503
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,650
Bad news!

504
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,030
It's too serious!

505
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,370
I'm so sleepy.

506
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,420
I can't sleep.

507
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,570
Young man,

508
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,860
you're so naughty.

509
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,620
Poisoned?

510
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,280
It's possible.

511
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,340
I looked through all my mother's medical books,

512
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,600
but I couldn't find these same symptoms.

513
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,570
There are many kinds of poisons in the world.

514
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,740
So I asked you all to come

515
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,140
to brainstorm together.

516
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:33,980
That's easy.

517
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,050
Liu Fu.

518
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,970
Send someone to collect all the

519
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,620
medical books, medicinal books,

520
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,400
and herbal manuals they can find.

521
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,330
Let's look through them one by one.

522
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,830
Please bring the Qi language versions too.

523
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,220
OK.

524
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,640
I think I found one.

525
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,290
Here.

526
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,030
Can you understand it?

527
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,630
I can't.

528
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,110
Let me read it.

529
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,760
I...

530
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,790
Let me see.

531
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,350
This is Qi language, Mother.

532
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,990
General.

533
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,620
Writings on Perculiar Plants.

534
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,710
It records

535
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,020
a kind of poisonous mushroom

536
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,020
that grows

537
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,370
in hot and humid places.

538
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,470
After certain animals ingest them,

539
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,870
they will spasm all over.

540
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,240
They will also grow fur

541
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,220
and fangs.

542
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,280
It's really very similar.

543
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,390
Could...

544
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,380
Could it be

545
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,620
only a similar poison?

546
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,340
Wait for me.

547
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,970
General.

548
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,100
You are...

549
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,020
According to the book,

550
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,620
the calls of a cat can

551
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,500
intensify its toxicity.

552
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Let's test it out.

553
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,620
Stop it.

554
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:12,840
Cat?

555
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:28,730
Han Zheng.

556
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,890
Are you alright?

557
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,380
Your Highness!

558
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,270
-Why is it so serious? -Keha!

559
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,600
Save me, Your Highness!

560
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,940
It seems this is the poison.

561
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,340
It can't be wrong.

562
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,860
The book also said

563
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,270
this mushroom

564
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,700
will only become poisonous

565
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,020
when the surrounding temperature

566
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,420
reaches a certain level.

567
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,210
No wonder only Qi people were poisoned.

568
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,340
Qian people haven't

569
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,330
because Qian people's body temperature

570
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,130
is higher than that of Qi people.

571
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,870
Who poisoned them then?

572
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,860
Could it have been an accident?

573
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,220
Such a rare poison

574
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,950
couldn't possibly appear in Jiuxiao City,

575
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,540
much less get accidentally ingested by so many people.

576
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,510
But it's hard to find out where it came from

577
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,990
for the time being.

578
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,160
Well...

579
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,870
Is there an antidote for it?

580
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,960
There is a plant

581
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,960
called xieshanlong.

582
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,820
Physician Qin, have you heard of it?

583
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,420
Yes!

584
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,940
I've heard of xieshanlong!

585
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,340
But I heard that plant

586
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,620
only grows

587
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,510
in the frigid regions of the far north.

588
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,510
I think it only grows in Shuobei.

589
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,420
That's not a problem.

590
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,460
Chilan.

591
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,720
Send a letter to Shuobei

592
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,960
and ask Teacher

593
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,030
to help us find some xieshanlong.

594
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,640
In that case,

595
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,960
isn't everything solved?

596
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,760
-Right? -Yes.

597
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,760
That's Qing'er's call.

598
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,760
Teacher replied to us.

599
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,940
Maybe they already know that

600
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,620
xieshanlong is the antidote.

601
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,850
That's great!

602
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,530
Teacher said that

603
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,670
xieshanlong has stopped growing

604
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,000
because of polar night.

605
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,140
To think that

606
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,100
our problems are compounding.

607
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,740
If it weren't for the fact that we are desperate,

608
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,410
we wouldn't have told

609
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,660
Prince Jun

610
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,930
about the missing Ember.

611
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:23,940
So no matter what,

612
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,030
the Ember is the only antidote.

613
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,360
We must find the Ember

614
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,080
to cure Qi's strange disease.

615
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,500
Don't worry.

616
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,800
Although I'm a prince of Qian,

617
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,980
more importantly, you are my friends.

618
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,300
I will never tell

619
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,650
anyone else about this,

620
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,460
including Father, Eldest Brother,

621
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,060
and Liu Fu.

622
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,260
I didn't expect

623
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,260
you all to trust me enough

624
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,900
to tell me such an important secret.

625
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,600
Jun.

626
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,340
You haven't thought of

627
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,000
the more serious side to this.

628
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,180
Xuanqi has always

629
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,270
seen the Qian as a thorn in its side.

630
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,600
But in the past,

631
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,590
the Cangqi and Chiqi

632
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,820
supported my father.

633
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,920
They also believed in the philosophy

634
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,220
of living in peace with the Qian.

635
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,350
But it's different now.

636
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,700
The loss of the Ember was exposed.

637
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,650
The King of Xuanqi

638
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,980
colluded with the King of Cangqi

639
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,880
to force my father

640
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,810
to send troops as soon as possible.

641
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,560
They believe

642
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,110
only by conquering the state of Qian

643
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,040
and moving south

644
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,310
can the Qi

645
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,150
survive polar night.

646
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,320
Will the King of Xueqi agree?

647
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,250
Father

648
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,270
is discussing it with the Chiqi.

649
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,780
He hasn't agreed yet.

650
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,740
But I think the Xuanqi and the others

651
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,010
can't wait long.

652
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,970
Soon,

653
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,970
the Qi will fragment.

654
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,780
The Cangqi

655
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:42,990
and Xuanqi

656
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,000
will form an alliance to advance south.

657
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,470
Isn't the Qian

658
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,420
in danger?

659
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,280
Looking at you,

660
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,120
there's no way we can defeat the Qi.

661
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,150
Can we avoid war

662
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,970
by finding the Ember?

663
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,790
All these years,

664
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,390
we’ve been looking for

665
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,150
the whereabouts of the Ember.

666
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,560
If it's really that simple,

667
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,090
why have we waited till now?

668
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,700
What should we do?

669
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,300
There's still hope.

670
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,620
What?

671
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,510
The Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

672
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,830
This is the reason why

673
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,820
His Majesty and Teacher

674
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,820
tasked us with it.

675
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,460
After all,

676
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,390
the Chiqi has always stood with the Xueqi.

677
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,340
And the King of Cangqi

678
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,170
is just worried that the Qi would be exterminated.

679
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:21,790
He doesn't really

680
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,590
want to start a war with the Qian.

681
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,540
If we can get the Qian-Qi Six Treaties

682
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,740
signed successfully

683
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,020
and move our people to Dongji Island

684
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,470
before polar night comes,

685
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,060
the King of Cangqi

686
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,970
won't have to ally themselves with the Xuanqi.

687
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,020
When that time comes,

688
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,550
the Xuanqi will be all alone

689
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,880
and there's nothing they can do about it.

690
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,390
It looks like

691
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,780
we can only ask Eldest Brother for help.

692
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
After all, only he

693
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,210
can influence Father's decision.

694
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,880
Boss,

695
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,310
what kind of teas do you have?

696
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,230
We have the best Longjing

697
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,210
and Pu'er from Yunnan.

698
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,810
What would you like to drink?

699
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,950
Give me the best one.

700
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,510
Okay.

701
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,100
Jun.

702
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,460
You're looking for me in such a hurry.

703
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,220
Did something

704
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,020
happen again?

705
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:06,780
Why couldn't we talk

706
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,740
at home?

707
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,140
Since the incident with Uncle,

708
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,230
many Qi people

709
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,030
have left Jiuxiao City for good.

710
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,220
I'm afraid I won't have a residence

711
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,660
full of theatre lovers again in my life.

712
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,600
The Qi are gone,

713
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,880
but there are still Qian people.

714
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,220
Yes.

715
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,820
But we can't go back to the way things were.

716
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,670
My roof is broken,

717
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,840
but I can only get a Qian to fix it.

718
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,100
The repairman said

719
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,740
I will have to wait

720
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,860
for three months.

721
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,020
That long?

722
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,540
It's not just your roof.

723
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,940
The medicine in my shop

724
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,070
cost three times as much

725
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,050
when Qian people supply them,

726
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,320
even though they're the same products and take the same route.

727
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,920
Yes.

728
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,350
The devil is in the comparison.

729
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,370
There are some things

730
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,940
that the Qian and Qi do differently.

731
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,640
Yes.

732
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,340
You can't say that.

733
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,450
Everything

734
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,630
has their own advantages and disadvantages.

735
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,740
Those people who used to

736
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,980
compete with the Qi for business

737
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,360
must be doing well now, right?

738
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,920
Those who used to do business with the Qi

739
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,320
cannot make a living now.

740
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,140
Look.

741
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,030
I have a whole cart of ice that I can't sell.

742
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,340
Look, now that the Qi have left,

743
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,400
isn't it rather inconvenient for us?

744
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,600
It's not rather inconvenient.

745
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,060
It's extremely inconvenient!

746
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,980
Exactly.

747
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,440
Don't you all think that

748
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,620
after the Qi left,

749
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,070
our quality of life

750
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,080
has regressed

751
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,510
by 20 years?

752
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,620
20 years?

753
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,400
Really?

754
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,020
We can't even make a living.

755
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,500
Yes.

756
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,060
It's regressed by 20 years.

757
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,580
It's too hard nowadays.

758
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,370
Yes.

759
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,470
Eldest Brother.

760
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,990
Eldest Brother.

761
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,880
That's not acting.

762
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,430
No one can script the commoners' talk

763
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,970
down to the last word.

764
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,170
We just used some tricks

765
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:00,760
to make them say

766
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,090
what they really think.

767
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,240
How?

768
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,630
Jiu'er, Physician Qin,

769
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,430
and their neighbors

770
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,140
got up early

771
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,600
to chat with everyone.

772
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,630
They left before I came?

773
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,460
Yes.

774
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,540
Brat.

775
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,110
As a prince,

776
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,440
you allowed yourself to be manipulated by others,

777
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,570
and you used such a cheap trick at that.

778
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,990
Eldest Brother,

779
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,140
no one is manipulating anyone.

780
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,810
Those commoners

781
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,320
had not been manipulated either.

782
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,310
What they told us

783
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,610
was what they really thought.

784
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,420
And everyone

785
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,580
genuinely believes

786
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,750
we should sign

787
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,580
the Qian-Qi Six Treaties

788
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,240
and keep Qi people in our city.

789
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,010
The Qian-Qi Six Treaties are very significant.

790
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,900
You can't go by feel on this matter.

791
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,220
No.

792
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,940
I've thought about it carefully.

793
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,580
Besides...

794
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,180
What?

795
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,560
Eldest Brother.

796
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,780
Something has happened both in Jiuxiao City

797
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,860
and in Shuobei.

798
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,740
I’m afraid

799
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,780
this is our best opportunity

800
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,820
for an alliance between the Qian and Qi.

801
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,550
If we miss it,

802
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,980
we might have to wait ten,

803
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,440
or even hundreds of years.

804
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,520
What happened in Shuobei?

805
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,400
Your Highness.

806
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,170
This is an important matter.

807
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,830
I'll explain it to you myself.

808
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,650
Your Highness.

809
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,900
Your Highness.

810
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:25,970
This way, please.

811
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,780
I wonder what General Chilan

812
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,760
has to tell me?

813
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,660
Have a seat.

814
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,080
Your Highness, you have so many travelers in Qi.

815
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,340
How can you not know what I'm going to say?

816
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,520
Qi is in such a big trouble,

817
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,690
but you are still in the mood to joke?

818
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,550
I'm not joking.

819
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,300
Just like you know the situation in Qi

820
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,410
very well,

821
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,140
I am also clear about what Qian is thinking.

822
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,040
In the past, you didn't want to sign it

823
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,390
because you were afraid that

824
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,280
something would happen

825
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
from close cooperation with the Qi.

826
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,580
Now, you don't want to sign

827
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,100
because you want to reap the benefits

828
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,260
of Qi's internal strife.

829
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:03,660
Right?

830
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,020
This is the most direct

831
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,250
and undemanding

832
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,830
political discussion I've ever had.

833
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,130
But Your Highness,

834
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,500
with all due respect,

835
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,150
you won't be able to reap any benefits.

836
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,320
Really?

837
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,380
The Qian and Qi are not evenly matched.

838
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,740
If we don't sign the Qian-Qi Six Treaties

839
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,780
and the King of Xueqi can't unite the four tribes,

840
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,180
the Qi will be thrown into chaos.

841
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,110
When the time comes,

842
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,770
the Qi will not be fragmented.

843
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,780
They will only cast their sights

844
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,130
onto Qian's territory.

845
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,480
Because whoever takes over Qian

846
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,410
will become the new king of Qi.

847
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,140
General,

848
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,040
we might not lose the war.

849
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,300
Yes.

850
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,980
But the King of Xueqi

851
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,970
once told me that

852
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,310
instead of mutual mistrust

853
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,690
that leads to losses on both sides,

854
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,760
we should work together

855
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,490
to create a win-win situation.

856
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,960
Is the Qian really going to choose war

857
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,980
instead of collaboration for mutual benefit?

858
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,260
I've tried my best.

859
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:04,900
The rest

860
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,870
is up to General Chilan.

861
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,830
Don't worry.

862
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,460
Chilan has never lost an argument

863
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,660
in all of her 60 years.

864
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,810
But Jun also said that

865
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,170
the Crown Prince

866
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,920
has never lost a debate either.

867
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,340
Who do you think

868
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,180
will win

869
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,380
the argument of the century?

870
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,270
I'm done.

871
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:30,580
General.

872
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,350
How was it?

873
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,540
My brother lost so soon?

874
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,740
No.

875
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:35,970
Did you lose?

876
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:37,830
No.

877
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,380
General, tell me quickly.

878
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,240
What happened?

879
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,320
What's the result?

880
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,290
Your brother isn't the one signing the treaties.

881
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:44,980
How could he

882
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,140
give me a result now?

883
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,270
Right.

884
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,940
But

885
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,900
you can send someone

886
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,200
to get news from the palace in a couple of days.

887
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,060
We should be able to find out soon.

888
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,290
Yes.

889
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,780
Let's go back and wait.

890
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,130
Let's go.

891
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,220
As long as we can sign the Qian-Qi Six Treaties,

892
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:04,970
we can resolve

893
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,030
Shuobei's crisis.

894
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,010
But

895
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,790
we still don't know

896
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,830
where the poison came from.

897
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,130
Those poisoned Qi

898
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:15,940
are very agitated

899
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,900
and incoherent.

900
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,970
I can't get anything out of them.

901
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,080
If only there was a way

902
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,440
to help them relax.

903
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
That'll be great.

904
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,800
Keha.

905
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,600
What are you doing?

906
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,840
I'm enjoying happiness.

907
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,530
Happiness?

908
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,910
What happiness?

909
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,170
We like this kind of grass.

910
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,910
It's so comfortable to rub up against it.

911
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,040
I didn't know there would be so much of it in Jiuxiao City.

912
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,100
You're an adult.

913
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,700
Can't you control yourself?

914
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,100
Han Zheng.

915
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:04,780
Here.

916
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,510
You try it too.

917
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,210
There's no need.

918
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,449
Just try it.

919
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:10,340
Try it.

920
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,280
Try it.

921
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,520
Come on.

922
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,900
Feel it.

923
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,659
Do you feel anything?

924
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,060
I have a lot of self-discipline.

925
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,120
What are you doing?

926
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:30,699
I know.

927
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,110
Isn't this

928
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
the thing that can help you Qi

929
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,400
relax?

930
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,780
This is it.

931
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,080
Come here.

932
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,100
This is very comfortable.

933
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,940
Don't be afraid.

934
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,139
Come here.

935
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,139
Don't be afraid.

936
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,000
Come on.

937
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,300
Stand here

938
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:53,080
and listen to me.

939
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:53,889
Just do

940
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:54,770
whatever I say.

941
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,540
OK.

942
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,580
Next,

943
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:02,220
imagine that

944
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,180
you are in a safe

945
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,740
and comfortable environment.

946
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,690
There are countless foxtails around you

947
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,520
and

948
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,040
all of your loved ones.

949
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,400
Since it's so comfortable,

950
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,020
can you tell me

951
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,620
where you went

952
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
and what you did

953
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,650
before you found that

954
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,750
you had been poisoned?

955
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,880
Okay.

956
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:36,100
I went to Jiuxiao City to carry bricks.

957
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,800
It was very hot.

958
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,710
The foreman even gave us iced water.

959
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,820
Qiwei Pavilion

960
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,460
received a batch of premium frozen beef liver.

961
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,420
I cut them for a whole day

962
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,680
and ate a few pieces.

963
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,300
It was so delicious.

964
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,620
I spent a whole day milling iced soy milk

965
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,340
in Miss Wang's tofu shop in South Street.

966
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,090
The soy milk was so sweet.

967
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,410
Iced soy milk.

968
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,550
So comfortable.

969
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,450
Iced water.

970
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,030
Frozen beef liver.

971
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,740
Iced tofu.

972
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,260
Ice...

973
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,880
I've got it.

974
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,420
The only thing that stands out

975
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,280
is that they had all had iced food.

976
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:33,880
Ice?

977
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,500
Right.

978
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,920
We all had some of the

979
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,920
qing bu liang (a sweet soup containing grains, seeds, sugar and crushed ice).

980
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,050
Only Chilan didn't.

981
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,660
But this

982
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,940
is just speculation.

983
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,460
As for the specifics,

984
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,720
we must still consult my mother.

985
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,250
Let's go.

986
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:49,860
Let's go.

987
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,120
The person who planted the poison

988
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,270
is really cunning.

989
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,220
What do you mean, Mother?

990
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,120
This poison was originally light yellow in color

991
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,660
and

992
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,640
had a bitter moldy taste.

993
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,030
But as long as it

994
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,320
is in cold water,

995
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,520
it becomes colorless and tasteless.

996
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,810
Qi people like ice.

997
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,700
Isn't this poison

998
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,920
targetting them?

999
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,960
But now that we know the source of the poison,

1000
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,490
we have a way to deal with it.

1001
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,440
I'll let

1002
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,600
the Qi people in Jiuxiao City know

1003
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,460
to be cautious.

1004
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,580
I'll send someone to keep an eye on the ice warehouse.

1005
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,740
Once there is anyone suspicious,

1006
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,600
we'll take him down immediately.

1007
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,900
Han Zheng.

1008
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,830
Don't worry.

1009
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,300
I will

1010
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,270
arrest the murderer

1011
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,400
before you grow fur.

1012
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,590
I'm just thinking about how

1013
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,900
this poison

1014
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,340
seems to be

1015
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,020
designed by Yinxue Pavilion,

1016
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,590
but it's not fatal.

1017
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,290
What are they after

1018
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,690
in planting this poison?

1019
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,620
Maybe they want to use the crime of shapeshifting

1020
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,680
to kick Qi people out of Jiuxiao City.

1021
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,190
No.

1022
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,180
They even silenced

1023
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,250
Marquis Xian.

1024
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,400
Why do they only want to

1025
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,970
expel the Qi people?

1026
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,810
This is very strange.

1027
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,430
What are you afraid of?

1028
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,620
No matter how troublesome they are,

1029
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,820
we can deal with them.

1030
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,390
Besides,

1031
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,320
good news is coming.

1032
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,090
You guys go after the source of the poison.

1033
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:30,770
These days,

1034
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,420
Eldest Brother has been busy.

1035
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,060
He has been conferring with

1036
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,190
some officials from the Pro-Qi Party.

1037
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,050
They just finished writing a memorial yesterday.

1038
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:37,840
Today, they went to

1039
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,580
the Palace of Great Supremacy

1040
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,540
to discuss it with Father.

1041
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,140
And then?

1042
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,360
Father agreed to consider it.

1043
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,340
Great.

1044
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,600
Then, this matter is settled.

1045
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,030
The Qian-Qi Six Treaties will be signed soon.

1046
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,960
Why do I feel like

1047
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,050
this is so surreal?

1048
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,940
It's real. How is it surreal?

1049
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,780
There's nothing

1050
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,780
we can't achieve.

1051
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,790
But

1052
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,440
I still want to say something to

1053
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,040
the person I admire the most.

1054
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,960
General Chilan.

1055
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,700
We

1056
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,910
tormented Eldest Brother for so long,

1057
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,100
but couldn't make him agree.

1058
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,980
You managed to convince him

1059
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,850
with just a few words.

1060
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,050
Here's a toast to you.

1061
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,410
This is also because

1062
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,120
you guys had set it up well.

1063
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,930
That's enough.

1064
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,030
Why are you flattering each other?

1065
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,200
Sit down.

1066
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,030
Alright.

1067
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,450
I admire

1068
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,480
Jun's brother,

1069
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,820
our  Crown Prince,

1070
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,150
the most.

1071
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,020
If he wasn't fair, selfless,

1072
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,860
and far-sighted,

1073
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,060
we couldn't have resolved this so soon.

1074
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,140
Of course.

1075
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,220
We can't let our guard down.

1076
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,050
We haven't settled the poison yet.

1077
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,440
Yinxue Pavilion might also obstruct

1078
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,300
the signing of the Qian-Qi Six Treaties at any time.

1079
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,030
Don't worry.

1080
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,840
I've sent people

1081
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,700
to guard all the shops in the city.

1082
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,590
Once the poisoner shows up,

1083
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,300
we'll take him down immediately.

1084
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,160
Prince Jun and I

1085
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,450
will also send someone to keep an eye on

1086
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,450
Administer Deng.

1087
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,620
How would all of these difficult problems

1088
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,830
been solved

1089
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,920
without your help?

1090
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,140
On behalf of His Majesty and the Qi race,

1091
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,400
I want to thank you all.

1092
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,450
What you said

1093
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,140
makes us

1094
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,670
feel a little embarrassed.

1095
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,130
Actually,

1096
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,520
I'm the one

1097
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,670
who should thank everyone.

1098
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,930
Why are you

1099
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,020
suddenly being polite too?

1100
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,770
Exactly.

1101
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,060
We're not used to

1102
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,310
you being like that.

1103
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,310
But I still want to say it.

1104
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,880
I have never thought that

1105
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,950
a group of friends from Qian

1106
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,620
would be the ones to help the Qi

1107
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,880
in our time of trouble.

1108
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,940
I'm not someone

1109
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,390
who can express myself well.

1110
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,020
But I'm lucky

1111
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,710
to have met

1112
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,660
friends like all of you.

1113
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,630
Brother Han.

1114
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,750
Having a friend like you

1115
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,910
makes me feel lucky too.

1116
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,640
Why are you being so cheesy?

1117
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,260
This is the Han Zheng

1118
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,160
we know.

1119
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,280
Come on.

1120
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,940
Let's have another toast

1121
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,740
to celebrate.

1122
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,580
-Come on. -Come on.

1123
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,040
Come on.

1124
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,020
Cheers.

1125
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,880
Your Highness.

1126
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,050
This way, please.

1127
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,320
You've also prepared wine?

1128
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,520
You knew I was coming?

1129
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:38,740
I dare not think that way.

1130
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,600
I prepared wine

1131
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,180
because today

1132
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,110
is a special day.

1133
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,390
What wine is this?

1134
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,130
Osmanthus wine.

1135
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,350
Mine too.

1136
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,820
What a coincidence.

1137
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,630
Whose should we drink first?

1138
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,140
Either.

1139
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:55,700
We must finish both anyway.

1140
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,220
Here.

1141
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,720
I came to find you today

1142
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,700
for two reasons.

1143
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,570
-Firstly... -To thank me?

1144
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,890
Does Your Highness mean

1145
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,920
the Qian-Qi Six Treaties will definitely be signed?

1146
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
I didn't say that.

1147
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,910
Don't worry.

1148
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,600
I'm not here to sound you out.

1149
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,810
I'm here

1150
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:17,910
to tell you that

1151
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,210
whether the Qian-Qi Six Treaties are signed or not,

1152
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,810
I'll be going back to Shubei.

1153
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,270
Will you come back?

1154
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,920
If they don't get signed,

1155
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,150
there is no way I can come back.

1156
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,170
If they do,

1157
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,040
I'll have to stay in Shuobei

1158
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,260
for the time being

1159
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,250
to handle Qi official matters.

1160
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,260
If you want to drink with me,

1161
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,540
send a letter to Shuobei

1162
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,260
and tell me you have other joint initiatives

1163
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,340
you wish to talk to me about.

1164
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,540
I'll come right away.

1165
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,630
What's the second thing?

1166
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,570
Today is my birthday.

1167
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:01,600
I don't have many other friends

1168
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,750
in Jiuxiao City.

1169
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,980
You've been helping me a lot lately.

1170
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,110
I've kept it in mind.

1171
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:06,880
So

1172
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,130
I came to have a drink with you

1173
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:09,970
and bid farewell.

1174
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,230
Take it as an expression of my gratitude.

1175
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,420
It's really the thought that counts

1176
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,450
with you.

1177
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,940
Don't you Qian have a saying that goes,

1178
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:23,470
"Great benefactions do not need expressions of gratitude"?

1179
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,310
Do you know why

1180
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,870
I prepared wine today?

1181
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,350
Why?

1182
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,020
Because today

1183
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,370
is my deceased wife's birthday.

1184
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,970
The late Crown Princess and I

1185
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,300
have the same birthday?

1186
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,020
It's a kind of fate.

1187
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:42,840
Happy birthday.

1188
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,230
I'm suddenly curious.

1189
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,920
What kind of person

1190
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,720
was she?

1191
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,840
What makes you so taken by her?

1192
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,230
Suddenly,

1193
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,770
I don't know how to describe her.

1194
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,110
She was

1195
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,420
a very rounded woman.

1196
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,370
I've been talking about myself for a long time.

1197
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,230
What about you?

1198
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:12,540
What kind of husband

1199
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,710
would a rational and decisive female general like you

1200
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,750
choose?

1201
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,090
I've never thought about it.

1202
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,690
Do you have someone you like?

1203
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,660
I didm

1204
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,790
when I was young.

1205
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,310
And then?

1206
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,310
Did you confess?

1207
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:34,770
Sadly,

1208
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:35,990
I didn't get to

1209
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,830
before he left Shuobei.

1210
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,530
Sometimes I wonder

1211
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,580
if things would have turned out different

1212
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:44,640
had I

1213
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,660
told him about it earlier.

1214
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,130
There are many decisions to make in life.

1215
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,540
That was the best one you made at that time.

1216
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,820
But it doesn't mean you have no regrets.

1217
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,470
If someone else asked me about this,

1218
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,180
I would have kicked them into a lake.

1219
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,290
I don't know why

1220
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,380
I told you so much today.

1221
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,000
Maybe it's because

1222
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,230
we get along well.

1223
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,220
By the way,

1224
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,550
I know

1225
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,710
a great sword maker.

1226
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,180
I went to his place a few days ago

1227
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,550
and found that he had made a new dagger.

1228
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,180
It's sharp and lustrous.

1229
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,020
I thought it's a good fit for you,

1230
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,820
so I bought it.

1231
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,160
Just in time

1232
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,610
for your birthday.

1233
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:51,670
Thank you.

1234
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,980
I hope the Qian-Qi Six Treaties

1235
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,260
will be signed successfully.

1236
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,500
That way,

1237
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,520
we can meet again.

1238
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,700
When that time comes,

1239
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,300
I will give you a gift in return.

1240
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:06,760
We will.

1241
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,560
We will meet again.

1242
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,150
Stop the carriage.

1243
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,350
The food is here.

1244
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,120
Bring the food in.

1245
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:22,380
Okay. Hurry.

1246
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:24,580
Here.

1247
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,130
Here, take it.
