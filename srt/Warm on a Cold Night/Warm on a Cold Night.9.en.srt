[Episode 9]

4
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,690
The Qian ambassadors died

5
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,490
before entering our territory.

6
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,780
What happened?

7
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,020
I was ordered to receive the ambassadors

8
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,820
at the border.

9
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,950
But when we arrived,

10
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,039
there were only two horses carrying

11
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,150
two dead Qian men.

12
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,800
Their bodies had already become cold.

13
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,330
Obviously, they had been dead for a long time.

14
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,350
Your Majesty.

15
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:11,650
Qing'er told me that

16
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,870
something had happened to

17
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,740
another ambassadors' horse.

18
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,720
They broke away from the main group.

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,050
He might still be alive.

20
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,400
I'll pick him up myself.

21
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,060
OK.

22
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,140
Are you the Qian ambassador

23
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,940
who got separated from the rest?

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,480
Yes, it's me.

25
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,520
Hurry up.

26
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,180
Be careful.

27
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,830
Once this ambassador dies,

28
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,330
Han Zheng will be doomed too.

29
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,730
Let’s see what else the King of Xueqi can do.

30
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,030
You tricked me!

31
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,060
Take him away.

32
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,050
This...

33
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,340
Isn't he the personal guard

34
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,540
of the King of Xuanqi?

35
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,260
Thanks to Chilan's intelligence,

36
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,520
we caught the culprit.

37
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,360
Otherwise, who would have thought

38
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,400
the King of Xuanqi's personal guard

39
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,450
would be the one assassinating Qian ambassadors.

40
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,440
This has nothing to do with King of Xuanqi.

41
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,400
I did it myself.

42
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,380
Your Majesty.

43
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,340
He said, "Once this ambassador dies,

44
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,740
Han Zheng will be doomed too."

45
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,010
They're after the Prince.

46
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,000
I did it for the Qi!

47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,730
How dare you!

48
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,940
You assassinated ambassadors

49
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,990
to stir up trouble between the two states.

50
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,570
How dare you say you're doing it for the Qi?

51
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:44,370
King of Xueqi.

52
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,010
You want to cooperate with Qian,

53
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,320
but that has caused the Qi to face oppression.

54
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,540
I killed the ambassadors

55
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,220
to make you

56
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,280
give up on this idea

57
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,320
for the benefit of the future generations of the Qi.

58
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,070
We don't need to cooperate with them.

59
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,200
Instead, we should conquer the South!

60
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm old

61
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,470
and slow now.

62
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,900
Your Majesty.

63
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,650
He hasn't confessed yet.

64
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,340
Confess?

65
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,700
You want him to confess that

66
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,670
the King of Xuanqi was the culprit?

67
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,560
That the King of Xuanqi was the mastermind?

68
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,020
The ambassadors from Qian are dead.

69
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,659
It's enough to hand him over.

70
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,300
Otherwise, are you going to believe what he said,

71
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,500
and hand the King of Xuanqi over as well?

72
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,950
King of Xuanqi.

73
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,710
What do you think?

74
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,420
Your Majesty is wise.

75
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,260
Why is it so hard to share

76
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,900
a deer with everyone?

77
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,280
Why are we still eating now?

78
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
The Cangqi Tribe is at your command.

79
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,050
Your Majesty.

80
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,910
We, the Chiqi Tribe

81
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,190
are willing to go to Jiuxiao City

82
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,390
to rescue Prince Han.

83
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,360
Han Zheng is your only son.

84
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,030
He's the future of the Qi race!

85
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,220
We must save him!

86
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,420
However,

87
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,950
the effort Your Majesty put into

88
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,620
strengthening the friendship between the two states

89
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,150
has all been for naught.

90
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,220
If

91
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,230
Your Majesty

92
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,880
trusts the Xuanqi Tribe,

93
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,830
we are always at your service.

94
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,690
That's enough.

95
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,830
I appreciate your offers.

96
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,400
But this has become a diplomatic issue

97
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,090
between the two states.

98
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,000
The state of Qian

99
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,750
has always been concerned about

100
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,140
the Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

101
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,460
The ambassadors were sent

102
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,590
to negotiate with me

103
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,130
to make me choose

104
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,710
between Han Zheng

105
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,040
and  the Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

106
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,270
Forget it.

107
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,810
This meal isn't important anymore.

108
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,440
You can all go back.

109
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,400
I'll take my leave.

110
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,460
Your Majesty.

111
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,140
As Han Zheng's teacher,

112
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,010
I am requesting to lead the expedition

113
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,540
to bring back His Highness.

114
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,419
Please grant me permission, Your Majesty.

115
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,220
Your Majesty.

116
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,380
I was already slated to go

117
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,539
on a diplomatic mission to Jiuxiao City next month

118
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,340
to discuss the details of the Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

119
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,950
Your Majesty,

120
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,630
please allow me to go ahead of time

121
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,490
to prepare for this negotiation.

122
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,000
You mean

123
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,230
you want to both save Han Zheng

124
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,920
and the Qian-Qi Six Treaties?

125
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,150
Your Majesty.

126
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,290
News of the ambassadors' murder

127
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,620
is going to spread soon.

128
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,390
We can't afford to wait.

129
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,620
Go ahead then.

130
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,870
But you must keep one thing in mind.

131
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,030
If things reach a point

132
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,780
where there is no turning back,

133
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,460
and a choice must be made

134
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,210
between Han Zheng

135
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,310
and the Qian-Qi Six Treaties,

136
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,700
for the future of the Qi,

137
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,140
you can only choose the Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

138
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,830
May the stars bless us.

139
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,270
The future of Han Zheng and the Qi

140
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,660
are in your hands.

141
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,480
-May the stars bless us. -May the stars bless us.

142
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,280
Found it!

143
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,460
So, Lord Zhang was kidnapped

144
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,720
but managed to escape.

145
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,230
He fell off the cliff while running away.

146
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,020
Therefore, the culprit could not handle his body

147
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,580
like the others in the Nursery Rhyme Case.

148
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,690
That's why Chef Zhang

149
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,380
used Zhamuke's body

150
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,370
as the last line of the nursery rhyme.

151
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,520
Let me do it.

152
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

153
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,890
Thank you, Miss Jiu'er.

154
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,870
You have even

155
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,000
worn out your throat

156
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,870
telling us the story of this case.

157
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,060
How is this your fault?

158
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,920
It's because I shouted too much.

159
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,320
Liu Fu.

160
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,460
I remember the Marquis

161
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,820
brought us some Snow Lotus Cream.

162
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,280
Make some for Miss Jiu'er.

163
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,260
No need. No need.

164
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,730
Thank you, Your Highness.

165
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,080
Those precious medicines

166
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,370
are no use

167
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,260
for my throat.

168
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,810
Water is enough for me.

169
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,140
I'll be fine after drinking some water.

170
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,910
By the way, Your Highness,

171
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,160
I found a loophole

172
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,570
in this case,

173
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,370
so I wanted to

174
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,530
analyze it with you.

175
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
Do you suspect

176
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,540
he has an accomplice?

177
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,580
That's strange.

178
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,520
He's already told you

179
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,050
where Lord Zhang's body was,

180
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,060
but he refuses to tell you

181
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,180
who pushed you down

182
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,380
the tower that day.

183
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,260
The person who kidnapped the four lords

184
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,580
and committed the Nursery Rhyme Case

185
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,310
must have been Chef Zhang.

186
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,370
But Zhamuke is different.

187
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,790
Zhamuke was a fugitive Qi.

188
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,180
He had better stamina and greater strength

189
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,590
than Chef Zhang's.

190
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,440
Zhang Sen said he drugged Zhamuke.

191
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,470
But how did he manage to drug

192
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,380
someone who knew he was an enemy?

193
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,580
And how did he tie Zhamuke up?

194
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,470
He didn't

195
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,690
explain any of these.

196
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,380
Well...

197
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,810
I don't know much about the Qi.

198
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,180
If only

199
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,890
Young Master Han was here.

200
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,140
Your Highness.

201
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,720
I want to ask if there is still no news

202
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,750
about the ambassadors today.

203
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,800
Not yet.

204
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,510
It has been such a long time since they went back,

205
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,320
why isn't there any news about them yet?

206
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,450
Shuobei is far away.

207
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,320
They might have been held up on the way.

208
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,250
But don't worry.

209
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,810
Young Master Han is the prince of the Qi after all.

210
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,640
The two states will not watch from the sidelines

211
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,770
when it comes to him.

212
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:29,810
But...

213
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,650
Is it that far away?

214
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,380
Look.

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,680
When I travel from Qian to Qi,

216
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,160
it will take me at least

217
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,900
five days to reach.

218
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,590
A round trip

219
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,580
will take ten days.

220
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
That's not right.

221
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,050
Ten days is more than enough

222
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,570
for a round trip between Jiuxiao City and Shuobei.

223
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,290
It's been over half a month.

224
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,650
That's not right.

225
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,450
What's wrong?

226
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,040
Your Highness.

227
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,180
I suddenly remembered that there's something

228
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,070
that I haven't done yet.

229
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,570
Thank you for reviewing the case with me.

230
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,360
If there is any news about Han Zheng...

231
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,500
I will inform you immediately.

232
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,210
Thank you, Your Highness.

233
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,670
Thank you, Your Highness.

234
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,500
Your Highness, if you don't come back soon,

235
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,080
I will die of the heat.

236
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,460
G-Grand Preceptor.

237
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,340
General.

238
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,340
What a personal guard he is.

239
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,290
Not only did he allow His Highness to escape,

240
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,960
he doesn't even know

241
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,090
how His Highness got into trouble.

242
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:36,960
Please spare my life, Grand Preceptor.

243
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,970
His Highness refused to bring me with him.

244
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,440
Idiot, keep your voice down.

245
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,230
Do you want all the Qian people around

246
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:41,830
to hear us?

247
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,650
So you have been waiting here the whole time?

248
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,010
After His Highness was caught,

249
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,100
I didn't have customs clearance papers.

250
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,040
I couldn't do anything

251
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,320
in Jiuxiao City.

252
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,960
I don't even have anything to eat.

253
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,280
So,

254
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,550
the only thing I could do was to hide here.

255
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,620
You know nothing about

256
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,380
what has happened to His Highness.

257
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,580
How could we save him?

258
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,780
I think we might as well

259
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,700
kill you right now

260
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,670
so you can reincarnate

261
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,600
with a new brain.

262
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,490
I remember now.

263
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,310
Even though I don't know

264
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,780
what happened back then,

265
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,350
there's someone who knows.

266
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,420
Who?

267
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,230
Before His Highness was caught,

268
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,070
he was close to an Inspector

269
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,780
who's rather clever and capable.

270
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,110
They were investigating a case together.

271
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,120
Does this Qian Inspector

272
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,440
know His Highness' identity?

273
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,330
She didn't know at that time.

274
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,340
His Highness was making use of her.

275
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,820
So you mean

276
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,040
she found out later?

277
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,620
Yes.

278
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,420
I went to see her afterwards.

279
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,780
She already knew then.

280
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,630
Idiot.

281
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,040
Think about it.

282
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,180
Given His Highness's skills

283
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,510
how could he get caught?

284
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,830
Maybe it was all because this Inspector

285
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,740
had given away His Highness' secret,

286
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,470
causing him to fall into a trap.

287
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:50,470
My lord.

288
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,290
Indeed.

289
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,490
This Inspector is indeed cunning.

290
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,330
She tricked His Highness

291
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,490
over and over again.

292
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,320
Did she really

293
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,150
set His Highness up?

294
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,900
I'll kill her!

295
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:02,850
Keha.

296
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,560
Keha.

297
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,170
Keha!

298
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,150
A Qian?

299
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,300
Wait.

300
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,050
Grand Preceptor, she's the Inspector that I mentioned.

301
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,100
How can she be an Inspector?

302
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,540
Clever and capable?

303
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,500
With your skills,

304
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,390
how could you be an Inspector in Jiuxiao City?

305
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,160
My lord, she's really...

306
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,830
With her looks,

307
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,030
this shouldn't be a honey trap.

308
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,580
You're so straightforward.

309
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,860
It hurts my pride a bit.

310
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,640
Tell me.

311
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:11,720
Who are you?

312
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,180
Why did you approach His Highness?

313
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:15,480
I am

314
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,290
Inspector Su Jiu'er from the Inspection Bureau.

315
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,690
I'm Han Zheng's partner.

316
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,460
He's a lone wolf.

317
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,940
He doesn't even partner up with other Qi,

318
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,340
much less to say a Qian.

319
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,150
Maybe

320
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,100
he thinks I'm cool.

321
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,750
You Qi have high body temperatures.

322
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,720
He's probably keeping me by his side

323
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,240
to use as a cooler.

324
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,570
You can try touching me if you don't believe me.

325
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,270
Why does her touch feel different

326
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,460
from Han Zheng's?

327
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,820
What exactly are you?

328
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,080
Why are you so strange?

329
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,800
I fell very badly ill

330
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,450
when I was a kid.

331
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,700
My body is very weak now.

332
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,410
I heard Keha calling you

333
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,510
"My Lord."

334
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,080
You must be a highly-ranked official.

335
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,530
Did you come to Jiuxiao City covertly

336
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,849
because something happened to the ambassadors?

337
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,460
You're quite smart.

338
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,140
Doesn't that mean Han Zheng...

339
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,020
Doesn't that mean Prince Han Zheng

340
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,020
will be in danger?

341
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,290
Let me tell you.

342
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,099
Don't think I'll trust you just because

343
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,619
you're showing concern for him.

344
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,640
While he's in prison,

345
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,930
you're here, safe and sound.

346
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,310
Something is wrong with you.

347
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,770
You can't blame that on me.

348
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,080
Before this,

349
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,940
we only had a working relationship.

350
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,090
He never told me

351
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,610
about his background.

352
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,590
I only found out about his identity

353
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,920
after he was imprisoned.

354
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,850
I can't save him even if I wanted to.

355
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,770
Then tell me

356
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,560
why did he shapeshift?

357
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,090
My lord.

358
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,830
Time is running out.

359
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,660
Please don't waste

360
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,820
your time here.

361
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,890
If you have the time to question me,

362
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,520
why don't you

363
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,470
ask His Highness personally

364
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,620
when you see him?

365
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,550
How do you know time is running out?

366
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,010
I...

367
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,320
The ambassadors we sent

368
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,190
still haven't returned to Jiuxiao City.

369
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,540
Some people assume

370
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,510
it's because of the long journey.

371
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,830
But I've done the calculations.

372
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,260
An urgent letter

373
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,720
will take only six days

374
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,520
to get to Shuobei and back.

375
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,980
But they haven't come back

376
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,040
after half a month.

377
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,160
Now that I'm seeing you here,

378
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,260
I can be sure

379
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,470
something had happened to the ambassadors.

380
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,250
That's why you are all

381
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,110
panicking

382
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,830
and trying to find another way to save him.

383
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,400
Tell me.

384
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,650
What else have you deduced?

385
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,680
You

386
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,970
are going to break into prison, aren't you?

387
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,830
You know too much.

388
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,690
Stay here.

389
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,900
If anything happens,

390
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,700
ask Qing'er to inform me.

391
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,030
Okay.

392
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,040
If that girl lied to me,

393
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,100
go back and kill her

394
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,460
before meeting up with the Grand Preceptor.

395
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,580
Don't worry, General.

396
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,060
I won't let you down.

397
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,600
My lord,

398
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,590
please take me with you.

399
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,520
I'm begging you.

400
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,980
You're an unskilled dead weight,

401
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,040
aren't you scared?

402
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,500
Do you want to implicate the two races?

403
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,610
Of course not.

404
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,300
I...

405
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,390
I'm just worried about His Highness.

406
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,150
Please don't worry.

407
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,600
I promise I won't hold you back.

408
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,240
Let go!

409
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,740
Let go!

410
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,700
Who taught you

411
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,900
how to pester people?

412
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,890
Please.

413
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,180
Please take me with you.

414
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,910
Stop wasting my time. Let's go.

415
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,660
Han Zheng.

416
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,410
Just wait.

417
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,940
I'm coming for you.

418
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,350
Why can't I smell

419
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,110
Han Zheng?

420
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,390
I know the reason.

421
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,710
Let me tell you.

422
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,930
You can't smell it now.

423
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,580
Follow me.

424
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,570
Let me smell.

425
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,810
This way.

426
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,530
Let me tell you.

427
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,530
This prison uses an incense

428
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,930
that can remove the scent

429
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,530
and suppress the five senses of Qi people.

430
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,250
Here,

431
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,860
your nose

432
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,410
can't even compare to mine.

433
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:38,770
Here it is!

434
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,990
How did you manage

435
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,190
to open the lock here?

436
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,800
This is a special craft

437
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,860
of the Chiqi Tribe.

438
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,390
Chilan.

439
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,370
Why are you here in Qian?

440
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,130
Han Zheng.

441
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:02,750
You...

442
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,420
Why do you look so haggard?

443
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,270
Aren't you a Prince?

444
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,260
How dare they

445
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,100
not give you food?

446
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,910
Why did the two of you come together?

447
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,370
Did the situation blow up?

448
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,640
They drugged you?

449
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,510
They must have used

450
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,840
such a despicable move

451
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,440
to prevent me from escaping.

452
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,720
I'm so pathetic.

453
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,800
Not only am I being starved,

454
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,580
I can't even have a good sleep.

455
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,860
Somebody keeps howling

456
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,380
outside the prison every day.

457
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,250
It's too noisy.

458
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,550
I was afraid

459
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,790
you'll be too emotionally fragile.

460
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,150
What if you go crazy

461
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:38,770
in prison?

462
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,910
You don't have much strength left,

463
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,170
yet you're still arguing with her.

464
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:42,840
Did you

465
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,380
really shapeshift in the palace

466
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,310
just to save her?

467
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,800
Forget about that.

468
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,670
Answer me first.

469
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,760
Didn't the Qian send ambassadors

470
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,400
already?

471
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,060
Why did you come to the prison

472
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:53,710
alone?

473
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,380
What happened?

474
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,770
Mucha killed the Qian ambassadors

475
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,230
while we were unprepared.

476
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,550
As expected, he found a chance.

477
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,330
What did my old man say?

478
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,280
To ignore me?

479
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,050
Is that why you came alone?

480
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,360
What are you thinking?

481
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,170
Come with me.

482
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,520
Let's go—

483
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,040
Save it.

484
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,300
I can't leave.

485
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:14,670
If I leave,

486
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,180
my old man's aspirations

487
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,240
will be all in vain.

488
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,990
I have another idea.

489
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,600
Another idea?

490
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,290
Could it be that

491
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,680
you want to make use of her?

492
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,440
Me?

493
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,590
Get out of here!

494
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,580
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

495
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,740
Get out of here!

496
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,600
Get out of here!

497
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,910
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

498
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,360
[Jiuxiao City]

499
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,060
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

500
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,520
How dare you Qi

501
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,780
kill our ambassadors?

502
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,750
You arrogant Qi!

503
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,100
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

504
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,940
Get out of here!

505
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,220
Yes!

506
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,280
Qi people are not welcome here!

507
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,100
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

508
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,500
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

509
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,980
Get out of here!

510
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,290
Get out!

511
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,360
Get out of here!

512
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,700
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

513
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,820
Get out!

514
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,500
Get out!

515
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:02,860
Get out!

516
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:03,910
Miss Jiu'er.

517
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,190
Miss Jiu'er!

518
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,090
Miss...

519
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:06,680
Prince Jun.

520
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,980
Have you seen Miss Jiu'er?

521
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,530
Greetings, Your Highness.

522
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

523
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,660
Have you two

524
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,240
seen Miss Jiu'er?

525
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,250
I have something urgent to talk about with her.

526
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,840
Did something happen to Your Highness?

527
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,240
Jiu is not here.

528
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,590
You can come to us if you need help.

529
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,450
Your Highness.

530
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,620
No, Your Highness.

531
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,370
These Qi

532
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
are getting more and more arrogant.

533
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,600
How dare they send us two coffins.

534
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,300
I would like to see

535
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,030
how they are going to save their Prince.

536
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,060
Han Lin

537
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,350
and Chilan

538
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,110
pays our respects to Emperor Dingkun.

539
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,240
You killed our ambassadors outright,

540
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,560
yet you still have the gall

541
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,100
to show up here?

542
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,250
Your Majesty.

543
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,220
We are here

544
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,780
to resolve this misunderstanding.

545
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,100
Misunderstanding?

546
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,940
It was an accident that the ambassadors were killed.

547
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,200
It was our negligence.

548
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,640
We should apologize.

549
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,820
The King of Xueqi has ordered me to

550
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,110
to present ten thousand taels of gold to the state of Qian

551
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,510
to express our condolences and apologies.

552
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,040
Hold on.

553
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,280
You're so arrogant after killing our ambassadors.

554
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,810
Do the Qi think

555
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,330
human lives can be

556
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,620
compensated for with gold?

557
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,420
Of course not.

558
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,180
This gold only represents the sincerity of our King

559
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,710
in capturing the murderer.

560
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,260
But the King of Xueqi hopes everyone here will remember that

561
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,790
the dead cannot be revived.

562
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,010
Don't let the dead

563
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,250
affect the living.

564
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,990
What a sharp tongue.

565
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,440
General Chilan.

566
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,820
We, the Qian, have always thought that

567
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,350
the rule of law should be upheld over all else.

568
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,220
Rather than demonstrating your sincerity with gold,

569
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,370
why don't you tell us

570
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,660
why, how, and by whose hands

571
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,320
our ambassadors were killed.

572
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,560
After all, the ambassadors

573
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,690
represented not only themselves,

574
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,740
but also the relationship

575
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,070
between the two states.

576
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,310
Don't you understand?

577
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,520
Your Majesty.

578
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,620
We are here

579
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,820
for two things.

580
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,870
First, we want to bring back Prince Han Zheng.

581
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,190
Second, we want to uphold justice

582
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,690
for the deceased ambassadors.

583
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,410
This gold

584
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,700
represents our determination

585
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,560
to punish the murderer severely.

586
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,150
The state of Qi is doing our best to apprehend him.

587
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,480
We believe we will find the murderer soon.

588
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,480
However, please believe that

589
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,180
this was just an accident.

590
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,720
Don't take it out on other things.

591
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,610
Are you asking me

592
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,880
to stop pursuing the matter?

593
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,680
Your Majesty.

594
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,750
We never pursued

595
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,860
the murderer of the Nursery Rhyme Case.

596
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,880
This is because we believe

597
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,380
the crime was caused

598
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,180
by resentment among the people.

599
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,240
How could he conflate these two issues?

600
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,970
Ridiculous!

601
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,140
How could he

602
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,300
compare these two issues?.

603
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:09,950
That's right.

604
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,750
That's right.

605
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,350
You're right.

606
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,530
[Qian, Administer Deng]

607
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,840
How could he conflate these two issues?

608
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,660
Grand Preceptor Hanlin.

609
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,470
It is a great disrepect for our ambassadors to be killed.

610
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,220
It shows that the Qi

611
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,280
disregards our the honor of the Qian.

612
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,250
How can it be conflated with a case

613
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,320
that happened among the people?

614
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,500
But there is a lot the trifles of the people

615
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,660
can tell us.

616
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,660
The relationship between the Qian and Qi

617
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,720
has been strained.

618
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,690
The Qian claim that the Qi

619
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,550
are arrogant.

620
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,640
But now, as you can see,

621
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,510
the Qi have been wronged

622
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,870
for all these years.

623
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,910
Moreover, the Qian state is also responsible

624
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,770
for the death of the ambassadors.

625
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,140
How dare you!

626
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,730
How outrageous!

627
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,740
Grand Preceptor Hanlin.

628
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,760
What do you mean?

629
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,460
The ambassadors were killed

630
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,460
and found dead

631
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,180
at the border between Shuobei and the Qian.

632
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,420
Three years ago, the Qian was paranoid

633
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,540
and insisted on shutting down

634
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,150
the government road connecting our states.

635
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,780
The dealings

636
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,060
between the two states

637
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,270
were thus canceled.

638
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,020
That's the reason why we couldn't

639
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,750
receive the ambassadors in time.

640
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,490
How dare you play the victim?

641
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,980
Your Majesty.

642
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,450
The King of Xueqi has always believed

643
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,250
an old saying of the Qian people,

644
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,650
"There is no difference

645
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,670
in human nature.

646
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,670
It needs to be restrained by law

647
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,640
to show its best side."

648
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,260
Hasn't the unfinished government road

649
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,070
proven just that?

650
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,420
Without restrictions, evil will breed.

651
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,560
How can we push the responsibility

652
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,460
onto others?

653
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,770
They were killed by the Qi!

654
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

655
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,490
The murderer is among the Qi.

656
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,580
The Qi State will surely

657
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,790
give you an explanation.

658
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,920
Just like the Qian's Inspection Bureau

659
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
has done for the Nursery Rhyme Case.

660
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,840
Doesn't that mean he's making an empty promise?

661
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,640
That's right.

662
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,990
How can he guarantee that?

663
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,880
Isn't this nonsense?

664
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,660
You're bringing up the Nursery Rhyme case again.

665
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,740
The Qi want to use this case

666
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,890
to cover up their mistakes.

667
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,810
How arrogant!

668
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,340
Everyone.

669
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,970
It's not that we want to drag in the Nursery Rhyme Case into this.

670
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,700
It's that we're not pursuing the Nursery Rhyme Case.

671
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,980
There are some Qian people in this state

672
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,780
who are spreading rumors about Qi people.

673
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,620
If we look into it,

674
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,480
I'm afraid we'll have to go to war.

675
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,190
Is that

676
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
what you want?

677
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,750
General Chilan.

678
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,010
About this matter,

679
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,940
you might have countless excuses.

680
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,160
But there's one issue

681
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,420
about which you don't.

682
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,200
I'm afraid not.

683
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,130
We don't know about the other issue either.

684
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,020
Why don't you invite our Prince

685
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,300
to come here and explain,

686
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,900
so we know how to deal with it.

687
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,620
Guards!

688
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,100
Summon the Prince of the Qi state.

689
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,540
Summon the Prince of the Qi state.

690
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,560
How arrogant of them!

691
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,490
How embarrassing!

692
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,420
That's right.

693
00:28:59,130 --> 00:28:59,990
Your Highness.

694
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,260
Why are you so thin?

695
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,380
Could it be...

696
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,190
I'm fine.

697
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,640
Guards.

698
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,820
Let the Prince be seated.

699
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,390
No need.

700
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,980
I'll just stand here.

701
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,030
As it also

702
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,460
complies with the law of your state.

703
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:14,790
Fine.

704
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,160
Since Your Highness is here,

705
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,240
we might as well talk face to face.

706
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,680
Prince Han Zheng,

707
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,300
you sneaked into Jiuxiao City

708
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,920
without customs clearance papers.

709
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,140
You broke into our palace

710
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,870
and shapeshifted into a beast,

711
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,450
causing chaos in the palace.

712
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,800
Is this true?

713
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:32,780
Yes.

714
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,170
General Chilan.

715
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,400
I think we've made it clear now.

716
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,960
Prince Hanzheng

717
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,400
has already admitted it.

718
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,060
But we

719
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,320
invited you two here

720
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,040
because Prince Han Zheng's

721
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,640
status is extraordinary.

722
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,190
He had trespassed

723
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,700
into Qian's palace,.

724
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,100
However, the legal codes of the Qian and Qi

725
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,600
have different judgements on it.

726
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,280
We want to ask the Qi state

727
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,970
whose legal code we should abide by

728
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,970
for Prince Hanzheng's sentencing.

729
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,940
May I ask

730
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,380
according to the legal code of the state of Qian,

731
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,290
what kind of punishment

732
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,690
should His Highness receive?

733
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,660
Tell them.

734
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,310
If a Qian broke into the palace

735
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,940
and disturbed the Emperor,

736
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,740
what kind of crime would that be?

737
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,230
A capital crime!

738
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:15,880
A capital crime!

739
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,810
A capital crime!

740
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,340
General Chilan.

741
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,040
Shapeshifting

742
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:23,030
might be common in Qi,

743
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:24,940
but in Qian,

744
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,920
it's absolutely out of the question.

745
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,590
Of course.

746
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,300
Considering the friendship between our states,

747
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,930
I am willing to give Prince Han Zheng

748
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,030
another chance.

749
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,690
Pray tell, Your Majesty.

750
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,950
Prince Han Zheng.

751
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,890
Your father, the King of Xueqi,

752
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,650
wanted to sign the Qian-Qi Six Treaties

753
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,660
with the Qian.

754
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,480
One of the six treaties stipulates that

755
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,080
Qi and Qian people must be equal before the law.

756
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,220
If you wish to

757
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,530
ratify these treaties,

758
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,930
Prince Han Zheng's crime

759
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,940
must be punished according to the Qian legal code.

760
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,580
So what you're saying is,

761
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,140
a choice must be made

762
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,820
between the Qian-Qi Six Treaties and I, right?

763
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,480
Yes.

764
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,300
I saved a Qian person,

765
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,860
yet you want to sentence me to death.

766
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,930
The Qian's legal code

767
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,610
sounds a little unreasonable.

768
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,550
Your Majesty.

769
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,580
Please allow me to question this matter further.

770
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,440
Your Highness.

771
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,890
You said you saved someone?

772
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,050
I saved a Qian.

773
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,280
She was locked

774
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,900
in the ice cellar of the palace,

775
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,830
and she was dying

776
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,960
If I hadn't shapeshifted,

777
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,190
I wouldn't have been able to find her.

778
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,260
It's none of your business that

779
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,610
she was locked in the ice cellar.

780
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,540
Even if we disregard the fact that she's my partner,

781
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,340
I must save her even if she were an

782
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,640
ordinary Qian person.

783
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,740
His Highness is benevolent,

784
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,160
and he sees the two races as one.

785
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,420
It's truly a blessing.

786
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,580
His Highness has been fond of criminal investigation

787
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,380
even back when he was still in Qi.

788
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,140
Although his entry into Jiuxiao City

789
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,940
was illegal,

790
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,940
it should be offset by his assistance at the Inspection Bureau.

791
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,580
His Majesty just said that the Qian-Qi Six Treaties stipulates that

792
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,950
the Qian and Qi are to be equal before the law.

793
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,400
However, Qian has always had

794
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,660
a merit-based system.

795
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,130
Right now, we are only talking about the crime of trespassing,

796
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,770
and not his merit in solving the case.

797
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,180
I wonder why this is so.

798
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,420
He broke into the palace.

799
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,540
What merit does he have?

800
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,620
You have no proof.

801
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,940
He was just involved in the case.

802
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,490
Who can prove that he had contributed?

803
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,080
I have a witness

804
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,450
to prove that what I said is true.

805
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,730
Of course a Qi

806
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,660
will help you.

807
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,700
Your Majesty.

808
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,570
She's a Qian.

809
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,310
She is Inspector Su Jiu'er

810
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,270
from the Inspection Bureau.

811
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:39,910
Su Jiu'er?

812
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,820
Inspection Bureau.

813
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,480
Summon her.

814
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,650
Summoning Inspector Su Jiu'er

815
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,840
from the Inspection Bureau.

816
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,170
Your Highness.

817
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,100
Don't be afraid.

818
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,540
Follow me.

819
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,590
-Greetings, Father. -Greetings, Your Majesty.

820
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,130
Rise.

821
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,730
Thank you, Your Majesty.

822
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,930
You are just a lowly-ranked Inspector.

823
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,930
What gives you the right to testify?

824
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,140
Father.

825
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,140
Young Master Han and Jiu'er

826
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,320
entered the palace together that day.

827
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,340
I acted as their guarantor.

828
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,180
Have you forgotten about it?

829
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,580
You...

830
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,020
Why are you...

831
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,390
Father.

832
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,940
The Qian and Qi have been on good terms for generations.

833
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,270
There are also many stories about it among the people.

834
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,770
Young Master Han barged into the palace

835
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,370
to save a citizen of the Qian.

836
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,140
I don't want

837
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,060
to ruin

838
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,210
the friendship between the Qian and Qi

839
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,410
just because of this.

840
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,430
Your Majesty.

841
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,310
Han Zheng had no intentions of

842
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,570
harming Your Majesty.

843
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,490
Since the Nursery Rhyme Case,

844
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,020
he has been working with me.

845
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,370
He followed me into the palace

846
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,580
to investigate the case of Chef Zhang.

847
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,580
After that,

848
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,139
due to my negligence,

849
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,500
I was trapped in the ice cellar.

850
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,940
That's why Han Zheng shapeshifted

851
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,820
to save me,

852
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,860
to ensure the evidence stayed intact.

853
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,889
Speaking of which,

854
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,510
Han Zheng

855
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,190
has contributed to our state.

856
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,219
How can we misunderstand

857
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,350
his act of kindness?

858
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,120
Ridiculous!

859
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,790
Nonsense!

860
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,880
How could a Prince of the Qi

861
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,820
serve the Qian?

862
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:29,830
Exactly.

863
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,820
I'm telling the truth, Your Majesty.

864
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,360
I have the Inspection Bureau's letter

865
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,679
for patrol recruitment.

866
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,810
Please take a look at it, Your Majesty.

867
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,400
A patrol.

868
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,510
Its rank is even lower than inspector.

869
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,880
I've heard that the Qi's five senses are very sharp.

870
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,140
They are very talented

871
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,250
at handling cases.

872
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,710
There is a precedent at the Law Department

873
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,070
of the recruitment of Qi people to help in searching for clues.

874
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,330
The results were good.

875
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,340
This is the Qian's case.

876
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,790
His Highness disregarded his status

877
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,230
to solve the case for the Qian.

878
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,230
He broke the law due to an emergency.

879
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,940
But what His Highness did

880
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,940
was for the Inspection Bureau,

881
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,080
not the Qi.

882
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,520
How dare you!

883
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,370
Who knows who's behind him?

884
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,430
If you want to speculate for no reason,

885
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,210
I want to ask about

886
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,780
Chef Zhang,

887
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,660
who works in the palace every day.

888
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,850
Who had instigated him

889
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,480
to mess with

890
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,380
the relationship between the Qian and Qi?

891
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,180
Your Majesty.

892
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,180
Can we, the Qi,

893
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,360
demand an explanation for this?

894
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,170
We definitely can't say that

895
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,760
we look down on the Qi.

896
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,360
Speaking of which,

897
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,580
we were indeed in the wrong in this case.

898
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,570
The relationship between the two states has always been good.

899
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:55,030
We mustn't speculate about it for no reason.

900
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,440
Father.

901
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:57,630
Then...

902
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,500
Based on existing evidence,

903
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,900
the Prince of Qi indeed came to the palace

904
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,060
to investigate a case.

905
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,620
However,

906
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,580
his reward and punishment will offset each other.

907
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,780
According to the legal code of the Qian,

908
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,940
he can be pardoned from the death penalty.

909
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,620
But flogging

910
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,180
is inevitable.

911
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,290
General Chilan.

912
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,420
His Majesty is magnanimous.

913
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,080
The Prince is in the clear now.

914
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,620
But in the Qian,

915
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,680
a prince and his commoners are equal before the law.

916
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,520
You won't ask

917
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,120
to be spared of the flogging too, right?

918
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,340
I saved someone and went to jail.

919
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,220
Now, I have to get flogged.

920
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,900
His Highness is willing to accept the punishment.

921
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,410
Good.

922
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,980
Since Han Zheng has done us a service by solving the case,

923
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,780
his reward and punishment will offset each other.

924
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,020
He shall be flogged 50 times.

925
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,210
Are you all satisfied now?

926
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:00,870
50 times?

927
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,860
Although we say that the Qian and Qi

928
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,480
are to be equal before the law,

929
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,210
isn't the punishment too light

930
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,250
for the ferocious Prince of Qi?

931
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,660
He has been locked up for half a month.

932
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,510
Look at his physique.

933
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,300
There's no way he could bear with it.

934
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,660
He'll be lucky to come out of it alive.

935
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,910
Bring the Prince of Qi

936
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,860
to receive his punishment.

937
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,170
Yes.

938
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,130
Your Highness, this way, please.

939
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,100
I'm tired.

940
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,690
Dismissed.

941
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:37,710
Hold on!

942
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,860
Your Majesty.

943
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,180
Han Zheng is my partner.

944
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:44,940
He shapeshifted

945
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,620
because of my negligence.

946
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,050
I'm willing to take the punishment for him.

947
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,700
Father.

948
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,730
I brought them

949
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,610
to the palace.

950
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,830
I'm willing to be punished too.

951
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,150
Father.

952
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,150
Since

953
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,800
the punishment is to be flogged 50 times,

954
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,970
and it hard to say

955
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,420
which one of them is more guilty than the other,

956
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,160
how about

957
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,470
we let the two of them share the punishment equally?

958
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,100
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

959
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,280
My goodness.

960
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,950
I thought His Majesty wanted to

961
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,160
humiliate the Qi.

962
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,100
Why are the Inspector and the Prince

963
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,820
here?

964
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,660
You're right.

965
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,920
We couldn't seize this prime opportunity,

966
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,170
and let them take the advantage instead.

967
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,730
I've let you down.

968
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,990
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

969
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,540
It's not the Crown Prince's fault.

970
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,020
The Grand Preceptor and the ambassador

971
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,860
are both Qi

972
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,230
with long lifespans.

973
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,340
They were on good terms with the late emperor,

974
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,870
and are adept politicians.

975
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,380
This is a rare experience

976
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,510
for the Crown Prince.

977
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,720
This is all because

978
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,850
you weren't feeling well a while ago

979
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,750
and had to return to your hometown to recuperate.

980
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,920
If not,

981
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,950
it wouldn't have ended up like this.

982
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,570
It's all my fault.

983
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,890
I've failed to share your burden.

984
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,850
At this point,

985
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,620
we can only find another chance.

986
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,400
But Administer Deng,

987
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,190
you must find a way

988
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,070
to assist the Crown Prince.

989
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:58,030
We mustn't proceed any further with the Qian-Qi Six Treaties.

990
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:00,510
-Yes. -Yes.

991
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,700
[Prince Jun's Residence]

992
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:10,970
Your Highness.

993
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,580
You can lie down for a few more days

994
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,710
and have a good rest.

995
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,840
I've got it.

996
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,870
S- Send some medicine

997
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,880
to Miss Jiu'er right away.

998
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,300
Yes.

999
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:18,950
Hurry up.

1000
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,460
Take care of His Highness.

1001
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:21,740
Yes.

1002
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,290
Let's go.

1003
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:23,940
Xiaoqing.

1004
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,590
Hurry up.

1005
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,540
Fan it for me.

1006
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,070
Hurry up.

1007
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:26,650
Okay.

1008
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,120
Your—

1009
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,440
Now you know it hurts?

1010
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,540
Eldest Brother, you're here?

1011
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,960
Where's Xiaoqing?

1012
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:49,740
Xiaoqing.

1013
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:51,710
Let me do it.

1014
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,550
This Prince's butt of yours

1015
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,920
can't be served by

1016
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,830
common people.

1017
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,650
I have something

1018
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,490
to tell you in private.

1019
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,470
Brother,

1020
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,900
are you

1021
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,730
going to teach me a lesson again?

1022
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,580
What would happen if I don't?

1023
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,140
This time, you were flogged.

1024
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:10,670
Who knows

1025
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,140
what trouble you'll get yourself into

1026
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,900
next time.

1027
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,370
You've never been involved in politics,

1028
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,910
so you don't know its implications.

1029
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,320
Do you think Father ordered your flogging

1030
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,720
to give you what you want?

1031
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,990
He wanted to tell you that

1032
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,450
because you disobeyed him

1033
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,820
to help a Qi,

1034
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,680
he's disappointed in you.

1035
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,020
Brother, help me up.

1036
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:31,770
Hurry up.

1037
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:32,070
Here.

1038
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,600
It hurts.

1039
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,240
Here you go.

1040
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:41,600
It hurts!

1041
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,790
This isn't even the only time

1042
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,020
I've let Father down.

1043
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,190
You know me well.

1044
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,850
I've never been into the politics

1045
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,510
and I don't want to be a prince.

1046
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,010
If it weren't for you,

1047
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,960
I would have left the palace long ago

1048
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,700
to be

1049
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,300
a free man.

1050
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,930
Don't talk nonsense.

1051
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,760
There's no one around.

1052
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,180
It's not easy for me to see my brother

1053
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,180
and speak my mind.

1054
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,810
I want to have a good talk.

1055
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,040
Although I was flogged today,

1056
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,120
I'm happy.

1057
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,330
A flogging in exchange for

1058
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,990
two straightforward friends

1059
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,990
and friendship between the two races.

1060
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,540
Isn't that a good story to be told?

1061
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,200
Two?

1062
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,820
Isn't it just that Inspector,

1063
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,260
Su Jiu'er?

1064
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,640
Who is she to you?

1065
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,990
Why are you so protective of her?

1066
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,450
An important old friend.
