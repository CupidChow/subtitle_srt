[Episode 17]

4
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,210
Painter Feng is so diligent.

5
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,740
He never stops practicing.

6
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,420
But for two years,

7
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,170
he didn't produce anything.

8
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,220
That was the time

9
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,880
he studied abroad.

10
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,220
We missed

11
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,420
such an obvious clue.

12
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Meng Huaiyun died

13
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,270
and the painting immortal appeared

14
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,580
on New Year's Eve of the 29th year of the Dingkun reign.

15
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,330
That means

16
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,690
he was actually

17
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,040
studying in the far east back then.

18
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,600
I see.

19
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,700
He escaped.

20
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,780
That table

21
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,610
was moved.

22
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,310
There's a secret tunnel here.

23
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,700
Hurry up.

24
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:57,940
Come on.

25
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:02,910
Be careful.

26
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,350
Be careful.

27
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,740
My master has arthritis in his legs.

28
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,350
For a while, he couldn't walk,

29
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,380
so there is a chair like this

30
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,450
in the studio.

31
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,590
The lamp is here.

32
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,710
Isn't this Master Wei 's fan?

33
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,250
So Wei Gonglin hasn't been traveling.

34
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,660
He has been imprisoned here.

35
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,620
His money was taken

36
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,140
to redeem Meng Huaiyun's paintings.

37
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,200
Look at the ground.

38
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,140
Those are wheelchair tracks.

39
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,240
That means

40
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,230
Feng Muyuan

41
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,300
has been lying to us all along.

42
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,020
Wei Gonglin's leg

43
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,080
hasn't recovered.

44
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,060
That's not right.

45
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,710
Then who was the person

46
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,970
who attacked him?

47
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,079
And why hasn't he killed

48
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,130
Wei Gonglin?

49
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,220
Isn't it more difficult

50
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,899
to imprison a living person?

51
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,870
Could it be...

52
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,940
the masked man is his accomplice

53
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,880
and has been helping him in secret the whole time?

54
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,340
The gas lamp just went out.

55
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,240
He can't have gone far.

56
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,850
I don't care.

57
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,930
Don't try to get rid of me this time.

58
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,670
We agreed

59
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,220
we would catch him together.

60
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,520
I won't be a burden.

61
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,030
Get off.

62
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,450
No.

63
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,420
Hold on tight.

64
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,159
A partner like me

65
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,550
is hard to come by.

66
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,290
Your Highness.

67
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,860
Go and get

68
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,360
everyone from the Inspection Bureau.

69
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,909
Let's go.

70
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,220
Where do I find you?

71
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,930
My disciple,

72
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,610
I was wrong.

73
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,630
I had always thought

74
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,360
you were the most foolish amongst your peers,

75
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,090
and had no talent for painting,

76
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,400
so I hadn't taken good care of you.

77
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,830
But since you've came back from the far east,

78
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,410
you have impressed me.

79
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,920
Although you've been hiding your true skill in painting,

80
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,170
I can see that

81
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,230
after you achieve a breakthrough,

82
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,230
it won't take long

83
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,040
before you surpass me.

84
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,680
My disciple,

85
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,020
why are you so persistent

86
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,900
about heartlessly destroying everything?

87
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,380
Let it go.

88
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,100
Where is

89
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,480
Huaiyun’s body?

90
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,700
It's not worth it

91
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,760
to ruin your own future

92
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,720
even if it's for Huaiyun's sake.

93
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,120
I loved Huaiyun so much.

94
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,480
But if I didn't keep the secret for them,

95
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,880
Nanfeng Studio would have been destroyed.

96
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,580
Do you really think

97
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,630
if you conceal the whereabouts of her body,

98
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,200
and the evidence doesn't surface,

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,180
that you would be able to live your life anew?

100
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,640
Master.

101
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
The world already knows

102
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
your true colors.

103
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,950
I didn't kill Huaiyun.

104
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,000
I just made a choice.

105
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,530
I waited until today

106
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,690
to make you see

107
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,780
it is your so-called choice

108
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,900
that ruins Nanfeng Studio!

109
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,930
Tell me.

110
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,200
Where did you hide her?

111
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,110
My disciple,

112
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,070
I've told you everything.

113
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,400
For old time's sake,

114
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,750
please spare my life.

115
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,990
I never knew

116
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,920
you and Yun had a relationship like this.

117
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,770
You've always done everything

118
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,720
in silence.

119
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,410
Why do this to yourself?

120
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,300
If you leave this sentiment

121
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,820
in painting—

122
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,580
Shut up!

123
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,790
Don't come here!

124
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,020
Stay away!

125
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,170
Otherwise,

126
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,570
I'll kill him right this moment!

127
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,070
Calm down,

128
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,870
Painter Feng.

129
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,730
Calm down.

130
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,470
I'll calm him down first.

131
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,200
You take the chance to save him.

132
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,460
Don't be impulsive.

133
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,860
I'm not good at swimming.

134
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,720
I'm afraid I won't be able to take care of you.

135
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,220
Painter Feng.

136
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,500
Are you waiting for someone?

137
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,200
Who?

138
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,730
That man yesterday

139
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,900
was your accomplice,

140
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,360
right?

141
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,880
If I say I have no accomplice,

142
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,120
would you believe me?

143
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,650
How is that possible?

144
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,460
In this world,

145
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,490
I don't have partners

146
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,990
nor a family.

147
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,900
Even if someone like me

148
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,830
disappeared,

149
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,920
no one will notice.

150
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,020
Just like Junior.

151
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,200
Painter Feng.

152
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,700
Why are you doing this?

153
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,160
She will never know

154
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,220
about your avenging her,

155
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,210
nor your love for her.

156
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,760
Right?

157
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,460
So what?

158
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,880
I don't deserve her.

159
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,620
It's all because of me...

160
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,690
I didn't protect her.

161
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,500
Back then,

162
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,520
I was only a junior disciple in Nanfeng Studio.

163
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,400
All I did were menial tasks

164
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,930
like serving tea and water.

165
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,000
I learned painting in secret,

166
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,600
hoping Master would take me as his disciple.

167
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,800
Senior, please have some tea.

168
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,860
And she

169
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,100
was just an apprentice who came to learn painting

170
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,050
once in a while.

171
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,540
She hadn't become a disciple yet.

172
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:15,610
Go.

173
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,590
Serve that lady tea.

174
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,300
What kind of beautiful painting

175
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,160
could such an ugly person create?

176
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:22,890
Go.

177
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:24,730
Go.

178
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,720
Senior.

179
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,230
I'm too clumsy.

180
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,420
I'll make some tea for you again.

181
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,780
Three years later,

182
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,750
Master finally accepted

183
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,210
his only female disciple.

184
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,530
From a distance,

185
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,300
I thought her eyes

186
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,560
looked very familiar.

187
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,740
She was extraordinarily gifted.

188
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,690
The entire Nanfeng Studio

189
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,080
treated her like a star,

190
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,280
but she kept her distance from everyone.

191
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,770
Junior.

192
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,560
Don’t go.

193
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,820
Where are you going?
Don’t go.

194
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,560
At that time,

195
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,960
although I was no longer a junior disciple,

196
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,030
I still had to do menial tasks

197
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,070
for my seniors.

198
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,040
Junior.

199
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,020
Senior.

200
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,850
Why are you still so stupid?

201
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,000
Still?

202
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,350
We seldom talked,

203
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,300
but we always hid out

204
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,860
in the warehouse together.

205
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,270
We just wanted

206
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,560
a quiet place to paint.

207
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,980
Although she didn't talk much,

208
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,650
I knew

209
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,030
it wasn't because she was aloof,

210
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,990
but because her background was complicated.

211
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,980
When she first came to Nanfeng Studio,

212
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,990
I've already heard that

213
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,700
the youngest daughter

214
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,920
of an official from Jiuxiao City

215
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,450
had a birthmark on her face.

216
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,890
A few years later,

217
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,510
when Master brought her back,

218
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,220
I heard that

219
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,320
the official's property had been confiscated

220
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,180
and his family had been beheaded.

221
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,460
Only the youngest daughter with a birthmark on her face

222
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,460
had gone missing.

223
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,190
Junior's painting

224
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,070
was taken by the palace again.

225
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,200
I've also heard that

226
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,520
the Empress Dowager wants Junior

227
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,300
to paint another one on her birthday.

228
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,950
Junior was getting better and better at painting,

229
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,080
and her name spread.

230
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,300
Her painting was sent to the palace

231
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,850
and recongized by the Empress Dowager.

232
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,380
As for me,

233
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,900
I was still

234
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,730
a nobody in Nanfeng Studio.

235
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,380
Muyuan.

236
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,620
Monk Suoluo

237
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,140
likes your painting.

238
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,380
He thinks you should meet each other.

239
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,870
He invites you to go to the far east with him

240
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,780
to hone your painting skills.

241
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,310
Master,

242
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:00,920
I...

243
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:01,940
My disciple.

244
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,930
This is a great opportunity.

245
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,330
But you can decide

246
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,900
whether you want to go or not.

247
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,980
Thank you, Master.

248
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,940
Congratulations, Senior.

249
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,650
Congratulations.

250
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,430
Congratulations.

251
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,170
Congratulations.

252
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:31,760
Congratulations.

253
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,690
Congratulations.

254
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,220
I didn't think that would be

255
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,150
the last time we saw each other.

256
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,570
Two years later,

257
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,510
I came back to Nanfeng Studio and learned that

258
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,180
Junior had given up painting to go back to her hometown

259
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,110
with her family.

260
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,690
But I knew

261
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,220
that was impossible.

262
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,920
But in this vast world,

263
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,780
I could only forget her.

264
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,670
Until that day.

265
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,040
Painter Feng.

266
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,510
Are you running errands for Master Wei again?

267
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,710
Please have a look at these paintings.

268
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,600
This is so well-painted.

269
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,600
[Spring in Nanfeng Studio, Meng Huaiyun]

270
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,860
I couldn't get it out of my mind.

271
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,810
But Master said

272
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,900
Junior had painted that

273
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,950
before she left.

274
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,710
I wanted to repress myself and forget,

275
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,630
until a coincidence occurred.

276
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:48,770
Good wine.

277
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,050
Good wine.

278
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,090
Senior is drunk.

279
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:55,840
Senior.

280
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,080
I'm not drunk.

281
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,690
You

282
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,360
are definitely drunk.

283
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,670
More.

284
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,170
Come on.

285
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,060
The three of us

286
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,260
haven't had so much fun in a long time.

287
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:13,720
Come on.

288
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,540
Cheers!

289
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,290
Do you remember

290
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,200
that time we drank with Junior

291
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,800
here?

292
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,750
What are you talking about?

293
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,060
Junior,

294
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:28,940
have you forgotten

295
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,450
what we had done

296
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,210
to her?

297
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,430
My disciple.

298
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,860
I've let you down.

299
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,770
In life,

300
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,000
if the one soulmate you had

301
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,050
was treated unjustly

302
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,710
and disappeared off the face of the earth,

303
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,940
what would you do?

304
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,480
So,

305
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,460
from the very beginning,

306
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,350
you never wanted to get away with this?

307
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,150
You blew the matter up on purpose

308
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,910
to let everyone know

309
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,200
about the evil deeds

310
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,820
your seniors had committed,

311
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,360
right?

312
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,180
That masked man.

313
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,630
Do you really not know who he is?

314
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,120
I don't know.

315
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,130
He's just a mysterious helper.

316
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,970
I've never seen

317
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,320
what's behind his mask.

318
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,210
But it's okay.

319
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,130
He taught me

320
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,590
how to kill people with the Qi Vitality Stone.

321
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,180
He even gave me

322
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,110
such a valuable Qi Vitality Stone.

323
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,980
And my three despicable seniors

324
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,910
were controlled by their own fear.

325
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,200
They kept using the Qi Vitality Stone

326
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,890
and scared themselves to death.

327
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,350
Have you ever thought about

328
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,840
why a stranger

329
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,330
would take the risk

330
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,140
to help you

331
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,710
frame Wei Gonglin?

332
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,730
He once told me

333
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,940
if I did two things,

334
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,370
he would help me with everything.

335
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,230
Except murder.

336
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,640
He also said

337
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,220
he wouldn't dirty his hands

338
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,060
because of me.

339
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,730
What two things?

340
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,070
First

341
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,730
was to turn the first criminal

342
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,610
into the “Wolf-headed Man Roaming at Night."

343
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,670
Second

344
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,410
was to tell you about this personally.

345
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,620
Jiu'er.

346
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,960
Lass.

347
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,750
Jiu'er.

348
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,180
What else did he tell you?

349
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,290
We will help you.

350
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,520
Painter Feng.

351
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,070
We will report

352
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,060

00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,970
Is our family going to produce

530
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,960
another senior inspector?

531
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,050
I wish.

532
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,670
By the way, Mother,

533
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,600
did you know

534
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,060
the Inspection Bureau

535
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,500
is going to recruit a batch of

536
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,620
Qi inspectors?

537
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:02,940
So what?

538
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,760
Mother.

539
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,520
Tell me.

540
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,850
If they assign me

541
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,790
a Qi as my partner...

542
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,860
That won't do.

543
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,490
You've just had a little success,

544
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,690
and you already want to ditch Han Zheng?

545
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,280
That's not what I meant.

546
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,300
I meant...

547
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,870
If he...

548
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,800
If he wants to find a Qi partner,

549
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,860
you must stop him.

550
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,120
Think about it.

551
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,060
The Qi are temperamental.

552
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,300
If he gets killed,

553
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,010
wouldn't you feel sorry for him?

554
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:35,470
Mother.

555
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,340
If he is...

556
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,160
Inspector Su.

557
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,460
What is it?

558
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,650
Inspector Su.

559
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,240
Our boss

560
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,530
has something for you.

561
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,310
Mr. Li?

562
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:45,780
Yes.

563
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,020
Thank you.

564
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,150
Mr. Li?

565
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,670
What is this?

566
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,920
I don't know.

567
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,560
Great.

568
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,910
This painting is so beautiful.

569
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,140
There's a letter here.

570
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,180
Mother.

571
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,640
I'm working on a case.

572
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,340
Go ahead.

573
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,800
I'll leave you to it.

574
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,510
Alright.

575
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,030
I'll buy you something delicious to eat.

576
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,800
Five days ago,

577
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,160
Painter Feng sent someone

578
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,660
to send it to the Nameless Art Gallery.

579
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,080
He asked me to hand it to you

580
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,050
in five days.

581
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,260
I had my guesses then,

582
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,210
but I didn't expect it

583
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
to happen so soon.

584
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,320
He jumped into the lake that same night.

585
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,600
Maybe he was determined to die,

586
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,860
and it was all planned.

587
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,220
He wanted to entrust these paintings to you.

588
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,260
Maybe he thought

589
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,640
you'll understand him.

590
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,350
[To Inspector Su]

591
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,210
I lost.

592
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,400
You beat me.

593
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,310
How is this a win?

594
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,570
I didn't save anyone.

595
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,700
I didn't even manage

596
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,480
to save him.

597
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,680
He didn't want anyone to save him.

598
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,820
He just wanted to find

599
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,020
Meng Huaiyun's body.

600
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:21,710
Also,

601
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,270
he needed someone

602
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,570
to remember

603
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,110
all that had happened between them.

604
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,380
You were the only one

605
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,250
among us

606
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,870
who found out about his love.

607
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,390
So,

608
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:35,970
you beat me.

609
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,070
I'm not used to

610
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,560
you talking like this.

611
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,760
Are you addicted to being bullied?

612
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,260
Or...

613
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,670
Then I'll use my privilege.

614
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,340
Can I?

615
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,650
Sure, go ahead.

616
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,710
What do you want?

617
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,280
Can I ask for anything?

618
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,320
Tell me first.

619
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,210
I want you to transform

620
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,010
into a puppy

621
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,420
and walk with me around the city.

622
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,080
Will you...

623
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,360
Han Zheng.

624
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,190
I was just kidding.

625
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,970
Why are you so serious?

626
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,810
I only have one request.

627
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,260
I have something to tell you,

628
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,980
but you're not allowed to get angry.

629
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,310
What?

630
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,370
Does the man with three scars

631
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,570
look like this?

632
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,410
Where did you get

633
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,200
this portrait?

634
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,710
I found it

635
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,300
in one of the Chief Inspector's

636
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,050
case files.

637
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,390
Why would he investigate this too?

638
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
I want to know too.

639
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,660
Because

640
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,330
the Inspection Bureau's Chief Inspector

641
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,780
was my father.

642
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,410
My father went to Shuobei before he died.

643
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,580
After he came back,

644
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,210
he contracted a strange disease

645
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,370
and grew black spots all over his body.

646
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,530
Soon after,

647
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,430
he died.

648
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,640
My mother

649
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,080
raised me, a sickly child,

650
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,940
all by herself.

651
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,640
She doesn't want me to take risks.

652
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,740
She just wants me to live well.

653
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,550
Every time

654
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,540
I work with you,

655
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,500
it is like there's a sword hanging over my head.

656
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,250
I don't know

657
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,380
if I should take risks

658
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,580
to do what I want to do,

659
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,080
or if I should listen to my parents

660
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,700
and live well.

661
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:33,980
You silly girl.

662
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,380
Why do you keep calling me silly?

663
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,980
I'm a reasonable person.

664
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:40,590
How could I let

665
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,240
a little girl

666
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,370
risk her life for me?

667
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,520
But from now on,

668
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,690
you can just order me around.

669
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,620
We are partners.

670
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:48,580
You

671
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,500
use your brain to the fullest.

672
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,360
As for the rest,

673
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,650
just count on me.

674
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,590
I just want to know

675
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,020
if the person on this portrait

676
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,790
is really

677
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,120
the man with three scars?

678
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,560
Is he?

679
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,580
I...

680
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,070
Look.

681
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,340
You don't want to

682
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,450
tell me anything.

683
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,300
Yet you say I'm your good friend

684
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,500
and trusted partner.

685
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,840
You only think of me

686
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,170
as a tool to solve cases.

687
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:13,730
No.

688
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,900
You're turning it on me.

689
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,620
I can only tell you

690
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:22,970
this man

691
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,260
is called Mu Yan.

692
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,250
He is related

693
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,030
to the Qi race's secret.

694
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,750
That's all I can tell you.

695
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,840
If I continue,

696
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,690
Chilan might come

697
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,830
to take your life.

698
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,180
By the way,

699
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,630
the disease you just mentioned

700
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,230
is similar to

701
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,660
a type of Xuanqi poison I've seen before.

702
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,120
Poison?

703
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:45,900
What poison?

704
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,000
The Xuanqi tribe is adept at medicine.

705
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,930
They have always been opposed to

706
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,980
friendly relations between the Qian and Qi.

707
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,610
So it's not surprising

708
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,210
that they would do something

709
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,440
to harm a Qian.

710
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,230
However,

711
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,850
what exactly happened to your father?

712
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,100
What if the person he met

713
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,420
wasn't Mu Yan?

714
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,850
Is he the one

715
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,460
in this portrait?

716
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,640
This portrait looks like the one

717
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,340
on the arrest warrant

718
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,560
the state of Qi once issued.

719
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,800
Logically speaking,

720
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,070
it shouldn't appear

721
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,020
in Jiuxiao City,

722
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,710
nor should it

723
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,770
come into your father's possession.

724
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,920
Thank you for trusting me

725
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,130
and telling me so much.

726
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,390
I have to tell you that

727
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,220
if one day,

728
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,980
I find out it was Mu Yan

729
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,310
who poisoned my father,

730
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,650
I won't let him off the hook.

731
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:46,940
Here.

732
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,570
Give me your hand.

733
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,400
What are you doing?

734
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,690
This is how the Qi

735
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,410
make a vow.

736
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,620
I swear

737
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,220
I will help you

738
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,900
find out the truth of your father's death

739
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,830
and give you a proper explanation.

740
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,230
Even if that person were Mu Yan,

741
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,470
I believe

742
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:10,350
he wouldn't kill a Qian

743
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,150
for no reason.

744
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,300
What?

745
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,140
You still don't believe me?

746
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,260
I...

747
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,810
Since Your Highness says so,

748
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,500
of course I believe you.

749
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,800
Can you

750
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,780
not call me "Your Highness"?

751
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:36,970
You can...

752
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,010
just call me Han Zheng.

753
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,990
Why are you suddenly

754
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
so amiable?

755
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,210
Did you wrong me

756
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,170
somehow?

757
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,020
Look at you.

758
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,900
Are you picking a fight again?

759
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,900
Do I have to be mean

760
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,020
to calm you down?

761
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:15,910
Let's go.

762
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,780
Actually,

763
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,780
I have been wanting to tell you something.

764
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,090
I recognise

765
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,020
you, Su Jiu'er, now.

766
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,110
You are different from

767
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,820
all the other Qian people.

768
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,750
You are qualified to be my partner.

769
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:34,790
However,

770
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,900
in the future,

771
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,820
I won't say any of these nonsense again.

772
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,960
I won't use them

773
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,290
to control you either.

774
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,000
But can you

775
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,210
not be so silly

776
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,470
and risk your life for me again?

777
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:53,800
Unfortunately,

778
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,460
it's all Yue Daren's fault.

779
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,140
If it weren't for him,

780
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,590
we might have caught that man

781
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,740
that night.

782
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,230
Tell me.

783
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,680
Was that person

784
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,710
the real Mu Yan,

785
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,500
or someone posing as him

786
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,430
to trick you?

787
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,850
We'll find out.

788
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,960
Here.

789
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,480
Eat more of this.

790
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,040
Become a sweeter talker.

791
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,840
Don't keep arguing with me

792
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,140
out of nowhere.

793
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,160
We are opposites.

794
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,020
I like to banter with you

795
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,320
when I'm in a good mood.

796
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,300
When I see you get so angry

797
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,500
that you have wrinkles on your face,

798
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,100
I'm happy.

799
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,360
Who has wrinkles on their face?

800
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:32,770
You.

801
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,480
-You’re full... -You.

802
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,790
You have wrinkles all over your face.

803
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,050
I don't have wrinkles.

804
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,030
I really don't have wrinkles.

805
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,300
Mother, I'm back.

806
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:54,720
Mother.

807
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,260
Do you want some candy?

808
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,650
You went to see His Highness secretly again?

809
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:02,650
Not His Highness.

810
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,710
It was Han Zheng.

811
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,239
He treats you so well.

812
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,120
Daughter, you must lock him down.

813
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,030
Mother, what are you talking about?

814
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,239
We are good partners.

815
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,600
We don't see gender.

816
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:24,679
Try one.

817
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,800
It's really sweet.

818
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,460
Take this red one, it's sweet.

819
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:30,830
Is it sweet?

820
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:31,900
Very.

821
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,060
The effects of her Qi Vitality Stone

822
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,060
haven't worn off.

823
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,110
I wonder

824
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,219
whose Qi Vitality Stone she used.

825
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,620
Will she dream of that Qi?

826
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,600
If she dreams of another Qi,

827
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:50,940
then...

828
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,230
She won't touch him, right?

829
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,500
Touch his face?

830
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,180
No way!

831
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,230
Pinch him like this?

832
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:05,980
No way!

833
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,130
Hold his hand?

834
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,980
She can only touch me—

835
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,940
Painter Feng?

836
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:54,730
Inspector Su.

837
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,430
Where is your partner?

838
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,800
Did he leave you

839
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,460
alone here?

840
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,060
Of course not.

841
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,490
How could he?

842
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:04,640
Yes.

843
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,870
How could he?

844
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,500
He won't leave you

845
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,290
alone here.

846
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,100
So that was what he meant

847
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,130
when he said that

848
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:18,930
back then.

849
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,310
What happened?

850
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,070
Am I dreaming about this

851
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,180
because I've been thinking about it in the day?

852
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,740
Junior.

853
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,350
Stop painting.

854
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,390
Tell her now.

855
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,000
You...

856
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,730
You fool.

857
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,380
Why didn't you tell her

858
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,500
you liked her

859
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,270
while she was still around?

860
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,160
She likes you too.

861
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,690
Why are you

862
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,960
so dull?

863
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,270
He doesn't want to say it.

864
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,270
Why force him?

865
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,820
Han Zheng?

866
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,020
Why are you here?

867
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,360
A dream?

868
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,460
Did she use

869
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,660
my Qi Vitality Stone?

870
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,080
That was the time.

871
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,440
Fine.

872
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,640
You're not an outsider anyway.

873
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,650
This is a dream anyway.

874
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,250
Don't just stand here.

875
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,230
Help them.

876
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,670
Let them be together.

877
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,540
Why do you want them

878
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,400
to be together?

879
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,340
Why?

880
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,380
Look at how pitiful they are.

881
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,780
Shouldn't people who have feelings for each other

882
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,960
get to be together?

883
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,850
Why are you acting so dull too?

884
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,840
Weird.

885
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,930
Why aren't you talking back

886
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,730
no matter what I say to you today?

887
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,140
Smile.

888
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:02,860
Don't smile.

889
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:03,990
Smile again.

890
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,740
Are you really a fake?

891
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,200
Since you're a fake,

892
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,660
let me practice on you.

893
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,070
Maybe

894
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,330
when I lie to you in the future,

895
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,030
I wouldn't blush

896
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,650
and my heart wouldn't beat faster anymore.

897
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,270
How about that?

898
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,530
Okay, let's practice.

899
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:27,800
Why aren't your ears fluffy

900
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,070
in my dream?

901
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,520
Qi people's noses

902
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,640
are also very sensitive, right?

903
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,350
Why are your noses

904
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,230
so sensitive?

905
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:34,970
Let me see.

906
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,920
Do it yourself.

907
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,880
Hold it up like this.

908
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,480
Hold it up.

909
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,220
Do you know

910
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,770
you're very cute

911
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,050
when you're obedient?

912
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,070
Oh my goodness.

913
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,980
What an amazing dream.

914
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,030
I can't believe

915
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,660
Han Zheng is being so docile!

916
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:55,750
Dear Heavens,

917
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,100
are you making it up to me

918
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,700
for my suffering in the past?

919
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,490
Han Zheng.

920
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,950
Look at them.

921
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,040
♫ I never forgot your warm gaze ♫

922
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:39,800
♫ Under the moonlight, the laughter is searching for the answer ♫

923
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:47,140
♫ Time goes by quietly, color turns grey ♫

924
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:52,180
♫ I only want him to be safe ♫

925
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:58,140
♫ The geese's return looks like a message from you ♫

926
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:03,870
♫ The warm dusk is like your embrace ♫

927
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:10,090
♫ The night breeze sweeps through my long hair, as if you are wrapped around me ♫

928
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:18,610
♫ The future can only depend on the beauty of imagination ♫

929
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,020
Go do farm work.

930
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,330
Is this enough?

931
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:42,650
Yes.

932
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,770
Mrs. Zhang.

933
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:49,980
Have you heard?

934
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,530
I think Su Jiu'er from the Inspection Bureau

935
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,180
has a Qi for a partner.

936
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,650
Really?

937
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,870
Is there anyone in Jiuxiao City

938
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,430
who still doesn't know about them?

939
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,350
They solved

940
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,780
several strange cases together.

941
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,880
These two

942
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,880
are joined at the hip.

943
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,580
They're like twins.

944
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:08,950
What does that Qi

945
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,020
look like?

946
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,560
You don't know.

947
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,340
I heard that Qi

948
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,170
is 8 feet tall,

949
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,930
has a mouth full of fangs,

950
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,610
and hair so long it sweeps the ground.

951
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,010
Granny.

952
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,050
When he talks...

953
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,500
Granny!

954
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,040
It's so loud and clear,

955
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,620
like the ringing of temples' bells.

956
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,620
You can hear it from five miles away.

957
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:30,680
It's not as exaggerated

958
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,600
as you said.

959
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,780
He's just an ordinary person.

960
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,130
His physique

961
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,540
is a little bulkier than ours.

962
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,700
But his nature

963
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,840
is very rough.

964
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,730
-My carriage! -Every time he's on the job,

965
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,720
he can catch the criminal.

966
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,380
But he leaves a mess

967
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,620
at the scene!

968
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,340
In the end,

969
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,010
it's still the misfortune

970
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,010
of us commoners!

971
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,680
I heard that

972
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,810
he's the prince of the Qi race.

973
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,090
So what?

974
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,200
In our country,

975
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,570
isn't he still an assistant

976
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,970
to our female inspector?

977
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,700
I've also heard that...

978
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,680
What did you hear?

979
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,730
I know you.

980
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,770
I'm the most—

981
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:02,650
You're the biggest gossip!

982
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,880
What's so good about selling wontons?

983
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,820
You sissy!

984
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,320
You're always strutting around!

985
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,900
How dare you question my information network?

986
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,750
Do you know who I am?

987
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,350
Thief!

988
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,350
Help me catch the thief!

989
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,140
Wait for me!

990
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:12,700
Thief!

991
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,670
Don't move.

992
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,620
Excuse me!

993
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,740
The Inspection Bureau is on a case!

994
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,010
Excuse me.

995
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,620
Don't move.

996
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,340
Be gentle.

997
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,230
Be gentle.

998
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:23,980
Sir.

999
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,180
He took him down so easily.

1000
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,110
That's amazing.

1001
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,720
-Please spare me. -Oh no.

1002
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,180
We're going to have to pay compensation again.
