4
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,140
Mother.

5
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,680
Why are you still up?

6
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,370
Jiu'er.

7
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,900
I just remembered something.

8
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,070
I've been looking for you.

9
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,800
Here you are.

10
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,430
What is it?

11
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,880
The sorceress in the west of the city

12
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,979
came to our house to buy medicine two days ago.

13
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,430
She

14
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,100
kept talking

15
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,100
and talking about

16
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,650
how she had a dream

17
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,960
of something happening to a ship.

18
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,580
And she said

19
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,700
it was a sign from heaven.

20
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,230
Is this dream

21
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,580
similar to yours?

22
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,970
I just remembered it

23
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,100
so I came to tell you.

24
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,060
Yes!

25
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,789
I'm not the only one

26
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,260
who has used Qi Vital Stones.

27
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:11,900
Someone else must have

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,360
dreamed of the same scene.

29
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,440
Mother,

30
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,380
you are so smart.

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,530
Your tips are always so useful.

32
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,710
Of course.

33
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,770
Who do you think I am?

34
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,180
Brother Ying.

35
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,829
Tell me if you feel sore.

36
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,370
Is this amount of pressure okay?

37
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,070
Enough.

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,540
Just say what you have to say.

39
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,060
Why are you

40
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,100
just like Jun?

41
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,290
Really?

42
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,680
Then

43
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,040
in that case,

44
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,140
aren't Brother Jun and I

45
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,060
a good match?

46
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,910
Isn't it enough for our family to have just

47
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,110
one person like this?

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,140
Brother Ying.

49
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,730
I'm here to ask you

50
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,780
what kind of relationship

51
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,550
Brother Jun, Su Jiu'er,

52
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,720
and Han Zheng

53
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,200
have.

54
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,960
You're an astute girl,

55
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,340
can't you tell?

56
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,180
Come, sit down.

57
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,260
Su Jiu'er said

58
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,500
Brother Jun likes Han Zheng.

59
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,670
But Han Zheng

60
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,770
seems to like Su Jiu'er.

61
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,570
Brother Jun likes Su Jiu'er too.

62
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,320
But I think

63
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,740
she likes Han Zheng more.

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,460
Where does Brother Jun fit into all this?

65
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,980
You have a point.

66
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,540
Then why is Brother Jun

67
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,070
still hanging around them?

68
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,500
He should be mine.

69
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,650
Lass.

70
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,470
You're still so young.

71
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,000
What are you talking about?

72
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,390
Brother Ying,

73
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,990
you are so experienced.

74
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,660
Teach me

75
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,170
how you made Sister-in-law yours

76
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,300
back then.

77
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,660
Back then, she mistakenly believed

78
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,470
I was going to

79
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,060
get married to another woman.

80
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,920
Her attitude towards me changed.

81
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,790
It was then that I realized she was jealous

82
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,030
and that she liked me too.

83
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,080
So naturally,

84
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,040
we got together.

85
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:11,900
I see.

86
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,710
As long as I make Brother Jun jealous,

87
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,600
he'll be mine.

88
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,399
Isn't your understanding

89
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,010
a little simple and crude?

90
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,870
Thank you, Brother Ying.

91
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,340
I see.

92
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,230
Goodbye.

93
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,420
Why did that scene

94
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,470
feel familiar?

95
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,500
Come here.

96
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,159
I have

97
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,820
an important announcement.

98
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,500
-What’s wrong? -What’s wrong?

99
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,100
What is it?

100
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,210
What's wrong?

101
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,070
Why didn't she

102
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,010
discuss it with us

103
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,750
before

104
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,240
she took this on?

105
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,720
Exactly.

106
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,810
How many ancient

107
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,640
cold cases

108
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,780
does the Inspection Bureau have?

109
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,380
Look at her.

110
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,110
Now, she's taking on the siren.

111
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,659
We are not monster hunters.

112
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,870
How can we bring the siren to justice?

113
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,910
Talking about Jiu'er behind her back.

114
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,440
Do you think I've gone deaf?

115
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,420
We're going to go help.

116
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,620
-Let’s go. -Good morning, everyone.

117
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,800
I called you here

118
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,460
because I finally figured out

119
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,660
how to solve the case.

120
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,010
Solve the case?

121
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,620
Let me help you.

122
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,660
I'll help too.

123
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,180
Come on, hand them out.

124
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,700
Offering a generous sum of reward money for anyone

125
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,640
who has dreamed of the Starry Night or the siren recently.

126
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,970
Offering reward money?

127
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,050
I thought it would be a good idea.

128
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,110
Jiu'er.

129
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,100
In my opinion,

130
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,960
you might as well hire a shaman

131
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,020
to perform a ritual for you.

132
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,060
It'll save us the trouble

133
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,909
of pasting these all over the city.

134
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,780
Cut the crap.

135
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,880
Inspector Su has her reasons for doing this.

136
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,360
Just do as she says.

137
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:50,700
Jiu'er.

138
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,020
You didn't tell me what your plan was,

139
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,960
but you told Brother Han?

140
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,659
I didn't.

141
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,040
No matter what Jiu'er does,

142
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,240
she's always right.

143
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,620
Please

144
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,960
put them up for me.

145
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,890
Thank you, everyone.

146
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,420
Let's go.

147
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,440
Get going.

148
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,590
Let's go.

149
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,610
Go, go, go.

150
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,180
Let's go.

151
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,510
The Princess is here.

152
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,940
What is she doing here?

153
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,670
I don't know.

154
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,620
Go put up the notice.

155
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,150
Let's go.

156
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,230
Princess Heyin.

157
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:30,780
Heyin.

158
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,260
Why are you here?

159
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,980
Heyin.

160
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,150
We're busy.

161
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,230
We don't have time to eat.

162
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,430
Why don't you go back?

163
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,530
Brother Zheng.

164
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,690
Have some melon.

165
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,620
Brother Zheng?

166
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,850
Brother Zheng?

167
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,740
Brother Zheng?

168
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,820
Brother Jun is jealous?

169
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,970
Brother Ying's method

170
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,660
really is simple and crude.

171
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,540
Princess.

172
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,980
What are you doing?

173
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,190
Brother Zheng is all alone

174
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,240
in a foreign country

175
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,920
to help the Qian solve cases.

176
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,140
As a princess of Qian,

177
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,600
I should take good care of him.

178
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Tell me the truth.

179
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,750
What do you want?

180
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,230
I was young and ignorant.

181
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,380
I thought the most handsome man in Jiuxiao City

182
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,060
was Brother Jun.

183
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,010
That was until I met you.

184
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Brother Jun can only rank third now.

185
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,890
Who's second?

186
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,080
You're ranked first

187
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,620
so no one even qualifies for second place.

188
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,980
Brother Zheng, open your mouth.

189
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,330
No.

190
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,270
What are you doing?

191
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,380
Brother Zheng!

192
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,340
Don't go, Brother Zheng!

193
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,530
Brother Zheng.

194
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,230
What's going on?

195
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,380
Guo.

196
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,540
Come here.

197
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,920
Later, you...

198
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,420
Boss.

199
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,680
Do you think there are so many people

200
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,100
who dreamed of the Starry Night and the siren?

201
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,420
I think they're here for the reward money.

202
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,040
They're probably just going to dupe us

203
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,900
with nonsense.

204
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,240
But Jiu'er said

205
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,860
she can tell if they're telling the truth

206
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,400
by asking just one question.

207
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,260
What question?

208
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,180
Those who can hum the siren's song,

209
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,980
queue up here!

210
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,860
I knew it.

211
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,090
There are so many liars?

212
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,710
Let's begin.

213
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,600
Stop.

214
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,310
You may leave.

215
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:52,770
Next.

216
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,170
Inspector Su.

217
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,960
You've heard the siren's song?

218
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,740
Hum it for me.

219
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,240
Brother Zheng!

220
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,680
Have a taste.

221
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,380
Brother Zheng!

222
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,420
Come on.

223
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,590
Brother Zheng.

224
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,840
Brother Zheng!

225
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,400
You've heard the siren's song?

226
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,820
Hum it for me.

227
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,390
That's enough.

228
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,530
Brother Zheng, have some watermelon.

229
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,390
Just have a taste.

230
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,340
Everyone trying to fish for reward money

231
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,950
under the guise of providing leads

232
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,300
will be detained for three days

233
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,100
for the obstruction of justice!

234
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,170
Did I hear wrong?

235
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:19,940
I can't sing.

236
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,870
They want to lock people up?

237
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,150
Why didn't they say it earlier?

238
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,900
Thank you for your hard work.

239
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,160
Go back and take a rest.

240
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,700
Okay, let's go.

241
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,490
Let's go.

242
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,600
Let's go.

243
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,960
Brother Zheng.

244
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,760
Stop running.

245
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,230
I'm exhausted.

246
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,010
Come on.

247
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,060
Just take one.

248
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,140
If you keep pestering me,

249
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,760
I will detain you for three days

250
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,620
for the obstruction of justice.

251
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,530
Commander Yan is terrified of my father.

252
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,980
He wouldn’t dare to lock me up.

253
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,260
Just eat one.

254
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,260
Just one.

255
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,720
I don't like eating this.

256
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,610
You don't like this?

257
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,410
You should have told me earlier.

258
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,820
The red one is sweet and the yellow one is sour.

259
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
Which one do you want? I'll feed you.

260
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,130
Candy?

261
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,260
Han Zheng.

262
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,520
If you dare eat it,

263
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
you're dead meat.

264
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,820
Does Jiu'er want one too?

265
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,840
Brother Jun is jealous.

266
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,190
It's working.

267
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,060
Can I throw her out?

268
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,500
No.

269
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,430
In the end, Jiu'er will have to

270
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,230
suffer for me.

271
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,640
Jiu'er's expression...

272
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,010
Is she afraid I'll offend her?

273
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,690
Come on, Brother Zheng.

274
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,700
Just eat one.

275
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,890
Just one, okay?

276
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,150
Just one bite.

277
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:52,790
Just one.

278
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,490
If you keep pestering me,

279
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,240
I'll eat you.

280
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,620
This...

281
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,020
Next!

282
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,150
Anyone else?

283
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,510
I don't think so.

284
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,630
I'm here.

285
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,480
Well...

286
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,860
Is this the place to claim the reward money?

287
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,260
Why is no one here?

288
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,740
What do you mean?

289
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,460
I'm here.

290
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,930
Cut the crap and sing.

291
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,950
That's it.

292
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,770
It's exactly like the sound I heard in my dream.

293
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,530
That's not the voice of a siren.

294
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,770
That is clearly

295
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,970
the sound of the sky-connecting conch.

296
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,620
The sky-connecting conch?

297
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,350
What is that?

298
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,790
You want to know?

299
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,330
I won't tell you.

300
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:57,930
Heyin.

301
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,240
I've specially

302
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,200
booked out Deyue Restaurant

303
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,920
for you.

304
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,350
How is it?

305
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,240
You may leave.

306
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,460
Heyin.

307
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,660
Well,

308
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,990
what is the sky-connecting conch?

309
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,730
Tell us.

310
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,220
I was at the Inspection Bureau

311
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,500
for so long.

312
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,570
My shoulders are really sore.

313
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,620
Then...

314
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,580
What should we do?

315
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,210
You, come here.

316
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,390
Me?

317
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,160
Yes.

318
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
Give me a massage.

319
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,890
Hurry up.

320
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,320
Alright, I'll give you a massage.

321
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,140
Here.

322
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,360
Brother Zheng.

323
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,270
What do you want?

324
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,030
I want to eat that.

325
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,330
Don't you...

326
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,470
Open your mouth.

327
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,080
Brother Zheng.

328
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,550
Brother Han.

329
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,080
Don't be so fierce.

330
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,430
Did you say that because you care about me?

331
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,780
Enough.

332
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,890
You can stop.

333
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,240
Can you tell us now?

334
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,670
I've heard that you're very fast.

335
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,710
How about this?

336
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,700
If you fly with me around Jiuxiao City,

337
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,500
I'll tell you.

338
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,130
How dare she ask Han Zheng to fly with her?

339
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,300
You won't say yes, will you?

340
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,260
This look

341
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,630
is encouraging me to bear with the humiliation.

342
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,760
Fine, I'll grant your wish.

343
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,170
Let's go.

344
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,630
-Brother Han. -Han Zheng!

345
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,830
Can you tell us now?

346
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,220
I feel dizzy.

347
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:33,960
You...

348
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,540
How about now?

349
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,180
I...

350
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,290
I don't want to fly anymore.

351
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,560
Brother Han.

352
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,150
Don't...

353
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,590
Brother Jun, save me.

354
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,590
Are you going to tell us?

355
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,190
I'll tell you.

356
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,830
What is it?

357
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,860
Tell us about it.

358
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,810
The song that person hummed

359
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,980
is exactly the same

360
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,660
as the sound of the sky-connecting conch

361
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,570
I've heard.

362
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,570
What on earth is the sky-connecting conch?

363
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,100
Yes.

364
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,010
What's that?

365
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:24,930
It's a type of conch

366
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,560
in the deep sea of the far east.

367
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,990
Although it's not big,

368
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,120
the sound it produces

369
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,600
is like a woman's singing.

370
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,230
It's very special.

371
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,980
It's rare to see it.

372
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,720
I remember when I was young,

373
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,530
my father bought one

374
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,120
for me as a toy.

375
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,220
But after playing with it for a while,

376
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,420
I lost interest in it.

377
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,050
That means

378
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,650
the so-called siren's song

379
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,210
was fabricated.

380
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,460
Where is the sky-connecting conch now?

381
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,620
Take us to find it.

382
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,540
I- I don't remember.

383
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,660
I really don't remember!

384
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,170
-Jiu'er. -Jiu'er.

385
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:11,890
Brother Jun.

386
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,810
I'm scared.

387
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,849
Don't go.

388
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,720
This...

389
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,089
Brother Jun!

390
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,540
Well, Heyin...

391
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,440
She's not bad.

392
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,569
She's quite useful at critical times.

393
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,780
It was my idea,

394
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,380
wasn't it?

395
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,589
But

396
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,990
without her,

397
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,130
you wouldn't have known that was

398
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,330
the sound of the sky-connecting conch.

399
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,380
Well...

400
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,630
You are also not bad.

401
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:38,720
Well...

402
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,040
You're amazing.

403
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,770
What do you mean by "also"?

404
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,100
I'm not amazing at all!

405
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,430
No.

406
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,700
She's the most amazing!

407
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,100
Go make her your partner.

408
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,580
Eat her fruit

409
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,450
and her candy.

410
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,710
Go fly around with her!

411
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,740
Didn't I do all this

412
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,900
for you?

413
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,210
For me?

414
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,180
Yes.

415
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,820
It's all because you made a promise

416
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,710
to the commoners.

417
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,780
I was afraid you'll look bad in front of them.

418
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,380
If not, would I have had to

419
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,440
put up with this kind of humiliation?

420
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,260
Fine.

421
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,580
I bit off more than I can chew.

422
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,560
I shouldn't have implicated you.

423
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Princes should be with princesses.

424
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,700
None of you

425
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,940
want me, the measly inspector anymore!

426
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,840
What are you doing?

427
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,100
What do you mean?

428
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,070
"Princes should be with princesses?"

429
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,700
Does that mean

430
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,360
Jiu'er should be with Jun'er?

431
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,910
You're being unreasonable!

432
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,660
You're the unreasonable one!

433
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,220
Heyin.

434
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,060
Do you really like Brother Han?

435
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:35,910
Yes.

436
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,130
I'm partial to Qi people.

437
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:38,940
Can't I?

438
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,030
That's great!

439
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,460
You like Han Zheng.

440
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,260
I like Jiu'er.

441
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,760
We can work together

442
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,920
to help each other.

443
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,540
Brother Jun.

444
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,600
Can't you tell

445
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,990
I'm provoking you?

446
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,170
Why?

447
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,630
How could I like

448
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,140
that fierce Qi?

449
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,130
Besides,

450
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,750
he only likes Su Jiu'er.

451
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,770
Why are you

452
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,140
butting in on their fun?

453
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,940
Even you can tell

454
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,630
Han Zheng likes Su Jiu'er?

455
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,560
Of course.

456
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,480
He's usually so fierce.

457
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,540
But he only listens

458
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,690
to Su Jiu'er.

459
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,710
How could he not like her?

460
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,540
I'm not butting in.

461
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,530
I have no choice.

462
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,790
I've met

463
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,250
the love of my life.

464
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,430
Even if she doesn't like me,

465
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,550
I can't stop

466
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,020
liking her.

467
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,750
You're such a fool.

468
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,560
When I was young,

469
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,340
my mother fell seriously ill.

470
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,610
I only had one friend.

471
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,090
She wasn't afraid of getting infected.

472
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,150
She kept me company

473
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,990
and took care of my mother and I.

474
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,310
She was Su Jiu'er.

475
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,020
Later, my mother passed away.

476
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,310
She told me

477
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,630
that wasn't a permanent goodbye.

478
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,470
One day,

479
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,980
we will meet again

480
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,120
in another world.

481
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,410
You're so silly.

482
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,300
What can you

483
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,640
get out of this?

484
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,780
Heyin.

485
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,020
Treating someone well

486
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,180
is one-sided.

487
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,620
If everyone only wants to take,

488
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,130
who will give?

489
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,630
But Brother Jun,

490
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,940
it's obvious that

491
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,870
Su Jiu'er treats Han Zheng better.

492
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,140
Giving without asking anything in return like this,

493
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,070
don't you get sad

494
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,180
or jealous?

495
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,030
I do get sad

496
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,220
and jealous.

497
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,260
But my relationship with Brother Han

498
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,460
and Jiu'er

499
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,060
is much closer

500
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,920
than you think.

501
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,940
Because we are good friends.

502
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,700
Good friends will fight,

503
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,100
but we won't turn our backs on one another.

504
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,800
I have been sickly

505
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,540
since I was a kid.

506
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,010
A while ago...

507
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,820
Louder!

508
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,500
Why are you scolding him?

509
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,640
Am I scolding him?

510
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,610
You are.

511
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,110
Am I?

512
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,430
I only asked him to speak louder. Is that considered scolding?

513
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,160
You scared me

514
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,180
when you slammed the table.

515
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,880
I don't want the reward anymore.

516
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,720
I'm leaving.

517
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,960
-No. Keep talking! -No. Keep talking!

518
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,200
Well...

519
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,100
My mother bought a secret medicine

520
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,360
from the black market.

521
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,930
It was very effective.

522
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,550
After eating it,

523
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,940
I'll always have strange dreams.

524
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,770
A few days ago,

525
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,790
I had two

526
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,710
horrible dreams.

527
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,650
Hurry!

528
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,340
Hide!

529
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,480
Hurry!

530
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,500
The siren is here!

531
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,540
Hide!

532
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,060
Hurry up!

533
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,070
Hide!

534
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,300
The siren is here!

535
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,850
Close your eyes!

536
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,680
I saw everyone close their eyes.

537
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,490
I couldn't help

538
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,710
but close my eyes too.

539
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,910
Please spare me!

540
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,730
What are you looking at?

541
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,220
Go on!

542
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,480
Why are you scolding him?

543
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,620
Am I scolding him?

544
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,480
You are.

545
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,700
When did you see me

546
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,300
scold him?

547
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,160
I didn't scold him just now either.

548
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,870
Why can you scold him

549
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,600
but not me?

550
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,650
On the first day, I woke up

551
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,400
when I got to that part.

552
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,490
But

553
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,340
the next day,

554
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,590
I had another dream.

555
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,960
I dreamed that

556
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,850
I was held captive in a karst cave.

557
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,910
There were many people

558
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,140
there with me.

559
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,400
Everyone was tied up.

560
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,060
I wanted to scream but I couldn't.

561
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,000
I think there was

562
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,770
something stuffed in my mouth.

563
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,810
I woke up then.

564
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,810
I think I was the same person in both dreams.

565
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,430
I even thought these two dreams

566
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,600
were successive.

567
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,030
Do you also feel like

568
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,440
the person in your dream

569
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,630
wasn't you?

570
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,540
It seemed like me.

571
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,240
B- But it also didn't.

572
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,050
The dream was very realistic,

573
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,250
but I couldn't

574
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,210
control my body.

575
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,360
I couldn't open

576
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,180
or close my eyes,

577
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,250
or speak at will.

578
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,570
What about the karst cave in your dream?

579
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,160
Was there anything special about it?

580
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
It seemed like

581
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,500
a karst cave.

582
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,650
I saw an owl.

583
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,950
I also vaguely heard

584
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,960
a wolf's howling.

585
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,290
-What else? -What else?

586
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,060
No.

587
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,140
Officers,

588
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,820
I've told you everything I know.

589
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:06,860
Well...

590
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,620
Can I get the reward now?

591
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,000
Thank you.

592
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,020
Why is he running?

593
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,110
It's not like I will eat him.

594
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,760
I think we've got it.

595
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,020
You...

596
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,250
Why aren't you leaving?

597
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,250
Aren't you afraid that I'll eat you?

598
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,430
Who knows who will eat who?

599
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,770
Fine.

600
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,210
You love eating humans so much.

601
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,670
Then save your appetite

602
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,310
for your princess!

603
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,170
She tastes better than me!

604
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,370
Wait.

605
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,860
What's wrong with you?

606
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,060
What does it have to do

607
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,120
with the princess?

608
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,800
[Nameless Art Gallery]

609
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,490
Princess.

610
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,660
I've searched all over three times,

611
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,280
but I couldn't find the sky-connecting conch.

612
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,430
Why can't you

613
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
find it?

614
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,100
I really don't remember

615
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,580
Your Highness bringing a sky-connecting conch

616
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,780
to the art gallery.

617
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,760
You probably lost it while playing with it

618
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,060
when you were young.

619
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,430
Calm down.

620
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,020
It's okay.

621
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,380
Since we can't find it,

622
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,100
let's not trouble Shopkeeper Li.

623
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,790
I'll find a way

624
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,850
to get another one.

625
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,150
Brother Jun.

626
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,620
It's very hard to get one.

627
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,550
How about I go back to my residence

628
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,750
to look for it for you?

629
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,180
Okay.

630
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,110
It's okay if you can't find it.

631
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,160
Brother Jun,

632
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,420
can I go to your residence

633
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,860
to read your new script?

634
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,340
Sure. Let's go.

635
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:50,990
Shopkeeper Li.

636
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,640
See you.

637
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,620
Let's go.

638
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:02,860
Marquis.

639
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,440
They're looking for the sky-connecting conch.

640
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,120
It's not a problem.

641
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,170
So many years went by without a hitch.

642
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,990
Can't I handle

643
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,120
these kids?

644
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,590
I need to know

645
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,180
why she

646
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,240
was so angry today.

647
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:33,740
No.

648
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,810
If we have another disagreement

649
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,270
and start fighting again,

650
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,880
wouldn't she be unable

651
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,720
to sleep well tonight?

652
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,690
What should I do? I have no inspiration.

653
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,420
It's too hard to write.

654
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,010
Who are you?

655
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,690
You broke into my house so late at night,

656
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,290
and you're asking me who I am?

657
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,210
Hua?

658
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,180
Hua, I...

659
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,320
I didn't expect

660
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,870
the suitor I've waited for for over ten years

661
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,340
to be you, Your Highness.

662
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,200
Wait for me.

663
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,100
Isn't it inappropriate

664
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,970
for Your Highness

665
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,310
to have a rendezvous with me

666
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,570
behind Jiu'er's back?

667
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,300
I am not

668
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,600
such an easy woman.

669
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,200
It's true

670
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,380
I'm here behind Jiu'er's back.

671
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,720
But how is this

672
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,930
a rendezvous?

673
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,700
What you said just now

674
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,620
indeed sounds uncharacteristic of Jiu'er.

675
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,090
Right?

676
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,790
Do you think

677
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,150
something has been bothering her lately?

678
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,460
Your brain

679
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,320
is rather slow.

680
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
How can you be a domineering prince?

681
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,050
Tell me.

682
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,720
Jiu'er

683
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,300
is clearly jealous

684
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,130
of you and that wilful princess.

685
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:41,800
Jealous?

686
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,380
Is Jiu'er jealous because of me?

687
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,110
Jiu'er is jealous because of me...

688
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,910
Silly boy, since you are so cute,

689
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,040
I'll let you in on another secret.

690
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:55,970
Go ahead.

691
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,780
Good women give in to persistent suitors.

692
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,570
Persistent?

693
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,510
I can't do that.

694
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,340
But still, thank you.

695
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,230
Where did he go?

696
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,830
Right!

697
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,940
If I introduce a wilful princess who messes up the situation,

698
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,460
I can continue writing!

699
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,610
Don't talk to me.

700
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,160
Fine, I'm sorry, okay?

701
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,910
Don't you understand?

702
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,700
I told you not to talk to me.

703
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,720
You even dreamed

704
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,040
because of me.

705
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,320
Why are you here?

706
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,610
I'm here

707
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,080
to pick you up.

708
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:09,510
I...

709
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,160
Where is my mother?

710
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,350
She's exercising outside.

711
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,900
Get up.

712
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,470
I'll get you some water to wash your face.

713
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,300
Here.

714
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,640
You didn't eat the noodles last time.

715
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,710
I made

716
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,640
another bowl for you.

717
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,180
Try it.

718
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,170
Here, eat it.

719
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,170
The watermelon was heart-shaped.

720
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,680
The eggs are also heart-shaped.

721
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,700
Why is everything heart-shaped?

722
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,100
I don't want it!

723
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:55,770
Then...

724
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,770
Don't eat it.

725
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,850
I also prepared

726
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,540
your favorite steamed buns.

727
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,270
Why don't you eat this instead?

728
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:03,780
Here.

729
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,420
Try it.

730
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,940
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

731
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,700
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

732
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,370
Three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

733
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,940
Four, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

734
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,400
Come on.

735
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,570
Go dance.

736
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,650
Let's do it again.

737
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,980
Can I not go?

738
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,100
♫Walking alone in a remote city♫

739
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,740
No!

740

I...

741
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:49,730
♫It's strange outside Jiuxiao City, I ran into you♫

742

00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,410
Stand next to my mother.

744
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,220
-Two, two, three, four, -Dance.

745
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,650
five, six, seven, eight.

746

♫Our love begins to blossom as we joke around♫

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:48,890
Which one should I pick?

767
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,620
Brother Jun.

768
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,520
Brother Jun, wake up.

769
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,800
Let's go find the sky-connecting conch.

770
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,020
Princess.

771
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,300
His Highness has already left.

772
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,760
Who are you?

773
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,220
I'm Liu Fu.

774
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:07,880
Brother Jun.

775
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,250
You're so naughty.

776
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,860
How could you be Liu Fu?

777
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,150
Why not?

778
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,300
Your Highness.

779
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,780
Her Highness came

780
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,600
before seven.

781
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,400
I had no choice.

782
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,940
I couldn't stop her.

783
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,480
Jun.

784
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,570
Come to Han Zheng's residence tomorrow morning.

785
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,910
There's something important to discuss.

786
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,910
Remember, don't let Heyin find out.

787
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,820
No matter what,

788
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,980
I have to lose Heyin first.

789
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,710
Brother Jun.

790
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,240
I'll come in if you don't say anything.

791
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,690
Where's Brother Jun?

792
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,610
I came in with you.

793
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,500
Weird.

794
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,490
Brother Han, how did you know

795
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,690
I was held up by Heyin?

796
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,780
We waited for you for a long time,

797
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,710
so we guessed it.

798
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,409
You mean

799
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,949
that man named Hai

800
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,840
had two dreams?

801
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,239
And they were related?

802
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,110
Hai was just like me.

803
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,159
He accidentally ate the Qi Vital Stone

804
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,889
of someone on the Starry Night.

805
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,820
His two dreams

806
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,449
were actually the real experiences

807
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,310
of this person.

808
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,409
Look at this picture.

809
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,469
This Qi

810
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,900
was kidnapped

811
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,320
by a group of masked men

812
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,440
before being confined in this karst cave.

813
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:39,030
And there were many people

814
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,790
tied up in there, just like him.

815
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,980
Could they all be

816
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,880
the people who went missing from the Starry Night?

817
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:47,570
Yes.

818
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,139
But it's not only

819
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,830
the people on the Starry Night.

820
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,389
I looked into all the ships

821
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,860
that fell victim to the siren.

822
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,060
There are six of them.

823
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,260
More than 200 people have gone missing.

824
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,020
More than 190 people are Qi people.

825
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,680
Only 30 are Qian people.

826
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,270
That means

827
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,500
most of the missing people

828
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,300
are Qi people.

829
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,820
It is mostly Qi people

830
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,600
who travel between

831
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,060
Jiuxiao City and Shuobei.

832
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,730
I've looked into the case files.

833
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,750
Eight years ago,

834
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,050
there were several Qian survivors

835
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,680
on the first boat to run into trouble.

836
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,840
But these survivors

837
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,740
managed to survive

838
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,260
because they hid themselves in the cargo containers.

839
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,580
The story about the siren

840
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,640
and the story about

841
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,900
being able to survive if one closed their eyes

842
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,980
were also

843
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:29,870
spread by them.

844
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,150
But strangely,

845
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,760
there is no record

846
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,980
of their identities.

847
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,910
We can't find them

848
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,620
to clarify our questions.

849
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,140
The so-called siren's song

850
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,970
was fabricated using a sky-connecting conch.

851
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,710
Then what those missing people said

852
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,020
is probably unreliable too.

853
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,130
Because there's a saying

854
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,980
that you won't die if you close your eyes,

855
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,460
as long as a ship in trouble

856
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,540
hears

857
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,820
the so-called siren's song,

858
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,980
everyone will close their eyes.

859
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:58,900
In this way,

860
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,260
the people who board the ship

861
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,790
can hide their identities,

862
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,610
and the crew on the ship

863
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,220
can't move.

864
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,700
That means

865
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,620
someone made up

866
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,000
of the myth of the siren

867
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,150
to kidnap Qi people.

868
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,580
Why?

869
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,460
The Qi in Jiuxiao City are much poorer

870
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
than the Qian.

871
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:17,810
What on earth

872
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,220
does the person behind this

873
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,660
want from them?

874
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,280
It's such a great risk.

875
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,690
Think about it.

876
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,640
Could it be

877
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,940
their Qi Vital Stones?

878
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,420
I found out a few months ago that

879
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,220
Qi Vital Stones are being sold on the black market.

880
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
I thought Qi people

881
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,460
who have no other choice

882
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,920
are doing this willingly.

883
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,460
But now that I think about it,

884
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,380
if someone wants to make a profit

885
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,860
and kidnapped Qi people

886
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,320
for their Qi Vital Stones,

887
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,910
that wouldn't be a stretch.

888
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,850
Plus, my mother said

889
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,630
a bottle of Qi Vital Stone

890
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,030
can fetch 20 gold pieces.

891
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,640
Faced with such a huge profit,

892
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,120
someone is bound to consider doing evil.

893
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,630
Who is it?

894
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,100
Who could do

895
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,320
such a vicious thing?

896
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,500
Jun.

897
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,780
Yesterday, you and the princess went to

898
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,740
the Nameless Art Gallery to find the sky-connecting conch.

899
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,600
Did you find it?

900
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,530
No.

901
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,100
Shopkeeper Li said

902
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,160
he doesn't know when it went missing.

903
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:20,500
I knew it.

904
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,350
I knew it.

905
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,340
What do you mean?

906
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,540
Hai said that in the karst cave,

907
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,530
he saw an owl

908
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,760
and heard the howling of a wolf.

909
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,390
We searched maps and documents

910
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,420
and found this place.

911
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,780
You can see wolf packs

912
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,970
and owls there.

913
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,870
There are only three places like that around Jiuxiao City.

914
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,510
Mount Qingfeng,

915
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,680
Mount Yuetian,

916
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:45,840
and

917
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,360
Marquis Xian's Western Suburbs' Hunting Grounds.

918
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,480
Western Suburbs' Hunting...

919
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,860
No wonder you asked me

920
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,660
to lose Heyin.

921
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,970
So you suspect Uncle Xian?

922
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,800
Although Uncle Xian is eccentric,

923
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,410
he's not a bad guy.

924
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,300
He hasn't done

925
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,220
anything evil.

926
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,750
In Jun's eyes,

927
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,380
there are no bad guys.

928
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,240
Would he tell you

929
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,680
that he did somethng evil?

930
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,410
Prince Jun.

931
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,930
I'll cut to the chase.

932
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,500
Have you been to the Western Suburbs' Hunting Grounds?

933
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,100
Yes.

934
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,820
The palace holds an autumn hunt

935
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,580
every year.

936
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,370
I was forced to go.

937
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,950
But I can't bear to see small animals

938
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,950
being killed,

939
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,320
so I go only very rarely.

940
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,200
Do you want me to bring you

941
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,860
to the Western Suburbs' Hunting Grounds

942
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,120
to find the karst cave?

943
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,060
Yes.

944
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,310
But...

945
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,120
The royal hunting grounds are heavily guarded.

946
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,070
Han Zheng

947
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,500
and the general are highly skilled,

948
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
so they can fly in.

949
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,660
But since they are

950
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,390
not familiar with the terrain,

951
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,130
it'll be hard to find the cave.

952
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,220
Marquis Xian is my uncle.

953
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,750
Although we're not related by blood,

954
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,100
he is still my relative.

955
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,880
Aren't you afraid that I'll tell him?

956
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,310
Impossible.

957
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,070
This case concerns hundreds of lives.

958
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,840
Jun is not someone

959
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,580
who can't tell right from wrong.

960
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,240
Prince Jun.

961
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,610
In the beginning,

962
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,940
I was worried about you.

963
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,370
But Han Zheng and Jiu'er told me

964
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,930
you are not a person who doesn't know right from wrong

965
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,050
and only cares about blood relations.

966
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,650
They told me to rest assured.

967
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,720
Even Brother Han trusts me.

968
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,210
If you let me down,

969
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,070
I'll beat you up.

970
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:31,620
Okay.

971
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:33,940
But

972
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,140
if I tell my uncle I'm going

973
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,520
to the Western Suburbs' Hunting Grounds,

974
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,250
he will definitely suspect me.

975
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,020
Because I am definitely not

976
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,840
the kind of person

977
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,440
who goes there voluntarily.

978
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,860
What should we do?

979
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,900
There is someone

980
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,650
who might bring us there.

981
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,190
Eldest Brother,

982
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,940
if you are tired,

983
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,060
rest a while longer.

984
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,720
Don't push yourself too hard.

985
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,170
Jun.

986
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,840
When did you come in?

987
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,480
Just now.

988
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,810
You looked tired,

989
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,930
so I brought you a bowl of ginger tea.

990
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,970
I have many memorials to read today.

991
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,580
Make it short.

992
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,140
I knew I couldn't hide anything from you.

993
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,070
Eldest Brother,

994
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,660
I came here

995
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,990
to complain.

996
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,150
I've spent so much time

997
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,380
with Jiu'er and Brother Han,

998
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,040
but they still don't trust me.

999
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,310
About what?

1000
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,610
They suspect the incident with the Starry Night

1001
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,520
was made to look like a siren's doing

1002
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,980
by someone who is kidnapping

1003
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,240
and harming Qi people.

1004
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,760
Really?

1005
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,410
Besides,

1006
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,900
they believe Uncle Xian is the mastermind.

1007
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,800
Do they have evidence?

1008
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,070
Not yet.

1009
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,180
But logically speaking,

1010
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,140
it's possible.

1011
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,320
Let me tell you.

1012
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,850
I feel conflicted as well.

1013
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,630
Although Uncle

1014
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,260
only cares about having fun,

1015
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,980
he's not a bad guy.

1016
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,660
He's not short of money.

1017
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,940
Why would he do that?

1018
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,890
That's why I fought with Jiu'er

1019
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,410
and Brother Han.

1020
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,390
Su Jiu'er and Prince Han

1021
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,130
work for the Inspection Bureau.

1022
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,190
It's their duty to find out the truth.

1023
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,420
It's understandable

1024
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,380
that they're suspecting Uncle.

1025
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,360
I'm afraid...

1026
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,060
I'm afraid that

1027
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,880
they will find

1028
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,230
Uncle's secret.

1029
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,390
What should we do then?

1030
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,310
Eldest Brother,

1031
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,460
if you were me,

1032
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,900
what would you do?

1033
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:06,530
I won't make any assumptions

1034
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,300
before I have hard proof.

1035
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,860
There's no one else here.

1036
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,780
Eldest Brother,

1037
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,100
tell me what you think.

1038
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,210
Are you sure there's no one else?

1039
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,920
Yes.

1040
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,110
Stop hiding.

1041
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,830
Ask them to come out.

1042
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,220
You sounded me out

1043
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,940
because you want me to help them, right?

1044
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,210
Eldest Brother.

1045
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,580
Without your orders,

1046
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,720
how would I dare let them in?

1047
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,120
Right?

1048
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:35,260
Jiu'er.

1049
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,340
Come in.

1050
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,080
Where did you come from?

1051
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,660
It seems I should change out my guards.

1052
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,060
Ah Qi.

1053
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,120
Let them in.

1054
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,240
Eldest Brother,

1055
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,400
how did you know

1056
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,600
they were outside?

1057
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,780
This isn't painted

1058
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:03,240
in your style.

1059
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,470
Also, I've never told you about

1060
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,990
this side chamber by the water.

1061
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,590
How did you find out about it?

1062
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:09,660
I...

1063
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,100
There are not many people

1064
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,220
who know about this place.

1065
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,380
General Chilan.

1066
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,240
Am I right?

1067
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,240
Your Highness, please don't fault us for being reckless.

1068
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,610
You once said that

1069
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,930
as long as there is news

1070
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,410
about the black market sale of Qi Vital Stones,

1071
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:26,810
I can come to you anytime.

1072
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,030
I don't know if that still counts.

1073
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,990
Besides sounding out

1074
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,810
my attitude towards Uncle Xian,

1075
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,910
you want me to help you

1076
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,440
enter the Western Suburbs' Hunting Grounds.

1077
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,480
Your Highness.

1078
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:42,470
We suspect that the missing people

1079
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,700
from the Starry Night

1080
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,020
are being held in a karst cave

1081
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,350
in the Western Suburbs' Hunting Grounds.

1082
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,380
However,

1083
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,580
the implications of this matter are severe.

1084
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,390
I dare not

1085
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,740
apply for a search warrant.

1086
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,760
I've heard that Your Highness

1087
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,490
is in charge of the autumn hunt,

1088
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,300
so we came up with this plan

1089
00:43:59,170 --> 00:43:59,940
hoping to receive

1090
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,140
Your Highness' help.

1091
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:03,780
Eldest Brother,

1092
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,190
you know I don't like hunting.

1093
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,590
If I tell Uncle

1094
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,420
I want to go to the hunting grounds,

1095
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,090
he'll definitely suspect something's up.

1096
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,420
We have no other choice.

1097
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,110
Please help us,

1098
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,760
Your Highness.

1099
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,380
Prince Han.

1100
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,570
We've known each other for so long,

1101
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:28,230
but this is the first time you've called me that.

1102
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,740
My manners were lacking.

1103
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,070
Please forgive me.

1104
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,120
It's exactly because

1105
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,660
I've known you for a long time,

1106
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,500
that I know

1107
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,280
you have foresight.

1108
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,150
You will never allow anyone

1109
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,970
to commit such a heinous crime

1110
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:42,730
under your watch.

1111
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:44,050
Moreover,

1112
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,030
the more closely related you are,

1113
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,890
the more impartial you should be.

1114
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,240
Because once the matter gets blown up,

1115
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,290
the implications will only get more severe.

1116
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,550
I'm sure Your Highness

1117
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,780
understands this

1118
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,130
better than I do.

1119
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,240
But what if

1120
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,590
this has nothing to do with Marquis Xian?

1121
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,090
Eldest Brother.

1122
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:05,290
What if it is related?

1123
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,480
Several hundred of people

1124
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,050
have gone missing.

1125
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,310
It's unknown if they're still alive.

1126
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,500
Until now, their families

1127
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,220
are still waiting for them to come home.

1128
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,060
Shouldn't we

1129
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,060
find out the truth

1130
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,310
and return justice

1131
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,350
to the victims as soon as possible?

1132
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,340
In order to find the truth,

1133
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,020
I won't let go of

1134
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:21,930
any lead.

1135
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,650
If we have really

1136
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,030
wronged Marquis Xian,

1137
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:30,910
you can punish me

1138
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,890
however you see fit.

1139
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,900
If it turns out we have acted unjustly,

1140
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,570
as the Prince of Qi,

1141
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,000
I promise I will give Your Highness

1142
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,860
and Marquis Xian an explanation.

1143
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,040
That's right.

1144
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,860
If we have wronged Uncle,

1145
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:45,850
I'm willing to plead guilty.
