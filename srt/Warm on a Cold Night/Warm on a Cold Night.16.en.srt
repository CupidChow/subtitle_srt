4
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,100
The old painter from Nanfeng Studio

5
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,410
who has been traveling for a long time,

6
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,370
Wei Gonglin.

7
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,300
Impossible.

8
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,979
Impossible.

9
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,660
Are you kidding me?

10
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,740
You're lying.

11
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,300
You can't say that without evidence.

12
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,160
My master

13
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,060
has been traveling for a long time.

14
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,140
How could you suspect him?

15
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,670
Exactly.

16
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,860
You are speculating without reason

17
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,660
and blackening his name.

18
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,180
Why?

19
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,729
Why would Grandmaster do that?

20
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:56,890
The bunch of you

21
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,650
killed his favorite disciple.

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,050
In order to hide the truth,

23
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,580
you even modified his painting.

24
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,980
Isn't that enough?

25
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,850
How is that possible?

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,100
Could it be true?

27
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,610
You have to have evidence.

28
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:11,620
Feng Muyuan.

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,940
If you don’t tell the truth now,

30
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,620
I'm afraid

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,600
you won't be able to live long either.

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,850
That's just an unreasonable speculation.

33
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,050
You have no evidence.

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
It might be blood,

35
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,570
but we don't know whose blood it is.

36
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,820
How can you be sure

37
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,150
this is Junior's blood?

38
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,770
It could be mine,

39
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,520
another disciple's,

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,180
or a maid's.

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,870
Master couldn't bear

42
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,090
to let the painting go to waste,

43
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,560
so he painted a few extra strokes on it.

44
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,480
It cannot prove

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,180
the painting immortal doesn't exist.

46
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,630
Maybe

47
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,780
that's the painting immortal's blood.

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,230
Master

49
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,770
has been traveling for a long time.

50
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,430
I'm just following his orders

51
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,210
to help Junior sell paintings.

52
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,880
My seniors used the Qi Vital Stone

53
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,010
to paint and do evil,

54
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,090
so the painting immortal punished them.

55
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,690
But I have a clear conscience.

56
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,550
I still believe

57
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,720
this is a painting of the immortal's arrival.

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,700
I also believe

59
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,830
she will bless me.

60
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,080
Yes.

61
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,850
That inspector

62
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,340
was just making a blind guess.

63
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,480
But he really made the fisherman

64
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,230
disappear.

65
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,360
What's the use?

66
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,960
We have a painting immortal in our studio

67
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,690
not just because of that one painting.

68
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,260
So many of us

69
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,390
are indebted to her.

70
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,810
That couldn't all be fake, could it?

71
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,620
You're right.

72
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,240
I didn't mean to ditch you.

73
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,860
Why did you ignore me?

74
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:41,800
Tell me.

75
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,130
What case do you want me to help you with now?

76
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,350
Don't say that.

77
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,660
I want to give you a point

78
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,260
for your performance just now.

79
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:49,810
No need.

80
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,280
You don't want points?

81
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,710
I don't have evidence,

82
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,420
so I haven't taken the lead yet.

83
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,770
I just wanted to trick him,

84
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,500
but I failed.

85
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,670
That's why

86
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,940
you need me.

87
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,330
Am I not the grandmaster

88
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,520
of playing tricks?

89
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,920
You should have done this just now.

90
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,140
The two of us should work together

91
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,620
and back each other up.

You always say that I need you.

94
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,930
But have you ever thought about

95
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,730
what I need from you as a partner?

98

do your best.

Your Highness.

102

Why are you running so fast?

103
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,409

104
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,130

[Nanfeng Studio]

106
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,490
I shouldn't have suggested

107
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,530
making a bet.

108
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,280
I wanted to prove that

109
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,510
I am a worthy partner,

110
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,020
but I scared him away.

111
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,190
I'm even pushing him further and further away.

112
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,110
Father,

113
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,790
have you ever

114
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,150
written anything about

115
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,870
how to tame a partner?

116
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,510
Where are you going?

117
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,510
Shouldn't you

118
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,400
be guarding Painter Feng right now?

119
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,250
You should thank

your good partner, the prince.

121

We couldn't stand it, so we came out for some fresh air.

You were kicked out?

127
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,300
You came out

128
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,450
because they told you so?

129
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:23,960
Lass.

130
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,670
If you aren't bothered, you take the night watch instead.

131
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,540
Fine.

132
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,050

Lass,

this is Hu's water bag.

137
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,810
You don't usually take the night watch.

138
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,740
You'll need it when you need water.

139
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,840
You've always been incompetent.

140
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,990
Today, without us around,

141
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,030
I'll see you'll do when you get in trouble.

142
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,480
What are you murmuring about?

143
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,460
None of your business.

144
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,230
Let's go.

145
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,210
What is this?

146
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,490
You made this?

147
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,660
It's useful.

148
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,290
You're always causing trouble.

149
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,490
Look at them.

150
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,660
We can't let anything happen to

151
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,390
Feng Muyuan.

152
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,080
Yes.

153
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,530
Looks like we need to be more vigilant.

154
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,740
I wonder when Han Zheng

155
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,970
will come back.

156
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,850
It's my fault.

157
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,580
I keep wanting to control him.

158
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,460
I always tell him

159
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,100
nonsense.

160
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,380
That's because

161
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,500
I'm too weak.

162
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,230
You always say

163
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,120
you'll abandon me if I'm useless.

164
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,540
If I don't play tricks on you,

165
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
what can I rely on?

166
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,900
I'm just a weak Qian.

167
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,280
If I don't do that,

168
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,310
how can I keep you aroud?

169
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,370
Painter Feng?

170
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,430
Inspector Su?

171
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,480
Didn't I tell you all to go back?

172
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,570
I'm still a little worried.

173
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,220
I wouldn't be able to sleep well even if I went back.

174
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,150
But don't worry.

175
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,290
I'll leave soon.

176
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,380
I won't bother you.

177
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,080
I've thought about it.

178
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,050
You're just doing your job.

179
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,500
You're not trying to smear Nanfeng Studio.

180
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,560
I was really angry,

181
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,140
but I didn't really mean to kick you all out.

182
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,480
Seeing that you are still here,

183
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,940
I feel much more relieved.

184
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,750
When you get the chance,

185
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,340
please thank your partner

186
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,730
for his diligence

187
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,010
in the investigation.

188
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,420
It's our duty.

189
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,500
By the way,

190
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,040
where's your partner?

191
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,430
Did he leave you

192
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,180
here alone?

193
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,240
He...

194
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,420
Of course not.

195
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,860
How could he?

196
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,190
Of course.

197
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,400
How could he?

198
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,430
He won't leave you

199
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,430
here alone.

200
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,190
Something feels off.

201
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,620
I don't think he's

202
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,800
talking to me.

203
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,340
But

204
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,900
His Highness really left me here

205
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,900
alone.

206
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,030
The bell rang.

207
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,909
Someone fell into my trap.

208
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,360
M- Master.

209
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,850
Why did you come back?

210
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
The authorities have already found out

211
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,740
about Junior.

212
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,220
Soon,

213
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,710
they'll find out

214
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,400
you're connected to the case.

215
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,910
But they

216
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,340
don't have evidence yet.

217
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,630
There's nothing they can do to me either.

218
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,310
You'd better run away now.

219
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,080
It's you?

220
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,280
How was it?

221
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
All is fair in war.

222
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,320
You weren't vigilant enough.

223
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,090
Guards!

224
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,860
The murderer has fallen into the trap.

225
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,740
Great! Catch him!

226
00:09:59,380 --> 00:09:59,940
Brother Han.

227
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,270
What happened just now?

228
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,530
The lass' bell

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,460
must have caught someone.

230
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,390
Where is she?

231
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,150
She ran away.

232
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,840
She followed that shadow.

233
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,460
You mean the person

234
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,610
who flew out just now

235
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,970
was Su Jiu'er?

236
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,020
Are you surprised?

237
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,940
I am, too.

238
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,260
Uncle Hu, keep an eye on him.

239
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,260
I'll go after her.

240
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,830
Don't worry.

241
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,770
Leave him to me.

242
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,490
Stop!

243
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,980
Stop!

244
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,200
Stop!

245
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,840
You lass.

246
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,700
You couldn't trick me into helping you,

247
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,980
so you secretly used the Qi Vital Stone.

248
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,780
Are you crazy?

249
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,810
Qi Vital Stone?

250
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,220
I really don't know what happened.

251
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,140
Since I made a mistake,

252
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,590
you can scold me however you want later.

253
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,060
But right now,

254
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,520
we mustn't let him escape!

255
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,280
Who are you?

256
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:46,990
Stop!

257
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,270
Stop!

258
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,030
Stop!

259
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,590
Over there!

260
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,870
This way!

261
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,060
Stop!

262
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,700
Where is he?

263
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,230
Up there!

264
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,520
Su Jiu'er!

265
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,670
Stop! Stop!

266
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,620
Stop!

267
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,050
Wei Gonglin is over 50,

268
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,650
but his stamina is this good.

269
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,860
Did he use the Qi Vital Stone too?

270
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,020
Or

271
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,280
is this person a Qi?

272
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,900
Han Zheng!

273
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,140
Let's surround him

274
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,180
and take him down!

275
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,290
Three scars.

276
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
It seems I have really become

277
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,420
a master of martial arts.

278
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:36,820
Stop!

279
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,600
You have nowhere left to run.

280
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,480
Who are you?

281
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,180
Su Jiu'er, are you crazy?

282
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,150
I'm finally not a good-for-nothing.

283
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,880
Don't worry.

284
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,570
I promised you I'll catch him,

285
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,350
so I will definitely catch him!

286
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,260
This...

287
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,840
What's going on?

288
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:25,730
What happened?

289
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,920
Wasn't I in the sky?

290
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:35,690
Xu Youdao.

291
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,370
Wang Jirong.

292
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,630
Lin Zhixing.

293
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,420
Help.

294
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,680
Am I seeing ghosts

295
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,180
or

296
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,900
am I dreaming?

297
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,430
I...

298
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,570
Meng Huaiyun.

299
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,240
Meng Huaiyun.

300
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,640
Meng Huaiyun.

301
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,680
Why are you here?

302
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,980
Are you Meng Huaiyun?

303
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,620
Something is wrong.

304
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,210
Her pulse is normal.

305
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,820
Why are her eyes closed?

306
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,870
-Jiu'er. -Be gentle.

307
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,530
-Jiu'er, wake up! -Be gentle.

308
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,310
It's working.

309
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,780
Mother.

310
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,660
I was dreaming.

311
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,010
Why did you pinch me?

312
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,340
She pinched you so hard,

313
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,560
but you were dreaming?

314
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,550
How could you?

315
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,840
It's so early in the morning.

316
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,700
What should I do

317
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,290
if not dream?

318
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,570
Why are you guys

319
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,830
in my room?

320
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,860
You little...

321
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,520
Seriously.

322
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,380
We were so worried,

323
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,290
but you were dreaming?

324
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,350
You're heartless.

325
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,070
His Highness and Young Master Han

326
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,800
worried about you for nothing!

327
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,640
Physician Qin.

328
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,850
Are you alright, Jiu'er?

329
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,820
I'm fine.

330
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,400
Mother.

331
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,630
What's happening?

332
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,100
Have you forgotten

333
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,460
what you did last night?

334
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,550
What did I do?

335
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,610
I...

336
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,270
Last night, I...

337
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,210
I was on night watch...

338
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,340
That's right!

339
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,630
Wasn't I at Nanfeng Studio?

340
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,820
How did I get home?

341
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,580
You don't remember anything?

342
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,060
Lass.

343
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,780
Why don't you remember anything?

344
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,860
Do you remember last night,

345
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,340
you jumped three feet into the air?

346
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,270
You sped around,

347
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,100
trying to catch the murderer all by yourself.

348
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,760
You don't remember anything?

349
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,210
Hu, don't lie to me.

350
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,820
I'm not that capable.

351
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,820
Speeding around?

352
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,440
I can't even stand properly.

353
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,480
Jiu'er.

354
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,220
Do you remember

355
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,540
why you used

356
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,630
the Qi Vital Stone?

357
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,260
What?

358
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,910
Qi Vital Stone?

359
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,099
Help!

360
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,250
Help!

361
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:28,820
Help me!

362
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,540
Come on.

363
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:43,720
Time to eat.

364
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,110
Two handsome men are in front of you.

365
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,520
Why are you looking down?

366
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,210
Come on.

367
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,980
The foods today are all medicinal.

368
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,880
They're good for your health.

369
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,610
Eat more.

370
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,210
Hurry up.

371
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,110
Hurry up.

372
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,020
You guys eat first.

373
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,100
I have another dish.

374
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,820
Eat first.

375
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,290
We'll wait for you.

376
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:11,950
Don't wait.

377
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,680
It's things like chicken stew with ephedra,

378
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,180
braised fish with silar,

379
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,610
and tofu stew with forsythia again.

380
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,120
What?

381
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,620
Still not satisfied?

382
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,930
Suit yourself.

383
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Your Highnesses,

384
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,300
I've been eating

385
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,900
these dishes for over ten years.

386
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,080
I've never gotten tired of them.

387
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,960
How about this?

388
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,520
Let's not wait to drink.

389
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,630
Come on.

390
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,260
There are no rules of superiority in the martial arts world.

391
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,060
From today on,

392
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,440
after drinking this wine

393
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,140
and eating this medicinal meal,

394
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,020
we'll be the best of friends,

395
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,490
nothing less.

396
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,040
Cheers!

397
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,540
Come on, Your Highnesses.

398
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,270
Let's drink.

399
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,810
He was always at Nanfeng Studio.

400
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,300
He never left.

401
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,620
He even saved me despite what happened between us.

402
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,220
Forget it.

403
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,380
Why do I

404
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,500
keep trying to prove I am smarter

405
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,580
than this lass?

406
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,690
Jiu'er.

407
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,460
Here.

408
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:04,740
Eat this.

409
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,110
Thank you, Your Highness.

410
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,010
You're so sweet.

411
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,890
This was a blessing in disguise.

412
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,110
I got to experience the effects

413
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,310
of the Qi Vital Stone.

414
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,060
Do you want to try it again?

415
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,620
No, I dare not.

416
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,050
That's not what I meant.

417
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,770
It's just that I finally understand

418
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,540
why you hate people

419
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,510
who use the Qi Vital Stone so much.

420
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,950
The Qi Vital Stone is so powerful.

421
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,540
The Qi must be very weak

422
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,420
now that you've lost it.

423
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,540
Forget it.

424
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,290
If you told me earlier,

425
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,140
you wouldn't have

426
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,270
made the bet with me.

427
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,840
How about

428
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,390
we call it off?

429
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,940
No.

430
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,310
We have to continue.

431
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,720
Otherwise,

432
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,830
you wouldn't have done your best.

433
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,730
I wouldn't have noticed your capabilities

434
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,130
because of this, either.

435
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,220
However,

436
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,110
in the future, just tell me

437
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,120
what you want to investigate.

438
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,970
Sickly girl,

439
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,440
you can't do anything without me.

440
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,000
That's right.

441
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,600
I can't do anything without you.

442
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,060
I can't get anything done.

443
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,780
If you had figured it out earlier,

444
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,980
would we have fought?

445
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,360
Do you mean it?

446
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,140
Of course.

447
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,310
I...

448
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,310
Really...

449
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,380
I mean it.

450
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,790
Forget it.

451
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,190
As a Qi,

452
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,160
how can I

453
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,310
keep haggling

454
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,340
with a delicate Qian woman like you?

455
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,170
You can't say that.

456
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,000
I want to

457
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,110
be useful too.

458
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,830
It's just that I was born weak

459
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,940
and helpless.

460
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,410
There's nothing I can do about it.

461
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,350
But you eat a lot.

462
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,210
Look at you.

463
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,850
You only got a little powerful,

464
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,650
but you were about to risk your life.

465
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,450
Don't do silly things like this again.

466
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,310
With me around,

467
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,100
you won't have to

468
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
charge the enemy lines personally.

469
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,880
So,

470
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,340
what should I do next?

471
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,080
Get up early tomorrow

472
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,150
and interrogate Feng Muyuan for me.

473
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,180
Yesterday, when you were

474
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,910
abusing the power of the Qi Vital Stone,

475
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,010
I tricked something

476
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:19,910
out of him.

477
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,190
It's just as we thought.

478
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,470
He already knew

479
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,500
the murderer

480
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,850
was probably Wei Gonglin.

481
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,800
He refused to tell us

482
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,660
because he wanted to protect him.

483
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,800
Wei Gonglin wants to kill him,

484
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,880
but he still wants to protect him?

485
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,100
So,

486
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,090
Inspector Su,

487
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,310
it's your turn.

488
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,400
Take it.

489
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,480
This is mine, right?

490
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,550
It's for you.

491
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,030
Bye.

492
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,450
Take care.

493
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,510
You look cute

494
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,140
when you're talking nicely.

495
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,770
Painter Feng,

496
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,960
we're here today

497
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,740
to confirm with you again

498
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,270
that you really do not know

499
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,600
who it was that wanted to kill you that day.

500
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,820
Young Master Han.

501
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,680
Didn't you already know?

502
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,440
Are you talking about

503
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,400
you stalling for time for your master

504
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,740
in exchange for him sparing your life?

505
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,770
Although

506
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,800
your acting was sincere,

507
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,540
I think

508
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:33,970
there's another

509
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,170
possible explanation for this matter.

510
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,300
All along,

511
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,840
you have been your master's accomplice.

512
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,160
You don't have to tell me,

513
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,720
but we can already

514
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,820
arrest you

515
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,090
for being an accomplice.

516
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,080
Not bad.

517
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,160
You've learned 30 percent

518
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,070
of my skills in deception.

519
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,400
It's 70 percent.

520
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,060
Painter Feng,

521
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,620
I saved you yesterday.

522
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,960
Although it was rather chaotic,

523
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,590
I saw it very clearly.

524
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,510
That mysterious man

525
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,900
was left-handed.

526
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,340
He held a knife

527
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,600
and could scale walls,

528
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,990
so my partner and I

529
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,300
couldn't catch him.

530
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,230
You mean...

531
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,140
Painter Feng.

532
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,580
You're a painter.

533
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,970
I've seen all your paintings.

534
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,270
You are

535
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,750
someone with ambition.

536
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,270
Although

537
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,600
your master

538
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,860
has never praised you,

539
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,060
you didn't take to

540
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,540
painting with the Qi Vitality Stone

541
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,940
like your three seniors.

542
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,230
What does this mean?

543
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,120
It means you're righteous at heart,

544
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,450
and you believe in justice.

545
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,050
Am I right?

546
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,010
Why are you saying this?

547
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,590
Your master came here

548
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,020
using the Qi Vitality Stone.

549
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,680
Otherwise,

550
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,010
he couldn't possibly have escaped

551
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,270
from my partner and me.

552
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,590
You want to protect him,

553
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,720
negotiate with him,

554
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,660
and you want him to be

555
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,520
at least a little bit reasonable.

556
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
But Painter Feng,

557
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
I want to tell you,

558
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,520
with all my sincerity,

559
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:14,640
that I hope

560
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:15,940
you will

561
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,030
protect yourself.

562
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,900
Don't rely on someone who

563
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,820
made use of the Qi Vitality Stone to commit crimes

564
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,280
to uphold justice for you.

565
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,840
He is no different

566
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,830
from your three seniors.

567
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,280
I don't know why,

568
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,100
but it's amazing.

569
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,100
You don't know anything.

570
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,380
Fine.

571
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,110
I'll tell you.

572
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,260
All of this started

573
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,120
with just a coincidence.

574
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,820
In Nanfeng Studio,

575
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,360
my seniors were

576
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,110
Master's favorite disciples.

577
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,170
When Junior showed up, however,

578
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,640
everything changed.

579
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,800
Extraordinary...

580
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,710
Junior was very diligent

581
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,220
and extraordinarily talented.

582
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,210
Even when she had first gotten here,

583
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,300
she was already

584
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,030
outshining everyone else.

585
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,600
Maybe my seniors were envious,

586
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,220
or maybe they were jealous.

587
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,340
At some point,

588
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,320
they found a way

589
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,560
to surpass Junior.

590
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,230
You mean

591
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,140
they started

592
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,500
painting with the Qi Vitality Stone

593
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,150
because of

594
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,000
Meng Huaiyun?

595
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:04,860
Liu Fu.

596
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,230
It tallies.

597
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,020
From the 28th year of the Dingkun reign,

598
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,620
Xu Youdao,

599
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,240
Wang Jirong, and Lin Zhixing

600
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,370
started to have two painting styles.

601
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,300
What is the coincidence

602
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,850
you mentioned?

603
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,510
At that time,

604
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,630
the painting immortal didn't exist.

605
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,710
The "Painting of a Snow Night in Jiuxiao City"

606
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,760
[Painting of a Snow Night in Jiuxiao City]

607
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,490
still hung in the guest hall.

608
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,230
On New Year's Eve that year,

609
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,860
I wanted to copy Junior's painting

610
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,490
to learn her painting skills.

611
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,730
But in the middle of the night,

612
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,530
my three seniors suddenly came.

613
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,710
I was afraid they would laugh at me,

614
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,860
so I hid.

615
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,410
That's strange

616
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,900
I saw

617
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,100
someone passing by.

618
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,940
Eldest Senior.

619
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,860
You're drunk.

620
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,950
It's impossible.

621
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,940
How can you talk to Eldest Senior like that?

622
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,470
No.

623
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,060
Could Eldest Senior be drunk?

624
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,470
Eldest Senior has far-seeing eyes.

625
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,260
Come on.

626
00:26:59,290 --> 00:26:59,620
Hush.

627
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,850
How dare you.

628
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Lower your voice.

629
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,400
What are you afraid of?

630
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,800
Today is New Year's Eve.

631
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,420
Those ungrateful people from Nanfeng Studio

632
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,220
have all gone home to celebrate.

633
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,420
Only the three of us

634
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,670
who have no parents

635
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,430
are still here.

636
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,760
Who else could there be?

637
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:17,960
Is anyone there?

638
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,920
No, no.

639
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:21,680
Come on.

640
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,190
Let's drink!

641
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,580
Pour it for me.

642
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,190
Junior.

643
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,980
You're here to paint again.

644
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,580
Junior.

645
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,720
Unfortunately,

646
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,270
the other person in the Studio who also had no parents

647
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,110
was Junior.

648
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,220
Come here.

649
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,680
Just in time.

650
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,130
Come on.

651
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,190
Junior, come here.

652
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,620
Let me teach you how to drink.

653
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,640
You never talk.

654
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,880
Why are you so arrogant?

655
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,680
Drink it.

656
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,030
Catch her.

657
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,680
Come back!

658
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,100
You're going to drink even if you don't want to.

659
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,300
Aren't you arrogant?

660
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,640
I'll let you have a taste of the Qi Vitality Stone Wine.

661
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,930
Where are you going?

662
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,810
She's dead.

663
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,270
I drank the Qi Vitality Stone,

664
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,630
so I was too strong.

665
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,210
Oh no. Look.

666
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,240
This is Master's painting.

667
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,910
What should we do?

668
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,140
What should we do?

669
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,000
Junior.

670
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,520
You must have been hiding for a long time.

671
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,670
So this is the truth?

672
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,910
Seniors didn't do it on purpose.

673
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,540
But in order to protect themselves,

674
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,690
they took advantage of the fact that

675
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,550
there were few people around on New Year's Eve

676
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,060
to dispose of her body.

677
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,870
Then, they made up rumors about the painting immortal

678
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,090
in case someone asked questions

679
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,100
about the damage

680
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,590
to Master's masterpiece.

681
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,730
You know such a big secret.

682
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,150
Why didn't they kill you?

683
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,570
Maybe they were afraid that

684
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,040
another missing person would be too obvious,

685
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,470
so they didn't kill me.

686
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,680
Soon after,

687
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,770
I asked to study abroad in the far east.

688
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,540
I was there for two years.

689
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,870
Two years later,

690
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,100
they seemed to think

691
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,230
things had settled.

692
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,060
We didn't talk

693
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,310
about the past.

694
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,080
I thought the matter wasn't significant

695
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,410
and had long blown over.

696
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,670
Until one day, Second Senior found out

697
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,750
the person in his painting had disappeared.

698
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,900
All three of them panicked.

699
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,650
So,

700
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,370
Xu Youdao borrowed money

701
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,570
to redeem the painting for Wang Jirong.

702
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,220
They scrutinized it,

703
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,970
but couldn't tell what had happened.

704
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,400
Instead, they thought Junior

705
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,730
was trying to kill them.

706
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,600
They didn't tell me about this.

707
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,250
It was only after you all came

708
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,250
that I found out this had happened

709
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,910
to Second Senior's painting.

710
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,600
But once Xu Youdao died,

711
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,350
you and Lin Zhixing knew

712
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,710
someone was trying to avenge your junior.

713
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,340
He had a reason not to talk.

714
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,220
Why didn't you?

715
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,460
No.

716
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,300
I went to find Third Senior,

717
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,100
but he said...

718
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,660
Why are you panicking?

719
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,860
No one knows about this

720
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,280
except you and me.

721
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,900
He's taking revenge like this

722
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,550
because

723
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,640
he has no evidence.

724
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,420
Just keep your mouth shut.

725
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,130
I'll find out who he is.

726
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,340
When that time comes,

727
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,670
we'll see

728
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,520
who kills who.

729
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:05,940
By the way,

730
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,350
don't you think Master has been

731
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,910
traveling for far too long?

732
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,840
The truth

733
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,270
is exactly as

734
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,670
Brother Han deduced.

735
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,140
Yes.

736
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,400
What came after

737
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,580
is what you all already know.

738
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,480
When Senior Lin died,

739
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,740
I knew I'd be Master's

740
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,580
next target.

741
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,100
But I believe

742
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,810
Master only means to punish me.

743
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,530
He wouldn't kill me.

744
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,070
I didn't kill Junior,

745
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,730
and I have always regretted

746
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,950
my cowardice.

747
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,340
So you've been

748
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,500
kneeling in front of the painting immortal

749
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,840
to beg him to spare you?

750
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,150
Don't worry.

751
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,660
With your testimony,

752
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,310
we can now issue an arrest warrant

753
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,710
to take him into custody.

754
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,030
You're safe now.

755
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,640
[Arrest]

756
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,730
Wei Gonglin?

757
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,680
Isn't this the famous painter?

758
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,760
Why are they arresting him?

759
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,060
I heard it has something to do

760
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,570
with the horrible case at the Lantern Festival.

761
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,080
What?

762
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:43,540
All done?

763
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,520
Yes.

764
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,350
They have been pasted on all the streets.

765
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:46,740
Dali.

766
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,060
Folks!

767
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,460
This man is a major criminal. The whole city is to be vigilant.

768
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,720
Those who report to the authorities with tips

769
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,180
will be greatly rewarded.

770
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,080
Hasn't the truth come to light?

771
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,660
Why are you

772
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,520
still worried?

773
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,380
Jun.

774
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,820
Listen up.

775
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,240
There isn't a body.

776
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,460
Everything rests on

777
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,190
Feng Muyan's testimony alone.

778
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,320
We can’t believe

779
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,030
everything he said.

780
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:17,910
It's just that

781
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,300
he insists it's the truth.

782
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,030
We can only take his word for it.

783
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,470
The most important thing now

784
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,920
is to find Wei Gonglin

785
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,350
and see if there'll be a turn of events.

786
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,900
You don't believe him?

787
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm not sure either.

788
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,400
But I feel

789
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,110
something is wrong.

790
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,720
I think it's a bit lamentable.

791
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,180
Why?

792
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,060
Look.

793
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,580
Master Wei

794
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,680
is a famous master.

795
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,060
His genius in painting is almost divine.

796
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,980
He went this far

797
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,010
for his disciple.

798
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,170
Do you think he cherishes talent and

799
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,220
loves painting,

800
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,000
or hates them

801
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,220
for ruining his work?

802
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,300
I know who to ask now!

803
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:00,700
Who?

804
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,340
Jun.

805
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,720
Clean these up.

806
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,560
Don't waste them.

807
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,090
Let's go!

808
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,800
Where are we going?

809
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:10,600
Your Highness.

810
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,650
What do you mean?

811
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,030
I can't accept it.

812
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,350
It's okay.

813
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,380
This was all my idea.

814
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,630
Thanks to

815
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,560
your help,

816
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,560
we solved the case successfully.

817
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,710
You contributed a lot.

818
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,870
So I prepared

819
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,940
some delicious food

820
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,420
to express

821
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,280
our gratitude.

822
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,360
Don't you think

823
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,510
Jiu'er is usually slow,

824
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:32,860
but at critical moments,

825
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,060
she's very eloquent?

826
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,020
Keep watching.

827
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,110
She's about to start

828
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,100
talking glibly

829
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,300
to make him happy.

830
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,100
How do you know?

831
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:45,310
Because

832
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,070
I've been through this before.

833
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:49,270
I think you're here

834
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,300
not just

835
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,520
to treat me to dinner.

836
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,969
You are wise.

837
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,340
You can tell at a glance

838
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,610
what we want to do.

839
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,530
No.

840
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,100
I'm very glad

841
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,580
you think highly of me.

842
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,840
Ask me anything.

843
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,990
I'll tell you everything I know.

844
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,220
Actually, we came here today

845
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,550
to ask you

846
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,490
which disciple

847
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,740
Wei Gonglin liked the most.

848
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,210
What?

849
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,810
The arrest warrant has been issued,

850
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,170
but you're still suspicious of his motive?

851
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,260
You are

852
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,480
very well-informed.

853
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,240
However,

854
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,800
I can

855
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,100
understand this.

856
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,520
Wei Gonglin has always been fair.

857
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,830
After Meng Huaiyun became his disciple,

858
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,320
it is true

859
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,680
he favored her the most.

860
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,610
I think it must be

861
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,030
because she was

862
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,210
a talented female disciple.

863
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,460
Is that true?

864
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,190
I have another question

865
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,010
to ask you.

866
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,010
Go ahead.

867
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,150
Did Wei Gonglin love Meng Huayuan

868
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,850
as a young disciple,

869
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,460
or as a woman?

870
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,010
Inspector Su,

871
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,830
why are you asking something like this?

872
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,380
What's wrong with this?

873
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,060
I just want to know

874
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,290
who was the person who redeemed

875
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,460
Meng Huaiyun's painting.

876
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,810
If the master murdered them

877
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,830
to take revenge,

878
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,140
why would he help her

879
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,120
redeem all the paintings?

880
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,770
Wouldn't it be better to leave them here

881
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,430
and let them be immortalized?

882
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,380
Exactly.

883
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,850
Which is it then?

884
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,130
Mr. Li.

885
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,430
Can't you just say it?

886
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,100
Inspector Su,

887
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,610
we get along well.

888
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:43,960
I'll only tell you

889
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,010
about this.

890
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,560
Treat it like a little puzzle.

891
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,100
Let me test you.

892
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,670
Why are you talking about me?

893
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:12,880
Jiu'er.

894
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,710
What did Mr. Li say?

895
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,320
He...

896
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,740
He told me

897
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,750
the love Wei Gonglin had for Meng Huaiyun

898
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,700
was only that of a master

899
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,850
for a disciple.

900
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,640
He even personally

901
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,740
wrote calligraphy for her

902
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,840
and sent it to the Nameless Art Gallery.

903
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,300
Then...

904
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,410
Why did he have to say it secretly?

905
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,470
You're good at making things up.

906
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,120
Forget it.

907
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,990
I'm not going to expose you.

908
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,810
It's not the kind between you and His Highness

909
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,940
nor the kind

910
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,260
between you and your friend.

911
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,190
Mr. Li

912
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:53,990
is like that.

913
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,640
He's addicted to investigating cases.

914
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,970
He likes to play tricks.

915
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,940
There are many characters like this

916
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,200
in your books.

917
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,390
You should know.

918
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,120
Right?

919
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,740
That's good.

920
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,780
Why are you curious

921
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,460
about this?

922
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,130
You were the one who reminded me.

923
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,990
The love a master has for his disciple

924
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:11,850
is a great love.

925
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,920
If he really wanted revenge,

926
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,330
he didn't have to redeem the paintings.

927
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,430
That would only give himself away.

928
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,450
Lin Zhixing suspected

929
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,060
the person

930
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,060
who took Meng Huaiyun's paintings.

931
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,020
He seemed to have some sort of

932
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,860
extreme protectiveness and possessiveness

933
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,000
towards the one who got away.

934
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,190
So you wanted to confirm

935
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,980
if Wei Gonglin had special feelings

936
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,190
for Meng Huaiyun?

937
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:39,850
Yes.

938
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,190
If this was

939
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,190
his motive,

940
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,910
the murderer

941
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,180
would be Wei Gonglin.

942
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,240
But Mr. Li just said

943
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,510
Wei Gonglin

944
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,870
loves himself the most.

945
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,380
He favored the junior

946
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,040
because he wanted the best

947
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,430
for Nanfeng Studio.

948
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:02,610
Maybe

949
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,690
we overlooked something.

950
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,440
Jiu'er.

951
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,410
What is our direction

952
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,020
this time?

953
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,320
Meng Huaiyun's painting.

954
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,990
Lin Zhixing died

955
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,830
because he found the murderer.

956
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,700
That means

957
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,090
the murderer is whoever

958
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,290
has those paintings.

959
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,440
Lass.

960
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,720
Maybe

961
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,260
the murderer has hidden

962
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,240
the paintings away.

963
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,580
Then, let's look for

964
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,050
the person here

965
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,220
who has such feelings

966
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,080
for the junior.

967
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,850
Let's split up.

968
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,760
Excuse me,

969
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,570
where did Meng Huaiyun

970
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,560
usually paint?

971
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,450
She often painted

972
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,510
in the storehouse.

973
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,440
The storehouse?

974
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:47,090
Thank you.

975
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,890
Su Jiu'er.

976
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,080
I'll help her with her work.

977
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,410
You like to work so much?

978
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,700
Then do mine too.

979
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,830
How did I fall asleep?

980
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:02,880
Jiu'er.

981
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,250
You're awake?

982
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,160
Let me tell you.

983
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,370
I've searched all the paintings here.

984
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:08,910
And?

985
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,710
Nothing.

986
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,140
This is strange.

987
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,660
You see, Wang Jirong,

988
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,750
Xu Youdao, and Lin Zhixing's paintings

989
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,770
from when they were children are all here.

990
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,560
But why aren't

991
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,480
Meng Huaiyun's?

992
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,050
Maybe

993
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,500
they were also taken away by the murderer.

994
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,300
If you say so,

995
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,780
the murderer

996
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,860
must really have special feelings

997
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,860
for Meng Huaiyun.

998
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,560
I knew that long ago.

999
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,250
But...

1000
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,510
Do we have no other leads?

1001
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,290
Don't move.

1002
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,320
What?

1003
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:45,700
Look over there.

1004
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:01,900
Jun.

1005
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,620
Can you tell

1006
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,740
who painted this?

1007
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:05,980
This lady

1008
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,920
looks like Painter Feng's style.

1009
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,300
But the cloud

1010
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,440
seems to be...

1011
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,000
Meng Huaiyun's!

1012
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,970
So it was really him.

1013
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,990
Painter Feng is so diligent.

1014
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,510
He never stops practicing.

1015
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,120
But for two years,

1016
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,990
he didn't produce anything.

1017
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:43,970
That was when

1018
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,660
he went abroad to study.

1019
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,940
We missed

1020
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,180
such an obvious clue.

1021
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,590
Meng Huaiyun died

1022
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,050
and the painting immortal appeared

1023
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,390
both on New Year's Eve of the 29th year of the Dingkun reign.

1024
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,170
That means

1025
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,430
he was actually

1026
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,420
studying in the far east then.

1027
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:05,650
I see.
