This is the first time you put on the make-up.

It looks nice.

Firstly,

there are fewer people during the rehearsal.

36

are in a tense situation recently.

41

You should take this as an opportunity for you to ease up on each other.

53
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,440
I can cut him some slack.

54

60

Why do you start quarreling once you meet?

74

What is this?

Yes, it is from the same shop.

77

But

78
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,940
this is a new flavor.

79
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,220
So you went out for so long

80
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,770
to buy this.

81
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,490

82
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,770
The red one is sweet.

83

triggers a chilly sensation.

85
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,080
The yellow one is a bit sour.

86
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,090

-I'll keep watch for you.
-Okay.

It's so sour.

89
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,780
I won't buy yellow ones next time.

90
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:52,880
No, no.

91
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,050
The sour ones

92
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,570
make the sweet ones taste sweeter.

00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,169
♫Jumping over the dragon gate♫

176
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,000
We will never get married again.

177
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,800
Even if we'll be lonely for a hundred years.

178
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,710
I always thought

179
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,870
Qi people have many wives and concubines.

180
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,280
It turns out that they are

181
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,910
so faithful in a relationship.

182
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,740
Of course.

183
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,260
Alright.

184
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,180
Brother Han, sit down first.

185
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,870
I heard

186
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,260
the Qi race would have the Under the Moon Festival.

187
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,760
I've heard of that too.

188
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,990
But what exactly is it?

189
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,510
The Under the Moon Festival

190
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,270
is our tradition.

191
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,760
By then, the moon

192
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,230
will be the most round and brightest

193
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,240
throughout a year in Shuobei.

194
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,460
The moon is several times larger

195
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,900
than the moon in Jiuxiao City.

196
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,770
On that day,

197
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,130
we will hold

198
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,710
a major ceremony involving the whole race.

199
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,050
Every age-appropriate Qi,

200
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,500
no matter men or women,

201
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,970
will confess their feelings

202
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,860
to the beloved ones

203
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,260
under the witness of the bright moon.

204
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,970
If they love each other,

205
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,470
it's a lifetime promise.

206
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,940
It sounds so romantic.

207
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,640
What if

208
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,000
it is a relationship between a Qian and a Qi?

209
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,810
Will they have a lifetime promise?

210
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,180
Of course.

211
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,300
I have a brother who grew up with me.

212
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,620
He is the Young Master of Cangqi.

213
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,080
He fell in love

214
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,210
with a Qian girl.

215
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,600
So he gave up everything

216
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,730
and came to the state of Qian with her.

217
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,060
Everything?

218
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,680
Including the throne?

219
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,460
Some people value power,

220
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,310
and some people value love.

221
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,180
And he is

222
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,400
a very affectionate person.

223
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,570
The throne

224
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,730
means nothing to him.

225
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,380
What's your brother's name?

226
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,740
Keyuncha.

227
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,140
Keyuncha?

228
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,420
Is he still in the state of Qian?

229
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,500
I don't know.

230
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,250
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

231
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,410
Moreover, you Qian people

232
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,420
are so unfriendly to Qi people.

233
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,660
I don't know

234
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,280
how he is now.

235
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,320
I just hope he's fine.

236
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,850
It's begun.

237
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,330
Look at Mr. Ren's figure.

238
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:04,960
Yes.

239
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,540
He's indeed the top gun.

240
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,180
Mr. Ren has a great figure.

241
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,130
Not bad.

242
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,290
He is Mr. Ren Fengyang,

243
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,800
the most popular actor

244
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,540
in Jiuxiao City.

245
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,300
Who is this?

246
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,980
He is a Qi hired by the boss

247
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,740
to be a bodyguard.

248
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:23,980
How much did it cost?

249
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,070
So mysterious.

What's wrong with Mr. Ren?

257
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,780
What's wrong?

258
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,880
What happened?

259
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,910

I-It's Shi Luqing.

265
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,820

Hurry up. What's going on?

270
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:58,980
Mr. Ren.

271
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,750
Go get a doctor.

272
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,590
Go.

273
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,180
Okay, I'll go.

274
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,700
It's too late.

275
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,340
He's not breathing anymore.

276
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,190
He's dead.

277
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,970
Go get a doctor.

278
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,070
Okay.

279
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,900
There are many exits here.

280
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,830
It's too late to block them.

281
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,500
Hurry, report to the Inspection Bureau.

282
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,020
Noted.

283
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,780
Everyone, step back.

284
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,550
It's really you.

285
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,560
It's not time yet.

286
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,340
Get back to work.

287
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,530
Everyone, step back.

288
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,360
Step back!

289
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,260
Don't destroy the scene.

290
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,890
Step back.

291
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,020
Wait for me here.

292
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,400
Don't let him escape.

293
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,890
General.

294
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,870
How long do you want to hide?

295
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,980
Everyone, step back.

296
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,980
Inspectors are on duty!

297
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,210
Step back!

298
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,910
Mr. Ren.

299
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,920
Step back further.

300
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,660
He's really dead.

301
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,050
It seems that he died from an accidental falling.

302
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,220
It wasn't an accident.

303
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,630
It was Shi Luqing's voice just now.

304
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,250
Yes.

305
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,450
Shi Luqing pushed him.

306
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,230
Did Shi Luqing come back to life?

307
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:27,980
Could it be

308
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,140
Shi Luqing has returned?

309
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:29,870
Sister Shi.

310
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:30,550
Don't come to me.

311
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,620
Please don't come to me.

312
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,580
Whether it's a human or a ghost,

313
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,420
there will always be clues.

314
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,780
I'll go upstairs and take a look.

315
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,330
Jiu'er.

316
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,420
Let me go with you.

317
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,500
It's too dangerous up there.

318
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,470
I can protect you.

319
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,740
You...

320
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,940
The ground is so rough.

321
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,580
It's impossible that he slipped himself.

322
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,640
But he was the only one

323
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,750
on the stage.

324
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:02,910
How did he

325
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,890
fall?

326
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,540
Could it be

327
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,330
really haunted?

328
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,770
As an Inspector from Inspection Bureau,

329
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,740
how could you say

330
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,580
such words?

331
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,250
Let's go downstairs.

332
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,200
You...

333
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,100
Have you made up?

334
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:35,910
No.

335
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:40,880
What's wrong?

336
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,440
What happened?

337
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,130
What...

338
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,660
What happened?

339
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,500
T-This...

340
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,220
He's dead.

341
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,570
H-How could it be?

342
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,400
Look at you.

343
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,500
You seem to know something.

344
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,590
Tell me.

345
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,200
W-What can I know?

346
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,320
How can I foresee that

347
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,280
the top gun

348
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,930
suddenly died

349
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,870
in the middle of singing?

350
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,700
After all,

351
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,180
you are also responsible for this.

352
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,100
If you hadn't disrupted

353
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,480
our ritual that day,

354
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,530
how could Shi Luqing's soul

355
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,410
have revived

356
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,610
and killed him?

357
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,460
When Shi Luqing

358
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,440
jumped off the tower and died,

359
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,270
I was not in Jiuxiao City.

360
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,740
How could the incident

361
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,840
be related to me?

362
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,130
But now that since you mentioned it,

363
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,060
you've reminded me.

364
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,710
I really have to find out

365
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,760
what happened

366
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,930
that made the actors in the theater

367
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,550
die one after another.

368
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,370
Where is that Qi bodyguard?

369
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,860
Where is he?

370
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,760
He repeatedly promised me

371
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,720
nothing would go wrong.

372
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,980
Now the top gun is dead.

373
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,440
Where did he go?

374
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Qi people

375
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:06,980
are so unreliable.

376
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,680
All they know is bragging.

377
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,170
Freeloaders.

378
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,460
Boss! Boss!

379
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,450
What are you doing? Boss.

380
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,310
-Put him down.
-Boss.

381
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,760
If you insult the Qi people again,

382
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,829
I will make you

383
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,420
unable to speak again.

384
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,440
Boss.

385
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,240
Boss Chen.

386
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,830
What's the matter with the Qi bodyguard

387
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,690
you just mentioned?

388
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,020
Well,

389
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,680
he's the Qi I found for the ritual.

390
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,110
The ritual was ruined,

391
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,130
but he still wanted to earn my money.

392
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,330
If it weren't for the haunting,

393
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,200
and no one applied for being a bodyguard,

394
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:51,930
I...

395
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,800
I wouldn't have chosen him.

396
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,320
This person is very important.

397
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,870
We just had a check.

398
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,830
From the scene,

399
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:00,850
Mr. Ren

400
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,020
did seem to lose his footing

401
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,760
or commit suicide.

402
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,060
How is that possible?

403
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,560
I've worked with him for years.

404
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,630
I've never heard him

405
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,130
talk about killing himself.

406
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,840
If so, there is another possibility.

407
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,490
If this person is very fast,

408
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,690
he can unknowingly

409
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,670
push Mr. Ren

410
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,660
from the platform

411
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,110
without leaving any trace.

412
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,670
The only person who meets all the characteristics

413
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,750
is that Qi.

414
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,220
Here is your liver platter.

415
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,300
Here.

416
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,100
Let's eat first.

417
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,640
So you are the Young Master of Cangqi

418
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,150
who ran away for love.

419
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,660
Keyuncha.

420
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,840
Miss Jiu'er.

421
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,440
How can he eat

422
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,530
with you staring at him?

423
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,800
Young Master of Cangqi,

424
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,560
you are the prime suspect

425
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,500
in this case.

426
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,700
It's okay. Have a bite first.

427
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,100
I'll interrogate you after you finish eating.

428
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,120
Alright.

429
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,620
In order to make everyone eat well,

430
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,590
I'll give an explanation first.

431
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,500
Keyuncha is not the real murderer.

432
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,470
Well...

433
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,380
What do you mean?

434
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,140
On the exorcism ritual

435
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,180
Boss Chen held that day,

436
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,860
Han Zheng and I both found

437
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,220
the Qi man who was tied up

438
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,990
had a familiar figure,

439
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,630
although he was wearing a mask.

440
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,770
He looked like Keyuncha.

441
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,200
After he had found out about the presence of Han Zheng and me,

442
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,940
he ran away.

443
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,320
That made us feel more suspicious.

444
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,520
Han Zheng entrusted me

445
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,630
to find Keyuncha.

446
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,450
But the only clue I have

447
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,360
is The Western Chamber.

448
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,880
So I came here.

449
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,320
And unexpectedly, I met him here.

450
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,230
Sorry to trouble you.

451
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,700
Why did you run away when you saw us?

452
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,800
With my current look,

453
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,420
you'll be worried when you see me.

454
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,830
You knew we were worried,

455
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,850
but you were still avoiding us.

456
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,420
If something hadn't happened today,

457
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,400
he would have escaped.

458
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,730
When Ren Fengyang died,

459
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,800
he wanted to

460
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,720
save him.

461
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,810
But it was too late.

462
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,630
Also, he didn't want to be caught by us.

463
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,750
That's why he tried to escape.

464
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,390
I see.

465
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,330
I'm sorry.

466
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,680
I got you wrong just now.

467
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,420
It's okay.

468
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,920
I'd been avoiding you before this.

469
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,280
It's reasonable for you to suspect me.

470
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,800
It seems that everyone is straightforward here.

471
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,230
Here.

472
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,380
Cheers.

473
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,240
After that, we'll be good friends.

474
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,180
Why is the tea

475
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,700
different from Qian's?

476
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,780
After drinking the tea,

477
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,390
we'll be good friends.

478
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,050
What?

479
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,700
Do you just want to be half a friend?

480
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,180
I...

481
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:57,890
Waiter.

482
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,020
Please serve a pot of plain water.

483
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,440
A pot of plain water.

484
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,560
Here, a pot of plain water.

485
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:06,910
Thank you.

486
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,430
By the way,

487
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,990
did you notice that

488
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,700
before Ren Fengyang fell,

489
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:13,820
he couldn't stand still?

490
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,650
Keyuncha and I did notice that.

491
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,420
Could it be...

492
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,910
he drank at that time?

493
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,420
But we didn't

494
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,320
smell any alcohol.

495
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,100
It's indeed without the smell of alcohol.

496
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,760
But when Ren Fengyang died,

497
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,230
I found a smell of medicine on him.

498
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,490
A smell of medicine?

499
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,380
Yes.

500
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,380
But

501
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,510
I can't tell what medicine it is.

502
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,600
All right.

503
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,890
We finally get together.

504
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,870
Let's eat first.

505
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,030
Han Zheng.

506
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:38,920
Come here and eat.

507
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,570
Their dishes

508
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,690
look not appealing,

509
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,620
but they're actually quite delicious.

510
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,300
How about this?

511
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,890
You can have a piece of meat first

512
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,650
then the cucumber strips

513
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,440
to relieve the greasy taste.

514
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,950
No, I'll just eat cucumber.

515
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,020
This is delicious.

516
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,380
Keyuncha.

517
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,370
You were the Young Master of Cangqi.

518
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,880
When you left Shuobei,

519
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:14,730
you did bring some money.

520
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,380
Why are you so...

521
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,640
You gave up the position of Young Master of Cangqi,

522
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,460
and bore all the difficulties on your own.

523
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,990
You even avoided us intentionally.

524
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,180
Are you trying to break off relations with us?

525
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,720
You know.

526
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,760
That's not what I meant.

527
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:31,410
If so,

528
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,960
go back with Chilan

529
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,770
or stay with me after this.

530
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,040
I have my own plan.

531
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,240
I won't go with you.

532
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,150
Why are you still staying here?

533
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,540
To serve those Qian people?

534
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,780
Since I had decided to leave,

535
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:44,900
and broken up

536
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,820
with my father at that time,

537
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,900
I made up my mind

538
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,800
to give up the position of Young Master of Cangqi.

539
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,450
Now my brother

540
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,370
has replaced me.

541
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,530
What is the point of me going back?

542
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,160
You...

543
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,550
The cucumber is so crispy.

544
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,410
It relives the greasy taste too.

545
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,830
Go on.

546
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,350
I can tell

547
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,280
you've had a hard time these years.

548
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,430
I suppose that woman

549
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,270
is no longer with you.

550
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,510
She has left me.

551
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,140
In that case,

552
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,670
why are you enduring all these hardships

553
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,150
in Jiuxiao City?

554
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,370
All these years,

555
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,370
your father has been thinking about you.

556
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,240
After this period,

557
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,830
go back with Chilan.

558
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,620
When you came to Jiuxiao City,

559
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,150
your father did try to stop you, right?

560
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,710
Even he couldn't stop you.

561
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,600
Why are you

562
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,360
stopping me here?

563
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,460
I just want to

564
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,520
live freely and alone.

565
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,140
Han Zheng.

566
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,740
I thought

567
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,490
you knew me the best.

568
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,210
It's fine if you don't go back with me.

569
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,990
At least let Han Zheng and I

570
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,780
keep an eye on

571
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,670
the jobs suitable for you.

572
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,820
We can feel at ease

573
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,890
after you gain a firm foothold in Jiuxiao City.

574
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,000
It's not a long-term solution

575
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,290
for you to work only in haunted places.

576
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,710
What happened in The Western Chamber

577
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,570
was quite strange.

578
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,180
I don't even dare to write such plots

579
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:21,920
in my script.

580
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,750
Do you think

581
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,610
it is really haunted?

582
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,310
I don't know whether there's a ghost.

583
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,170
But I know someone

584
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,410
has been following us.

585
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,660
Make yourself at home. Let's eat up.

586
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,890
One plays a good cop,

587
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,030
while the other plays a bad cop.

588
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,040
You do have a tacit agreement.

589
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,000
You've been standing up there

590
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,830
for so long.

591
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,910
You must be tired from standing.

592
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,580
Here.

593
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,880
Have some soup

594
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:25,640
to warm your stomach.

595
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,010
Don't be afraid.

596
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,780
Does our food

597
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,670
taste so bad?

598
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:36,650
No.

599
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,320
You scared her.

600
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:40,940
Don't be afraid.

601
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,260
Although this Qi is indifferent,

602
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,260
cruel and merciless,

603
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,410
I don't think he'll eat you.

604
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,970
You've been

605
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:53,750
following us today.

606
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,270
What is it?

607
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,070
Miss.

608
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,850
Please save me.

609
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,320
Please save me.

610
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,570
What happened?

611
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,870
Is there somebody who wants to hurt you?

612
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,220
No.

613
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,570
It's...

614
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,010
It's Sister Shi.

615
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,480
As Sister Shi has just returned,

616
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,170
Mr. Ren died.

617
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,930
I'm afraid she'll take revenge on me.

618
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,870
We checked it

619
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,850
thoroughly today.

620
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,720
Ren Fengyang

621
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,910
accidentally fell by himself.

622
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,210
It has nothing to do with Shi Luqing.

623
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:25,980
Don't be afraid.

624
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:26,990
No.

625
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,120
It's definitely not.

626
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,850
Sister Shi said

627
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,450
she wouldn't spare any of us.

628
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,990
She must have returned.

629
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,930
I don't have any relatives in Jiuxiao City.

630
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,530
I don't dare to be alone.

631
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,950
I'm scared.

632
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,270
There was a sound similar to Shi Luqing's

633
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,020
on the stage.

634
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,890
Why are you all so scared?

635
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,250
The voice is

636
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,190
not just similar to Shi Luqing's,

637
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,440
but exactly the same.

638
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,040
Yes.

639
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,170
She had taught me for a while.

640
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,050
So I remember it very clearly.

641
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,480
That's her voice.

642
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,610
Then why are you so sure

643
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,280
that she will come to take revenge on you?

644
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,660
I...

645
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,360
You don't have to tell me.

646
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,090
But if

647
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,290
I heard it right,

648
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,260
you learned operas

649
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,590
from Shi Luqing before.

650
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,870
The resurrection of Shi Luqing

651
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,360
might be

652
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,550
your doing.

653
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,910
Guess whether

654
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,850
you will be arrested

655
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,630
if I report the situation

656
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,780
to the Inspection Bureau.

657
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,260
It wasn't me.

658
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:22,960
Or

659
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,820
you prefer to say it

660
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,910
in prison of the Inspection Bureau

661
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,040
than to tell me now?

662
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,600
It wasn't me. It really wasn't me.

663
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,090
I only know a little.

664
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,110
But I really didn't do anything.

665
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,190
Get up and explain to us.

666
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,520
Don't be afraid.

667
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,790
Just tell us

668
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,950
everything you know.

669
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,070
If it

670
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:42,930
has nothing to do with you,

671
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,470
of course, he won't arrest you.

672
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,890
Fine.

673
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:46,990
I'll tell you.

674
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,230
I'll tell you everything.

675
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,740
Actually,

676
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,450
I felt guilty about Sister Shi before this.

677
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,030
The last time I saw her

678
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,700
was also the last day

679
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,530
she went to the theater.

680
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,300
After I removed Mr. Ren's makeup,

681
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,210
Sister Shi came in.

682
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,020
Sister Shi.

683
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,300
Let me do it.

684
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,490
Thank you, Mei.

685
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:31,330
Sister Shi.

686
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,110
The theater is also full of audiences today.

687
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,470
People are standing in the corridor.

688
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,600
They're all here to see you.

689
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:36,550
Not at all.

690
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,390
They're here for Mr. Ren.

691
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,460
No.

692
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,640
There are many

693
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,580
came specially for you.

694
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,880
Everyone in Jiuxiao City knows

695
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,230
that an understudy in The Western Chamber

696
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,830
sings better than a famous actress.

697
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,080
Don't say that.

698
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,860
If words get out,

699
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,190
I...

700
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,490
Sister.

701
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
I apologize for my utterance.

702
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,560
Please don't be mad at me.

703
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,730
It's okay.

704
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,630
It's not easy for an out-of-towner

705
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,780
to make a living in Jiuxiao City.

706
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,320
I'm just afraid of losing my job.

707
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,640
What are you afraid of?

708
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,580
You have a unique voice.

709
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,650
It's only a matter of time

710
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,150
for you to become a famous actress.

711
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,210
Alright, Sister.

712
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,420
Let's not talk about this.

713
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,220
Do you have time

714
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
to teach me how to sing the "Bride Moon?"

715
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,520
Yes.

716
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:25,940
Great.

717
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,220
Let's meet here

718
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,200
after dinner.

719
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,130
Okay.

720
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,170
Go.

721
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,140
Cool.

722
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:39,810
Mei.

723
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,700
Mr. Ren.

724
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,400
Tonight,

725
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,400
go and get the new costume

726
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,220
I ordered

727
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:46,780
from Yu's shop.

728
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:47,900
But...

729
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,300
The delivery day is the day after tomorrow.

730
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,020
They can't make it tonight.

731
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:52,390
When I say I need it,

732
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,370
I mean it.

733
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,680
Get it to me

734
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,570
by tomorrow.

735
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,310
Because that day wasn't the delivery day.

736
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,650
The craftsmen didn't finish it.

737
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,580
I helped them all night

738
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,750
to make head ornaments.

739
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,520
I forgot to cancel

740
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,650
the date with Sister Shi.

741
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,980
I wanted to apologize to her

742
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,300
the next day.

743
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,520
But she never showed up after that.

744
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,520
It's Sister Shi's corset.

745
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,590
Mr. Ren.

746
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,970
She's not that impressive of an actress,

747
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,380
but she's top-notch

748
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,930
at seduction.

749
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,030
I've heard

750
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,620
you get along well with her.

751
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,890
Yes.

752
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,440
Then mind your mouth.

753
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,850
For the sake of her reputation,

754
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,660
don't spread the gossip.

755
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,090
Understand?

756
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
I was scared.

757
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,470
I dared not tell anyone

758
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,360
about this.

759
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,910
Firstly,

760
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,100
it's for the sake of Sister Shi's reputation.

761
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,750
Secondly, I'm worried that Mr. Ren

762
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,320
would stop me from performing.

763
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,670
Did Shi Luqing

764
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,250
commit suicide

765
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,290
because she was assaulted sexually by Ren Fengyang?

766
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,860
I don't know.

767
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,690
But since then,

768
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,190
Sister Shi never came to the theater.

769
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,700
After a while,

770
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,970
she went to a dead end.

771
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,650
Then it must be the reason.

772
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,910
Ren Fengyang

773
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,490
was indeed a brute under a human mask.

774
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,030
And then?

775
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,070
After that, no family members

776
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,740
came to hold a funeral for Sister Shi.

777
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,310
She was buried hastily.

778
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,140
People said

779
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,640
she had become a wandering ghost.

780
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,290
If you had told her you didn't go to the theater that night,

781
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,760
it would have been nice.

782
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,410
Yes.

783
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,460
I did let her down.

784
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,540
Sister Shi was usually impassive.

785
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,840
She only talked

786
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,940
with me.

787
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,840
Everyone thought she was haughty.

788
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,800
There are many bad rumors

789
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,030
about her death.

790
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,320
But I know

791
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,390
she's not that frivolous.

792
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,970
But I dare not speak for her.

793
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,260
Anyhow, I'm a nobody.

794
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,020
Who would believe me?

795
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:27,810
If

796
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,490
as you said,

797
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,420
Shi Luqing should take revenge

798
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,820
on Ren Fengyang.

799
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,360
It has nothing to do with you.

800
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,800
But did Ren Fengyang

801
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,640
do anything unusual

802
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,790
after Shi Luqing died?

803
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,320
Not at first.

804
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,750
But the theater started to be haunted a while ago.

805
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,170
Everyone was scared.

806
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,960
Mr. Ren's reaction

807
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,170
seemed to be more overwhelming.

808
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,360
He was very bold before.

809
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,600
Now that he suddenly died,

810
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,190
I'm afraid...

811
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,670
I'm afraid I'll be the next one.

812
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,770
Sir,

813
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,030
I know Boss Chen

814
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,360
hired you to protect him.

815
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,920
Now I want to hire you for protection.

816
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,820
At least until the end of July.

817
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,260
This is all my savings.

818
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,660
I know it's not much.

819
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,250
But please make an exception.

820
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,500
I have no one to rely on

821
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,510
in Jiuxiao City anymore.

822
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:29,920
Okay.

823
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,420
Thank you.

824
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,360
Please go out for a while

825
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,730
for us to have a discussion.

826
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,030
It's the Ghost Festival now

827
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:47,900
and half a month

828
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,570
before July ends.

829
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,480
You have to stay close to her and protect her all the time.

830
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,830
This bag of coins

831
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,870
is not even enough for food.

832
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,700
But she's a girl.

833
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,760
She's pitiful

834
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,170
without anyone to rely on.

835
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,150
It's reasonable

836
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,110
for you to be such poor.

837
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,660
Also, from what I heard,

838
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,489
Mei

839
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,060
is not entirely innocent.

840
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,530
That's right.

841
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,340
I agree.

842
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,830
According to her statement,

843
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,260
a dead person is now

844
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,719
taking revenge on the other dead person.

845
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,340
She denied any involvement in the case

846
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,020
from her testimony.

847
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,510
But she was

848
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,139
so afraid.

849
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,889
This means

850
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,110
what she said

851
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,110
must be more complicated than the truth.

852
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,050
Shi Luqing taught her singing,

853
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,429
while Ren Fengyang threatened her.

854
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,940
We can't rule out her suspicion.

855
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,659
Besides,

856
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,620
she specially asked you to be her bodyguard

857
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,420
in front of us.

858
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,150
This is also very likely one of her tricks

859
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,760
to clear her name.

860
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,210
Before this,

861
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,150
apart from

862
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,060
being afraid of haunting,

863
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,960
is there anything else strange about Ren Fengyang?

864
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,860
There's nothing else

865
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,720
other than the smell of medicine.

866
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,410
Fine.

867
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,560
Since Mei is still a suspect,

868
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,910
Keyuncha should follow

869
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,250
and protect her at the same time.

870
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,890
Consider it as an assist

871
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,290
in the investigation of the Inspection Bureau.

872
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,790
As for the reward,

873
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,870
Inspection Bureau will pay for it.

874
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,400
Don't worry.

875
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,780
I will finish the job well.

876
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,270
See you.

877
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,180
I'll send Mei back first.

878
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:53,820
Thank you.

879
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,210
Thank you, everyone.

880
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:56,900
Let's go.

881
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,010
Okay.

882
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:02,980
It's late.

883
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,810
Jiu'er. Let me send you home.

884
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,550
Let's go.

885
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,210
No need.

886
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,830
We can send her off.

887
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,530
I'm afraid

888
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,990
there are too many rumors between you and Jiu'er.

889
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:13,920
If others see you again...

890
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,350
It would be better if I send her home.

891
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,550
Let me send you back.

892
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,500
Hold on.

893
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,740
How about I send you home?

894
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,000
You...

895
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,650
You send me home?

896
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,500
Yes.

897
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,670
She's so strong. She'll be fine.

898
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,220
How dare you!

899
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,270
You win.

900
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,960
Miss Jiu'er.

901
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,090
What's wrong?

902
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,560
Let me send you home.

903
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,840
You don't have to send me home.

904
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,240
I'm strong.

905
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,220
But the Gate of Hell has been wide open recently.

906
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,520
Aren't you afraid of

907
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,990
walking alone

908
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,750
and realizing

909
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,130
there are three shadows under your feet?

910
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:08,950
Well...

911
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,010
Let me send you home.

912
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,930
Let's go.

913
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,730
Jiu'er.

914
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:23,340
Let's go.

915
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,780
Brother Han.

916
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,050
Why do you insist on

917
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,940
sending me back?

918
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,610
I can chat with you

919
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,040
if I send you back. Let's go.

920
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,390
Hurry up. Stop dawdling.

921
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,690
[Qiwei Restaurant]

922
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,130
Brother Han.

923
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,430
Didn't you ask me

924
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,530
to chat with you?

925
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,400
I'm tired.

926
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,440
Brother Han.

927
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,700
Did you and Miss Jiu'er

928
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,940
pretend to be unharmonious

929
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:49,840
in front of me?

930
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,670
Have you heard of a saying?

931
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,330
If you turn a blind eye,

932
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,450
we can still be friends.

933
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,190
I'm sorry.

934
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,110
I thought the three of us

935
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,540
had been getting along for so long.

936
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,810
We're already good friends.

937
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,180
Right?

938
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,140
But I think

939
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,810
you don't

940
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,850
trust me that much.

941
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,190
It's not your fault.

942
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,990
It's my fault.

943
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,050
I don't care

944
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,680
about those rumors.

945
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,660
But Jiu'er

946
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,500
was devastated.

947
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,210
So we pretended to

948
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,030
hide it from everyone.

949
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,170
I see.

950
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,070
Thank you, Brother Han,

951
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,080
for taking care of her.

952
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,240
Let's protect

953
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,260
Miss Jiu'er together.

954
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:50,800
Do you want some candies?

955
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,520
There are so many colors.

956
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,350
Which one is tasty?

957
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,320
The yellow one is the best.

958
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,500
Yellow?

959
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,580
It's sweet in sour.

960
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,270
My residence's right ahead of us.

961
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,890
I'll send a carriage for you.

962
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,190
I've sent you back.

963
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,800
Now you're asking someone to send me home?

964
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:24,850
Do men

965
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,770
have to be that cheesy?

966
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,150
It's not cheesy.

967
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,770
It's a friendship between friends.

968
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,540
No need.

969
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:34,730
Later,

970
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,990
I have somewhere to go.

971
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:14,760
Han Zheng?

972
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,060
Do you live here?

973
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,100
It's temporary.

974
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,200
Without the pass,

975
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,460
even if you have money,

976
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,860
you still can't rent a house.

977
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,440
Pack up your things

978
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:36,370
and stay at my place.

979
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,040
Forget it.

980
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,580
You have nothing to pack.

981
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,910
Just come with me.

982
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,040
No, I'm not leaving.

983
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,390
I'm fine here.

984
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:45,980
It's been five years.

985
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,220
You don't treat me

986
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,030
as your brother anymore, do you?

987
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,820
Of course, you are my brother.

988
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,580
You, Chilan,

989
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,200
and Muyan.

990
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,500
All of you are my close friends

991
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,700
since childhood.

992
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,010
That's why

993
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,260
I want to

994
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,820
leave only the best image of a friend in your memory

995
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,040
instead of

996
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:03,710
trouble in Jiuxiao City.

997
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,180
Please take your leave.

998
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,000
I can take care of everything here.

999
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,600
I can also feel relieved in that way.

1000
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,260
Three months ago,

1001
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,690
I entered Jiuxiao City for the first time.

1002
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,440
and was accidentally locked up

1003
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,500
in the Imperial Prison.

1004
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,670
I almost caused the Qian-Qi Six Treaties

1005
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,100
to fail to proceed.

1006
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,530
Chilan came all the way

1007
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,210
to save me in Jiuxiao City.

1008
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,010
She didn't

1009
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,800
regard me as trouble.

1010
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,630
I also didn't

1011
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,670
regard myself as trouble.

1012
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,480
I think

1013
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,670
this is what we do

1014
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,280
with friends.

1015
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:52,200
Okay.

1016
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:53,630
Let me see

1017
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,840
what kind of residence

1018
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,280
the fussy Prince Han lives in.

1019
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,380
Don't be jealous of me when you see it.

1020
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,020
Come on.

1021
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:02,980
I've seen much of life.

1022
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,500
However,

1023
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,310
even if you'd lived such a miserable life,

1024
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:08,450
you didn't sell the Qi Vital Stone.

1025
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,310
I'll compliment you on that.

1026
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,240
You have guts.

1027
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,340
You're indeed my brother.

1028
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,280
Let's go.

1029
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,490
Wait, I'll take my hat.

1030
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,540
It's raining outside.

1031
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,010
Let's go.

1032
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,420
Go!

1033
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,860
Wait for me!

1034
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,100
Aren't you wearing a hat?

1035
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:32,620
Get out.

1036
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,550
The rain is too heavy. It's useless.

1037
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:34,980
By the way,

1038
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,250
did you send Mei home?

1039
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,640
Yes.

1040
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,180
She arrived safely before the rain.
