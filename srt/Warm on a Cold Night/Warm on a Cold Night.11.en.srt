[Episode 11]

4
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,000
What's wrong?

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,710
I just arranged it in ascending order.

6
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,259
Yan Blackie, Yan Blackie, Yan Kuan.

7
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:55,990
Yan Kuan!

8
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,680
Why does he hold such a grudge?

9
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,360
He saw me coming back alone.

10
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,190
Then he vented his anger

11
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,300
on us.

12
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,950
Calm down.

13
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,180
Am I not here to accompany you?

14
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,430
Why is my life so miserable?

15
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,419
I thought

16
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,720
I got a patron,

17
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,380
who can handle cases and keep me in good health.

18
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:12,980
In the end,

19
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,820
I didn't gain enough health and longevity

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,850
but I lost half of my life

21
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,400
to clean up the mess for him.

22
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,760
You will live a long life.

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,660
Girl.

25
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,370
Speaking of which,

26
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,560
the Han guy

27
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,329
treats you differently.

28
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,040
How?

29
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,360
Can't you tell that?

30
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,870
He even dared to answer Yan Kuan back

31
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,850
and yelled at him.

32
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,050
But to you, he just...

33
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,590
That's it?

34
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,960
It's all fake.

35
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,640
He's always like that.

36
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:55,940
He yells at me first,

37
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,820
then gives me

38
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,079
some little benefits.

39
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,250
When I am about to

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,370
change my mind,

41
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,910
he then makes a fool of me.

42
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,120
Girl, this is an old trick.

43
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,430
I've seen a lot.

44
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,060
Let me tell you the truth.

45
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,580
Your father also used this trick

46
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,040
when he wooed your mother.

47
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,780
Girl.

48
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,830
What's wrong?

49
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,410
Does he have a crush on you?

50
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,300
You...

51
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,240
What are you talking about, Godfather?

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,640
He is the Prince of Qi.

53
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,510
He hates Qian people the most.

54
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,480
What about you?

55
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,470
Do you like him?

56
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,300
I notice that

57
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,570
you've been mentioning him lately.

58
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,300
He is mentioned in everything.

59
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,740
I...

60
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,600
Godfather, you're overthinking.

61
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,250
I know very well.

62
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,040
We, the Qian people,

63
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,500
in their eyes,

64
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,300
are just like a little hedgehog.

65
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,350
Then why would a hedgehog

66
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,070
fall in love

67
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,590
with a big bad wolf that might eat itself?

68
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,130
Right?

69
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,990
At most,

70
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,710
I'd like to use his power

71
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,440
to become a Commander

72
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,010
like my father, who can solve many cases.

73
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,640
Forget it.

74
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,890
One can't make a success without being self-reliant.

75
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,100
Yan Kuan, just wait and see.

76
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,260
I'll clean this up.

77
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,470
Girl,

78
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,600
you are not a little hedgehog.

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,780
It's all because

80
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,680
I'm useless.

81
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,400
If I were half as capable

82
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,530
as your born father,

83
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,170
I wouldn't have let the little hedgehog

84
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,100
make a living with the big bad wolf.

85
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,029
Godfather.

86
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,589
What are you talking about?

87
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,550
Back then,

88
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,370
you protected my father.

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,990
I can find the proof for you if you don't believe me.

90
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,050
He wrote it before.

91
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,510
Here is it.

92
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,740
Here is it.

93
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,740
This's it.

94
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,820
Here.

95
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,550
Look.

96
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,140
Look.

97
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,210
Inspector Hu went straight in

98
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,450
to arrest the culprit

99
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:42,620
before he shot the poisonous arrow

100
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,220
so that the tragedy wouldn't happen.

101
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:44,659
Look.

102
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,020
Don't mention it.

103
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,350
It was nothing.

104
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,150
We were brothers. Look.

105
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,140
Here's what happened at the time.

106
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,600
Forget it.

107
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,710
Let's move on.

108
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,700
Everyone knew

109
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,280
your father was the...

110
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,490
I contributed

111
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,060
only a little help.

112
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,780
Without your father,

113
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,030
I would be a boor.

114
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,280
You are not.

115
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,580
Get back to work.

116
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,730
Let's get back to work.

117
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,240
We're going to finish the work

118
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,570
and go home early today.

119
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,340
Slow down.

120
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:14,860
I'm fine.

121
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,470
Slow down, Godfather.

122
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,290
I'm strong.

123
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:24,820
Su Jiu'er.

124
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,400
It doesn't matter to feel aggrieved.

125
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,340
You must make a good showing.

126
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,600
Live as long as you can.

127
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,980
You still have so many people

128
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,060
you want to be with.

129
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,880
This girl

130
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,670
is just like Su.

131
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,280
Father was amazing.

132
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,980
He always found clues,

133
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,750
even in complicated cases.

134
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,110
This doesn't seem to be the document.

135
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,070
It's my father's notebook.

136
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,570
Three scars.

137
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,360
This is strange.

138
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,520
How could Father draw

139
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,190
that Qi guy?

140
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,830
Oh no!

141
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,740
I spent too much today.

142
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,140
I haven't replenished my health and longevity yet.

143
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,570
I...

144
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,920
Guess who I am.

145
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,270
It's my dear Jiu'er.

146
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,380
Jiu'er,

147
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,610
I'm drawing.

148
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,990
Wait here for a while.

149
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,960
After I'm done,

150
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,220
I'll buy you Tanghulu.

151
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:25,760
Alright?

152
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,250
Okay.

153
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,310
Have a seat.

154
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:31,890
Father.

155
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,270
Who are you drawing?

156
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,990
I remember a few clues

157
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,540
that I need to draw first.

158
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,760
I'm afraid after a long time,

159
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,560
I will forget.

160
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,340
You're drawing

161
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
for the trip to Shuobei, aren't you?

162
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,370
You are indeed very smart.

163
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:00,980
Father.

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,620
Come back early this time.

165
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,020
You must catch up with the Lantern Festival this year.

166
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,150
Okay, I promise you.

167
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,360
I'll be back before the Lantern Festival.

168
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,090
Pinky swear.

169
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,470
Pinky swear.

170
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,240
Open your mouth.

171
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,240
Father, I want that.

172
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,780
I want that rabbit-shaped lantern.

173
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,140
Okay.

174
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,900
Now I have a rabbit.

175
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,730
I have a rabbit-shaped lantern.

176
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,880
Father, you're awesome!

177
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,650
Come on, this way.

178
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,480
Father!

179
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,460
Father, wake up!

180
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,680
Father!

181
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,470
Father!

182
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,790
Father!

183
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,230
Jiu'er.

184
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,320
Jiu'er.

185
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:17,780
Jiu'er.

186
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,380
Mother.

187
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,340
Come.

188
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,120
Don't move.

189
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,100
Don't move.

190
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,960
Don't move.

191
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,560
It doesn't hurt.

192
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,630
I'm fine, Mother.

193
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,340
It just hurts a little.

194
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Alright, Mother.

195
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,290
There's no need for you to stay with me.

196
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,750
Go back and have some rest.

197
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,940
I'm not tired.

198
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,560
Close your eyes.

199
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,110
Hurry, sleep well.

200
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,720
Good girl.

201
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:57,840
Dali.

202
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,830
Look at Jiu'er.

203
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,380
I thought she could achieve great success

204
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,910
after befriending the Prince of Qi.

205
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,860
But she suffered from the falling instead.

206
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,260
If the Prince of Qi didn't

207
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,180
disrespect

208
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,570
and offend Yan Blackie,

209
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,500
how could Jiu'er

210
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,180
be locked up to clean the storage?

211
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,290
What? Last night, the one who fell in the storage

212
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,340
was Jiu'er?

213
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,430
Who else do you think?

214
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,580
[Inspection Bureau]

215
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,590
Besides that,

216
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,660
I heard that her leg was broken.

217
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,690
She couldn't come to the Inspection Bureau

218
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,890
for the next few days.

219
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,030
No need to go to the Inspection Bureau recently.

220
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,240
Your godfather

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,400
will handle the file organization for you.

222
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,010
Don't try to run away.

223
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,450
The neighbors on this street

224
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,450
are all my people.

225
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,430
Girl.

226
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,190
Don't tell me you have become silly because you fell.

227
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,430
I'm fine, Mother.

228
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,140
I just...

229
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,890
dreamed of my father.

230
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:02,840
Mother.

231
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,540
I remember

232
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,010
you told me

233
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,320
my father died

234
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,340
because he caught a cold in Shuobei.

235
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,830
But I just remembered

236
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,840
there were

237
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,260
a lot of grey-black spots on him.

238
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,060
What was going on?

239
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,230
No way.

240
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,420
You got it wrong.

241
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,150
No.

242
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,910
I will never forget

243
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,520
that day when Father died.

244
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,410
What illness was Father having?

245
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,760
All right. Come on.

246
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,000
That's a common disease among the Qi people.

247
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,430
It's just that the Qian people couldn't cure it.

248
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,470
Then why do you keep telling me

249
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,930
my father caught a cold?

250
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,550
It was...

251
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,150
It was your father

252
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,360
who told me to say that before he died.

253
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,830
Why?

254
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,640
Think about it.

255
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,060
Qian and Qi had such a bad relationship back then.

256
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,120
Your father got sick from Shuobei.

257
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,580
Although he didn't infect others,

258
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,850
people with bad intentions would make speculation.

259
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,450
Besides,

260
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,190
you were sick at that time.

261
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,220
Your father

262
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,700
was afraid that you would be bullied

263
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,040
before he died.

264
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,820
But why did Father

265
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,580
contract such a strange disease?

266
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,540
I-I didn't go to Shuobei with him.

267
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,450
H-How would I know?

268
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,090
You're right.

269
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,600
Although I'm curious too,

270
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,630
Su said,

271
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,050
don't get to the bottom.

272
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,410
If Jiu'er gets suspicious,

273
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,220
she will take the risk to investigate.

274
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,180
By the way, Mother,

275
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,570
don't you have a medical manual?

276
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,620
I want to take a look.

277
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,320
You just solved a big case.

278
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,540
So now you're going through your father's old scores,

279
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,200
aren't you?

280
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,550
You seem to be

281
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,300
too excited.

282
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,840
Come on, let me give you acupuncture

283
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,880
to calm you down.

284
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,220
Let you calm down!

285
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,320
Who is it?

286
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,200
Who is it?

287
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,790
Miss Jiu'er.

288
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,020
So you really live here.

289
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,880
Your Highness.

290
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,430
Why are you here?

291
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,830
Your Highness.

292
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,820
Your Highness.

293
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,690
Sorry for being rude

294
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,320
and interrupting your conversation.

295
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,180
I'll go out now.

296
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,700
Who is this?

297
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,190
This is Prince Jun.

298
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,880
Greetings, Prince Jun.

299
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,180
Your Highness.

300
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:23,870
I don't know

301
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,890
what your preferences are.

302
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,420
So I take some from each kind.

303
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:26,820
Here.

304
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,780
Eat this.

305
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,300
Here.

306
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,080
Here, Your Highness. Please take it.

307
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,030
Let me do it.

308
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,080
Okay, you do it.

309
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,720
I'll make you some tea.

310
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:37,630
Jiu'er.

311
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,590
Su,

312
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,270
Did you bless our daughter

313
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,970
when watching this from heaven?

314
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:51,830
It's not in vain

315
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,410
that I burn incense for you every day.

316
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,240
Isn't this the backyard?

317
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,780
Nice view.

318
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,150
Let me take a look.

319
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,200
What happened to your leg?

320
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,700
I accidentally strained

321
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,920
in Inspection Bureau.

322
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,720
Not a big deal.

323
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,420
By the way, Your Highness.

324
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,460
What brings you here?

325
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,260
Here's the thing.

326
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,300
I have some clues

327
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,850
about the person you asked me to find.

328
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,230
But when I went to the Inspection Bureau,

329
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,260
they said you took a sick leave.

330
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,330
So I came to check on you.

331
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,660
You found a clue so soon?

332
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,870
How is it soon?

333
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,070
It's been a full day and night.

334
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,760
I don't want to hold you back.

335
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,180
Tell me then.

336
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,930
But I want to

337
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,830
take you there to see it in person.

338
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,080
However, your leg...

339
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,550
Your Highness, my leg is fine.

340
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,060
It doesn't matter.

341
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,620
Let's go now.

342
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,350
Miss Jiu'er.

343
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,440
How about this?

344
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,710
Take your time to recover.

345
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,810
And I'll arrange

346
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,360
for us to check it out together.

347
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,220
Your Highness.

348
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,000
Judging from what you said,

349
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,660
have you arrested

350
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,720
the three-scar Qi?

351
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,030
Miss Jiu'er, you misunderstood.

352
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,630
The clue I'm looking for is not a living person,

353
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,610
but a painting.

354
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,660
A painting?

355
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,750
This Qi guy is very strange.

356
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,000
I asked everyone in my residence

357
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,480
to inquire about it.

358
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,730
Other than the Nursery Crime Case,

359
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,660
those passersby

360
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,010
have never seen

361
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,400
a Qi with three scars on his face anymore.

362
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,490
Then,

363
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,620
I checked the Official Namelist.

364
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,380
As expected, there was no record of him.

365
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,940
In this direction,

366
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,780
I expanded the search range.

367
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,900
Then I remembered

368
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,590
there was an anomaly painting.

369
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,110
A three-scar Qi happened to be

370
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,180
on the painting.

371
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,620
Although the painter draws ghostly figures,

372
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,220
they all have their origins.

373
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,420
So I think the painting

374
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,370
has something unusual.

375
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,370
I want to take you there in a few days.

376
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,000
What are they mumbling about?

377
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,180
I can't hear them.

378
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,530
Why is the Prince

379
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,540
so haunting?

380
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,540
You scared me.

381
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,740
Why isn't there a sound

382
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,920
when you walk?

383
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,610
Who are you?

384
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,210
I'm a colleague of Su Jiu'er.

385
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,020
Just came a Prince.

386
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,490
And now,

387
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,560
came a tall and handsome colleague.

388
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,250
My daughter is not feeling well lately.

389
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,310
But her luck in love

390
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,020
is quite prosperous.

391
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,250
What brings you here?

392
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,260
I heard she got hurt.

393
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,210
Is everything okay?

394
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,010
How would I know?

395
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,720
Go in and see for yourself.

396
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,080
Go in and ask yourself.

397
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,100
Come on.

398
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,180
Jiu'er.

399
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,750
Your colleague is here.

400
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,540
Take your time.

401
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,620
W-Why are you here?

402
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,860
Isn't he here too?

403
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,420
I guess Brother Han must be like me.

404
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,540
He heard that Miss Jiu'er was sick.

405
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,600
so he came to visit.

406
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,420
Right?

407
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,710
What is this?

408
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,640
Open it.

409
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,080
It must be a gift.

410
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,810
Baozi?

411
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,750
What does this mean?

412
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,359
Brother Han,

413
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,589
your ideas are unique.

414
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,000
I heard you hurt your leg.

415
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,260
So I bought some supplements

416
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,060
for you to replenish.

417
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,859
How can baozi replenish health?

418
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,060
Why doesn't

419
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,060
he know

420
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,390
the social norms at all?

421
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,069
Forget it.

422
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,890
He's your health and longevity.

423
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,680
You should be tolerant of him.

424
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,280
I appreciate your kindness.

425
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,830
Thank you, Your Highness.

426
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,720
It sounds like

427
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,330
you don't feel like eating.

428
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,960
No way, you have to eat one

429
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,470
and get well soon.

430
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,020
Otherwise,

431
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,210
how are you going to investigate the case with me?

432
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,720
I ate a lot this morning.

433
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,240
I'm not eating now.

434
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,580
What does replenishing health have to do

435
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,340
with whether you're full or not?

436
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,340
Come on, have one.

437
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,290
I don't want to eat.

438
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,550
Why are you forcing me?

439
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,610
Hurry up.

440
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,620
Have one.

441
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,740
I-I don't want to eat.

442
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,510
You have to.

443
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,620
What are you doing?

444
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,350
Brother Han.

445
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,430
This may be a tonic

446
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,560
in Qi.

447
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,330
However, in our country,

448
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,530
it is just breakfast.

449
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,210
A breakfast?

450
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,860
I asked you to find something

451
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,980
Qian people use to nourish their bodies.

452
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,310
Is this good for health?

453
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,280
Besides, this is too monotone.

454
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,650
You don't understand, Your Highness.

455
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,140
There are meat and noodles inside.

456
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,490
And most importantly,

457
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,610
I've tasted all in Jiuxiao City.

458
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,310
This is the best.

459
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,540
Keha, you're dead.

460
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,620
And you left without saying goodbye yesterday.

461
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,260
I think

462
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,710
you should apologize.

463
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,390
It's none of your business.

464
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,780
It indeed has nothing to do with me.

465
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,420
But I think

466
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,460
the way Qi and Qian get along with

467
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,260
is different.

468
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,460
If you really want

469
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,260
to apologize,

470
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,890
I have a suggestion.

471
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,080
Do you want to hear it?

472
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,730
What is it?

473
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,280
Look.

474
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,590
Jiu'er hurt her leg severely.

475
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,570
She won't be able to patrol the streets these days.

476
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,540
But her duty

477
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,820
as an Inspector of the Inspection Bureau

478
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,590
can't be neglected

479
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,420
How about this?

480
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,140
We take over her job

481
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,360
so that she can recuperate well.

482
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,820
We...

483
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,500
You and me.

484
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,430
We can have a chat while patrolling.

485
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,560
Time will pass soon.

486
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,310
Who wants to chat with you

487
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,930
while patrolling the streets?

488
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:17,790
I don't want to.

489
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,100
Why?

490
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,350
We, Qi people, are always alone.

491
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:22,860
But...

492
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,480
Miss Jiu'er needs your help.

493
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,010
My leg...

494
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,680
It hurts suddenly.

495
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,090
My poor foot.

496
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,330
If I hadn't been so tired yesterday,

497
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,190
how could I

498
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,460
have broken it?

499
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,340
Am I right?

500
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,550
Am I right?

501
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:45,780
Right?

502
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,900
That's right, Brother Han.

503
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,180
Please help her.

504
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,820
It hurts so much.

505
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,080
Stupid woman.

506
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,180
How dare she hint at me with her legs?

507
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,440
No way I'm taking that.

508
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,780
Fine.

509
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,510
It's like every time

510
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,580
I use this tactic,

511
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,060
he'll waver.

512
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,960
A big bad wolf

513
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,240
is also sympathetic.

514
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,300
It's because

515
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,670
you're injured.

516
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,000
Then, Miss Jiu'er,

517
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,980
Brother Han and I

518
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,140
will patrol the streets in a while.

519
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,870
Don't worry.

520
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:16,520
Wait.

521
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,160
Your Highness.

522
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,360
I have something

523
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,070
to talk to Prince Han alone.

524
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,990
Would you mind leaving us alone?

525
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:24,880
Sure.

526
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,270
I'll be out there to admire the beauty of flowers.

527
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,440
Please do so.

528
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,690
[He'an Hall]

529
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,430
I'm telling you.

530
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,390
Miss Jiu'er asked me to come out

531
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,170
because she thinks

532
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,730
Brother Han has a weird personality.

533
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,260
She wants to

534
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,720
reason with him secretly.

535
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,220
It's really tiring for her.

536
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,780
Sit down.

537
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,410
Your leg is injured.

538
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,010
You...

539
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,090
Sit tight.

540
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,670
Yes.

541
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,390
It's really tiring for her.

542
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,400
Let me tell you.

543
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,410
Although Brother Han's old,

544
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,160
his behaviour is just like a kid's.

545
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,780
Yes.

546
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,130
Speaking gossip behind others

547
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,660
is not a gentleman's doing.

548
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,790
Yes.

549
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,600
Why did you

550
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,740
leave without saying goodbye yesterday?

551
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,060
I waited so long for you

552
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,300
but I didn't see you.

553
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,590
Were you trying to trick me

554
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,530
or did something urgent happen?

555
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,530
What do you think?

556
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,780
You found something,

557
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,440
didn't you?

558
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,280
I smelled the three-scar Qi

559
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,060
in the market yesterday.

560
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,610
So I followed him.

561
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,900
But I lost him.

562
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,780
You're so skillful in martial arts.

563
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,280
How could you lose him?

564
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,050
Not really.

565
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,070
He was beating around the bush.

566
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,900
It seemed that he deliberately wanted me

567
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,500
to be aware of his existence.

568
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,600
In the end, he left a message

569
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,090
and said he would show up again.

570
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,340
I'm curious about one thing.

571
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:05,820
Go ahead.

572
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,300
Chef Zhang's case

573
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,260
is related to officials, imperial chefs,

574
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,210
the royal family,

575
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,340
and kung fu masters.

576
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,020
Do you think the three-scar Qi

577
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,350
is one of the

578
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,280
big shots of the Qi race?

579
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,660
Who cares?

580
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,340
Just catch him.

581
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,610
Then why did he target you?

582
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,730
Why must you

583
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,800
catch him?

584
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,900
Don't you understand me?

585
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,740
This

586
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,770
has nothing to do with you.

587
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,510
Does he have a name?

588
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,780
If he does,

589
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,180
I can go through the documents.

590
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,670
Maybe I can find some clues

591
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,660
with that.

592
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,350
No way he uses his own name.

593
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,390
What if he uses it?

594
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,830
It's not a big deal to have a check.

595
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,380
Don't you understand my words?

596
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,350
I told you

597
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,650
it has nothing to do with you.

598
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,170
What you need to do is find him.

599
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,030
The rest is none of your business.

600
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,220
I...

601
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,420
Aren't we partners?

602
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,830
If you drop asking, we're partners.

603
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,860
If you insist, we're enemies.

604
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,380
Think about it

605
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,620
and make a choice.

606
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:10,920
Okay.

607
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,430
I'll stop asking questions.

608
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,600
I only want to help you

609
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,880
investigate the case.

610
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,450
Why are you so fierce?

611
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,750
Actually,

612
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,190
what I want to say is...

613
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,590
Don't ask about the three-scar Qi anymore.

614
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,170
This is where you draw the line,

615
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:32,650
right?

616
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,460
Why was I so fierce just now?

617
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,590
Can't I talk nicely?

618
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
I scared her.

619
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,870
Give me your hand.

620
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,760
I didn't replenish enough health and longevity

621
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,840
for you last night.

622
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,590
I'll make it up to you today.

623
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,510
He's always like this.

624
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,590
When I think he is annoying,

625
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,820
he suddenly becomes

626
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,940
reasonable.

627
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,420
If he knew that

628
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,950
my father had investigated the three-scar Qi,

629
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,880
what would he do?

630
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,930
Will he help me

631
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,980
or treat me like an enemy?

632
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:16,910
What?

633
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,360
You are too timid

634
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,420
to talk after being scared by me?

635
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,000
How could I

636
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,010
be so timid?

637
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,530
Besides,

638
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,650
I asked you the questions

639
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:29,770
just

640
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,720
to solve the case as soon as possible.

641
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,060
Even without your clue,

642
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,940
I can still find

643
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,000
the three-scar Qi.

644
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,750
I hope so.

645
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,330
But, Prince Han.

646
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,590
Before that,

647
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:46,730
can you

648
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,360
teach me some Qi characters?

649
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,380
It's not hard.

650
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
Give me your hand.

651
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,400
If I mess up the order of words,

652
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,010
he won't be able to notice

653
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,270
what I'm trying to ask.

654
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,100
Just

655
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,920
some numbers of the Qi race.

656
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,450
Five, two, three.

657
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,250
What's wrong?

658
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,370
Nothing.

659
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,070
I saw it

660
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,630
when I was organizing the files.

661
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,460
Since you are a Qi,

662
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,640
If I learn more about Qi characters,

663
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,160
we can communicate more conveniently

664
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,240
in the future.

665
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,810
There must be something wrong

666
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,140
if she is asking about this all of a sudden.

667
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,700
Written on the portrait

668
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,500
is 2355.

669
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,390
[2355]

670
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,540
Could it be on the 23rd year of Dingkun,

671
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,550
May 5?

672
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,140
That was the last time Father

673
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,310
went to Shuobei.

674
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,930
Could it be Father

675
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,320
had met with the three-scar Qi?

676
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,520
In each district,

677
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,830
patrol twice before sunset.

678
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,380
You may reduce the frequency within an acceptable range at night.

679
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,040
What is the acceptable range?

680
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,100
I'll help them

681
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,360
standardize it later.

682
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,060
You're being nosy again.

683
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,380
No, I'm not.

684
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,220
Brother Han, you don't know that

685
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,060
I have a shortcoming.

686
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,740
If I see anything

687
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,870
that doesn't match,

688
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,160
I feel uncomfortable.

689
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,090
I know.

690
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,520
You know?

691
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,870
How did you know?

692
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,360
You and Miss Jiu'er

693
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
treated me as a suspect before this.

694
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,380
Brother Han,

695
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,760
why don't you have your uniform?

696
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,370
Did the Inspection Bureau slight you?

697
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,210
How dare they!

698
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,280
I dislike these ugly clothes.

699
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,310
The tailors hired by the Inspection Bureau are not skillful enough.

700
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,170
How about this?

701
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,370
I'll customize one for you another day.

702
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:40,970
Same as me,

703
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,560
use top-quality materials.

704
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
What do you think?

705
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:45,990
Your Highness.

706
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,440
I'm curious.

707
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,700
Why are you so obsessed with

708
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,340
Inspector's uniform?

709
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,400
Well...

710
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,450
Prince Han.

711
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,710
I think

712
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,340
it's not about the uniform.

713
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,380
Apparently,

714
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,980
it's because of Miss Jiu'er.

715
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,020
What's wrong with her?

716
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,780
I heard that

717
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,580
Qi would only be a grown-up at 60 years old.

718
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,700
And you'll only have one partner in your life.

719
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,120
No wonder you are

720
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,990
insensitive to these things.

721
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,640
You're even worse than a eunuch.

722
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,660
What are you trying to say?

723
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,120
Actually, I don't like this uniform.

724
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,780
But for Miss Jiu'er,

725
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,160
I'm willing to give it a try.

726
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,870
[Drunkery]

727
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,440
What do you mean?

728
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,530
Do you like her?

729
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:39,580
No.

730
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,420
Whether you like her or not,

731
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,730
it has nothing to do with me.

732
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,990
Why bother telling me?

733
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,540
That's right.

734
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,630
I haven't found the person yet.

735
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,700
How dare you

736
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,150
take my partner

737
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,330
away?

738
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,520
What kind of wine has such a bad taste?

739
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,910
What a waste.

740
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,100
Someone else will drink it if you don't.

741
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,960
Sir, slow down.

742
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,780
I can still drink.

743
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,210
Waiter, another bottle of wine.

744
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:13,730
Coming.

745
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,440
Here.

746
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,130
It's on you, Brother Han.

747
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,010
In Shuobei,

748
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,100
no one

749
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,940
will touch other people's cups,

750
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,760
let alone drink others' wine.

751
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,240
This isn't Shuobei.

752
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,980
We're not as indifferent as you guys.

753
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,710
In our place,

754
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,990
you're a passerby when drinking the first cup

755
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,960
but a friend when drinking the second cup.

756
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,890
Come on, friend.

757
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,070
Since you drank my wine,

758
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,150
I have something to ask you.

759
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,040
Uncle Hu, you have to answer honestly.

760
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
Those in the Inspection Bureau said

761
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,670
Jiu'er was punished to clean the storage

762
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,980
because of me.

763
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,030
Is that true?

764
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,350
It has nothing to do with you.

765
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,280
It's Yan Kuan's fault.

766
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,560
He held a grudge.

767
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,540
Since you have a high status,

768
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,260
when you contradict him,

769
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,450
he has to vent his anger on others.

770
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,330
In the Inspection Bureau,

771
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,260
there are all men

772
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,090
with bad tempers.

773
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,070
Who can he vent his anger on?

774
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,890
Only Jiu'er

775
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,230
is gentle

776
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,500
and well-educated.

777
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,780
Bullies pick soft targets.

778
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,220
How bad he is.

779
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,130
That's because of me.

780
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,360
I'll teach you a lesson today.

781
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,160
I'm gonna drink your wine

782
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,180
and make you feel guilty

783
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,110
towards Jiu'er.

784
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,210
Young man,

785
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,800
don't take it to heart.

786
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,420
My daughter

787
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,300
has been very smart since she was young

788
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,560
and always wanted to be a good Inspector.

789
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,790
She is well-educated,

790
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,610
and amicable.

791
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:42,450
I didn't expect

792
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,450
you'd only been here for two months,

793
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,140
but she already broke her leg

794
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,480
and got punished because of you.

795
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,910
But she never holds grudges.

796
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,840
Why do I feel that

797
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,530
you're being ironic?

798
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,570
Also, my friend.

799
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,540
Don't take it to heart.

800
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,710
Don't mind.

801
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,390
She even got flogged for you.

802
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,510
She doesn't hold a grudge.

803
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:06,620
Uncle Hu.

804
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,330
Just get to the point.

805
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,680
I don't like to owe others.

806
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,210
I'm a straightforward person.

807
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,470
I'm speaking frankly.

808
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,680
Jiu'er

809
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,610
has a good personality

810
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,690
and she's smart.

811
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,420
The only shortcoming is she's in poor health.

812
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,520
Even so,

813
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,760
she was flogged for you.

814
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,430
It shows how much she cares

815
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,940
about you as her partner.

816
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,180
I got it.

817
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,730
My ability to talk nonsense

818
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,010
is as good as before.

819
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:36,660
Girl.

820
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,190
Your godfather

821
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,480
will pave a way for you.

822
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,690
Good brother.

823
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,670
You're straightforward.

824
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,720
Since we've come to this point,

825
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,420
I have a secret.

826
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,620
Do you want to hear it?

827
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,450
What is it?

828
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,770
Do you want to know

829
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,650
how to make up

830
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,000
with Jiu'er?

831
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,520
Go ahead.

832
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:02,880
Waiter.

833
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,340
One more bottle of wine.

834
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:04,840
Hurry up.

835
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,460
Coming.

836
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,280
This is so beautiful.

837
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,260
I'm glad you like it.

838
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:30,700
There are lantern riddles ahead.

839
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,030
Okay.

840
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,350
Go ahead.

841
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,800
Mother, I want to go there.

842
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,200
Do you want to solve the lantern riddles?

843
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,700
Let's play lantern riddles here.

844
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,230
Let's go.

845
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,460
If you guess it right,

846
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,100
you can choose the lanterns up here.

847
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,110
There are so many riddles here.

848
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,020
If you guess it right, you can take the lanterns.

849
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,070
Young Master, look at this.

850
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,290
The Lantern Festival is around the corner.

851
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,630
Jiu'er loves rabbit-shaped lanterns the most.

852
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,910
Unexpectedly,

853
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,540
she likes this kind of thing.

854
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:52,980
Boss,

855
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,490
how much is the lantern?

856
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,290
Sir,

857
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,540
are you kidding?

858
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,710
This is a stall for lantern riddles.

859
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,550
You spend money to solve lantern riddles here.

860
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,550
In the end, whoever guesses the most

861
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,120
will take the lantern away.

862
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,100
What is the riddle?

863
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,170
Pinwheel.

864
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,480
Take a look at pinwheels.

865
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,460
This is pretty.

866
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,400
It's very unique.

867
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,130
I don't want.

868
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,140
Where are you going? So mysterious.

869
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,920
You'll know when we get there.

870
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,450
Hurry up.

871
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:21,610
That one.

872
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,410
Do you like this?

873
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,320
Can't I?

874
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,060
You can.

875
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,910
You used to love eating rabbits.

876
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,740
I didn't expect you

877
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,170
to be interested in

878
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,720
these paper-made rabbits.

879
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,760
Cut the crap.

880
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,640
The Qian culture is deep and profound.

881
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
Can you handle it?

882
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,630
Of course I can.

883
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,540
But why should I help you

884
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,180
with this?

885
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,250
I'm not interested

886
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,280
in these paper-made rabbits at all.

887
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,130
Tell me. What is your condition?

888
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,580
You know what I want to hear.

889
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,420
Call me.

890
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,320
Impossible.

891
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,790
Then I have no choice.

892
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,670
Thank you, sister.

893
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,260
Boss,

894
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,000
I want all the lanterns

895
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,630
you have.

896
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,400
This...

897
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,390
Stupid woman.

898
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,860
Why does she like this kind of thing?

899
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,460
Not bad.

900
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,030
Today is indeed a wonderful day

901
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,230
to experience the life

902
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,010
and feel the custom of the Qian.

903
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,500
Look.

904
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,980
The man with the rabbit-shaped lantern

905
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,740
is so handsome.

906
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,510
But he has someone

907
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,420
by his side.

908
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,500
Can't you see that?

909
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,120
He's so handsome.

910
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,940
But the two of them

911
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,270
look like a great match.

912
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,730
Qian girls are so boring.

913
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,780
All they think about is love.

914
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,170
Are you happy?

915
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:43,820
Hanzheng.

916
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,310
Do you know the origin of the Lantern Festival?

917
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,950
What is it?

918
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:48,850
The Lantern Festival

919
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,990
is similar to our Under the Moon Festival.

920
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,620
It's the day when a man and a woman make their love promise.

921
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,420
No, man...

922
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,460
A man and a woman make their love promise?

923
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,660
Let me remind you.

924
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,230
Although you don't understand love,

925
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,850
Qian is different from Qi.

926
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,240
Once you invite a girl to the Lantern Festival

927
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,340
and give her the festive lantern she loves,

928
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,600
that's a token of love.

929
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,280
Tell me.

930
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,739
Who are you going to

931
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,900
give this rabbit-shaped lantern to?

932
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,159
I'll give it to myself.

933
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,540
Can't I like it?

934
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,739
We're almost there.

935
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:21,620
Okay.

936
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,040
Guys.

937
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,560
This road is blocked. Please take a detour.

938
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,889
Here has been booked

939
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:26,840
by His Highness.

940
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,840
His Highness? Which prince is it?

941
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,320
How many princes there are

942
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,250
in Jiuxiao City?

943
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,409
You two should go somewhere else.

944
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,739
Let's go over there.

945
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:36,780
Okay.

946
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,130
Your Highness.

947
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,239
Everything is ready.

948
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,370
The road is blocked.

949
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,239
It's right ahead.

950
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,230
Everything is ready.

951
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,590
Okay.

952
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,850
Miss Jiu'er.

953
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,530
You look

954
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,750
pretty today.

955
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,990
If my mother hadn't forced me,

956
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,030
I wouldn't have dressed like this.

957
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,320
Why did she force you?

958
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,670
She...

959
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,100
I'm going to investigate a case.

960
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,160
Why are you dressing me so seriously?

961
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,540
Your mother has been the wife of an inspector

962
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,660
for so long.

963
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,080
If he doesn't like you,

964
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,690
write my name upside down.

965
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,020
I think you really need to

966
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,880
write your name upside down.

967
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,920
His warm heart

968
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,910
is not for me,

969
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,830
but the script.

970
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,060
He just wants to collect materials

971
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,740
for his scripts.

972
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,430
There's one more.

973
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,910
Come on, let me have a look.

974
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,930
Forget it.

975
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,170
Enjoy your meal.

976
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:36,670
Thank you.

977
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,260
Let's take a walk.

978
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,480
Boss.

979
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,060
A pot of tea.

980
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,690
Noted, please wait for a moment.

981
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,750
What are you doing?

982
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,740
I want to know

983
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,340
what they are talking about.

984
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,570
I'm thirsty too.

985
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,400
You speak with a forked tongue.

986
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,880
Who are you talking about?

987
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,480
Your Highness.

988
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,090
Aren't you taking me

989
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:06,990
to see the painting?

990
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,040
Why are we here at the Lantern Festival?

991
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,450
We're indeed here to see the painting.

992
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,940
But if we just borrow the painting,

993
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,100
others may feel suspicious.

994
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,500
So,

995
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,280
with the name of Secret Guest,

996
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
I invited all painters

997
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,780
to hold an exhibition here.

998
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,750
In name,

999
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,610
we pray for the people of Jiuxiao City.

1000
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,210
In fact,

1001
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,960
we can sneak into the crowd

1002
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,220
and watch it quietly.

1003
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,820
They won't find out.

1004
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,380
Your Highness,

1005
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,860
you are really a model for our generation.

1006
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,640
You worked so hard

1007
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,090
to write scripts and collect materials.

1008
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,700
You will definitely become

1009
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,450
a famous big shot in the future.

1010
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,130
It's not all for the case,

1011
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,040
but to help you.

1012
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,600
Your Highness,

1013
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,510
I'm just an Inspector.

1014
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,680
I don't deserve you

1015
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,190
to spend so much money.

1016
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,680
Miss Jiu'er.

1017
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,780
Aren't we friends?

1018
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,380
We're friends.

1019
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,040
So we should make it clear.

1020
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:08,710
Fine.

1021
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,190
I'll tell you then.

1022
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,430
You're not just a friend to me.

1023
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,040
If he doesn't like you,

1024
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,660
write my name upside down.

1025
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,800
You really don't remember me.

1026
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,000
You are...

1027
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,160
It's me.

1028
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,540
Don't, Your Highness.

1029
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,820
I can't bear that.

1030
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,370
No.

1031
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,300
Have you forgotten

1032
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,300
how you called me?

1033
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,300
I...

1034
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,280
What did I call you?

1035
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,640
That autumn,

1036
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,060
outside the Guanyin Temple.

1037
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:45,880
What?

1038
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:48,670
Let go!

1039
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,160
Mother!

1040
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,130
Let go!
Mother!

1041
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,250
Mother! Mother!

1042
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,230
Why did Father detain you here?

1043
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,510
Jun.

1044
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,830
Mother has contracted pox.

1045
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,380
Everyone will die if they are infected.

1046
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:01,820
Mother.

1047
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,230
Go back with Fuzi.

1048
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,100
Mother.

1049
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,860
From now on,

1050
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,050
Mother.

1051
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,830
don't come to see me.

1052
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,610
Why is no one

1053
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,770
willing to save my mother?

1054
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,750
Who said no one would save her?

1055
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,220
My mother is willing to save her.

1056
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,780
Cry-baby.

1057
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:41,970
It's you?

1058
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:42,660
Yes.

1059
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,190
It's you.

1060
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,050
Cry-baby?

1061
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,330
What is she talking about?

1062
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,430
I didn't want you

1063
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,780
to address me with that.

1064
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:57,870
Oh ya.

1065
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,940
You're a Prince now.

1066
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,470
I remember

1067
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,240
when your mother passed away.

1068
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,070
You came to cry at the temple

1069
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,000
every fifth day of the lunar month.

1070
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,080
You never came here again after that.

1071
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,630
I thought you stopped crying

1072
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,280
after you'd grown up.

1073
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,680
So you didn't come again.

1074
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,150
I wanted to see you,

1075
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,690
but the Empress took me to the palace.

1076
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,820
I couldn't come out.

1077
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,530
When I went to Guanyin Temple after that,

1078
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,540
I couldn't find you anymore.

1079
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,820
Why didn't you tell me?

1080
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,400
I wanted to wait until

1081
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,320
I had some achievements

1082
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,180
and you were impressed by me.

1083
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,580
By then, I would tell you.

1084
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,660
But

1085
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,510
you avoided me.

1086
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,730
Why didn't you tell me earlier

1087
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,670
that you're Jun?

1088
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,760
I knew it.

1089
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,170
How could I

1090
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,850
be favored by a Prince?

1091
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,850
In the future,

1092
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,380
I will just call you Jiu'er.

1093
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:44,780
Okay.

1094
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,010
I'll call you Jun.

1095
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,400
When someone is around,

1096
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,860
I'd better call you Your Highness.

1097
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,050
Okay, I'll listen to you.

1098
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,580
Let's go.

1099
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,220
Jiu'er.

1100
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,030
Wait for me.

1101
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,590
Mister, can you

1102
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,990
sell this lantern to me?

1103
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,860
This...

1104
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,380
Thank you, sir.

1105
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,240
Thank you, sir.

1106
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:10,920
Jiu'er.

1107
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,340
I remember you said

1108
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,840
you like festive lanterns.

1109
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,240
I wanted to give it to you.

1110
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,010
I finally bought it today.

1111
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,750
Now I have a rabbit.

1112
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,540
I have a rabbit-shaped lantern.

1113
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,220
Father, you're awesome!

1114
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,640
Thank you, Jun.

1115
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,550
I thought you were the only one

1116
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,430
who likes festive lanterns.

1117
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,960
So that girl likes them too.

1118
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,550
Since she likes them,

1119
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,010
I won't like them anymore.

1120
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,900
This is the art exhibition

1121
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,900
I prepare for you.

1122
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:56,830
This way.

1123
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,000
This is the painting.

1124
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,420
There are all lovey-dovey couples

1125
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,470
over the street.

1126
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,680
It makes me feel hot.

1127
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,260
Thank you for accompanying me today, General.

1128
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:09,850
I'm leaving.
