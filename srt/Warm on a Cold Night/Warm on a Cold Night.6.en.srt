4
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,320
Are you playing with a dog or something?

5
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,560
I'm looking for you.

6
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,259
Do you want me to shout out loud,

7
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,320
"Han Zheng!

8
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,470
Where are you?"

9
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,300
Like this?

10
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,780
Can you do it again?

11
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,920
How did you

12
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,820
fly out so quickly from

13
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,700

14

room?

15
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,509
You want to know?

16
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,980
I heard that

17
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,280
Qi men are fast.

18
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:23,890
But I didn't expect them

19
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,020
to be this fast.

20
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,450
This stupid woman.

21
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,400
She forgot how she got so dizzy after being spun by me.

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,130
Brother Han.

23
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,670
Can you

24
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,880
take me flying around outside

25
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,810
just like you did

26
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,950
just now?

27
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,460
You were just having such a great time

28
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,890
talking with Mr. Wen Jun just now.

29
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,490
Now you think of me?

30
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,930
You...

31
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,150
Let alone eavesdropping on others' conversation,

32
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,950
why are you being all sarcastic?

33
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,820
Stupid woman.

34
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,000
Why are you scolding me?

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,480
Do you know

36
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,290
why that man asked you out?

37
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,579
Why?

38
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,010
To kill you.

39
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,430
He's using that as an excuse,

40
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,250
but he actually lured you into the trap

41
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,300
to kill you.

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
That's not right.

43
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,340
If he wants to kill me,

44
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,960
he firstly must be

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,560
the nursery rhyme murderer.

46
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,410
But I think

47
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,210
he doesn't look like the murderer.

48
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,850
Or

49
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,940
could he have other reasons?

50
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,250
Do you know what I found

51
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,690
in his secret room?

52
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,079
What?

53
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,590
There's a map

54
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,540
of Jiuxiao city.

55
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,500
There is also another book

00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,730

Qi  nursery rhymes.

59
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:40,570

In that case,

63
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,890
it is quite strange.

No, wait.

69

Compared to me,

70

you probably want to know the truth more.

71
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,570
He must have

72
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,000
his motives to ask me out.

73
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,140

he covets my beauty

78
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,450
and took the chance to ask me out.

79
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,770
That's why you don't want me to go?

80

Why didn't I

realize this before?

- I can’t even walk.
- Stop.

I don't believe you.

I think

109
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,800
you can fly

110

when you're alone.

111
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,430
But you wouldn't be able to

Qi men are

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,170
Tell me about it.

177
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,420
When I first saw it,

178
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,450
I felt most sorry for Cui Sheng.

179
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,400
He and his wife

180
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,760
had to go through so much

181
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,870
to get married.

182
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,700
But later on,

183
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,340
his wife

184
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,850
fell in love with Zhamuke–

185
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,990
Headless?

186
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,160
And eloped.

187
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,140
I was so furious.

188
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,370
So when the ending wrote that Cui Sheng

189
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,590
killed Zhamuke,

190
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,680
it was really satisfying.

191
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,240
However,

192
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,910
when I reread it last night,

193
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,980
I suddenly felt

194
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,090
Zhamuke is actually quite pitiful too.

195
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,390
After all, Cui Sheng's love

196
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,140
is pretty suffocating.

197
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,580
On the contrary,

198
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,170
Zhamuke's love is selfless.

199
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:00,480
Yes.

200
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,020
Some people,

201
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,240
after reading about Zhamuke,

202
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,980
think he is a bad guy.

203
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,510
I understand.

204
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,390
Zhamuke fell in love with the wrong person accidently,

205
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,360
but ended up in a tragic end.

206
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,180
He's quite pitiful too.

207
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,900
My sentiments exactly,

208
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,580
Ms. Jiu'er!

209
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,710
What exactly

210
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,350
is the deal with this Wen Jun?

211
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,180
Why is he so nice to this woman?

212
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,700
I sympathize with

213
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,630
Zhamuke a lot too.

214
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,660
Then why did Mr. Wen Jun

215
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,800
created such a

216
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,170
a vivid villain,

217
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,350
yet made him die so miserably.

218
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,010
There's actually a story.

219
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,260
This Zhamuke is...

220
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,170
Is?

221
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,990
You scared me.

222
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:05,840
Eat.

223
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,740
Don't stand on ceremony.

224
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,010
Here.

225
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,480
What are they doing?

226
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,670
There really is an accomplice.

227
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,160
Sir, you haven't paid yet.

228
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,430
Mr. Wen Jun.

229
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,220
When you mentioned Zhamuke just now,

230
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,900
what were you going to say?

231
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:57,870
Ms. Jiu'er,

232
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,390
why don’t you go to the theater

233
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,030
to watch my new opera?

234
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,010
Didn't we agree to

235
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,440
discuss the script here?

236
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,530
The script I wrote

237
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,290
is written in a traditional way.

238
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,330
We, as creators,

239
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,470
are too involved in it

240
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,890
and can't find what should be edited.

241
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,350
I need a bystander like you

242
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,140
to give me some comments.

243
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,120
Ms. Jiu'er, let's go.

244
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:20,820
But...

245
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,950
Mr. Wen Jun.

246
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,660
But...

247
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,610
You're Wen Jun's

248
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,780
accomplice, right?

249
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,210
Hold this for me.

250
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,570
What's going on?

251
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,750
Open the door!

252
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,910
Let me out!

253
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,420
Let me out!

254
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,960
Do you know why that guy

255
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,910
asked you out?

256
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,550
With the script as an excuse,

257
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,010
he lures you into a trap

258
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,900
and kill you to silence you.

259
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,290
Oh no.

260
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,340
I'm going to die.

261
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,600
Let me out!

262
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,160
It's you.

263
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,950
You Qi men's skills

264
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,460
are just so-so.

265
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,900
I only used 30% of my strength just now.

266
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,800
You seem calm and relaxed,

267
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,270
but you can't handle it anymore.

268
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,530
I am someone

269
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,790
who is in his fifties.

270
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,560
Even if you beat me,

271
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:55,510
it's not anything

272
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,580
to brag about.

273
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,150
Qian men are so delicate

274
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,640
yet so arrogant.

275
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,730
I'm in my sixties too.

276
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,380
But I'm not like you.

277
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,590
You Qi have a slow life.

278
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,000
When you are 60,

279
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,020
you are in the prime of

280
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,150
what Qi men would be.

281
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,230
Things that could've been done in 20 years,

282
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,830
you all have to take 60 years.

283
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,920
What does that prove?

284
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,720
You are

285
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,040
a slow race.

286
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,730
You will easily be

287
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,890
overtaken by us Qian.

288
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,220
You are quite stubborn.

289
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,320
Wait till I have your life

290
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,980
in my hands,

291
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,340
tell me then

292
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,230
what are you up to

293
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,120
with Wen Jun?

294
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,560
Don't bother.

295
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,300
I'll tell you everything.

296
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,160
Who are you?

297
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,000
What is this place?

298
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,100
What is this?

299
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,280
No!

300
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,310
No!

301
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,710
Are you human or ghost?

302
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,350
Don't come over!

303
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,010
Don't come over! I beg you!

304
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,210
I beg you.

305
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,170
Please.

306
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,620
Where is this?

307
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,680
Shuobei.

308
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,990
I'm already in Qi?

309
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,290
You shouldn't have come.

310
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,430
Your voice

311
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,180
sounds familiar.

312
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,080
Father.

313
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,370
Is that you?

314
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:47,860
Father.

315
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,880
I know it's you.

316
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,420
10 years has been too long.

317
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,210
I'm afraid I can't recognize you

318
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,370
when I see you again,

319
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,590
so I've remembered

320
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,100
your voice.

321
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,050
Father, come out!

322
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,310
I came all the way

323
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,359
from Qian to Shuibei

324
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,730
to find you.

325
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,579
Father,

326
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,210
why can't I touch you?

327
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,650
My Hui.

328
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,660
Father is dead.

329
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,600
You're dead?

330
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,780
What they said is true.

331
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,660
You were really killed

332
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,020
by those Qi men?

333
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,650
Why did Mother lie to me?

334
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,650
She said you went to Qi State

335
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,260
as an envoy

336
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,880
to maintain

337
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,500
the peace between the two races.

338
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,110
She said

339
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,380
when I grow up,

340
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,580
you will return to home

341
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,480
and stay with us forever.

342
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,340
But all of this is fake.

343
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,570
If I didn't come,

344
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,420
I'm afraid...

345
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,590
I'm afraid I'll be kept in the dark forever.

346
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,620
Go away!

347
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,650
You damn Qi men!

348
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,040
I hate you!

349
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,610
I'll kill you all!

350
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,140
I've been an official all my life.

351
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,230
I've been going back and forth the Qian and Qi race.

352
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,220
Although I was killed by the villains of the Qi race,

353
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,040
but I have also received

354
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,690
a lot of help from many Qi.

355
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,500
In this world,

356
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,980
besides from kind men, are those who are evil.

357
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,160
That's how the Qian are.

358
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,560
And so are the Qi men.

359
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,880
My Hui'er,

360
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,660
don't turn yourself into an evil person

361
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,350
because of others' evil deeds.

362
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,500
What do you think, Ms. Jiu'er?

363
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,300
Do you like it?

364
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,370
Mr. Wen Jun.

365
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,130
Did you write this play?

366
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,850
Yes.

367
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,760
Your writing is so good.

368
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,620
Ms. Jiu'er, if you like it...

369
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,010
Ms. Jiu'er,

370
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:42,820
if you like it,

371
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,270
my hard work these days

372
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,130
are not in vain.

373
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,720
How did you come up with this idea?

374
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,120
I...

375
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,230
A friend once told me

376
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,900
that this is her story.

377
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,770
I always dream of her.

378
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,580
She was like this in her dream.

379
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,530
So after a while,

380
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,980
I got this idea.

381
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,910
Your friend

382
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,860
is very pitiful.

383
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,020
But she is also very lucky.

384
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,320
She waited for 10 years with expectations.

385
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,320
In the end, she was separated from her father forever.

386
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,590
But at least

387
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:18,980
she managed

388
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,980
to meet her father for one last time.

389
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,210
Ms. Jiu'er,

390
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,930
I am very happy

391
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,950
that you like the characters I wrote.

392
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,200
Ms. Jiu'er,

393
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,620
I've taken up so much your time today.

394
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,620
I'll make it up to you next time.

395
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,390
Deyue Restaurant again?

396
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,320
I will take you

397
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,270
anywhere in Jiuxiao City

398
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,070
that you like.

399
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,220
I have another presumptuous request.

400
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,490
Can I continue to

401
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,680
invite you to help me

402
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,560
with my script?

403
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,710
Of course.

404
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,140
I love watching the shows

405
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,140
Mr. Wen Jun wrote.

406
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,640
Really?

407
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,950
Can I

408
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,490
visit you at the Inspection Bureau next time?

409
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,420
How did he know

410
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,970
I'm from the Guard Command?

411
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:20,720
Let's go.

412
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,040
You...

413
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,080
You hurt her.

414
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,230
You really care about her.

415
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,770
Greetings, Your Highness.

416
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,670
Your Highness–

417
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,280
You...

418
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,440
You are a prince?

419
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,300
He is...

420
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,510
You know that too?

421
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,290
You all know?

422
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,350
I am the only one who doesn't know.

423
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,470
Our prince

424
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,800
is simple-minded.

425
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,520
That's why he believed

426
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,150
your flimsy lies.

427
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,130
This is His Highness's token.

428
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,130
Yesterday,

429
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,160
after you left,

430
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,640
I sent someone

431
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,120
to investigate you.

432
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,050
Turns out you're from the Guard Command.

433
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,180
How could you be investigating

434
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,460
our prince?

435
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,260
But...

436
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,820
why do you have so many things

437
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,080
related to the case?

438
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,320
I'm curious about this case.

439
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,660
I wanted to write a script based on it.

440
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,680
So I secretly

441
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,240
started investigating it.

442
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,420
I see.

443
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,060
Although it makes sense,

444
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,200
but he's not that trustworthy.

445
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,130
Right, partner?

446
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,700
It's indeed a misunderstanding.

447
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,590
Since you two

448
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,180
are also here to investigate this case,

449
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,060
His Highness

450
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,620
would like to invite you to his residence

451
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,980
to talk about the case

452
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,980
and find some inspiration.

453
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,620
I wonder

454
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,510
if you are available.

455
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,860
I...

456
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,090
Yes, I am available.

457
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,860
What are you doing?

458
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,620
Trust me.

459
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,670
Yes.

460
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,930
You agreed?

461
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,670
Are you plotting something?

462
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,450
I want to be polite

463
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,980
towards you Qian's prince.

464
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:18,770
Can't I?

465
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,140
You don't have to agree

466
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,530
to talk about cases in their residence.

467
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,530
I'm yielding to the Prince's power,

468
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:26,860
can't I?

469
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,400
A fearless person

470
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,110
like you

471
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,300
will take a useless

472
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,600
Qian Prince

473
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,460
seriously?

474
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,110
Do you think I'm stupid?

475
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,350
Just take it as I'm in a good mood.

476
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,460
Strange...

477
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,780
I've never seen

478
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,700
this coin pouch before.

479
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,490
How dare you!

480
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,180
You're thinking about trying to replenish health again.

481
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:05,390
This...

482
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,540
Gold!

483
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,430
You make it seem like you're so upright

484
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,060
but you took so many gold

485
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,020
behind my back.

486
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,800
This is my own.

487
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,450
You...

488
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,710
Why do you have so much gold?

489
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,850
Do you think I'm illiterate?

490
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,320
There's an official seal on it.

491
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,250
How dare you deny

492
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,010
that you took this from that eunuch from just now?

493
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,770
If you don't make it clear,

494
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,170
I'll return it for you.

495
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,950
Didn't you say you are losing your five senses?

496
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,860
How could you see

497
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,060
so clearly this time?

498
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,010
Asking me to bring a weak prince

499
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,180
to investigate the case?

500
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,150
Impossible.

501
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,280
My lord

502
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,900
is addicted to writing scripts.

503
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,780
He insisted on investigating the Nursery Rhyme Case.

504
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,980
I think you're good.

505
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,180
If you can take him

506
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,100
to investigate the case,

507
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,160
I can rest assured.

508
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,240
Impossible.

509
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,770
Su Jiu'er

510
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,790
is enough burden.

511
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,650
I don't want to bring myself

512
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,650
any more trouble.

513
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,360
Three to seven.

514
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,460
What do you mean?

515
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,530
I get 70%

516
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,140
and you get 30%.

517
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,860
Why should I give it to you?

518
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,760
Because I can

519
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,230
attract him to talk about the script with me.

520
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,170
If it weren't for me,

521
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,230
you wouldn't have made so much money.

522
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,470
I'll get six and you get four.

523
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,530
- Stop the cart. I want to get off.
- Wait.

524
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,260
Five to five.

525
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,250
Two to eight. I'm 80% and you're 20%.

526
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,440
If it weren't for me,

527
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,260
you wouldn't have had the chance to participate.

528
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,870
- Five to five–
- One to nine.

529
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,600
I'm 90%

530
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,970
and you're 10%.

531
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
Young Master Han,

532
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,260
if you obey me now,

533
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,170
you can still get 10% of it.

534
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,680
Think about it.

535
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
Think carefully.

536
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,070
Oh no.

537
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,700
Oh no.

538
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,320
What now?

539
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,040
You need my

540
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,140
health again now?

541
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,090
I really need you now.

542
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,070
I'm 70% and you're 30%.

543
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,350
How about this,

544
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,310
five to five.

545
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,270
Two to eight.

546
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,310
Didn't you just say five to five just now?

547
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,010
I agree now.

548
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,260
Five to five.

549
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,900
One to nine.

550
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,920
Three to seven.

551
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,070
Three to seven.

552
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,630
I'm 30%

553
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,990
and you're 70%.

554
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,360
It's so warm.

555
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,790
Alright.

556
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,750
That's about enough

557
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,380
for today.

558
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,080
Don't move.

559
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,310
It costed me a lot

560
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,020
to get this.

561
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,820
I need to replenish more.

562
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,600
Not only for today,

563
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,880
I want more time in the future.

564
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,880
That'd depend on my mood.

565
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,900
[Prince Jun's Mansion]

566
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,020
Excuse me,

567
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,250
we have arrived at the residence.

568
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,340
Don't be all silly later

569
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,270
and tell everything

570
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,240
to that Wen Jun.

571
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:57,710
Don't worry.

572
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,680
I'm not a fool.

573
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,130
Although he doesn't

574
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,220
seem like a bad guy,

575
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,440
I won't

576
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,180
reveal the case

577
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,240
and create more troubles.

578
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,840
What you said is nice indeed.

579
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,580
But you looked all rosy just now.

580
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,080
Wasn't it because

581
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,000
he's a prince?

582
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,880
It's not because of him.

583
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,510
It's because of gold.

584
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,860
With this gold,

585
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,060
I will be able to pay back

586
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,040
Mr. Jin's money.

587
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,100
Stop talking. They're here.

588
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,540
Ms. Jiu'er.

589
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,130
Mr. Han.

590
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,660
Your Highness.

591
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,790
This is my humble dwelling.

592
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,380
You call this a humble dwelling?

593
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,410
Sirs,

594
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,650
please come in.

595
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,930
Please, Your Highness.

596
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,390
Please.

597
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,310
This is so grand.

598
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,080
The person living here

599
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,180
must be the happiest person

600
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,140
in Jiuxiao City.

601
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,510
Above the Prince's Residence, there is also the Royal Palace.

602
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,840
I don't envy the palace.

603
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,180
There's no freedom there.

604
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,380
This place is better.

605
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,760
Can you talk less?

606
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,070
How embarrassing.

607
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,970
This young lady is straightforward.

608
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,220
She is very cute.

609
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
Did you hear that?

610
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,930
Why don't you two go to the study

611
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,880
for a seat with Eunuch Liu?

612
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,540
I'll come after I get changed.

613
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,260
Take care, Your Highness.

614
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,700
Ms. Jiu'er, this way please.

615
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,280
So magnificent.

616
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:33,790
Over there.

617
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,360
And there too.

618
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,590
Over there

619
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,180
is Prince's study.

620
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,530
Isn't this The West Chamber?

621
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,450
Prince Jun is really

622
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,730
obsessed with operas.

623
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,870
My lord

624
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,720
is not interested in politics,

625
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,470
but he loves operas.

626
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
He seemed happy dedicating himself

627
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,820
to these things.

628
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,240
So I let him be.

629
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,980
My request for you two is simple.

630
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,550
You took the initiative

631
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,180
to investigate the case with my lord.

632
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,010
Don't say it was my idea.

633
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,060
Could it be you want us to say that

634
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,100
we were moved

635
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,360
by Prince Jun's intelligence

636
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,230
So we wanted to bring him along on this case?

637
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,440
That's what I mean.

638
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,790
But you can't just say it out like this.

639
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,180
Although His Highness is simple-minded,

640
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,500
he's not stupid.

641
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,760
Your Highness.

642
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,140
Ms. Jiu'er, have a seat.

643
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,800
Young Master Han, have a seat.

644
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,940
Your Highness, I'll leave you to it.

645
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,440
Go ahead.

646
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,840
I'll take my leave.

647
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:02,980
Take care.

648
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,610
Ms. Jiu'er,

649
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,950
don't be so courteous.

650
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,480
Sit down.

651
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,180
This...

652
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,780
is a bit rude.

653
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,580
I hope you can treat me as a friend.

654
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,220
Friends

655
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,650
don't stand on ceremony.

656
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,170
I'm happier if you're relaxed.

657
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:16,770
All right.

658
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,660
Since Your Highness said so,

659
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,020
I'll do as you say.

660
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:20,900
Ms. Jiu'er,

661
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,670
let me show you something.

662
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,170
What is this?

663
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,180
So cute.

664
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,610
This is made by a prop master

665
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,700
at The Western Chamber.

666
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,780
I thought you would like it,

667
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,040
so I brought it for you.

668
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,040
You can have it.

669
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,400
Since we're friends,

670
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,400
I'll take it.

671
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,220
Thank you, Your Highness.

672
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,380
Let's put chatting aside,

673
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,240
don't forget about our business.

674
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,520
By the way, Prince Jun,

675
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,640
we haven't finished talking.

676
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,510
Since you care so much about

677
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,340
Zhamuke in "Through the Night,"

678
00:31:58,770 --> 00:31:59,760
why did you have to write him

679
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,160
such a miserable ending?

680
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,890
Well,

681
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,420
I don't know how to say it.

682
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,540
But

683
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,120
the Zhamuke you speak of

684
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,820
is indeed real.

685
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,460
Who is it?

686
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,880
I have a friend.

687
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,970
His wife

688
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,600
eloped with a Qi man called Zhamuke

689
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
to the state of Qi.

690
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,170
Since then,

691
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,340
he changed a lot.

692
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,340
It's almost like he's a different person.

693
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,390
But the deep love

694
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,490
and complex feelings he has for his wife

695
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,150
touched me.

696
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,000
I couldn't help

697
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,660
but write it down in my script.

698
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,460
As for the ending you saw,

699
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,010
I didn't mean

700
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,700
to kill him.

701
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,180
Your friend

702
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,060
must want to kill Zhamuke.

703
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,210
Not really.

704
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,390
He's a very gentle person.

705
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,200
As for what you read

706
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,000
in the script,

707
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,560
is just words of anger I have exaggerated.

708
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,000
I visited his house a few days ago.

709
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,370
He still has the things

710
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,300
his wife used

711
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,830
placed in their original positions,

712
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,380
hoping his wife

713
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,580
would return one day.

714
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,310
That's how it is.

715
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,510
The real Zhamuke is dead?

716
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,380
How can they elope?

717
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,670
He's lying then.

718
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,240
Ms. Jiu'er,

719
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,930
you mentioning about this Zhamuke,

720
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:26,920
is it because you're suspecting that

721
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,440
he's the Qi murderer?

722
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,170
Well...

723
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,880
We're still investigating.

724
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,010
We can't confirm it.

725
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,090
I have another question.

726
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,220
Young Master,

727
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,680
you said you're not someone

728
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,710
from the Guard Command.

729
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,630
Why are you investigating the case

730
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,540
with Ms. Jiu'er?

731
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,070
It's none of your business.

732
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,620
Prince Jun.

733
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,480
This cup is shining so brightly.

734
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,820
It must be made of gold.

735
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:57,980
Right?

736
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,730
If you want to hear it,

737
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,790
I can tell you about it slowly.

738
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,340
So it's been a difficult time for Ms. Jiu'er

739
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,340
as she investigates cases in the Guard Command.

740
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,870
Thankfully there is Young Master Han to help.

741
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,570
Unfortunately,

742
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,989
the two of us

743
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,280
are still not enough.

744
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,920
We keep running into issues while investigating.

745
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,520
How about

746
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:42,820
I find some Qi people

747
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,480
to help you?

748
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,750
No, no.

749
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:45,540
No way.

750
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,940
It's already troublesome enough

751
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,940
with one Qi man.

752
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,590
If Commander Yan finds out,

753
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,889
I would lose my job.

754
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,300
What should we do

755
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,489
now that we are short of manpower?

756
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,510
We can't let the murderer

757
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,670
get away with it, right?

758
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,280
True...

759
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,580
Whatever.

760
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,270
Even if it's just the two of us,

761
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,040
we must bring him to justice.

762
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,460
Let's just do that.

763
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,320
Ms. Jiu'er.

764
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,200
H-how about me?

765
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,700
What about you?

766
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,430
To join you to investigate the case together!

767
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,120
No!

768
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,600
Of course not!

769
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,470
Prince Jun, listen.

770
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,300
Solving cases is different

771
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,590
from writing scripts.

772
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,520
You need to

773
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,530
stay out all day,

774
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,500
and use a lot of effort and money

775
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,390
to investigate cases.

776
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,160
You know?

777
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,830
Besides,

778
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,630
if His Majesty finds out

779
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,380
I'm ordering you around,

780
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,430
not only will I lose my job,

781
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,190
I might also die.

782
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,140
Don't worry.

783
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,900
My father seldom cares about me.

784
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:41,910
I'm very free.

785
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,550
Besides,

786
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,450
as a Prince,

787
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,410
joining you guys

788
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,320
and helping you investigate the case

789
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,180
would bring you a lot of benefits.

790
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:48,850
Really?

791
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,570
That's great!

792
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,960
Prince Jun

793
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,670
is intelligent, thoughtful,

794
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,590
and good at dealing with people.

795
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,980
Your smile is also mesmerizing.

796
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,610
With your help,

797
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,140
we'll be able to

798
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,860
find the murderer soon.

799
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,710
We will be investigation partners

800
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,710
in the future!

801
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,330
Here.

802
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,150
Sure.

803
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,220
Stupid woman.

804
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,940
She knows I am a clean freak.

805
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,330
She touched my hand and went on to touch others.

806
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,330
Young Master Han,

807
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,370
you're my first Qi friend.

808
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,150
What a coincidence.

809
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,230
He's also my first

810
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,780
Qi friend.

811
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,370
Really?

812
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,380
The Qi are different

813
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,140
from you.

814
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,600
We don't need friends.

815
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,810
Please don't mind him, Your Highness.

816
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,010
That's how the Qi are.

817
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,380
They like to be alone,

818
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,700
and doesn't like to come into contact with other people.

819
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,990
If you touch him,

820
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,000
he'll feel like

821
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,450
as if he was struck by lightning.

822
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,310
How about this?

823
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,210
I'll shake hands with you for him.

824
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:49,700
Okay.

825
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,170
Here.

826
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:50,720
Sure.

827
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,590
We've been talking for so long.

828
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,570
We haven't had tea yet.

829
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,100
Let's go.

830
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,740
Let's go eat some snacks.

831
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,270
Let's go.

832
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,270
These snacks

833
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,650
were made by my friend.

834
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,250
It's good.

835
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,020
His residence is not far from my residence.

836
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,740
So he often

837
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,860
delivers me some.

838
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,800
That friend of yours made this?

839
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,110
It looks delicious.

840
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,030
By the way, Prince Jun,

841
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,500
I have a favour to ask.

842
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,190
Here's the thing.

843
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,090
My mother

844
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,140
likes

845
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,560
eating snacks like this.

846
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,500
The Dragon Boat Festival

847
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,360
is coming soon.

848
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,280
I want to make

849
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,830
some unique snacks for her.

850
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,530
I wonder if Your Highness

851
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,160
could introduce this friend

852
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,920
to me?

853
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,580
I would like to learn from them.

854
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,240
How's that?

855
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,780
Well...

856
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,890
Is it not convenient?

857
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,730
Not really.

858
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,820
He's an imperial chef.

859
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,370
For the Dragon Boat Festival,

860
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,100
he has been busy preparing for the banquet to be held in the palace.

861
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,180
If you're in a hurry,

862
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,180
you can only go to the palace with me.

863
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,050
Is that troublesome?

864
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:00,810
Not at all.

865
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,050
I just need you to change into

866
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,010
a maid's clothes

867
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,410
and pretend to be my maid.

868
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:06,810
That's nothing.

869
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,610
I can do that.

870
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,680
Prince Jun,

871
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,870
can you bring this Qi bumpkin

872
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,740
in too

873
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,770
with us?

874
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,190
Let him see a whole new world.

875
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,910
Since you asked,

876
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,370
of course it's no problem.

877
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,850
It's a deal then.

878
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,390
Sir and Miss,

879
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,370
His Highness ordered to send you off.

880
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,500
Where are you going?

881
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,700
I'm going home.

882
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,580
Wait.

883
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,420
If it's a Prince's Residence's cart

884
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,620
going through a pass,

885
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,690
you don't need a pass document right?

886
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,500
Of course not.

887
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,650
Who dares to make things difficult for Prince Jun's Residence?

888
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,330
Let's go then.

889
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,390
To the East Market.

890
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,180
What for?

891
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,230
Let me show you

892
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,840
the delicacies

893
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:02,970
of Qi.

894
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,140
The delicacies of Qi?

895
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,310
Sure.

896
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,980
I happen to be hungry.

897
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,510
Let's go.

898
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,270
[Qiwei Restaurant]

899
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,290
Here, have some.

900
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:17,550
Drink.

901
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,260
This is delicious.

902
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,740
Sirs, your towel is here.

903
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:20,990
Thank you.

904
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,650
Is this the delicacy you mentioned?

905
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,500
If you don't taste it,

906
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,430
how do you know it's not delicious?

907
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,710
No, thank you.

908
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,400
I'm full looking at these.

909
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,580
I told you

910
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,530
this is the best restaurant.

911
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,420
It is not bad indeed.

912
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,660
Seems like the Qi men in Jiuxiao City

913
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,420
have a societal hierarchy too.

914
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,810
All the people here

915
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,750
are rich people in fancy clothes.

916
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,110
Besides, isn't it said that

917
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,370
Qi men like to be alone?

918
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,890
But I see many people

919
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,840
sitting close together

920
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,770
on the same table

921
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,150
with no distance.

922
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,550
Why are you

923
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,080
so far away from me?

924
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,780
I'm used to being alone.

925
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,770
If you're too close,

926
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,230
I'll feel uncomfortable.

927
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,380
Did something happen

928
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,460
when you were young?

929
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,520
Or have any trauma?

930
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,610
I just think

931
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,390
when I'm alone,

932
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,220
I'm more alert

933
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,560
and won't be affected by emotions.

934
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,730
That sounds nice.

935
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,420
But I think you just don't have any friends.

936
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,060
Do you want to die?

937
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,380
I was

938
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,600
just kidding.

939
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,630
Why are you so triggered

940
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,620
and anxious?

941
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,440
Could it be...

942
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,430
I was right?

943
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,510
Right?

944
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,100
A normal Qian man like you

945
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,300
can't understand me.

946
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:54,940
You

947
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,580
should eat something

948
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,030
for your health.

949
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,920
No–

950
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,240
It seems

951
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,220
quite delicious.

952
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,360
Try this.

953
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,940
Pour some sesame oil

954
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,200
and it'd taste better.

955
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,500
Look, it's a Qian-Qi couple.

956
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,260
That Qian woman actually

957
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,470
eats Qi food.

958
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,860
The man is quite gentle.

959
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,190
He even fed her himself.

960
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,060
Stop talking. Let's go.

961
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,590
Oh right,

962
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,360
let's meet at our old place,

963
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,700
Huaide Workshop, at 5PM tomorrow.

964
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,620
We're going into the palace together.

965
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,020
No.

966
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,460
Why?

967
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:52,870
Didn't we agree?

968
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:53,950
To make me pretend to be

969
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:54,970
a Qian...

970
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,350
eunuch.

971
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,070
Do you think it's possible?

972
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,350
Why not?

973
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,180
It's just pretending.

974
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,380
What's my identity.

975
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,140
To be an–

976
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,150
I just can't.

977
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,250
What's your identity?

978
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,470
I thought you were rich.

979
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,670
You always

980
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,690
looked so proud.

981
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,300
In the end,

982
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,260
you took Liu Fu's gold

983
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,460
behind my back.

984
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,110
You're just

985
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,200
putting up a front.

986
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,080
Do you want to know?

987
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,800
If I tell you,

988
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,450
you will be killed.

989
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:31,020
Tell me then.

990
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:31,890
Scare me.
