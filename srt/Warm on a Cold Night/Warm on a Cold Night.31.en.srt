4
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,200
We won't leave

5
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,580
until we see Prince Jun.

6
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,440
We won't leave!

7
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,900
We won't leave!

8
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,340
We won't go back!

9
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,620
We won't leave if you don't let His Highness go!

10
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,500
Let His Highness go!

11
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,340
Let His Highness go!

12
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,740
We won't leave if you don't.

13
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,270
We won't leave if you don't.

14
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,630
General.

15
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,570
It's Miss Jiu'er and Prince Jun.

16
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,580
I'll go help.

17
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,160
They must be looking for us

18
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,460
through making so much noise.

19
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,820
There must be news about Han Zheng.

20
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,980
We won't leave.

21
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,540
Release him! Release him!

22
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,260
We are not afraid!

23
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,300
Not afraid!

24
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,030
Don't move!

25
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:09,860
What should we do?

26
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,020
Let's see who dares to move.

27
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,580
Step back.

28
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,260
Here!

29
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,020
Jun!

30
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,340
It's the general!

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,620
General and Keha!

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,460
What should we do now?

33
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,590
Think of something!

34
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,470
Liu Fu, use your ultimate move!

35
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,140
He hit me! Charge! He hit me!

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,820
Send people! Is there still law?

37
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,810
He hit me!

38
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,940
He hit me!

39
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:34,220
He hit me! Send people!

40
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,740
He's hitting me!

41
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,180
He's hitting me!

42
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,030
General!

43
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,740
Keha!

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,540
I know where Han Zheng is!

45
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,300
He's in a cave.

46
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,700
Wait.

47
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,510
Let's talk over there.

48
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,380
Let's go.

49
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,820
Here.

50
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,720
It should be safe here.

51
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,380
Jiu'er,

52
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,420
why are you here

53
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,060
with Prince Jun?

54
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,460
I know where Han Zheng is.

55
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,080
I ate his Qi Vital Stone

56
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,780
and saw him in my dream.

57
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,500
I...

58
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,550
Princess Heyin.

59
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,020
Heyin?

60
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:18,980
Princess?

61
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,900
Brother Jun!

62
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,820
Brother Jun.

63
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,150
Why are you here?

64
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,350
Brother Jun,

65
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,420
tell me,

66
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,260
why does my father want to kill Han Zheng?

67
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,820
Also,

68
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,500
what are you doing here?

69
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,160
What does my father want to do?

70
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,310
Oh right, Heyin,

71
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,220
you've been playing here since you were a kid,

72
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,100
you know this place best.

73
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,700
Tell me

74
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,579
where the cave is.

75
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,020
It's a

76
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,060
deep and big cave.

77
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:42,500
Yes.

78
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,060
Answer my question first.

79
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,320
Why does my father want to kill Han Zheng?

80
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,420
Princess Heyin,

81
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,579
please tell us.

82
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,900
If we don't leave now,

83
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,380
Han Zheng is going to die!

84
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,220
Die?

85
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,020
Yes!

86
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,579
You don't want your father

87
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,180
to become a murderer, right?

88
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,530
There is a huge cave

89
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,100
in the downstream of the river over there.

90
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,180
I'll take you there.

91
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,780
All right.

92
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,150
Marquis.

93
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,220
Some people broke into the cave.

94
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,150
Prince Jun seems to be part of them.

95
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:13,700
What?

96
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,140
You useless bunch!

97
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,070
I deserve to die.

98
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,740
Our men are all at the gate

99
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,339
trying to stop Prince Jun's men.

100
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,019
We don't have any more manpower.

101
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,880
Besides, there are also two Qi men

102
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,860
among those who barged in.

103
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,330
Qi men?

104
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,800
They are very skilled.

105
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,980
Marquis, what should we do now?

106
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,860
Not only that prince,

107
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,860
but also all the Qi men

108
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,900
we kidnapped from the Starry Night

109
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,460
are captured in that cave.

110
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,700
We can only destroy the evidence by destroying their corpse.

111
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,820
Come.

112
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,860
Hurry.

113
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,700
Brother Jun!

114
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,500
Let go!

115
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,080
Go quickly!

116
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:17,820
Go!

117
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,820
Be careful.

118
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,590
Prepare all the wicks that leads to the gunpowder

119
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,200
in the cave.

120
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:37,620
Yes.

121
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,020
Yes.

122
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,780
Save me...

123
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,060
Han Zheng... Han Zheng!

124
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,260
Where are you?

125
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,340
What did they do wrong?

126
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,300
Why are they locked up here?

127
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,590
I'll tell you later.

128
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,700
Kill me.

129
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,850
Don't worry. You will be saved soon.

130
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,780
Here.

131
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,740
Be careful.

132
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,100
Wait here.

133
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,280
I'll be right back.

134
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:36,740
Go find Han Zheng.

135
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,340
Okay.

136
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,330
Han Zheng!

137
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,620
Han Zheng!

138
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,740
Han Zheng!

139
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,540
Han Zheng!

140
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,540
Han–

141
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,460
Han Zheng!

142
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,900
Han Zheng!

143
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,160
Han Zheng, wake up!

144
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,140
Han Zheng!

145
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,380
Han Zheng!

146
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,280
Don't scare me, Han Zheng!

147
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,980
Han Zheng!

148
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,460
Han Zheng!

149
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,750
Han Zheng...

150
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,260
Jiu'er.

151
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,300
You finally found me.

152
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,250
Han Zheng...

153
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,260
You scared me.

154
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,320
You're finally awake.

155
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,740
I finally found you.

156
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,380
Why did this happen?

157
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,100
Why would Father

158
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,360
capture Han Zheng?

159
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,180
Marquis, Marquis! This...

160
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,740
Marquis,

161
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,300
they're going to leave soon.

162
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,770
It'll be too late if we don't blow it up.

163
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,660
Fool.

164
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,940
The princess is still inside.

165
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,500
Marquis,

166
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,300
what should we do now?

167
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,380
I'm afraid we won't be able to

168
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,740
keep whats in the cave a secret anymore.

169
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,340
They won't get out of the hunting ground alive.

170
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,020
The most important thing now

171
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,660
is to protect Heyin!

172
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,580
Hurry up.

173
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:06,940
Go.

174
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,460
Go!

175
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,900
Oh no.

176
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,620
Go!

177
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,420
Heyin!

178
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,860
Heyin is taken away!

179
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,340
Watch Han Zheng

180
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
My Heyin!

181
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
- Father!
-Heyin!

182
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,540
Father!

183
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,140
Are you okay, Father?

184
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,740
I'm glad you're fine.

185
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,420
I'm glad you're fine.

186
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,060
Come.

187
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,780
Shoot!

188
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,100
- Don't shoot.
- Heyin!

189
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,180
There are still people inside!

190
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:53,860
- Heyin.
- Father.

191
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,460
Brother Jun is still inside.

192
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,540
Protect His Highness.

193
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,540
I'll go save them!

194
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,860
Don't shoot.

195
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,980
Brother Jun is still inside.

196
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,580
Why are you still thinking about

197
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,900
that traitor?

198
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,230
Set the fire!

199
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,380
Stop!

200
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,940
Heyin!

201
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,860
Father, Brother Jun is still inside.

202
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,260
- You can't set it on fire!
- Enough!

203
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:32,720
Father!

204
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,420
Heyin!

205
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,700
Are they more important

206
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,020
or your father?

207
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,220
Father...

208
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,260
Catch her!

209
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,420
Don't kill my father!

210
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,500
Go!

211
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,420
Go!

212
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:25,740
Quick!

213
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,470
Brother Jun!

214
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,940
Liu Fu, go after him!

215
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,580
Yes.

216
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,900
Protect Marquis Hou!

217
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,580
Protect–

218
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,380
Your Highness.

219
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,450
Get up quickly!

220
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,500
Father.

221
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,910
I won't run anymore.

222
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,900
I can't run anymore, Father.

223
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,580
Those locked up in those caves

224
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,840
are bad people, right?

225
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,780
That's why you

226
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,640
locked them up.

227
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,260
And that Han Zheng...

228
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,960
Father made a mistake, right?

229
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,580
They are all bad people.

230
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,740
Father is the good person.

231
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,300
Father is a good man, right?

232
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,340
Old man.

233
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:13,980
Run!

234
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,540
Father!

235
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,900
You are dead!

236
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,180
Stop!

237
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,230
I'm going to take your life!

238
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:39,740
Hurry!

239
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,900
Take us away!

240
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
Father!

241
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,300
Father!

242
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,620
Father!

243
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,380
Father!

244
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,760
Father, hang in there. Father...

245
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,860
Father!

246
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,100
Father!

247
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,340
Father!

248
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,660
Father!

249
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,940
Father!

250
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,340
Father!

251
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,460
Father, don't go.

252
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,300
Heyin!

253
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,300
Father, don't leave me alone.

254
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,140
Father!

255
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,940
Heyin.

256
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,580
Father!

257
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,420
Here.

258
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,550
Are you okay?

259
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,980
I'm fine.

260
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,380
I heard that Prince Han

261
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,580
is severely injured.

262
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,260
I asked Jiu'er and Keha

263
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,520
to send him back first.

264
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,180
Go get Imperial Physician Liu

265
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,140
to Prince Han's residence to treat him.

266
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,580
Yes.

267
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,380
Prince Jun.

268
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,860
Help bandage them.

269
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:02,740
Yes.

270
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,060
Crown Prince.

271
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Be careful.

272
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,350
Are you okay?

273
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,480
Uncle Xian is dead.

274
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,180
I know.

275
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,670
I didn't expect this to happen.

276
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,160
I just wanted to save Brother Han.

277
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,660
Why did this happen?

278
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,900
The person who killed him

279
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,020
was the murderer.

280
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,270
But at the end of the day,

281
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,000
it was uncle who did something wrong.

282
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,100
Who is that person?

283
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,700
Why did he kill Uncle Xian?

284
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,420
I saw my uncle

285
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,680
saying this to the man:

286
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,960
"Hurry, take us away."

287
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,480
They must know each other!

288
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:42,910
Brother,

289
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,400
you have to help me.

290
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,150
Help me find that person, okay?

291
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,460
Okay.

292
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,860
You're tired.

293
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,340
Go back and rest.

294
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,940
Leave this to me.

295
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,420
Here.

296
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,140
Here.

297
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

298
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,940
Forgive me for being rude.

299
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,380
There's something in the cave.

300
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,540
I want to take Your Highness

301
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,340
to have a look.

302
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,620
If I didn't see it with my own eyes,

303
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,350
it would be hard to believe that

304
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,660
Uncle Xian would do

305
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,260
such an unforgivable thing.

306
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,180
I thought Marquis Xian was the one

307
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,940
who manipulated the Qi Vital Stone business.

308
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,700
Unexpectedly,

309
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,160
he got murdered so easily.

310
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,070
It shows that

311
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,940
there has to be someone even bigger behind him.

312
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,860
I promised you

313
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,300
to investigate the trade of Qi Vital Stone

314
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,630
and cut off this business from its source.

315
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,230
I am a man of my words.

316
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,580
But there aren't many people in Jiuxiao City

317
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,460
who have greater power than Marquis Xian.

318
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,420
If Your Highness keeps investigating,

319
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,300
and find out that it's someone that you can't touch...

320
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,340
Marquis Xian is my mother's brother.

321
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,410
Even with no evidence,

322
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:58,820
I helped you to get into

323
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,260
the western suburbs' hunting ground.

324
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,720
Isn't this enough to prove

325
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,800
my determination to eliminate evil?

326
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,580
In that case, I, Chilan,

327
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,810
shall thank Your Highness on behalf of

328
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,260
the Qi people in Jiuxiao City.

329
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,940
Make sure the truth comes out.

330
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,360
But you need to be mentally prepared.

331
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,520
From what I know about Father,

332
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,460
I'm afraid this matter can't be

333
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,920
investigate in the light.

334
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,510
Let's go.

335
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,020
The Siren Murder case

336
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,580
was done by Marquis Xian?

337
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,300
It's him?

338
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:34,700
It's him?

339
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,140
Marquis Xian...

340
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,140
resisted arrest

341
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,160
and was killed on the spot.

342
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,140
This...

343
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,300
This is so scary!

344
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,260
Exactly.

345
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,220
He got lucky.

346
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,950
He killed so many people

347
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,390
selling Qi Vital Stone.

348
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,740
In my opinion,

349
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,500
we have to confiscate his house

350
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,740
and divide his unjust wealth.

351
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,260
We should divide his money.

352
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,780
Why are you, a Qi, so excited about this?

353
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,260
What?

354
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,020
Us Qi's lives

355
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,780
is not a life?

356
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,260
I didn't say that.

357
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,740
Don't make trouble.

358
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,620
What do you mean?

359
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,420
What do you mean?

360
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,480
That's what I mean.

361
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,780
Do it!

362
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,980
Stop fighting!

363
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,339
Stop! Stop!

364
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,310
How dare you!

365
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,180
You Qian people caused so much harm

366
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:11,280
[Notice]

367
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,970
to us Qi

368
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,770
and now you want to chase us away?

369
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,900
What a jerk.

370
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:27,930
Wait.

371
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,940
My father gave this to me.

372
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,180
You can't take it away.

373
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,040
Your Highness.

374
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,500
Marquis bought these

375
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,830
with ill-gotten gains.

376
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,500
It must be confiscated by the state treasury.

377
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,160
We're just following orders.

378
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,940
My father painted these himself.

379
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,980
[Heyin's gift, 8-year-old birthday]

380
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,160
He didn't buy this.

381
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,940
We're just doing our job.

382
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,020
If you keep doing this,

383
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,020
we'll arrest you.

384
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,310
You can't go.

385
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,730
Move.

386
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,140
Be polite.

387
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,150
She's a princess after all.

388
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,060
Brother Li,

389
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,290
she won't be a princess any more in two days.

390
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,500
Have you ever seen a princess

391
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,900
whose father is a murderer?

392
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,630
Who are you calling a murderer?

393
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,260
This is a gift my father gave to me

394
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,980
on my birthday.

395
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,420
Give it to me.

396
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,150
Give it to me.

397
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:09,660
Let go!

398
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,380
Give it to me!

399
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:10,780
Let go!

400
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,780
Move!

401
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,230
How dare you bite me?

402
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,270
All right, get back to work.

403
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,380
Mr. Wei from Nanfeng Studio

404
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,550
specially painted this for Heyin.

405
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,420
Look.

406
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,660
The deer's eyes

407
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,420
are like Heyin's.

408
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,060
Look.

409
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,500
I don't want it.

410
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,360
I don't want it.

411
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,780
I don't want the deer!

412
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,660
I want mother!

413
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,140
I want mother!

414
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,580
Look.

415
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,460
Next to the deer

416
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,500
is its mother.

417
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,620
Just like

418
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,860
Heyin's mother,

419
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,260
she will always be by your side

420
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,280
and has never left you.

421
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,740
I want to paint too.

422
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,500
Sure.

423
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,620
What is this?

424
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,060
This is Father.

425
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,580
Princess.

426
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,020
Sorry.

427
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,420
Sorry, Heyin.

428
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,100
If I didn't take you

429
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,300
to look for Han Zheng,

430
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,220
this wouldn't have happened,

431
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,500
right?

432
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,900
I'm sorry.

433
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,260
I used you.

434
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,260
But...

435
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,100
If I didn't do this,

436
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,060
Han Zheng would've died.

437
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,190
Many people would've died too.

438
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,660
Then why are you so nice

439
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,340
to them?

440
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,960
You're so nice to everyone

441
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,660
but so bad to me.

442
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,250
From now on,

443
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,660
I will treat you very well.

444
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,900
I-I'll give my everything

445
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,240
to make it up to you.

446
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,140
I don't want you.

447
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,180
I don't want you!

448
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,580
I only want my father!

449
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,020
I don't want you!

450
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,460
I only want my father!

451
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,020
Father!

452
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,980
I don't want you! I don't!

453
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,300
The Inspection bureau received an order.

454
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,780
They want to put the blame of

455
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,380
the Siren Murder case and the

456
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,540
trade of Qi Vital Stone on Marquis Xian.

457
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,180
They want to appease

458
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,380
the people

459
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,870
as soon as possible.

460
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
Marquis Xian

461
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,540
was murdered.

462
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,300
But the notice says

463
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,220
he got killed while resisting his arrest.

464
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,080
But now that Marquis Xian is dead,

465
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,840
and the clues are gone.

466
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,580
There's no way to investigate.

467
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,780
When I was in the cave,

468
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,030
Marquis Xian

469
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,990
mentioned an organization

470
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,450
called Snow Chamber.

471
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,420
The organization

472
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,980
with a snowflake emblem.

473
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,860
That's right.

474
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,260
The jade ring that Marquis Xian

475
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,900
brought around with him has a snowflake emblem

476
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,420
on the inside of it.

477
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,300
It should be the symbol of the Snow Chamber.

478
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:29,980
If so,

479
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,020
the person who killed Marquis Xian

480
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,180
should be someone from the Snow Chamber.

481
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,780
I also heard Marquis Xian say

482
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,340
they are preparing a big gift

483
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,340
for the Qi race.

484
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,380
A big gift?

485
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,980
Then...

486
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,460
do they have

487
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,200
another ulterior motive?

488
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,580
We're in the dark now.

489
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,130
We can only wait and see.

490
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,420
Oh right,

491
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,980
when the Inspection Bureau

492
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,860
was searching Marquis Xian's residence

493
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,460
was there any new discovery?

494
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,260
There were many treasures,

495
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,540
but we didn't find

496
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,620
anything that is

497
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,020
related to the ember.

498
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,700
In a while, Nameless Art Gallery

499
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,580
will return everything

500
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,380
here.

501
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,460
Let's go

502
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,080
take another look.

503
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,340
Let's go.

504
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,620
Let's go interrogate

505
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,820
the shopkeeper of Nameless Art Gallery

506
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,660
and see if we can

507
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,990
get anything out of him.

508
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,690
[Inspection Bureau]

509
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,860
Chen Li.

510
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,860
Are all of Marquis Xian's

511
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,020
belongings here?

512
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,500
These belong to Marquis Xian's residence.

513
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,560
Those are from Nameless Art Gallery.

514
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,980
We're putting them here for tonight.

515
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,710
They will be submitted to the treasury tomorrow.

516
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,420
Let's go.

517
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,140
Lass.

518
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,020
What are you looking for?

519
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,680
You're being all mysterious.

520
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,830
It's none of your business.

521
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,140
Let's go.

522
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,380
Boss.

523
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,700
This Han Zheng really

524
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,100
doesn't treat himself as an outsider.

525
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,180
He's going in and out of the Inspection Bureau

526
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,240
like it's his home.

527
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,260
Is there anything you can do?

528
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,460
The Commander has agreed.

529
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,500
Can you stop him?

530
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,550
I knew it wouldn't be there.

531
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,660
You knew?

532
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,540
In the cave,

533
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,620
in order to get some words out of Marquis Xian,

534
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,180
I told him the content of

535
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,140
the letter.

536
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,860
You know about this letter?

537
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,840
But the information is wrong.

538
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
The Holy Fire

539
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,660
is still in our country.

540
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,580
Impossible.

541
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,620
Us Snow Chamber's information

542
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,780
can never be wrong.

543
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,710
The reaction that Marquis Xian gave me

544
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
made me feel that the ember

545
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,340
is not in his hands

546
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,200
nor in Snow Chamber's.

547
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,860
If the Snow Chamber

548
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,460
didn't get the ember either,

549
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,020
where could the ember be?

550
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,540
Could it be...

551
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,020
Muyan has it?

552
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,680
Brother Li.

553
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,500
I have already set things up with Shopkeeper Li.

554
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,230
Okay, got it.

555
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,820
Let's go interrogate Shopkeeper Li first.

556
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,480
Shopkeeper Li,

557
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,980
we meet again.

558
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,500
Inspector Su.

559
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,610
I didn't expect this would be how we meet again

560
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,620
after a few months.

561
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,490
Prince Han,

562
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,500
I deeply sympathize with you.

563
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:46,740
But...

564
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,140
I had no choice.

565
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,260
Please don't mind it.

566
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,620
It's okay.

567
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,050
I

568
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,180
and am exceptional at holding grudges.

569
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,420
I'm just an accountant.

570
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,200
I run errands for the Marquis occasionally.

571
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,460
I didn't do anything bad.

572
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:03,980
I...

573
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,620
The business of Marquis Xian kidnapping Qi

574
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,420
started from the rumor of the Daylight Water vessel?

575
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:13,940
Yes.

576
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,500
In the beginning, the Qi Vital Stone

577
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,360
transacted in this business were

578
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,740
willingly sold by the Qi people.

579
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,160
But unexpectedly,

580
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,260
it became unstoppable.

581
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,960
The price of Qi Vital Stone

582
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,900
skyrocketed.

583
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,660
Many years ago,

584
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,790
I mentioned to Marquis Hou that

585
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,020
there was a ship that goes between

586
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,820
Shuobei and Jiuxiao City.

587
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,220
The people on the boat

588
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,700
would disappear after

589
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,820
arriving at the port

590
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,260
mysteriously.

591
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,580
Later, there was a rumor that

592
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,140
they were all eaten by a siren.

593
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,340
So the Marquis used this rumor

594
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,180
to kidnap Qi people.

595
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,180
Causing accidents on the vessel

596
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,820
and kidnapping

597
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,060
so many Qi people

598
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,660
is not

599
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,700
a simple thing.

600
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,500
Did Marquis Xian orchestrate this

601
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,360
all by himself?

602
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,290
I'm sure.

603
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,970
It's all by himself.

604
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,180
Have you heard of Snow Chamber?

605
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,220
No.

606
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,460
Let me show you another thing.

607
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,060
Have you seen this before?

608
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,540
It looks familiar.

609
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,480
This is the emblem on the ring that

610
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,260
Marquis Xian never takes off.

611
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,590
Have you every seen this

612
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,190
somewhere else before?

613
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,180
N-No.

614
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,460
You don't know anything.

615
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,600
You must know very well

616
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,740
what is done to the Qi people

617
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,620
in the cave.

618
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,640
Do you want to try it yourself?

619
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
No, no, no.

620
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,420
I-I really don't know.

621
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,980
At the beginning,

622
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,580
I didn't agree

623
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,020
what Marquis Xian does.

624
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,660
But

625
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,100
I have

626
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,420
a sick mother

627
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,820
I need to take care of.

628
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,140
I–

629
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,540
The Crown Prince is here.

630
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,720
Your Highness.

631
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,000
Your Highness.

632
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,500
Prince Han,

633
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,540
Miss Jiu'er,

634
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,180
at ease.

635
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,660
What brings you here, Your Highness?

636
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,180
Although the case was closed

637
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,440
to appease the people,

638
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,060
we all know that

639
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,140
there must be a lot more people

640
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,060
who must be involved in this

641
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,220
behind Marquis Xian.

642
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,620
I must find out the truth.

643
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,260
How is the interrogation going?

644
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,780
Other than the first few things he mentioned,

645
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,980
he said nothing else.

646
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,020
It's not that I'm not saying anything.

647
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,890
I-it's because

648
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,360
I don't know anything.

649
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,620
It's all right.

650
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,580
Leave it to us.

651
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,340
This Crown Prince

652
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,230
is Wen Jun's brother after all.

653
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,100
He looks gentle.

654
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,460
Do you think

655
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,160
he really can interrogate the criminal?

656
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,870
Your Highness, I have already said everything I–

657
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,620
I know...

658
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,860
I really don't know

659
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,980
anything more.

660
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,660
I...

661
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,060
Crown–

662
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,100
It seems

663
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,380
you worried too much.

664
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,660
I will speak!

665
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,590
I will speak.

666
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,070
There's no rush.

667
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,720
Think about it.

668
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,460
Once you're done thinking, you can say them all in one go.

669
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,660
I'm done...

670
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,620
I'm done...

671
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,500
thinking...

672
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,580
Please come in.

673
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,520
I really don't know

674
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,980
about Snow Chamber.

675
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,060
But

676
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,220
every time Marquis Xian

677
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,700
is meeting a certain big figure,

678
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,120
he doesn't allow us to follow him.

679
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,180
Who is it?

680
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,740
Administer Deng.

681
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,500
Administer Deng.

682
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,580
Bring him to the Law Department.

683
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,570
Yes, sir

684
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,300
I do remember this

685
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,860
Administer Deng.

686
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,260
We met him when

687
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,380
we were punished

688
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,820
Administer Deng has never formed a clique.

689
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,300
He has always been nice

690
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,420
towards trade with the State of Qi.

691
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,500
Could it be that

692
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,060
he just named anymore?

693
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,060
It doesn't seem that way.

694
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,620
Administer Deng commands hundreds of officials

695
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,780
and is revered by many.

696
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,060
His influence to the court

697
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,190
is higher than mine.

698
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,340
If Shopkeeper Li wants to just

699
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,660
name a random name,

700
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,580
he wouldn't have mentioned him.

701
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,780
Shopkeeper Li mentioned Snow Chamber.

702
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,960
What is that place?

703
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,420
When I was captured

704
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,900
by Marquis Xian,

705
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,060
I heard him mention this organization.

706
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,380
It seems to be

707
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,780
an organization that has a lot of information.

708
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,980
Marquis Xian is also one of them.

709
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,440
Your Highness,

710
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,860
have you ever heard of it?

711
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,200
It's my first time hearing it.

712
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,110
Is Administer Deng from Snow Chamber?

713
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,510
With Marquis Xian on the front,

714
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,580
and Administer Deng under the table...

715
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,940
Could there be

716
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,620
many officials who are involved

717
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,880
in this organization.

718
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,380
Ridiculous.

719
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,860
In the court,

720
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,300
it's a taboo to form cliques for personal gain.

721
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,940
I need to find out what's going on

722
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,140
in this Snow Chamber.

723
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,790
Administer Deng is in a high position.

724
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,780
If he really

725
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,620
is involved,

726
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:28,860
even if we want to investigate,

727
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,460
it'd be hard for us to do much.

728
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,980
It'll be great if we could have

729
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,240
Your Highness's help.

730
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,060
I will investigate in secret.

731
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,260
If anything happens,

732
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,140
I might still need the

733
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,670
Inspection Bureau's help.

734
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,470
After being busy for the whole day,

735
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,100
I finally finished my job.

736
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,820
Now that you're done with your job,

737
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,500
it's time to do something that isn't work.

738
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,260
What is it?

739
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,260
Besides investigating cases,

740
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,690
do you have

741
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,750
any other hobbies?

742
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,780
Does eating good food count?

743
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,460
What else?

744
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,630
Eat sugar drops.

745
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,710
Besides eating,

746
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,620
is there anything else?

747
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,740
Let's go to the bathhouse then.

748
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,380
Okay.

749
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,540
Today,

750
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,500
let's go eat something delicious,

751
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,460
buy sugar drops,

752
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,480
and take you to the bathhouse.

753
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,740
All expenses tonight will be

754
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
on my tab tonight.

755
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,820
You mean

756
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,220
we're going on a date–

757
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,100
Going to hang out together?

758
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,660
We're not hanging out.

759
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,140
I'm treating you.

760
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,870
Let's go.

761
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:28,940
Wait.

762
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,050
You're treating me?

763
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,140
You just said you will keep it

764
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,260
on your tab.

765
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,700
Don't tell me you want me to pay you back?

766
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,620
Fool.

767
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,460
You're the fool.

768
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,340
Thank you.

769
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:02,860
Have it.

770
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,860
I'll eat this.

771
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,350
- Is it sticky?
- Yes.

772
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,490
Sugar drops!

773
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,080
Miss, have some drops.

774
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,260
I want 300 grams.

775
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,910
Thank you, boss.

776
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,140
You can't choose.

777
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,070
You can only take

778
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,760
whatever a scoop gets you.

779
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,580
The yellow one is so sour.

780
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,620
How can I eat it?

781
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,350
I don't want it anymore.

782
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,140
Jiu'er.

783
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,740
You bought it all.

784
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,520
How much did that cost?

785
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,580
I'm generous.

786
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,080
Go pick as you wish.

787
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,700
Oh right,

788
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,300
I can pick what I want.

789
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,230
You pick,

790
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,620
I'll catch it for you.

791
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,540
Put it here.

792
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,740
Give me the petals.

793
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,980
Which one do you want?

794
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,180
The bubbles are quite comfortable.

795
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,660
Indeed.

796
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,580
Milk bath

797
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,860
is the best.

798
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,139
So you like milk bath the most.

799
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:28,929
The water is cold.

800
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,500
Add hot water!

801
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,580
Stop.

802
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,560
I meant add hot water in there.

803
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,239
They didn't ask for it.

804
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,420
I'm telling you to add it, so just do it.

805
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,420
Cut the crap.

806
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,380
Add hot water to the female bath.

807
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,800
What are you doing tomorrow morning?

808
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,990
Do the roll call,

809
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,260
patrol the streets.

810
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,500
and organize the cases.

811
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,260
That's all.

812
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,950
I'll go with you.

813
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,580
What else can you do?

814
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,900
You are the high-end assistant I recruited

815
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,230
with 20 taels of silver.

816
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,220
Of course you have to accompany me.

817
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,020
You're right.

818
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,820
Now that you mention it,

819
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,880
I remember now that

820
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,660
you haven't paid my salary

821
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,780
for this month.

822
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,460
I...

823
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,180
I only have sugar drops.

824
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,740
Give me your hand.

825
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,540
Here.

826
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,650
Paid.

827
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,780
Thank you.

828
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,550
I'll treat you to candy.

829
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,030
I don't want it.a

830
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,400
They're already so sweet.

831
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,390
Jiu'er refuses to admit to it every time I ask.

832
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,980
I'd like to see

833
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,460
how long it will take you guys

834
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,860
to walk such a short path.

835
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,100
I'm home.

836
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,740
I'm going in then.

837
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:15,940
Okay.

838
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,110
I'm really leaving.

839
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,460
Go ahead.

840
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,020
Wait.

841
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,020
What's wrong?

842
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,260
Have you replenished enough health

843
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,580
for today?

844
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,940
I think I'm still short of a little.

845
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,300
Just right,

846
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,140
let's stay a little longer then.

847
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,660
Sure.

848
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,710
They're holding hands.

849
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,580
By the way,

850
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,100
I was a little drunk

851
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,620
when we were eating hotpot a few days ago.

852
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,220
Did I say any nonsense?

853
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,890
Why are you laughing?

854
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,500
You were so bold that day.

855
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,100
You rubbed my head

856
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,740
and pinched my face.

857
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,220
But as to what you said that day,

858
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,380
are you sure you want to know?

859
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,020
I...

860
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,220
What did I say?

861
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,580
You said

862
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,380
I'm a player.

863
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,120
I brought Heyin to fly,

864
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,380
ate her sugar drops

865
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,540
and said I was going to eat her up.

866
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,460
You also said

867
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,300
I've done everything I've done with you

868
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,580
with her.

869
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,420
How could it be?

870
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,020
How could I say

871
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,980
such a ridiculous thing?

872
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,720
Because...

873
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,100
You must be jealous.

874
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,060
I...

875
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,340
I...

876
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,420
Why should I be jealous because you?

877
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,260
Because...

878
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,700
Because...

879
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,780
You like me.

880
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,700
I don't.

881
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,940
I don't like you.

882
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,790
[He'an Hall]

883
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,470
Enough talking,

884
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,580
I'm going home to sleep.

885
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,490
I'm not done talking

886
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,750
I don't want to hear it.

887
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,140
No.

888
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,620
Jiu'er, listen to me.

889
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,340
Su Jiu'er!

890
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,620
I don't want to hear it. I really–

891
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,340
I like you.

892
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:29,820
I–

893
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,380
Wh-what did you say?

894
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,460
I...

895
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,580
I said

896
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,260
I like you.

897
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,230
I like you more than you like me.

898
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,140
Hua!

899
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,230
Are you alright?

900
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,020
Hua!

901
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,860
Hua, are you alright?

902
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,180
Mother!

Han Zheng.

905
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,680
Well...

906
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,820
The moon is so round today.

907
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,610
There are stars too!

908
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,460
Han Zaheng said he likes me.

909
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,060
He said he likes me.

♫ The naïve feelings, the laughter that starts ♫

♫ There's warmth hidden on your finger tips ♫

915

♫ I want to travel the world with you ♫

♫ The two hearts understand when the night is warm ♫

924
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,660
What's wrong with him?

925
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,500
It's in the middle of the night.

926
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,600
♫ I'll hold you in my arms outside Jiuxiao City ♫

Ouch!

931
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,380
Be gentle, sister.

932
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,780
Why are you shouting?

933
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,020
How can you recover if I don't use my strength?

934
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,150
It's all your fault.

935
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,670
What are you looking at?

936
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,340
Look at my hands.

937
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,660
It hurts.

938
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,220
Jiu'er.

Han Zheng?

946
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,740
Why are you here?

947
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:28,980
You haven't answered

948
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,100
my question.

949
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,860
Jiu'er,

950

right?

952
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:40,620
I...

953
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,560
♫ I will spend the rest of my life with you, I smile towards the long journey ♫

954
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,720
♫ I only wish to enjoy the constellations with you through the long night ♫

955
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,820
♫ Day and night in my dreams ♫

956
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,120
♫ The light in my eyes tell a story ♫

957
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,280
♫ I have no regrets even if it's a the long journey ♫

958
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,340
♫ We'll talk about life and death with love ♫

959
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:21,720
♫ Wind dances with the flowers, rain waters the plants♫

960
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:29,190
♫ To hold only one person's hand forever ♫
