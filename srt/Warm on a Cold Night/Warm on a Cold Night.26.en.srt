4
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,920
How could you ask him to come to our house?

5
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,720
Jiu'er, I have something to say.

6
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,509
What else do you want to say?

7
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,020
I've been thinking about it

8
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,150
over and over again.

9
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,430
I finally recall

10
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,190
when I left the yard of The Western Chamber

11
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,630
with Keyuncha.

12
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,350
I'm sure

13
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,660
Hu told me something like,

14
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,880
"Han, you're acting foolish."

15
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,600
If I had pushed him away

16
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,470
and his head had knocked over the flower bed,

17
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,730
he would have fainted.

18
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,210
How was it possible

19
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,940
for him to say that?

20
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,640
But...

21
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,020
But this is just

22
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,970
your one-sided statement.

23
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,430
Jiu'er.

24
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,480
If there's any falsehood in my words,

25
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,010
I will die a horrible death.

26
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,900
Also, think about it.

27
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,079
If I did it,

28
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,660
why would I come back

29
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,860
to get myself caught?

30
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,820
Since I've been

31
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,650
out of prison,

32
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,320
I could have just walked away

33
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,720
and returned to Shuobei.

34
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,940
Nobody can stop me.

35
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,990
Am I right?

36
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,329
I'm sure

37
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,610
it was done by someone else.

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,360
As long as I find that person,

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,420
I can clear my name.

40
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,470
Uncle Hu

41
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,470
can also rest in peace.

42
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,800
Jiu'er.

43
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,950
Actually, I have doubts too.

44
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,930
If Han Zheng is telling the truth,

45
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,340
not only did we wrong him,

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,130
but the real murderer

47
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,079
was unpunished.

48
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,600
You've been getting along with Han Zheng

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,770
for so long.

50
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,230
Don't you know

51
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,660
what kind of person he is?

52
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,580
Jiu'er. Please trust me.

53
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,500
Okay, I trust you for now.

54
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,590
But you have to go back

55
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,220
to the Inspection Bureau with me first.

56
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,020
Stay there and behave yourself.

57
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,510
I'll find

58
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,890
the culprit who killed Hu on my own.

59
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,680
No, Jiu'er.

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,560
I can go back with you.

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,310
But don't you think

62
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,380
investigating together

63
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,170
is more reliable

64
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:31,790
than working alone?

65
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,560
Yes.

66
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,510
Two people

67
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,340
are much better than one person.

68
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:35,900
Look.

69
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,140
Physician Qin can tell right from wrong.

70
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,010
But you...

71
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,890
Enough.

72
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,180
Let's eat first.

73
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,510
-Come on.
-Physician Qin.

74
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,310
I have some more to say.

75
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,579
I can't go home now.

76
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,750
And I don't have

77
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,640
any money on me.

78
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,430
After thinking back and forth,

79
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,450
I think staying here is the most suitable for me.

80
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,450
Sure, no problem.

81
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,700
No.

82
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,840
I disagree.

83
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,460
It doesn't matter even if you disagree.

84
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,860
Physician Qin is the head of the household.

85
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,060
She has the final say.

86
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,530
Right?

87
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,420
Alright.

88
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,600
Let's eat.

89
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,000
Come on. Let's eat.

90
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,020
Let me help you.

91
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,130
Physician Qin.

92
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,750
Not only are you skillful at medicine,

93
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,550
but you're also good at cooking.

94
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,460
Mother.

95
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,980
Why did you...

96
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,260
Jiu'er.

97
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,430
I trust him.

98
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,030
You should trust him one more time.

99
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,330
Give him some time

100
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,800
to find the real murderer.

101
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,990
Be amenable.

102
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,780
Attagirl.

103
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,380
Come on.

104
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,750
It's time to eat.

105
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,430
Did you see the looks of the man in black

106
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,710
who released you?

107
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:40,740
No.

108
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,540
He wrapped himself tightly.

109
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,740
He even used agarwood

110
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,340
to cover up his smell.

111
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,940
I think he doesn't want me to know

112
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,760
his identity.

113
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,900
That means

114
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,800
you probably know him.

115
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,540
Otherwise, why did he make an unnecessary move

116
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,950
by applying the agarwood?

117
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,750
He is very familiar with prison.

118
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,840
He has the key.

119
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,220
So I suspect

120
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,170
that he is

121
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,140
someone from the Inspection Bureau.

122
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,200
Someone from the Inspection Bureau?

123
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,130
Why did somebody from the Inspection Bureau

124
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,370
release you?

125
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,700
Could it be that he was trying to be kind?

126
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,780
He turned me into a fugitive at the beginning,

127
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,910
and then he caused Jiu'er to be suspended incidentally.

128
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,760
No matter what I think, he must have an ulterior motive.

129
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,620
Look.

130
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,780
Investigating together

131
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,610
is better than working alone.

132
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:30,940
Right?

133
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,340
Of course.

134
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,230
I'm full.

135
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,700
I'll clean up the table.

136
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,300
I'll do it.

137
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,260
Give it to me.

138
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,180
Thank you.

139
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,670
Physician Qin, your bed is ready.

140
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:04,840
Not bad.

141
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,730
Han Zheng.

142
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,730
I want to ask you once again.

143
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,780
Was Hu really not killed by you?

144
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,040
None of my words is falsehood.

145
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,540
You mentioned that every time Jiu'er came close to you,

146
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,940
her symptoms would ease.

147
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,590
Is that true as well?

148
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,520
Your neighbor, Hua,

149
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,380
knows about this.

150
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,710
You can verify with her.

151
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,420
Fine.

152
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,909
You can stay here, then.

153
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,190
Thank you, Physician Qin.

154
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,110
Jiu'er.

155
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,520
It's...

156
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,100
It's late.

157
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,140
Don't bother cleaning up.

158
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,800
Let me do it.

159
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:54,980
Okay.

160
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,000
There is no such thing as a free lunch.

161
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,540
Since you want to stay here,

162
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,000
you have to do some chores.

163
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:52,980
It's done.

164
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,250
Jiu'er.

165
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,740
Are you going to do the laundry?

166
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,180
Let me help you.

167
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,740
This is what I should do.

168
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,190
Go and get some rest.

[Health and Longevity]

This...

171
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,180
Jiu'er.

172
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,230
Jiu'er.

173
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,060
You're already an adult.

174
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,980
Why are you still wearing this kind of clothing?

175
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,580
Do you need to wipe your mouth

176
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,720
after eating?

177

Pervert!

178
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:50,960
Rascal!

179
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,360
No.

180
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:53,730
This...

181
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,780
You're still wearing this with your age,

182
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,700
but you call me a rascal?

183
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
Are you saying

184
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,710
Brother Han moved into your house?

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,060
But I won't allow him to stay for free.

186
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,470
Now he's in charge of

187
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,360
all our chores.

188
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,630
Drink some, Jun.

189
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:29,430
This...

190
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,050
I did

191
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,620
all the chores at home.

192
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,800
How dare you serve him here?

193
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,430
I...

194
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,780
I asked him to stay at my residence,

195
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,640
but he refused.

196
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,600
I gave him money

197
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,340
and asked him to stay at the inn. He refused too.

198
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,940
He said he had a place to stay.

199
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,510
It turns out he went to your house.

200
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:47,950
What?

201
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,700
But he told me

202
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,780
he was cornered

203
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,730
and had no money.

204
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,870
That's why he asked to stay at my house.

205
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,090
-He's so cunning.
-He's so cunning.

206
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,260
I...

207
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,610
Jun.

208
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,980
Let's go.

209
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,570
Regarding the Peony Case, there are five victims

210
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,570
and crime scenes.

211
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,110
We have to check them out

212
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,040
one by one today.

213
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,540
Let's go.

214
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,070
Let's go.

215
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,170
I swallowed my pride for you.

216
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,740
How dare you abandon me

217
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,950
and investigate the case with Wen Jun?

218
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,570
Today, I must find

219
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,700
more clues than you.

220
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,400
So that you would know who is more important.

221
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,420
That's it.

222
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,550
It was hard

223
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,180
to climb,

224
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,230
but I felt refreshed

225
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,940
to see such a beautiful view.

226
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,420
Right?

227
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,070
Jiu'er.

228
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,720
Isn't that because

229
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,130
this is all your family's territory?

230
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,030
Exactly.

231
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,180
It's right ahead. We're arriving. Let's go.

232
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,430
It seems to be

233
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,990
only women's prayers here.

234
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,970
They wished to be more beautiful

235
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,050
and find a good match.

236
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,860
So this is the Beauty Tree.

237
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,870
Beauty Tree?

238
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,770
I heard from the storyteller that

239
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,310
there is a Beauty Tree on Beauty Ridge.

240
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,220
If girls touch it,

241
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,200
and pray sincerely,

242
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,060
they will become

243
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,990
more beautiful.

244
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:34,910
If they're lucky,

245
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,640
they can even find a good match.

246
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,420
I see.

247
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,100
Look.

248
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,510
Why is a man here too?

249
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,910
What is a man doing here?

250
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,960
Is the man coming

251
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,940
to pray?

252
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,840
We are all here to pray for marriage.

253
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,680
Yes.

254
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,190
And I think that girl...

255
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,460
Is he praying

256
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,280
for that girl?

257
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,280
The Beauty Tree

258
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,680
also blesses beauty.

259
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,340
Why is he here?

260
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,430
Yeah. Look at him.

261
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,740
Generally speaking, the Marriage Tree is only for women.

262
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,660
Exactly.

263
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,340
Can our Beauty Tree

264
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,550
still work?

265
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,580
What are they doing here?

266
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,710
Will the tree lose its blessing power?

267
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,100
What bad luck we have!

268
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,600
Exactly.

269
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,530
But the young master

270
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,680
is quite handsome.

271
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,600
Jiu'er.

272
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,000
What are you doing?

273
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,640
I'm thinking about

274
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,600
the female victim who

275
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,460
couldn't be pushed off the cliff

276
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,140
by a man.

277
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,300
Why?

278
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,700
People who come here

279
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,730
are mostly women.

280
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,370
If a man comes,

281
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,280
he'll definitely attract attention

282
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,340
as you did just now.

283
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,380
So it's impossible for her

284
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,620
to allow a strange man

285
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,550
to approach her.

286
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,090
And I clearly remember

287
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,980
the file had written that

288
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,200
the scene

289
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,850
had no sign of struggle.

290
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,730
What if he pushed her down

291
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,820
when she was not paying attention?

292
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,270
Come with me.

293
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,470
Are you afraid

294
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,990
when standing here?

295
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,780
It's a bit high.

296
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,460
She must be scared standing here alone.

297
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,900
How could she give a man the opportunity

298
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,950
to approach her?

299
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,100
Not to mention

300
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,900
a strange man.

301
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,620
Yes.

302
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
The Hongluo Temple we went to before

303
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,820
seems to be a place

304
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,140
where women go often.

305
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:11,920
Yes.

306
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,690
The place where the first female victim was killed

307
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,720
was by the riverside in the suburbs.

308
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,520
It's the same.

309
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,070
The rivers around the suburbs are very fast-flowing.

310
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,100
Also, it's noisy.

311
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,600
Even if the murderer was a woman,

312
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,520
she could sneak behind the victim

313
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,890
and push her down

314
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,730
easily.

315
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,180
The last female victim

316
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,910
was killed in a deserted house.

317
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,250
A woman

318
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,520
could also do it.

319
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,190
I still remember

320
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,080
the four bodies scooped out from the moat,

321
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,890
suspected to include the culprit.

322
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,220
Three of them were men,

323
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,980
and the other was a woman.

324
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,870
Could it be her?

325
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:48,970
That's not right.

326
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,870
Kaka's mother is a Qi.

327
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,940
It's hard for an ordinary woman to do that.

328
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,100
This is

329
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,160
the weirdest part.

330
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,780
I really

331
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,090
don't understand.

332
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,780
Jun, think about it.

333
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,990
Ten years ago,

334
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,400
my father and Uncle Liu

335
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,540
were like us.

336
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,450
They searched here

337
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,310
thoroughly.

338
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,750
Even we could infer that

339
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,150
the murderer was a woman.

340
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,310
Why didn't they?

341
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,910
Could it be...

342
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,390
Uncle Liu.

343
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,900
Based on the description of Jiu'er about Commander Su,

344
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,600
it's impossible for him

345
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,400
to confuse a peony with a moutan.

346
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,910
Why is that file

347
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,600
damaged coincidentally?

348
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,850
Who released me

349
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,110
from prison in secret?

350
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,480
Who caused Jiu'er to be suspended

351
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,600
from participating in the investigation?

352
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,190
Who is this

353
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,900
in the Inspection Bureau?

354
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:52,890
Bin.

355
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,060
Stay at home alone.

356
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,740
Have fun.

357
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,240
Remember not to go out.

358
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,030
Rest assured.

359
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,300
Don't open the door for anyone.

360
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,100
Okay, Father.

361
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:01,790
Be good.

362
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,920
I'll bring you back deep-fried dough sticks.

363
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,980
Thank you, Father.

364
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,819
Father, be careful.

365
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,810
Is it Uncle Liu?

366
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,410
But Uncle Liu is such a good man.

367
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,970
Would he do that?

368
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,440
Bin, come out and have fun with us.

369
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,319
Bin, open the door.

370
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,630
Come out.

371
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,670
Bin, come out.

372
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,030
Bin.

373
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:35,830
Let's...

374
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,260
Let's play soccer together.

375
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,300
Let's go, Bin.

376
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,120
I'm not going.

377
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,370
Father doesn't allow me to go out.

378
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,340
Let's play together.

379
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,580
Hurry.

380
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,440
Silly boy.

381
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,690
No one will protect you this time, right?

382
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,610
Enjoy playing with us

383
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,320
for a while.

384
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,240
-Stop there!
-Don't move.

385
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,760
Your Qi friend

386
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,820
is really cruel.

387
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,780
One of my teeth

388
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,080
was broken by him.

389
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,150
You have to pay me back.

390
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:00,960
Beat him!

391
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,620
Beat him!

392
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,370
Beat him up!

393
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,180
Beat him!

394
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,280
I was wrong.

395
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,630
Please let go of me.

396
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,830
It hurts.

397
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,070
Are you okay?

398
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,470
Here you are.

399
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,590
Go to the alley north of your house.

400
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,570
Someone's hitting your son.

401
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,450
Beat him up!

402
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,930
Stop it!

403
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:30,930
I was wrong.

404
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,140
Stop it!

405
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,980
Stop!

406
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,820
Run!

407
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,860
Someone is coming.

408
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,300
Hurry!

409
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:37,730
Bin.

410
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,030
Don't be afraid.

411
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,480
Father is here.

412
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:42,680
Father!

413
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,770
You bastard!

414
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,460
Listen.

415
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,550
If you dare to bully Bin again,

416
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,570
I'll kill you.

417
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,430
Do you hear me?

418
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,990
Do you hear me?

419
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:53,750
Get lost!

420
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,140
Father.

421
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,480
It hurts.

422
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,340
Father.

423
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,010
Bin.

424
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,860
Bin, don't be afraid.

425
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,040
Father is here.

426
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
-Father.
-Get up.

427
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,480
What's wrong?

428
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,310
You can share with me

429
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,180
if something is bothering you.

430
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,140
Actually,

431
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,260
when I found out that

432
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,320
it was moutan

433
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,030
instead of peony

434
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,300
on the hairpin of Kaka's mother,

435
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,970
I already had my suspicions.

436
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,440
But

437
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,810
I was reluctant to believe it.

438
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,030
Today when I was inspecting,

439
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,040
I found that

440
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,350
the murderer

441
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,370
should be a woman.

442
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,170
Uncle Liu and my father

443
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,300
didn't find out

444
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,250
all these clues.

445
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,100
Also,

446
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,510
the parts of the file

447
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,020
with the most crucial information

448
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,400
are all defective.

449
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,030
All these points to...

450
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,160
Uncle Liu.

451
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,550
Are you also suspecting Uncle Liu?

452
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,850
Today when I followed Uncle Liu,

453
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,300
I found

454
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,490
he warned those kids

455
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,510
who bullied Bin fiercely.

456
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,010
He said,

457
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,140
"If you hurt my son again,

458
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,320
I'll kill you."

459
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,290
Could it be...

460
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,510
Could it really be Uncle Liu

461
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,690
tampered with my father's file?

462
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,310
But why is that?

463
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,990
Apparently,

464
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:42,940
Uncle Liu

465
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,070
has a skeleton in his closet.

466
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,740
Go and clean up the pharmacy.

467
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,540
Okay.

468
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,580
Madam.

469
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,500
Serve me another bowl.

470
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:21,920
Sure.

471
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:24,590
Jiu'er.

472
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,290
Are you saying that

473
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,640
the murderer of Kaka's mother

474
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,460
was Uncle Liu?

475
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,310
He then took advantage of his position

476
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,310
to shift the blame

477
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,380
onto the murderer of the Peony Case.

478
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,600
This is my only inference.

479
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,340
I really hope

480
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,760
Uncle Liu can give me

481
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,940
a reasonable explanation

482
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,270
to stop suspecting him.

483
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,700
Uncle Liu is kind and honest.

484
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,590
He can't pretend that.

485
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,470
Maybe he has his reasons.

486
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,500
Let's not assume

487
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,560
he is too terrible.

488
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,340
Here's the soy milk.

489
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,770
Okay.

490
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,470
Master Fu.

491
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,670
Here's your soy milk.

492
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,820
You've suspected he killed someone,

493
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,540
but you're still saying

494
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,800
not to think of him as an evildoer.

495
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,790
You're a fugitive now.

496
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,900
Get out of here immediately!

497
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,160
I...

498
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:09,820
Madam.

499
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,120
-Give me...
-Go!

500
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,540
another bowl of soy milk and two deep-fried dough sticks.

501
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,180
Noted.

502
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:18,700
I...

503
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,740
Did I mislook it?

504
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,420
Jiu'er.

505
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,300
I think

506
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,720
we should visit Uncle Liu's house

507
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,580
to feel him out.

508
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,150
Your Highness.

509
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,130
Whether Uncle Liu killed anyone,

510
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,600
we just have to report to the Inspection Bureau,

511
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,860
and we'll know after the interrogation.

512
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,980
I think

513
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,490
if Uncle Liu can turn himself in,

514
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,400
he'll be sentenced lightly.

515
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,900
I understand the difficulties you are facing.

516
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,360
Jiu'er.

517
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,400
Don't worry.

518
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,800
No matter what,

519
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,170
I will protect you.

520
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,980
You'd better protect yourself.

521
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,180
Go away.

522
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,150
Do you hear me?

523
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,840
Is something wrong with my eyes?

524
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,170
So I can infer that

525
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,680
the murderer of the Peony Case

526
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,100
was actually a woman.

527
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,730
Jiu'er.

528
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,120
What you said

529
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,280
makes sense.

530
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,700
But

531
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,660
if the murderer

532
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,760
who killed Kaka's mother

533
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,800
was a woman,

534
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,800
how could she kill her?

535
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,800
Kaka's mother was a Qi person.

536
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,000
After deep consideration,

537
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,990
there is only one possibility.

538
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,860
The murderer

539
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,100
is someone else.

540
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,240
Who is it?

541
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,140
I'm curious.

542
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,050
After ten years,

543
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,500
even I

544
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,100
easily come to a conclusion.

545
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,230
How could you and my father

546
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,340
find nothing?

547
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,790
Besides,

548
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,670
there is no record on the file.

549
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,820
Maybe

550
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,500
I was too stupid.

551
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,500
Also, Commander Su was seriously ill.

552
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,140
So we neglected it.

553
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,680
No.

554
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,260
Uncle Liu.

555
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,680
You deliberately destroyed my father's record,

556
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,340
which concluded the murderer

557
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,200
was a woman.

558
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,620
Jiu'er.

559
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,800
How can you talk such nonsense

560
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,220
with no evidence?

561
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,580
I am on solid ground.

562
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,860
If I report to Commander Yan,

563
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,290
it's enough for the Inspection Bureau to re-investigate the case.

564
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,750
The case was full of loopholes.

565
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,660
As long as we investigate,

566
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,790
there must be a flaw.

567
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,090
Then why didn't you

568
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,070
go to the Inspection Bureau

569
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,310
but here?

570
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,890
Uncle Liu.

571
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,460
I hope you can tell me the truth.

572
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,780
You fabricated the file

573
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,580
and deliberately hid the truth.

574
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,470
Was it because

575
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,950
you were the murderer?

576
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,420
Uncle Liu.

577
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,240
Why don't you turn yourself in?

578
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,940
In this way,

579
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,410
Jiu'er can help you

580
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,920
with the commutation.

581
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,100
Really?

582
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,670
Thank you, then.

583
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:46,990
Father.

584
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,360
Father!

585
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:49,900
Father!

586
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,950
Why did you lock the door, Father?

587
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:52,830
Father!

588
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,760
What do you want?

589
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:54,980
Father.

590
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:56,940
Jiu'er.

591
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,820
You're right.

592
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,930
Father.

593
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:00,810
I

594
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,270
was the murderer

595
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,730
who killed Kaka's mother.

596
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,350
I deliberately mixed the case

597
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,580
with the Peony Case.

598
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,030
My purpose was to defend myself.

599
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,580
Father.

600
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,630
Father!

601
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,100
Let me out.

602
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,780
I will be amenable.

603
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,290
Father.

604
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,780
Father!

605
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,260
Jiu'er.

606
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,450
Take me to the Inspection Bureau.

607
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,250
But Uncle Liu,

608
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,880
you two had always been close.

609
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,250
Why did you kill her?

610
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,050
Owing we were close,

611
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,180
they kept asking me for money.

612
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,420
Sometimes they returned less than the borrowed amount

613
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,420
or even not at all.

614
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,780
That day when I went to collect for debt,

615
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,580
I had a fight with Kaka's mother.

616
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,180
Father.

617
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,510
Then I killed her by mistake.

618
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,960
Bin will be amenable.

619
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,630
You've always been gentle.

620
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,780
Why were you so impulsive?

621
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:46,680
Maybe...

622
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,460
Father.

623
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,530
It's you who doesn't know me.

624
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,820
Father.

625
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,750
All these years,

626
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,020
I raised Bin alone.

627
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,250
I kept the hardships bottled up

628
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,770
and swallowed all the grievances.

629
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,720
I was impulsive that day.

630
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,470
All these years,

631
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,590
I felt regretful too.

632
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,080
Take me to the Inspection Bureau.

633
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,210
So that I can be free.

634
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:14,500
As for Bin,

635
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,980
please send a letter

636
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,700
to his aunt in the countryside.

637
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,030
She'll take care of Bin from now on.

638
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,540
It's raining, Father.

639
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,570
Father, it's raining.

640
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,460
Father.

641
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,460
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

642
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:41,860
Wait.

643
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,810
Wait, Uncle Liu.

644
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,720
Father.

645
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,930
What happened to Bin?

646
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,870
Father, help me!

647
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,180
Say something, Uncle Liu!

648
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,710
Father, they want to hit me.

649
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,790
Father, I can't control myself.

650
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,850
What are you waiting for?

651
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:55,270
Let's go!

652
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:55,690
No.

653
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,500
Are you really the murderer?

654
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:57,980
I am.

655
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,590
I'm the murderer!

656
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,530
Hurry up!

657
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,400
Uncle Liu.

658
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,660
You are not the murderer.

659
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,180
Who is the real murderer?

660
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,920
I'm the murderer.

661
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,900
The murderer is me.

662
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,620
Let's go, Jiu'er.

663
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,340
Impossible.

664
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:07,940
Uncle Liu.

665
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,330
Who is the murderer exactly?

666
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,170
Father!

667
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,340
Let me go!

668
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,140
Father!

669
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,740
No one can take my father away.

670
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,300
Bin.

671
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,610
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

672
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:21,770
Hurry.

673
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,710
Bring me the rope

674
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,510
in the basket!

675
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,180
Okay.

676
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:24,820
I'll go.

677
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,010
This...

678
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:26,940
Come on.

679
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,550
Bin!

680
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:37,980
Bin!

681
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,450
Bin!

682
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,740
You bad woman!

683
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,310
Bin!

684
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,060
Prince Han, don't hurt him.

685
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,590
Your Highness.

686
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,470
I beg you.

687
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,110
Bin.

688
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,750
Bin.

689
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,340
Han Zheng.

690
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,020
Your Highness, are you alright?

691
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,150
Your Highness. Let me have a look.

692
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,190
Bin.

693
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,460
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

694
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,250
Bin.

695
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,540
Bin.

696
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,770
Bin.

697
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,140
When Bin was seven,

698
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,980
bad kids bullied him

699
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,650
and hurt his head.

700
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,500
Since then,

701
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,980
his mental age

702
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,740
has stopped at seven.

703
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,220
That day,

704
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,760
there was also a thunderstorm.

705
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,850
So, every time it rains and thunders,

706
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,580
Bin is irritated.

707
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,230
Sometimes,

708
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,040
he hurts others.

709
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,190
But it's because he is afraid.

710
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,810
The death of Kaka's mother

711
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,130
was indeed done by Bin.

712
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,260
But it all boils down to

713
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,530
my fault.

714
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,640
That day,

715
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,460
it suddenly rained.

716
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,140
There were a lot of things to do in the Inspection Bureau.

717
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,750
I couldn't go back in time.

718
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,650
When I got home,

719
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,100
Bin was already lost.

720
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,900
I was very worried.

721
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,740
I looked for him everywhere.

722
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,590
Bin!

723
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,630
Stop!

724
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,810
Father!

725
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,940
Bin.

726
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

727
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,510
Bin.

728
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,860
I didn't mean it.

729
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,580
I...

730
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:38,620
Bin.

731
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,660
At that time, I had my mind stuffed on

732
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,510
how to help Bin get off.

733
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,330
Suddenly,

734
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,020
I saw

735
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,680
the sculpture on the hairpin.

736
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,800
It reminded me of the Peony Case not long ago.

737
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,140
So I thought of

738
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,740
mixing the death of Kaka's mother

739
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,060
with the Peony Case.

740
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,500
But I was too flustered.

741
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,100
I didn't notice

742
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,500
the sculpture on the hairpin was a moutan

743
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,220
instead of a peony.

744
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,650
Commander Su did figure out

745
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,300
the murderer of the Peony Case was a woman in a short while.

746
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,890
And someone else

747
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,180
killed Kaka's mother.

748
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,380
But Commander Su was seriously ill.

749
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,990
He had no strength at all

750
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,980
to visit the Inspection Bureau.

751
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,020
He wrote all of this

752
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,800
into the file of the Peony Case

753
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,560
and urged me to find out the truth

754
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,600
and give Kaka and Bu an account.

755
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,660
Kaka's mother was dead.

756
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,800
The dead can't be revived.

757
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,200
But Bin's mental age

758
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,360
is still a child's.

759
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,340
If he's imprisoned,

760
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,350
he won't live long.

761
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,580
I made up my mind

762
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,520
to cover up the truth.

763
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,630
So I destroyed

764
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,320
the crucial pages in the file.

765
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,870
Jiuxiao City is a rainy city.

766
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,500
So I deliberately

767
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,820
pulled out some tiles

768
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,460
on the roof of the storage.

769
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,100
During the rain after that,

770
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,410
most of the files in the storage

771
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:26,950
were waterlogged.

772
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,310
In that way, no one could notice

773
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,490
I had tampered with

774
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,810
the file of the Peony Case.

775
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,570
Later, under my guidance,

776
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,380
everyone thought

777
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,010
the murderer of the Peony Case was a man.

778
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,570
After that,

779
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,070
Commander Su passed away.

780
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,320
The Inspection Bureau had been in chaos for years.

781
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,300
And the Peony Case

782
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,730
gradually

783
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,700
became an unsolved case.

784
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,860
No one ever asked about it.

785
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,100
Did you purposely release

786
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,720
Han Zheng from prison

787
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,800
so that

788
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,580
Commander Yan would suspend me?

789
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,160
I know.

790
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,320
If you keep investigating,

791
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,140
you'll find out

792
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,700
the truth of the Peony Case.

793
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,800
I'm also aware that

794
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,130
even if you are suspended,

795
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,790
with your personality,

796
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,460
you won't give up on the investigation.

797
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,120
But I still did it.

798
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,750
That day, a young beggar

799
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,160
told me Bin was bullied.

800
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,400
I got suspicious

801
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,720
and found that Prince Han was following me.

802
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,040
I knew that

803
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,710
you had started to suspect me.

804
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,980
So I made up my mind

805
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,230
to take the blame for Bin.

806
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,070
However,

807
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,490
the rain in Jiuxiao City

808
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,610
always comes with bad timing.

809
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,449
Maybe

810
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,820
this is fate.

811
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,719
Liu,

812
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,639
sign your name.

813
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,340
T-There's another crime

814
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,159
to confess.

815
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,190
Uncle Hu's death

816
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,500
wasn't caused by Han Zheng

817
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,950
but by Bin.

818
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:11,500
What?

819
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,460
During that period, I was busy

820
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,130
investigating Shi Luqing's case in the surroundings of The Western Chamber

821
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,330
and barely went home.

822
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,630
I didn't want to starve Bin.

823
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,520
So I took him with me.

824
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,420
He likes drawing.

825
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,540
So I left him alone

826
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,870
in The Western Chamber.

827
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,830
But I never thought

828
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,210
Boss Chen would go back to The Western Chamber

829
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,780
and Han Zheng would fight

830
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,980
with Uncle Hu

831
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,200
in the yard.

832
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,190
Grandpa Hu!

833
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,380
Grandpa Hu!

834
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,310
Grandpa Hu!

835
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,040
Are you alright, Grandpa Hu?

836
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
Let me help you up.

837
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,060
Why are you here?

838
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:54,690
Bin.

839
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,370
-Hurry.
-Let me help you up.

840
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,680
Be gentle.

841
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,410
Bin.

842
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,660
Is Uncle Liu here too?

843
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:04,950
No, he's not.

844
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,510
Grandpa, are you okay?

845
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:09,840
No!

846
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,560
No!

847
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,270
No!

848
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,200
Bin.

849
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,890
Don't be afraid.

850
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,670
That's thunder.

851
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,620
Bin.

852
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:25,970
Take me...

853
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,250
Take me to Uncle Liu.

854
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,460
Don't be afraid.

855
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,050
Take me to Uncle Liu.

856
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,430
Liu.

857
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,570
So there was no sign of Bin

858
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,520
in the yard of The Western Chamber.

859
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,820
Was that your doing?

860
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,500
Liu.

861
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:26,700
Liu!

862
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,380
Jiu'er.

863
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,700
I know

864
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,790
I have no right

865
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,420
to ask for your forgiveness.

866
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,350
But this is the last time

867
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,260
I beg you shamelessly.

868
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,400
Soon,

869
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,350
Bin and I

870
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,360
are going to the prison of the Law Department.

871
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,540
I beg you to

872
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,500
plead with Commander Yan to intervene

873
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,230
and request the Law Department

874
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,110
to lock us up

875
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,250
in the same cell.

876
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,120
For the rest of my life,

877
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,470
I wish to take care of him like always.

878
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,280
Congratulations.

879
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,740
You've cleared your name.

880
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,800
But Uncle Hu will never come back.

881
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,670
You've changed.

882
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,490
In the past, you wouldn't be so emotional

883
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,290
because of a Qian person's death

884
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,810
who is not related to you.

885
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,410
We've been through so many things together.

886
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,100
How could you say

887
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,160
we are irrelevant?

888
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,260
Anyway,

889
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,460
as long as

890
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,620
you come out safely,

891
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,270
that is the best news.

892
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,280
Let's go. You're hurt.

893
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,690
I'll bandage it for you.

894
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,700
No need.

895
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,080
It's just a minor injury.

896
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,280
Don't be so dramatic.

897
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,860
By the way,

898
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,350
Grand Preceptor sent me a letter to remind you

899
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,980
that you don't have much time

900
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,380
in Jiuxiao City anymore.

901
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,140
It looks like you haven't forgotten.

902
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,060
His Majesty is going to celebrate

903
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,460
his 280th birthday soon.

904
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,700
That means

905
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,660
the Xuandong Grand Ceremony is coming.

906
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,390
How could I forget?

907
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,740
After the Xuandong Grand Ceremony,

908
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,140
you will be the King of Qi.

909
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,740
But now, there are many rumors in Shuobei

910
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,020
that Prince Han Zheng

911
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,180
is obsessed with Jiuxiao City

912
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,450
because of a Qian woman.

913
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,420
They're afraid you'll even give up

914
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,080
the Xuandong Grand Ceremony.

915
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:18,980
Han Zheng.

916
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,900
I know you are not someone

917
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,000
who doesn't know the order of priority.

918
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,730
You will not

919
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,070
give up your responsibilities

920
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,400
because of a Qian woman,

921
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,310
will you?

922
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,140
Don't worry.

923
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,340
I'll go back.

924
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,420
And I will win

925
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,020
in the Xuandong Grand Ceremony.

926
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,020
[Peony Case]

927
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,470
Hu?

928
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,400
Hu.

929
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,190
Is that you?

930
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,260
It turns out to be the wind.

931
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:41,720
Hu.

932
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,400
The case is solved.

933
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,860
Now you can leave in peace.

934
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,800
You have left me, right?

935
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,740
Why are you here?

936
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,040
It didn't respond.

937
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,790
Maybe it's because Uncle Hu

938
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,380
has already got away from it all

939
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,580
and left peacefully.

940
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,550
Indeed.

941
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,560
That's good.

942
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,350
You haven't answered me yet.

943
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,460
Why are you here?

944
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,420
I...

945
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,010
I'm sorry.

946
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,500
I forgot you were injured.

947
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,620
Sit here.

948
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,460
I came to the Inspection Bureau

949
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,290
to get some medicine.

950
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,160
Now, this is great.

951
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,740
A minor injury turns into a severe one.

952
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,350
You're criticizing

953
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,040
the Inspection Bureau again.

954
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,500
You are a Qi.

955
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,900
Shouldn't the wounds

956
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,650
heal themselves?

957
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,230
How? Look.

958
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,620
It's still bleeding.

959
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,890
It's really bleeding.

960
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:42,890
Sit still.

961
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,260
I'll get you the medicine.

962
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,140
Don't move.

963
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:57,940
Alright.

964
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,600
Take it off.

965
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,310
Take off what?

966
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,730
Take off your clothes. What else could it be?

967
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,400
Why should I take off my clothes?

968
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,480
If you don't,

969
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,490
how can I apply for the medicine?

970
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,910
My arm is injured.

971
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,130
I just need to roll up my sleeves.

972
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,190
Is that so?

973
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,850
O-Okay.

974
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,000
D-Don't move.

975
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,150
It hurts. Be gentle.

976
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,940
I'm sorry.

977
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,450
I'll be gentle.

978
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,160
It hurts.

979
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,630
It doesn't hurt anymore, right?

980
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,180
Better a little loss than a long sorrow.

981
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,030
Don't forget

982
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:58,900
I got hurt because of you.

983
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,490
I was trying

984
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,580
to clear your name.

985
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:36,420
Alright.
