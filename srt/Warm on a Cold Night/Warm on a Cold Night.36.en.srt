[Episode 36]

4
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,420
You're so stubborn.

5
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,910
Why should I

6
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,229
show mercy to you?

7
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,539
No!

8
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,470
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,650
I can't watch you

10
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,930
make another mistake.

11
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,280
It turns out

12
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
you all have always been heartless.

13
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,070
I'm the only one showing mercy.

14
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:52,940
No.

15
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,500
At this point,

16
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,590
our friendship

17
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,160
is over.

18
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,350
I made this dagger myself.

19
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,730
Do you like it?

20
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,840
I'll make another one for you.

21
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,060
The timing is just right.

22
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,190
It's your birthday.

23
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,000
This is for you.

24
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:09,620
General.

25
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,030
Are you alright?

26
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,870
Why did you stop?

27
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,620
If you stab me,

28
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,370
I'll die for sure.

29
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,300
You know

30
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,390
we don't want to hurt you.

31
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,890
Just like you don't want

32
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,910
to fight with us.

33
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,630
But you still did it.

34
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,160
Just like I did to you.

35
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:17,890
Do it.

36
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,260
I won't do that.

37
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,909
Be careful!

38
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,140
What happens next

39
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,950
is your chocie.

40
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,390
Do you want to save the people of the Qi race

41
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,300
or Su Jiu'er?

42
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,020
Search every house.

43
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,220
You guys go over there.

44
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,500
Yes.

45
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,310
Let's go.

46
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,710
Our problems are compounding.

47
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,200
Why has the Eldest Prince also gone missing?

48
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,260
Who knows?

49
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,270
Shut up!

50
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,200
Don't talk presumptuously about His Highness.

51
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,800
Let's go.

52
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,260
Be careful.

53
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,060
Hurry up.

54
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,860
-Hurry up. -Those are all soldiers.

55
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,390
Get down.

56
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,059
Let's go.

57
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,309
Keep searching.

58
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:42,990
Can Jiuxiao City

59
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,700
go back to the way it was?

60
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,580
Yes.

61
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,260
Of course.

62
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,440
Su Jiu'er, let me tell you.

63
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,820
Don't overthink this.

64
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,820
You must live well.

65
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,620
Do you hear me?

66
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,830
What are you talking about?

67
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,140
Don't get affected by Mu Yan.

68
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,630
You think that's the only way?

69
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,090
There must be another way.

70
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,180
Stop talking, let's go.

71
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,710
Let's go.

72
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,680
Over there.

73
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,930
You scared me.

74
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,220
You suddenly disappeared.

75
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,780
I thought

76
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,290
you had been abducted.

77
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,080
I was.

78
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,700
But

79
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,790
Han Zheng saved me.

80
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,040
What happened?

81
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,100
Why did you come back

82
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,360
looking like this?

83
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,810
What did you do?

84
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,510
Is it related to

85
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,350
the disappearance of the Eldest Prince?

86
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,450
No, Mother.

87
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,460
-Han Zheng, you... -Alright, Mother.

88
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,320
Come, sit down.

89
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,790
-Let me ask you. -What’s wrong with them?

90
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,900
Why are they so mysterious?

91
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,860
What's the matter?

92
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,120
Let me ask you, Mother.

93
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,280
Have you formulated the antidote?

94
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,300
Not yet.

95
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,660
I'm not that fast.

96
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,620
Keha.

97
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,850
Go to the Inspection Bureau

98
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,180
and bring Uncle Bu here.

99
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:40,940
Bu?

100
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,140
Jiu'er.

101
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,580
What do you want to do?

102
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,150
Don't be so nervous.

103
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,700
I'm just thinking

104
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,120
since I have the Ember

105
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,760
and can cure Han Zheng,

106
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,790
maybe I can cure the others too.

107
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,590
I want to try.

108
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:53,780
Ember?

109
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
What's the Ember?

110
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,280
It's nothing.

111
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,020
Keha.

112
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,740
Go.

113
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,110
Here.

114
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,560
Have some water.

115
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,010
He actually would harm

116
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,700
his own clanspeople.

117
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,720
I didn't expect

118
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,020
there to be so many people in Shuobei

119
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,350
who have been poisoned.

120
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,800
We must not

121
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,970
let Jiu'er find out about this.

122
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,810
Otherwise,

123
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,390
she will do something stupid.

124
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,750
But now that Mu Yan has left,

125
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,670
the Ember is our only antidote.

126
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,200
I don't believe it.

127
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,790
There's still time.

128
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,590
There must be another way.

129
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,520
Prince Jun, are you looking for me?

130
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,770
I found it in Eldest Brother—

131
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,440
Mu Yan's room today.

132
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,140
If you don't want it,

133
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,030
I'll take it.

134
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,590
I could destroy it too.

135
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,840
No matter what happens,

136
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,800
it won't affect the past.

137
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,610
Eldest Brother.

138
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,180
How did you and Sister-in-law

139
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,380
make your feelings known to each other?

140
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,510
We

141
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,620
never confessed

142
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,620
to each other.

143
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,600
We used to see each other a lot,

144
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,140
but I never

145
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,670
told her about my feelings.

146
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,580
This was until

147
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,140
she mistakenly thought

148
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,100
I was going to marry

149
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,960
another woman.

150
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,060
Her attitude towards me changed completely.

151
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,920
She ignored me.

152
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,280
That was when I realized

153
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,390
she was jealous.

154
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,810
It turns out

155
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,590
she liked me too.

156
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,900
Your Highness.

157
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,100
Let's go back.

158
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,850
I'm curious.

159
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,770
Hundred Beast Chess

160
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,180
is only popular in Qi.

161
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,940
Why do you know how to play it?

162
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,420
My wife

163
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,420
liked it very much.

164
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,990
I played with her often.

165
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,370
I've heard about

166
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,530
the Crown Princess.

167
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,490
She must have been

168
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,060
a very special woman.

169
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,200
In my heart,

170
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,270
she was second to none.

171
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,500
The late Crown Princess had

172
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,830
the same birthday as me?

173
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,120
I guess this is a kind of

174
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,540
inexplicable fate.

175
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,220
Happy birthday.

176
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,480
Tell me.

177
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,710
If one day,

178
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,070
we become adversaries,

179
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,110
what should I do?

180
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,520
That day won't come.

181
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,860
I said if.

182
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,610
I think

183
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,780
I would choose to leave.

184
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,180
So what you said

185
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,120
was always about us.

186
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,830
It seems

187
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,000
you have disappeared from this world.

188
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,770
I hope you can let go of everything

189
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,740
and live a new life.

190
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,410
You're getting better.

191
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,140
You're really getting better.

192
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,460
What's happening?

193
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,020
I have been holding Uncle Bu

194
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,260
for a whole day.

195
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,780
He's finally getting better.

196
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,380
Look.

197
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:17,980
Yes.

198
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,550
His pulse is improving.

199
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,319
It's not as weak

200
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,520
as it was before.

201
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,520
Indeed.

202
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,339
He's much better now.

203
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,000
So

204
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,640
Bu doesn't have to die.

205
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:28,890
Yes.

206
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,380
Uncle Bu doesn't have to die.

207
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,820
I don't have to die either.

208
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,100
None of us has to die!

209
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,270
Su Jiu'er.

210
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,160
What's wrong?

211
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,600
Let's talk outside. Let's go.

212
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,590
Come, sit down.

213
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,390
What's wrong?

214
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,270
Isn't this a good thing?

215
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,380
What did you mean?

216
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,030
Did you really want to

217
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,160
gorge out the Ember?

218
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:11,800
What if Mu Yan

219
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,680
lied to us?

220
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,520
Were you going to risk your life to verify it?

221
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,340
Why are you laughing?

222
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,190
Alright, Your Highness.

223
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,400
You said so much in a single breath.

224
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,120
Aren't you tired?

225
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,460
No.

226
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,740
All right.

227
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,090
Come on, Your Highness.

228
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,170
Calm down.

229
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,660
Don't be angry.

230
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,790
Don't worry.

231
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,130
Safety comes first

232
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,730
has always been my motto.

233
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,970
Besides,

234
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,940
since I can alleviate Uncle Bu's symptoms

235
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,300
through physical contact,

236
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,810
it means

237
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,070
it will work for the other Qi people too.

238
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,700
Why would I still have to

239
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,760
take out the Ember?

240
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:44,640
Jiu'er.

241
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:45,900
You must not think about

242
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,230
sacrificing yourself.

243
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,790
The world is so big.

244
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,700
There must be another solution.

245
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,580
Yes.

246
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,900
I know.

247
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,540
After all this trouble,

248
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,220
I finally understand

249
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,530
it was the power of the Ember

250
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,170
that saved me

251
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,480
from the brink of death

252
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,700
ten years ago.

253
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,280
You still have me.

254
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,500
I will help you

255
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,430
live healthily.

256
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,270
No.

257
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,460
Not only that.

258
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,710
I can help you

259
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,410
live happily.

260
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,920
Tell me.

261
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,580
Why

262
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,940
does my body feel better

263
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,520
whenever I touch you?

264
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,700
The Ember is the holy fire

265
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,460
passed down within the Xueqi.

266
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,390
And I am of

267
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,100
the purest Xueqi bloodline.

268
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,900
Maybe it's because

269
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,540
of this.

270
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,220
Every time I touch you,

271
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
the power of the Ember intensifies.

272
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,360
I see.

273
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,550
Sorry.

274
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,820
I have been holding on to the Ember for so many years.

275
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,500
What?

276
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,650
Aren't you helping everyone

277
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,300
with the Ember right now?

278
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,210
But now

279
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,820
so many Qi people have been poisoned.

280
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,980
From now on,

281
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,090
I think I must

282
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,610
hold many people's hands every day.

283
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,010
I can't do anything else.

284
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,940
When I get to the Inspection Bureau,

285
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,260
I will have to just sit there

286
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,660
and stretch out my hands.

287
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,090
Many people will then

288
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,350
line up to hold my hand.

289
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,390
I will probably

290
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,110
hold over two hundred people's hands in a day.

291
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,740
Will you get jealous?

292
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,350
I'll lend them that hand

293
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,950
for the time being.

294
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,750
This hand

295
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,140
belongs to me.

296
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,130
You save their lives.

297
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,640
I'll replenish your health and longevity.

298
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,500
I really hope all of this

299
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,630
will end soon.

300
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:41,770
Then

301
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:42,940
we can

302
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
return to Shuobei

303
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,780
during the Under the Moon Festival.

304
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,380
The Under the Moon Festival?

305
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,950
Great!

306
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,740
After listening to you all last time,

307
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,470
I've been really wanting to go.

308
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,310
At the Under the Moon Festival,

309
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,130
I will announce to the world

310
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,100
that I

311
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,370
am going to marry you.

312
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,450
With the Moon God as a witness,

313
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,660
the promise made between two lovers

314
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,620
is binding for life.

315
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,500
What a pity.

316
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,270
You Qi people

317
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,890
can live for over 200 years.

318
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,300
I can't

319
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,420
grow old with you.

320
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,040
I won't live to be

321
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,120
200 years old then.

322
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,140
I just want to

323
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,170
be with you for the rest of my life.

324
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,370
Don't talk nonsense.

325
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,620
I'm not.

326
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,600
I'm serious.

327
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,690
I can give up everything

328
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,160
for you.

329
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,900
You haven't been eating or sleeping

330
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,100
for the past few days.

331
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,790
You must be exhausted.

332
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,740
Why don't you go back and sleep?

333
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,760
I don't want to.

334
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,230
Sit down.

335
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,170
No.

336
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:08,980
I

337
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,680
want to sit here

338
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,100
quietly

339
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,980
with you.

340
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,140
Okay.

341
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,190
I want to eat something delicious.

342
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,160
And

343
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,110
I want sugar drops.

344
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,220
I want to go to the bathhouse.

345
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,920
I'll take you there tomorrow.

346
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,640
Tomorrow?

347
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,800
Under the Moon Festival's lanterns

348
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,260
are lit for one's beloved.

349
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,770
Who are you lighting it for?

350
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,750
For old friends.

351
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,800
Who are you lighting the lantern for?

352
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,260
For my beloved, of course.

353
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,840
Who is your lantern

354
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:01,670
for?

355
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,400
Shi Luqing, of course.

356
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,260
Because I still love her.

357
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,110
My lantern

358
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,920
is for Jiu'er, of course.

359
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,910
Where is everyone?

360
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:50,810
Han Zheng.

361
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,020
Han Zheng.

362
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,070
I'm here.

363
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,990
Jiu'er.

364
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,190
Are you calling out to me?

365
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,750
Why are you here?

366
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,390
Come out now.

367
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,400
Why aren't you coming out?

368
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,260
Jiu'er.

369
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,260
Jiu'er!

370
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,330
Come out!

371
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,370
Jiu'er!

372
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,120
Why am I here?

373
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,230
Why are you crying?

374
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,280
Your Highness.

375
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,220
You're awake?

376
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,330
It's still early.

377
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,350
Go back to sleep.

378
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Where is your fur?

379
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,620
You're recovered?

380
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,240
You should sleep a while more, Your Highness.

381
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,170
Where's Jiu'er?

382
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,020
Say something! Where's Jiu'er?

383
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,290
Your Highness....

384
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,280
Jiu'er...

385
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,260
Your Highness...

386
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,510
That one up there.

387
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,300
Be careful.

388
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,780
OK.

389
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,700
Have some water and take a rest.

390
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,570
Yes, that's it.

391
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,980
Let me help you.

392
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,600
Thank you.

393
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,460
Thank you for your work.

394
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,390
You're welcome.

395
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,610
Come on.

396
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,360
Drink some water, everyone.

397
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,110
Here, have some water.

398
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,980
Thank you.

399
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:19,890
A little to the left.

400
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,240
Boss!

401
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,820
This place was a mess

402
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,750
just yesterday.

403
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,700
How did you rebuild so quickly?

404
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,630
What yesterday?

405
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,140
I've been fixing my house for three days.

406
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,890
Three days?

407
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:49,660
Jiu'er.

408
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,410
Jiu'er, wake up.

409
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,480
I'm here.

410
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,540
Wake up.

411
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,260
I'm Han Zheng.

412
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,060
Jiu'er is fine.

413
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,280
She's just asleep.

414
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,300
Right?

415
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,410
Look.

416
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,020
Her heart is still beating.

417
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,150
She won't wake up anymore.

418
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,770
Why?

419
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,370
The poison can be treated through physical contact.

420
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,410
Why did you have to

421
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,500
take out the Ember?

422
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,380
At that time,

423
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,530
she already realized physical contact didn't work.

424
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,160
The only way

425
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,560
was to take out the Ember.

426
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,300
She was afraid you wouldn't agree,

427
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,300
so she lied to you.

428
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,830
Impossible.

429
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,190
Didn't Bu

430
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,140
recover?

431
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,540
That was a lie.

432
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,990
I pricked the acupoint behind his neck.

433
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,430
The water

434
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,920
at the stargazing balcony

435
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,960
was spiked?

436
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,020
That's why

437
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,940
I was in a coma for three days?

438
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,240
Physician Qin,

439
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,090
you love Jiu'er the most.

440
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,620
Why did you allow her

441
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,400
to do this?

442
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:57,860
I...

443
00:29:59,520 --> 00:29:59,840
I...

444
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,300
I didn't want to!

445
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,150
But Jiu'er said

446
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,230
if I didn't help her,

447
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,250
she would do it herself.

448
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,080
You know

449
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,270
how she is.

450
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,180
She is as stubborn as her father.

451
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,740
She believed she stole

452
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,360
the past 10 years of her life.

453
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,130
No matter what,

454
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,350
she wanted to return the Ember

455
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,740
and save more people.

456
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,420
I knew

457
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,590
I couldn't stop her.

458
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,350
The only thing I could do

459
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,530
was to help her

460
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,810
leave without pain.

461
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,220
Brother Han.

462
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,370
This is a letter from Jiu'er.

463
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,210
Jiu'er said

464
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,820
she wanted to

465
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,050
write a lot of things to you.

466
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,570
But by then,

467
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,060
she had no more strength left.

468
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,590
Han Zheng.

469
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,480
Don't blame me for lying to you again.

470
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,640
I'm timid and afraid of death.

471
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,380
But I'm more scared

472
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,640
of harming more people

473
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,020
because I want to live.

474
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,620
I still think

475
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,480
being able to meet you

476
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,640
is an incredible thing.

477
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,510
My life is destined to be short,

478
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,790
but because of my father's persistence

479
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,180
and the power of the Ember,

480
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,440
I have lived until now.

481
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,270
I fear troublesome things,

482
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,060
but I somehow got involved in the Nursery Rhyme Case

483
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,980
and met you.

484
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,690
In the beginning, I was afraid of your moodiness

485
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,160
and you hated my lies.

486
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,700
But because of health and longevity,

487
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,310
we kept getting closer to each other.

488
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,480
We got to know each other

489
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,280
and fell in love with each other.

490
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:40,980
So,

491
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,740
in this vast world,

492
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,190
amongst a multitude of people,

493
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,820
we're lucky

494
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,050
to have come this far.

495
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,970
Why agonize over

496
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,040
whether we can grow old together?

497
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,030
Han Zheng.

498
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,380
Please forgive me.

499
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,910
I've thought long and hard about my decision.

500
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,060
If I don't

501
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,390
remove the Ember from my body,

502
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,870
I can only save the Xueqi.

503
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,180
What about

504
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,510
all the other Qi people?

505
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,310
I don't want to live ignobly

506
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,840
at the cost of your clanspeople's lives.

507
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,100
In your long life

508
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,580
of over 200 years,

509
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,940
I am just a passing moment.

510
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,590
Don't stop in your tracks forever

511
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,430
because of this one moment.

512
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,150
Alright.

513
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,290
It's time to let go.

514
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,020
I know

515
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,640
you will always remember me.

516
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,340
But you have to

517
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,100
let me go.

518
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,270
I should have noticed it earlier.

519
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,020
She's good at lying.

520
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:28,820
Why didn't I

521
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,820
notice it?

522
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,969
Why am I so stupid?

523
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,560
This was Jiu'er's own choice.

524
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,139
Let's let her leave with dignity.

525
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:46,889
Jiu'er.

526
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,929
Please don't let me go.

527
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:51,860
Han Zheng!

528
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,010

00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:56,950
Let's go.

702
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:58,660
Jiu'er.

703
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:00,260
Wait.

704
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:00,940
Jiu'er.

705
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,620
I can't speed around anymore.

706
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,500
Are they getting married or not?

707
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,780
I've never been married.

708
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,710
How would I know?

709
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,300
Oh no.

710
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,060
His Highness is just like

711
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,290
a normal Qian now.

712
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:15,910
-It’s none of your business. -It's none of your business.

713
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,320
At least

714
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:18,320
they can grow old together.

715
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,120
That's great.

716
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,210
Liu Fu.

717
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,330
Applaud.

718
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,600
Where's Han Zheng?

719
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,570
I'm sorry.

720
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,190
Why did I leave you behind?

721
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,310
I- I'm not used to

722
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,260
my body.

723
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,100
It's okay.

724
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,990
After all, what you have now

725
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,130
is the Qi race's

726
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:49,480
most formidable power.

727
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,540
It's normal that

728
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,120
you're not used to it yet.

729

You said it yourself.

739
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,500
There's a Shuobei extra after the finale.

740
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,750
