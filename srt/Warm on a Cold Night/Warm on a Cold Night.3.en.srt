[Episode 3]

4
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,979
It's really strange.

5
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,229
I can see clearly again.

6
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,160
What is

7
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,310
this stupid woman doing?

8
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,330
It's really strange.

9
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,760
Why do I feel so strange

10
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,510
every time I touch him?

11
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,500
Although I don't know

12
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,300
why,

13
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,200
if I can

14
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,700
take him home,

15
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,640
my illness can be cured.

16
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,790
Does that mean I can

17
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,010
increase my longevity?

18
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,820
Longevity?

19
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,010
Why are you...

20
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,440
G-Godfather...

21
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,890
Shut up or you're dead.

22
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,420
Jiu'er.

23
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,250
Girl.

24
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,530
There's a checkpoint ahead.

25
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,350
Be careful in there.

26
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,470
Godfather.

27
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,550
Don't push!

28
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:47,440
Next.

29
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,740
Hu.

30
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,020
How have you been?

31
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,930
What are you doing here?

32
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,579
Ding.

33
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,950
My goddaughter is sick.

34
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,350
We are going to see a doctor.

35
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,800
Shut up.

36
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,960
Come on, inspect it.

37
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,460
What are you doing?

38
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,160
We are brothers.

39
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,420
Let him go.

40
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,110
Thank you.

41
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,700
No worries.

42
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,760
-I'll drink with you next time.
-Sure.

43
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,260
Remember to drink together.

44
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,220
Do you want to know

45
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,870
why the things in the car

46
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,760
don't work on me?

47
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,780
-Shut up. -Why?

48
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,540
You can't even do your homework well.

49
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,750
Indeed.

50
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,460
The Qi race is afraid of

51
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,670
the pungent smell,

52
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,100
especially

53
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,900
the Cangqi tribe, which is sensitive to the five senses.

54
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,750
But we, the Xueqi tribe,

55
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,480
can inactivate our five senses.

56
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,860
I can't smell anything now.

57
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,680
Silly girl.

58
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,040
Jiu'er, we're almost there.

59
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,260
Tell me.

60
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,330
You've been targeting me.

61
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,690
What are you up to?

62
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,630
Brother Qi.

63
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,170
Look.

64
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,000
You also want to find the Qi with three scars.

65
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,440
So do I.

66
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,220
Since we have

67
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,829
the same purpose,

68
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,130
why can't we share the clues

69
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,470
and work collaboratively?

70
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,649
Work collaboratively?

71
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,260
Then why did you prepare so many peppers?

72
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,440
Those are not fatal.

73
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,370
I just want you

74
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,960
to sit there quietly,

75
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,180
so that I can express

76
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,360
my sincerity.

77
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,130
First,

78
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,960
I've always been alone.

79
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,690
Second,

80
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,460
you are useless.

81
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,990
Why am I useless?

82
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,090
I'm very useful, Brother Qi.

83
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,060
Although I'm not good at fighting,

84
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,730
I'm quick-witted.

85
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,530
I almost

86
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,740
caught you just now.

87
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,340
Look at you.

88
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,250
You worked so hard

89
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,400
to pretend to be the three-scar Qi.

90
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,430
In the end,

91
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,860
you only got

92
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,820
half of the file.

93
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,730
However,

94
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,470
there's another place in the entire Jiuxiao City.

95
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,550
Are you trying to say

96
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,440
the other half is in your mind?

97
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,330
Brother,

98
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,620
you are so smart.

99
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,800
The 33rd year of Dingkun, on March 16,

100
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,780
the first witness

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,020
saw

102
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,490
a sneaky Qi man

103
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,550
in Zhang Residence.

104
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,380
What is the latter part?

105
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,710
This Qi man is seven feet tall

106
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,610
and well-built.

107
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,780
There are three scars on his right face.

108
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,500
Scars are narrow and deep.

109
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,630
It's an old wound.

110
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,360
It's neither a burn nor a scald,

111
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,230
nor a stubborn disease.

112
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,620
It was hurt

113
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,470
by a sharp weapon.

114
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,420
None of the registered Qi people in the entire Jiuxiao City

115
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,140
has such characteristics.

116
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,260
Brother Qi.

117
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,300
Look.

118
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,070
Am I really useful?

119
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,000
Besides,

120
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,420
not only can I memorize the files,

121
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,140
I can also help you

122
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,320
get a real pass.

123
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,470
Most importantly,

124
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,900
I can help you

125
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,370
catch

126
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,330
the Qi man with three scars.

127
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,970
How do you plan to find

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,780
the Qi man who has three scars?

129
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,060
Severed in one bite, the beauty's head.

130
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,210
Throw it out at the gate of hell, under the moon.

131
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,230
You surely know the Gate of Hell.

132
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,940
It is...

133
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
Where is it again?

134
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,210
It's on the tip of my tongue.

135
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:26,830
It is called...

136
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,730
c-called...

137
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,470
Are you trying to fool me?

138
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,100
I'm much better than you.

139
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:32,970
Also,

140
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,840
if you had any clue,

141
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,450
you would already be there.

142
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,130
Why bother to trap me?

143
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,770
Isn't arresting me

144
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,210
having the same difficulty as

145
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,640
arresting the murderer?

146
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,630
This Qi man is quite smart.

147
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,060
Tell me.

148
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,370
What is the reason

149
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,030
you keep chasing me?

150
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,130
Well...

151
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,540
The reason?

152
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,200
I can't explain it clearly with a few words.

153
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,860
But I promise

154
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,610
I really

155
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,820
have no bad intentions for you.

156
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,520
Brother.

157
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,880
Just think of me

158
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,320
as lusting after your beauty.

159
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:05,820
By the way,

160
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,800
aren't you Qi people afraid of heat?

161
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,910
My body temperature is low.

162
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,340
Just take me as ice

163
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,300
and bring me with you at any time.

164
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,380
I can cool you down.

165
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:13,840
Right?

166
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,370
Try it. Isn't it cool?

167
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,300
The filthy speech.

168
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,890
I don't want to hear it again.

169
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,050
There will not be a fourth time.

170
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,870
I'm warning you.

171
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,340
Don't let me see you again.

172
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,290
If I see you again,

173
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,180
I promise

174
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,980
you won't have a chance

175
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,940
to say it the fourth time.

176
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,140
I...

177
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,870

Did he really fall

181
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,040
from the carriage?

182
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:58,900
Was it really from the carriage?

Yes.

It's too cruel.

211

you are investigating,

225
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,140
you have to put it aside.

Your merits offset faults

241

245

It won't be fresh later.

251

Don't waste any food.

254

By the way, Your Highness.

255
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,650

257
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,230
seems to be nowhere

Throw it out at the gate of hell, under the moon.

262

the murderer

263
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,260
will dump the body at the Gate of Hell.

264

269
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,160
she has another half of the file

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,440
she's up to something on me?

plotted against you?

285

committed the crime flawlessly.

Think with the Qi race's mindset?

309
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,530
Is the nursery rhyme a Qi's doing

or a Qian's?

311

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,270
Girl,

352
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,030
you are so smart.

353
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,640
Why do I feel that

354
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,600
you've

355
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,450
been smarter

356
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
these days?

357
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,390
But Godfather,

358
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,440
what should we do?

359
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,940
Now we know

360
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,660
when and where he will dump the body.

361
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,770
But we are short-handed.

362
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,430
It's hard to solve the case.

363
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,950
Without enough manpower,

364
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,350
what should we do?

365
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:27,940
Yue Da—

366
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,150
So silly. He's gone.

367
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,480
Since Yue Daren

368
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,040
has gotten such an important clue,

369
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,290
he will surely set an ambush

370
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,770
on the Guanghua Bridge three days later

371
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,800
and wait in vain.

372
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:55,950
If he really

373
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,970
find any clues,

374
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,030
our 100 taels of silver

375
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,300
will be gone.

376
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,570
That's right.

377
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,560
So this is the worst solution.

378
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,620
If we can't catch

379
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,890
the Qi with three scars,

380
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,740
we can only use Yue Daren's power

381
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,300
to arrest him.

382
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,490
From what you said,

383
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,420
there is a better way.

384
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,180
This is the hardest.

385
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,100
Come here.

386
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:17,700
Let me tell you.

387
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,270
Listen.

388
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,580
At that time,

389
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,470
we can first

390
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,890
attract the fierce Qi man

391
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,150
to Guanghua Bridge.

392
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,520
His nose

393
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,420
is even better than a dog's.

394
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,800
He must have noticed it before us.

395
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,300
Then we'll make Yue Daren

396
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,840
create chaos

397
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,580
and let them fight with each other.

398
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,640
And we will

399
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,620
take advantage of it.

400
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,340
Good idea.

401
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,410
Let's celebrate.

402
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,390
Okay.

403
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:44,960
Now,

404
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,800
one last question.

405
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,480
How should we attract him

406
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,410
to Guanghua Bridge?

407
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,220
What are you doing?

408
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,910
You scared me.

409
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,040
Little fellow Qi.

410
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,580
You knew I was coming?

411
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,870
How is that possible?

412
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,390
I didn't knock just now.

413
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,550
A while ago,

414
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,310
I heard your footsteps.

415
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,470
And the smell of alcohol

416
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,890
on you.

417
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,060
If so, it doesn't matter if I take another sip.

418
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,430
That's right.

419
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,650
With his acute sense of smell and hearing,

420
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,990
which is better than dogs,

421
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,520
he can definitely find the three-scar Qi.

422
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,680
How did you know

423
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,340
I live here?

424
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,690
Little fellow Qi.

425
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,960
Let me tell you.

426
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,300
Everyone, either high class or low class

427
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,010
in this Jiuxiao City,

428
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,040
is my spy.

429
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:10,920
Are you not believing me?

430
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:12,569
The house you are renting,

431
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,230
the landlady

432
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,819
is my old friend.

433
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,220
What do you think?

434
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,829
Are you interested in working with us?

435
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,660
You're taking advantage of us

436
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,119
if you cooperate with us.

437
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,640
If you cooperate with us,

438
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,650
from now on,

439
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,869
you can walk freely in Jiuxiao City.

440
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,090
No one will restrict you anymore.

441
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,960
No need.

442
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,240
Why are you so stubborn?

443
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,190
Let me tell you.

444
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,720
This is great news.

445
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,070
Detective Su

446
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,790
has found

447
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,810
where the Gate of Hell is.

448
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,290
See you

449
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,330
in three days.

450
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,210
Come out.

451
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,250
Your Highness.

452
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,620
He didn't trouble you, did he?

453
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,420
It is Qi's language.

454
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,310
I know where the Gate of Hell is.

455
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,870
We'll meet at the tower of Guanghua Bridge

456
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:08,980
in three days.

457
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,970
I threw away this letter.

458
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,180
But you picked it up

459
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,270
and told me the content.

460
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:17,900
I didn't break my promise.

461
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,340
What a cover-up.

462
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,980
Your Highness

463
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,260
is indeed smarter than me.

464
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:39,340
[Gwanghua Bridge]

465
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,260
Get yourselves together.

466
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,040
Don't miss a single fly.

467
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,290
Yes.

468
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,900
It's already midnight.

469
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,460
The three-scar Qi man

470
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,610
has no action yet.

471
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,130
What happened?

472
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,720
Is he not dumping the body today?

473
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,310
Think about it, Hu.

474
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,720
He went through a lot of trouble

475
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,130
and commit the crime based on the nursery rhythm.

476
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,990
It is a rule for himself.

477
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,590
It won't be broken easily.

478
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,770
Where is that Qi?

479
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,610
Why didn't that Qi

480
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,200
show up?

481
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,410
Yes.

482
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,630
If he really looks for the three-scar Qi,

483
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,120
he might be

484
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,050
hiding somewhere

485
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,950
and watching us.

486
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,150
Keep your voice down. Don't shout.

487
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,780
I won't show up

488
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,210
in front of you, a female hooligan.

489
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,500
He's really not here.

490
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,100
No way.

491
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,630
I'm a little worried.

492
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,980
I'll go down there and take a look.

493
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,490
Be careful.

494
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,020
If anything happens...

495
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,460
Okay.

496
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,530
Turn the signal light.

497
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:47,950
When it's on,

498
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,700
I will rush to your side

499
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,680
as soon as possible.

500
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,710
Be careful.

501
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,270
Okay.

502
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,170
Hurry up. Go.

503
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,420
Father.

504
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,120
Look at those three stars.

505
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,300
Jiu'er.

506
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,720
The brightest one is you.

507
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,500
The one next to you

508
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,810
is your mother.

509
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,590
The one below is me.

510
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,170
Do you see it?

511
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:30,960
Jiu'er.

512
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,860
You must live well

513
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,360
and accompany your mother for me.

514
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,110
Help me.

515
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,860
Hold me tight.

516
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,380
I can't hold on any longer. Hurry up.

517
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,390
Hurry up.

518
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,550
Pull me up.

519
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,520
I don't want to die yet.

520
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,890
What do you usually eat makes you so heavy?

521
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,420
-I am freaked out!
-Get up.

522
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,040
I thought I was dead.

523
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,040
Get up!

524
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,860
You are an Inspector.

525
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,700
Why are you so afraid of death?

526
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,770
Don't do this to me.

527
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:40,660
If I die,

528
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,650
everything will be gone.

529
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,900
I haven't lived enough yet.

530
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,710
You're already a burden

531
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,530
before we start working together.

532
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,230
I...

533
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,990
Let me take a break.

534
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,260
I'm so scared that my l-legs are weak.

535
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,650
Are you still going to catch the three-scar Qi?

536
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,130
Do you mean

537
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,890
the person who pushed me down

538
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,720
was the three-scar Qi?

539
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,180
He was wearing a black robe.

540
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,410
I vaguely saw

541
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,250
three scars on his mask.

542
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,970
But I'm not sure.

543
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,230
Because he

544
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,090
has no Qi's scent.

545
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,650
It also doesn't look like he's here to dump the body.

546
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,060
But that's not right.

547
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,760
Seven days are almost up.

548
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,580
There's no way he won't dump the body.

549
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,550
What is that?

550
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,780
D-Don't sleep anymore.

551
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,550
Look, what is that?

552
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:39,910
Hurry up.

553
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:40,840
Go!

554
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,500
Hurry!

555
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:41,940
Go down there.

556
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:42,930
Let's go.

557
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,620
Go.

558
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,260
Go.

559
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,320
Get it over there.

560
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,040
Pick it up.

561
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,680
Get the stick.

562
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,250
Get the stick.

563
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,530
Hurry.

564
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,100
Come on.

565
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,150
Move forward.

566
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,040
Okay.

567
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,700
Here.

568
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,260
Here.

569
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,480
The body.

570
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,360
The three-scar Qi man...

571
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,150
Where is he?

572
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,470
Girl,

573
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,900
I saw nothing

574
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,660
when I was there just now.

575
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,060
Hurry up.

576
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,000
Why is there so much noise

577
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,910
from Yue Daren's side?

578
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,390
Three-scar Qi has dumped the body.

579
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,660
Hurry up. Open it.

580
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,220
Come on.

581
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,190
There's no head.

582
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,870
[Guanghua Bridge]

583
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,480
This headless corpse

584
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,110
can't be identified

585
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:02,920
based on facial features.

586
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:04,970
But based on the smell,

587
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,610
we can infer that

588
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,850
he died more than half a month ago.

589
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,260
All the wounds

590
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,410
were torn.

591
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,550
It should be caused by the shapeshifting of Qi people.

592
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,360
Judging from his figure and clothing,

593
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,110
he should be the fourth person

594
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:17,680
in our missing case.

595
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,190
Chief of the Inspection Service, Zhang Yunhe, undoubtedly.

596
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,260
Yes, it must be him.

597
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,750
What a tragic death!

598
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,400
So miserable.

599
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,400
Stop it.

600
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,470
Okay, I got it.

601
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,300
Cover it quickly.

602
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,330
How can we investigate it?

603
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,580
He died so miserably.

604
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,510
Commander Yan.

605
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,620
Commander Yan. Commander Yan.

606
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:38,660
Commander.

607
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,770
Idiot!

608
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,260
All of you are useless!

609
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,220
Commander, please forgive my incompetence.

610
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,020
Of course.

611
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,300
Of course you are incompetent.

612
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,860
I gave you 100 people

613
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,730
and even alarmed the guards.

614
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,790
Yet you let the three-scar Qi man

615
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,360
commit a crime

616
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,050
under your nose.

617
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,140
Do you know how people, ranged from the Imperial City

618
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,490
to Jiuxiao City,

619
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,640
talk about

620
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,630
Inspection Bureau?

621
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,630
No, Commander.

622
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,440
We all think it's unbelievable.

623
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,870
Including the moat,

624
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:13,900
we have surrounded the whole Guanghua Bridge

625
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,460
with our spies and men.

626
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,020
How could the three-scar Qi

627
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,650
dump the body

628
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,500
without anyone knowing?

629
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,930
-I...
-Because he

630
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,700
has no need to dump the body.

631
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,500
No need?

632
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,220
Why?

633
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:25,830
Yeah.

634
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,420
What do you mean?

635
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,290
There's no need to dump the body.

636
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,680
Why?

637
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,060
Judging from the state

638
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,170
of decomp,

639
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,220
it should have been in the water

640
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,380
for a long time.

641
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,280
The oil paper

642
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,050
is uneven and yellow.

643
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,250
What does it mean?

644
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,800
It means the murderer

645
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,870
wrapped the well-measured soil

646
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,170
with the body

647
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,650
and sank into the water in advance.

648
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,540
Let me show you.

649
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,470
After the river

650
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,840
has washed away all the dirt,

651
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,820
the body will surface onto the water

652
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,560
naturally.

653
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,380
Amazing.

654
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,340
Jiu'er,

655
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,200
you've become smarter recently.

656
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:02,920
Yeah.

657
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,810
What do you mean?

658
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,880
She's always smart.

659
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,030
Yeah.

660
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,010
Well,

661
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,300
I was just guessing.

662
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,180
I don't know

663
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,130
if I'm right.

664
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,380
Look.

665
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,470
She's so skillful

666
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,660
and smart.

667
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,000
Unlike someone

668
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,140
who always said he was a coroner.

669
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,930
A coroner?

670
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,100
Having

671
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,140
limited talent

672
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,440
is somehow better than

673
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,900
an Inspector who has worked for 30 years.

674
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,480
Not even with limited talent.

675
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,100
He can only

676
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,040
rely on the young generation to enlighten him

677
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,970
and spend his time goofing off.

678
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,370
I indeed rely on Jiu'er.

679
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,010
What's wrong?

680
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,550
I'll admit it today.

681
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,860
All these years,

682
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,670
of those cases, small or big,

683
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,280
the reason why we can find the answer

684
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,580
is that our foster daughter,

685
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,180
Jiu'er, is very clever.

686
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,780
But she gave all the credit

687
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,940
to me.

688
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,690
Yan.

689
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,990
C-Commander Yan.

690
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,500
Inspection Bureau doesn't need me,

691
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,530
a drunkard.

692
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,530
I also don't need Inspection Bureau

693
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,440
to give me this job.

694
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,670
I have a house.

695
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,620
But

696
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,450
if you fire her,

697
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,780
you'll make

698
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,420
the biggest mistake

699
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,880
the Inspection Bureau has ever made

700
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,440
other than the passing away of Patrol Commander Su.

701
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,550
Hu Badao.

702
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,450
Who are you to

703
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,470
bargain with me?

704
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,460
You think

705
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,260
your statement just now

706
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,380
can keep

707
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,660
your precious foster daughter's job.

708
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,170
Do you?

709
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,300
Let me tell you.

710
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,700
I made it clear that day.

711
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,840
If you can't solve this case,

712
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,880
both of you leave from here.

713
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,080
It's time.

714
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:20,890
Get lost.

715
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,220
How dare you!

716
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,540
I thought

717
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,950
you were a petty toy boy at first.

718
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,650
It turns out that you are not only narrow-minded,

719
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,960
but also blind.

720
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,410
Just wait until you regret it.

721
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,590
Let's go. Quit it.

722
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:32,800
Let's go.

723
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,320
No.

724
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,060
Commander Yan.

725
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,780
Don't you always keep your word?

726
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,460
You can't break your promise.

727
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,780
What do you mean?

728
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,060
You promised to spare us

729
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,250
half a month.

730
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,740
Today is only the seventh day.

731
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,670
Why are you so anxious

732
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,650
and asking us to get lost?

733
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,740
All four bodies

734
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,680
were thrown out.

735
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,520
The Qi man

736
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,420
won't commit another crime.

737
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,660
So even if I give you time,

738
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,710
you have no more chance.

739
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,030
No chance?

740
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,700
We can create opportunities.

741
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,900
I haven't given up yet.

742
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,200
How could you give up first?

743
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,040
Why didn't I know

744
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,830
you were so eloquent?

745
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,600
Maybe in seven days,

746
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,160
you'll find that my ability is better

747
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,720
than my eloquence.

748
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,560
If we fail in seven days,

749
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,670
you can ask us to get lost.

750
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:20,690
Let's go.

751
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,340
Wait and see.

752
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,590
Dismiss.

753
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,120
Go.

754
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,790
Get back to work.

755
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,180
Calm down.

756
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,430
It's all my fault.

757
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,210
This mouth.

758
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,290
You didn't want to

759
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,700
get involved

760
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,570
in this troublesome case.

761
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,510
You hid yourself carefully.

762
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,630
But I accidentally

763
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,000
spilled it out.

764
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,140
It's okay, Hu.

765
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,600
I've also experienced being impressive.

766
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,160
Now I can only wear the 30-year uniform of Inspector

767
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,580
for the last seven days.

768
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,290
But don't worry.

769
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,840
I can earn at least 100 taels of silver

770
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,430
if I sold my ancestral home.

771
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,130
As for the rest,

772
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,300
we can have some small-profit businesses.

773
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,830
Don't worry, Hu.

774
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,100
This matter

775
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,180
hasn't reached the end yet.

776
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:05,780
What are you doing?

777
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,510
You sound like someone died.

778
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,460
Because the murderer

779
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,720
wanted to kill me.

780
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,290
Kill you?

781
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,730
The three-scar Qi man wants to kill you.

782
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,130
Why?

783
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,840
There were so many people from Inspection Bureau,

784
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,020
but he only tried to kill me.

785
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,360
What does that mean?

786
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,520
It means that

787
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,380
we probably

788
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,560
have met each other.

789
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:37,880
He didn't want to expose himself.

790
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,580
That's why he did this.

791
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,470
No, no, no.

792
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,460
We can't stay in Jiuxiao City anymore.

793
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,200
We can't stay here anymore.

794
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:54,790
Let's go.

795
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,780
Come with me to the countryside to hide for a while.

796
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,380
Why are we leaving?

797
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,840
We'll come back when things are over.

798
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,520
Stop, Godfather.

799
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,280
Now there are a debt collector

800
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,250
and a person who wants my life.

801
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,660
We can't do anything now.

802
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,910
We can only solve the case.

803
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,850
Solve it.

804
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,090
How?

805
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,330
Give me your hand.

806
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:18,890
Come on.

807
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,000
It's not the time to spend money

808
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,660
to buy me small gifts.

809
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,530
What are you talking about, Godfather?

810
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,720
This was removed

811
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,500
from Lord Zhang's body.

812
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,090
Godfather,

813
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,200
this is important evidence.

814
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,690
Why did you steal it since you knew it was important?

815
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,180
What? Steal?

816
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,920
This is just a loan.

817
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,640
And I thought

818
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,740
there might be some vital clues

819
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,960
hidden inside.

820
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,590
Now I think

821
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,580
it may have

822
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:48,640
saved my life.

823
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,050
[Fate]

824
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,470
Jiu'er.

825
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:04,820
Aren't you going to

826
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,200
the Qi man's house?

827
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,120
Lower your voice.

828
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,840
Hua!

829
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,310
What's wrong?

830
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,480
Keep your voice down.

831
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,090
Don't let my mother hear it.

832
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,980
I am going without an invitation.

833
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,780
Said to be a guest,

834
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,420
but actually to negotiate.

835
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,860
Is it the handsome Qi in the painting?

836
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,090
Is he that scary?

837
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,360
Yes, he is.

838
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,699
He is very emotional.

839
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,290
One moment he's smiling at you.

840
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,540
Then he might eat you the next second.

841
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,929
Then why do you go?

842
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,159
It was for the case.

843
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,610
Now,

844
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,909
it's to save lives.

845
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,340
I think it's killing.

846
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,570
All handsome men in the world

847
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,389
are fatal.

848
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,900
I have to go.

849
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,850
I have to go now.

850
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,679
I'm leaving.

851
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,670
Instead of bringing

852
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,699
those useless things,

853
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,390
why don't you bring something practical?

854
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,260
What?

855
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,530
How can you not bring gifts

856
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,910
when you visit somebody?

857
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,600
Don't look at me like that.

858
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,890
I have no choice.

859
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,100
It's because you're the favourite

860
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,200
of Qi people.

861
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,580
Your Highness.

862
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,230
Look.

863
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:39,980
Why is it so cold?

864
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:43,750
You...

865
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,720
How dare you

866
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,910
show up yourself

867
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,160
with food?

868
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,190
It's a token of appreciation.

869
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,650
I wonder

870
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,370
if you like it.

871
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,630
Of course.

872
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,770
I like delicate

873
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,300
girls.

874
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,800
Just kidding.

875
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,820
You're like a medicine jar.

876
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,450
I'm afraid I feel bitter after swallowing you.

877
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,060
Brother, you're right.

878
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,720
I'm like a medicine jar.

879
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,870
I taste disgusting.

880
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,300
Very bitter.

881
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,600
Try it and you'll know.

882
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,160
Bah!

883
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,910
Eat it raw.

884
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:28,990
Raw?

885
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,750
E-Eat it raw.

886
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,020
Since you came here unannounced,

887
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,470
you'd better give me

888
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,020
a reason not to get angry.

889
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,300
Brother.

890
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,380
Don't worry.

891
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,240
You are our guest.

892
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,920
As we've known each other for so long,

893
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,140
I haven't introduced

894
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,770
myself.

895
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,300
I'm an Inspector under Inspection Bureau, Su Jiu'er.

896
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,550
May I know your name?

897
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,530
Hanzheng.

898
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,660
Hanzheng.

899
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,040
Young Master Han.

900
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,530
All four bodies

901
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,720
have been thrown out.

902
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,750
There's no way that the three-scar Qi

903
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,130
gives himself away.

904
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,860
However,

905
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,850
I have a new clue

906
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,160
about the case.

907
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,100
If you agree to

908
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,040
cooperate with me,

909
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,290
we still have one last chance

910
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,240
to arrest him.

911
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,900
What clue?

912
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,830
You agree to cooperate with me first,

913
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,810
I'll tell you later.

914
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,750
Whether you really have a clue,

915
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,150
I don't know.

916
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,650
But I know

917
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,560
you want to cooperate with me

918
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,680
because the murderer

919
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,580
wanted to kill you.

920
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,740
And you

921
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,850
need my protection.

922
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,830
Alright.

923
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,580
You're smart.

924
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,480
But think about it.

925
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,950
Besides killing me,

926
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,630
is it true that the three-scar Qi

927
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,830
will never appear again?

928
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,600
If you work with me,

929
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,000
it's killing two birds with one stone.

930
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,300
I can follow you

931
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:31,970
in private.

932
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,870
Why bother to protect you?

933
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,000
But you saved me three times.

934
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,770
You didn't seem to use a great effort.

935
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,260
Yes.

936
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,660
I saved you three times,

937
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,380
but you didn't even give me

938
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,380
any useful clues.

939
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,500
Who said that?

940
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,310
I found

941
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,190
this

942
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,020
from the fourth body.

943
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,650
The pattern on it

944
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,860
seems to be Qi's language.

945
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,260
I have searched many books

946
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:58,980
but I couldn't find

947
00:38:59,010 --> 00:38:59,910
what it means.

948
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,750
I think

949
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,860
it's not an important clue.

950
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,050
It's just a trap

951
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,490
you are trying to trick me into.

952
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,340
Who said that?

953
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,660
I've found

954
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,580
its origin.

955
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,820
It's just that I dare not

956
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,620
to go alone.

957
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,680
Since you've found

958
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,850
such an important clue,

959
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,720
there are so many Qi people in Jiuxiao City.

960
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,170
Why do you choose me

961
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,160
to be your partner?

962
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,510
B-Because...

963
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,270
Because...

964
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,380
Because when I touch you...

965
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,390
What

966
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,180
are you up to?

967
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,090
Why are you

968
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,200
scheming all the time?

969
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,310
Let me tell you the truth.

970
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,140
I just think

971
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,120
you're amazing.

972
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,250
That's why I want to work with you.

973
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,780
In the entire Jiuxiao City,

974
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,260
in terms of martial arts and brain power,

975
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,600
no one can beat you.

976
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:54,640
Also,

977
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,840
you've saved me three times.

978
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
I think you are

979
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,120
a kind person.

980
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,500
So I want to

981
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,220
be friends

982
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,010
with you.

983
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,940
Who knows,

984
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,500
you always turn me down.

985
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,050
She is a Qian,

986
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,330
but she wants to be my friend?

987
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,020
Forget it.

988
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,540
I was rude today.

989
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,760
Since you don't want

990
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,800
cooperate with me,

991
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,180
I'll go home

992
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,020
and study it myself.

993
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,410
If one day

994
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,260
I am killed

995
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,720
by the three-scar Qi,

996
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,070
let me die far away.

997
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,590
Let me fend for myself.

998
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,220
Leave me alone.

999
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,840
Take back your clothes.

1000
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,130
But I don't want to die yet.

1001
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,840
I'm not done yet.

1002
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,270
Tell me your clues.

1003
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,990
I'll consider your sincerity.

1004
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,890
This thumb ring

1005
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,480
is from the dance tavern

1006
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,470
owned by the Qi from Huaide Workshop.

1007
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,030
Do you know that?

1008
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,590
This is the token for the entrance.

1009
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,620
No wonder there's ancient Qi's language

1010
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,820
carved on it.

1011
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,320
It means fate.

1012
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,890
Fate?

1013
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,320
When we examined the body today,

1014
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,800
this ring

1015
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,910
dropped from

1016
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,660
Lord Zhang's internal lining.

1017
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,700
This case has always been related to Qi people.

1018
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,880
But those officers

1019
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,600
don't often deal with Qi.

1020
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,550
This is just your guess.

1021
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,750
It's not enough.

1022
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,870
Who said it's just a guess?

1023
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,480
I followed the clues

1024
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,120
and found something big.

1025
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,740
The strangest thing in this case

1026
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,820
is

1027
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,360
the motives

1028
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,300
the murderer

1029
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,530
has.

1030
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,390
If he wants to complete the nursery rhythm,

1031
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,680
he can just simply

1032
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,550
murder four Qian people.

1033
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,300
There's no need

1034
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,820
to target these four lords?

1035
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,490
It seemed that the four lords

1036
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,510
rarely had personal ties while they were all officials.

1037
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,580
But do you know?

1038
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,130
The four lords came to

1039
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,590
Shuobei Tavern every month

1040
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,530
on the same day

1041
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,510
at the same time.

1042
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,210
In other words,

1043
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,640
they went together

1044
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,770
and disappeared together.

1045
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,840
This place is indeed very suspicious.

1046
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,350
And strangely,

1047
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,730
four bodies

1048
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,820
Only on the thumbs of three bodies

1049
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,700
had traces of wearing a thumb ring

1050
