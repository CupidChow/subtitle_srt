Excuse me.

Behave yourself. Don't move!

Sir.

He caught the culprit in the blink of an eye.

12
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,259
How amazing he is!

Please spare my life.

Oh no.

15
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,680
We have to compensate for the damage again.

We're relieved

by your presence in Jiuxiao City.

37

Yes.

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,940
I didn't expect Inspector Han

39
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,740
to be not only handsome

40
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,740
but also so brave.

45
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,530

this pair of Qian-Qi partners

52
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:11,410
seems to be

53
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,580

You are the Prince of Qi.

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,070
Of course, you don't need to care about others' opinions.

are only good partners.

178
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,530

It's already the 33rd year of Dingkun.

180
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,750
Do you still believe there is pure friendship

181
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,010
between men and women?

182
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,970
I'm telling the truth.

183
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,890
I've never thought of

184
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,170
that way.

185
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,430
Let me ask you.

186
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,010
Regarding the gossip,

187
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,630
did your handsome Qi partner

188
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,480
deny it?

189
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,010
Did he?

190
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,230
Hanzheng's not the kind of person

191
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,610
who cares about gossip.

192
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:38,970
You

193
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,260
are really emotionally unintelligent.

194
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,220
He is a Prince.

195
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,620
Why would he

196
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,990
be willing to be slandered of being together with you?

197
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,380
If he doesn't deny it, that means he agrees with it.

198
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,260
And it shows that he falls for you.

199
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,040
Are you saying Hanzheng likes me?

200
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,960
How is that possible?

201
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,210
At least he doesn't dislike you.

202
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,080
What about you?

203
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,300
Do you like him?

204
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,220
No way I would like him.

205
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,410
He's not my type.

206
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,110
Then who is your type?

207
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,520
I like someone like my father.

208
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,380
He must be righteous,

209
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,060
brave,

210
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,960
skillful in martial arts,

211
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
and responsible.

212
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,800
The more I hear it, the more it sounds like Hanzheng.

213
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,320
No.

214
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,220
He won't be like my father.

215
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,240
He pulls a long face every day.

216
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,380
My father was amicable

217
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,110
to everyone.

218
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,520
Your father

219
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,059
was with the aesthetic standard of

220
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,659
a few decades ago.

221
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,179
Now, it's trending

222
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,850
to keep a straight face to everyone

223
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,340
but be nice to you.

224
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,799
It's so sweet.

225
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,650
I have to go, Hua.

226
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,360
I'm going to see my mother.

227
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,060
What's with that expression?

228
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,050
Your expression

229
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,680
is exactly the same as

230
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,590
Su Jiu'er

231
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,550
when she is getting into mischief.

232
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,360
Your Highness is indeed

233
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,490
talking about Miss Jiu'er all the time.

234
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,830
What do you mean?

235
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,340
Don't you know

236
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,340
the slander between

237
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,780
you and Miss Jiu'er

238
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,220
has gone viral in the entire Jiuxiao City?

239
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,180
I went to the ice house this afternoon to buy some ice.

240
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,840
The manager asked me about it.

241
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,190
What did you say?

242
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,590
I told him the truth.

243
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,740
I said Your Highness

244
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,640
is a perfect match

245
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,810
with Miss Jiu'er.

246
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,660
Unfortunately...

247
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,930
Unfortunately?

248
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,020
It's a pity that Miss Jiu'er

249
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,800
is a Qian.

250
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,440
She can't be

251
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,530
Young Master of Qi's wife.

252
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,760
Interracial marriage is also not allowed

253
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,890
between Qian and Qi.

254
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,770
Moreover, Your Highness

255
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,070
is so noble.

256
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,040
You can't

257
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,680
have a relationship with a Qian

258
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,770
in secret

259
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,550
like other people.

260
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,700
But it doesn't matter.

261
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,230
Isn't Qian-Qi Six Treaties

262
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,450
progressing?

263
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,840
What matters is

264
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,470
whether Your Highness likes Miss Jiu'er.

265
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,930
I like her.

266
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,540
Look.

267
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,260
Or I don't like her.

268
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,640
It's none of your business.

269
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,430
Go and cook.

270
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,140
Then fan it yourself.

271
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,140
I'm going to cook.

272
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,020
Mother.

273
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,160
I'm back.

274
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,120
Mother.

275
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,740
Mother.

276
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,550
What did I do wrong again?

277
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,640
Every time I do something wrong,

278
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,410
you come to

279
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,570
complain to Father.

280
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,540
Just tell me.

281
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,260
What is it?

282
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,620
Don't bother Father.

283
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,120
Su Jiu'er.

284
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,980
Tell me the truth.

285
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,910
Are you in a relationship with a Qi?

286
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,410
Mother.

287
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Why do you believe

288
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,030
rumors like that?

289
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,060
Your partner, Hanzheng,

290
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,620
is a Qi.

291
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,200
He is even the Young Master.

292
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,290
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

293
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,570
I...

294
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,730
I didn't say he's a Qian.

295
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,950
If I hadn't

296
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,310
treated Kaka's father,

297
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,130
I would still be in the dark.

298
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,160
Rumor has it that

299
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,400
you fell in love with your Qi partner.

300
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,470
Su Jiu'er.

301
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,900
Why are you so foolish?

302
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,590
I didn't, Mother.

303
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,880
We are just

304
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,280
partners.

305
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,230
People are always like this.

306
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,160
They make groundless accusations and spread gossip as they wish.

307
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,620
I think it's because

308
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,090
Jiuxiao City has been too peaceful.

309
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:32,750
If there's a big case

310
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,740
in a few days,

311
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,820
they will lose interest in talking about this.

312
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,460
Su Jiu'er

313
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,550
Are you really just partners?

314
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,780
Really.

315
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,450
Then don't be his partner anymore.

316
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,850
Stay away from him, okay?

317
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,010
But

318
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,450
how can I

319
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,540
break up with my partner

320
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,600
just because of the rumors out there?

321
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,230
Jiu'er.

322
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,560
I'm not an unreasonable person.

323
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,430
You're working in the Inspection Bureau.

324
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,120
You should know better than me.

325
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,350
Although Qian and Qi

326
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,440
seem to be in a peaceful situation now,

327
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,170
the two races

328
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,520
can fight easily.

329
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,050
Although Qian-Qi romances

330
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,180
are not prohibited,

331
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,620
past relationships

332
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,200
were despised by the public.

333
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,690
They were all singled out by the Qian.

334
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,620
I'm telling you.

335
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,850
If you are still entangled

336
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,660
with Hanzheng,

337
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,100
let alone the Inspection Bureau,

338
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,140
the whole neighborhood

339
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,270
can't tolerate you.

340
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,490
But...

341
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,050
Mother.

342
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,990
We are really not

343
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,140
what you think.

344
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,580
-I...
-Jiu'er.

345
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,100
The Qian-Qi romance

346
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,870
may look newfangled,

347
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,300
but it's only temporary joy.

348
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,870
Think about it.

349
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,790
We only live

350
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,730
for decades.

351
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,830
While Qi people

352
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,840
can live for hundreds of years.

353
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,550
After a few decades,

354
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,560
your beauty is gone.

355
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,070
He's still in his prime.

356
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,580
Can he stay with you forever?

357
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,130
Fine.

358
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,070
I promise you, Mother.

359
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,220
I won't have a Qian-Qi romance

360
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,220
with him.

361
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,280
Rest assured.

362
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:10,680
Jiu'er.

363
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,420
You must listen to me this time.

364
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,010
Okay?

365
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,120
I'm starving, Mother.

366
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,200
Did you

367
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,180
cook something delicious?

368
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,220
Get some for me.

369
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,810
I'm starving.

370
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,410
All right.

371
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:20,860
Listen to me.

372
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,540
Okay, you're the boss.

373
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,660
Hurry up.

374
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,040
Get me more.

375
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,220
What matters is

376
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,660
whether Your Highness likes Miss Jiu'er.

377
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,300
Tell me.

378
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,240
You are so weak

379
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,690
and silly.

380
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,580
Will I really fall in love with you?

381
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,090
Why does everyone think

382
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,780
we are having a relationship?

383
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,560
Oh my God.

384
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,320
Why doesn't everyone

385
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,750
understand us?

386
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,800
Don't arrest me.

387
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,900
It's me, Hanzheng.

388
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,470
Hanzheng.

389
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:36,970
Hanzheng.

390
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,650
It's you.

391
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,470
It's already late.

392
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,620
Why are you wandering around

393
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,080
in the middle of the night?

394
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,860
I'm not.

395
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,810
I think no one

396
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,770
understands me.

397
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,030
They all think

398
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,690
we're having a relationship.

399
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,410
It's okay.

400
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,830
I'm here for you.

401
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:58,830
Looks like

402
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,700
she is dreaming of me again.

403
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,550
Hanzheng.

404
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,200
It's great to have you around.

405
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,320
You are only well-behaved

406
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,330
in your dream, aren't you?

407
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,770
What did you say?

408
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,970
Nothing.

409
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,990
Anyway,

410
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,940
you're in your dream now.

411
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,660
Let's just stay quiet

412
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,750
for a moment.

413
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,680
Over there.

414
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,590
Su Jiu'er.

415
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,300
You

416
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,220
shameless woman.

417
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,750
Exactly.

418
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,020
In the middle of the night,

419
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,030
a Qian and a Qi

420
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,940
are here,

421
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,020
flirting and hugging each other.

422
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,630
-Do you have any etiquette?
-No.

423
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,650
It's not what you think.

424
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,440
Stop quibbling.

425
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,390
We saw it.

426
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,780
Yes, we saw it.

427
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,010
You really got us wrong.

428
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,900
You are still quibbling.

429
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,860
We saw it all.

430
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,320
It's not what you think.

431
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,580
It's not what you think.

432
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,400
-I really...
-Jiu'er.

433
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,620
Mother.

434
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,710
Come here.

435
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,200
Come to me.

436
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,380
Stay away from the Qi.

437
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:11,730
Come here.

438
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,310
Yes.

439
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,970
Let's go.

440
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,420
But Mother,

441
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,030
he is my partner.

442
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,180
Am I

443
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,230
just your partner?

444
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,270
Jiu'er.

445
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,760
Come here.

446
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,540
Do you still refuse to come to your senses?

447
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,140
Jiu'er.

448
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,300
Hurry.

449
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,140
If you dare to

450
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,230
stay with the Qi,

451
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,060
the whole neighborhood

452
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,120
is no place for you.

453
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,010
Jiuxiao City

454
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,140
is also no place for you.

455
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,940
That's right.

456
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,180
Go away.

457
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,770
Leave now.

458
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,590
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

459
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,020
You're not allowed here.

460
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,550
Get out of the Jiuxiao City!

461
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,690
Su Jiu'er.

462
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,210
If you can't stay in Jiuxiao City,

463
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,610
I'll take you to Shuobei.

464
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,430
No one will bully you there.

465
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:06,990
And no one

466
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,550
will sit in judgment on you.

467
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:09,869
Get lost.

468
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,710
If your daughter

469
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,800
is with the Qi,

470
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,770
she doesn't deserve to stay in Jiuxiao City.

471
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,050
Neither do you.

472
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,089
Get out!

473
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,369
Get out of here!

474
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,589
Mother!

475
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:21,700
Mother!

476
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,810
Move! Mother!

477
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,690
Get up.

478
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,569
Hanzheng.

479
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,800
Let's never meet again.

480
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,380
You may leave now and

481
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,130
go back to Shuobei on your own.

482
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,820
From now on,

483
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,040
we will never meet again.

484
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,270
Jiu'er.

485
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,100
Let's go.

486
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,780
We should teach her a lesson.

487
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,740
How shameless she is

488
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,740
to do such a thing!

489
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,490
Go away!

490
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,660
Get lost!

491
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,780
Don't stay here.

492
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,900
Get out of Jiuxiao City!

493
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,660
You're not welcome here.

494
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,120
Get out!

495
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,590
Get out of here!

496
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
It was her dream.

497
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,740
Why does it hurt so much here?

498
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,660
Could it be...

499
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,050
I've really got a crush on her?

500
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,500
Don't leave me, Hanzheng.

501
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,940
Han...

502
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,960
Luckily,

503
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,350
it was just a dream.

504
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,920
Put the braziers

505
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,870
in every corner.

506
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,160
Burn more joss paper.

507
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,010
-Yes, sir.
-By the way,

508
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,870
spread out more mulberry leaves.

509
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,380
I have already been

510
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,570
generous.

511
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,530
Don't be stingy.

512
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,190
Spread them out. Hurry up.

513
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:54,710
Okay.

514
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,910
After all,

515
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,580
I wrote "Painting Immortal"

516
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,420
for Meng Huaiyun

517
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,350
and Feng Muyuan.

518
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,090
So,

519
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,130
the story turned out happily.

520
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,780
But

521
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,610
I was worried that if it was too smooth,

522
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,990
the viewers would get bored.

523
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,780
So I wrote another

524
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,710
open-ended one.

525
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,400
Jiu'er. What do you think?

526
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,400
Jiu'er.

527
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,230
What?

528
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,760
The new ending.

529
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,140
The ending?

530
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,750
Alright.

531
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,090
I think you're tired.

532
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:28,820
How about you

533
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,240
go back and rest early?

534
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,710
I'm sorry, Jun.

535
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,820
I promised to check the script for you.

536
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,320
But I'm absent-minded.

537
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,700
It's nothing.

538
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,700
But

539
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,350
what's wrong with you?

540
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,210
Is something bothering you?

541
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,870
Why don't you share it with me?

542
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,890
The gossip of

543
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,620
Hanzheng and I having a Qian-Qi romance,

544
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,950
have you heard about it?

545
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,610
Liu Fu has told me some.

546
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,480
But those are all nonsense.

547
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,390
You don't have to take it to heart.

548
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,000
But I just don't understand.

549
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,640
The two of us are only

550
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,700
solving the cases.

551
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,710
Why are there so many

552
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,850
people

553
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,920
criticizing us?

554
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,550
Besides,

555
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:13,930
my mother

556
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,640
is also worried about me because of this.

557
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,900
It's really annoying.

558
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,150
Is the criticism

559
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,220
bothering you?

560
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,460
Or your relationship with Brother Han?

561
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,810
Do you want to ask

562
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,690
if I really like Hanzheng?

563
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,800
Alright.

564
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,980
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

565
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,940
Because liking someone

566
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,060
is one's own business.

567
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,120
There's no need to confess to others.

568
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:47,990
Actually,

569
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,110
I've never

570
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,270
thought about this.

571
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,200
Why?

572
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,110
Because it's destiny.

573
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,510
I've been weak since I was young.

574
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,990
Someday,

575
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,210
I will leave you all.

576
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,540
So,

577
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,990
whether I like someone

578
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,540
or someone likes me,

579
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,920
it's too much to hope for me.

580
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,620
Besides,

581
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,210
I am already a burden to my mother.

582
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,820
If I implicate the others,

583
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,220
isn't that a sin?

584
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,420
Jiu'er.

585
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,440
Sometimes, you have to think boldly.

586
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,080
I think

587
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,540
romance

588
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,210
is the best thing

589
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,130
in the world.

590
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,780
It can make two people

591
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,870
fall in love at first sight

592
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,080
and be together forever.

593
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,610
It can also make two miserable people

594
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,870
rely on each other in troubled times.

595
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,460
Plus, it can allow two enemies

596
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,920
to understand each other.

597
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,620
How could you regard love

598
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,420
as a burden?

599
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:47,830
So, Jiu'er.

600
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,350
Look.

601
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,950
You met Brother Han.

602
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,850
He can help you live long and healthily.

603
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,780
You met me again.

604
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,610
I will spare no effort

605
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,630
to search the world

606
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,150
for a way to cure you.

607
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,610
So,

608
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,250
there's nothing

609
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,470
destined.

610
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,570
Because

611
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,360
you never know

612
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,140
what will happen tomorrow.

613
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:11,830
Yes.

614
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:14,410
Jun.

615
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,130
Thank you.

616
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,330
What on earth is love?

617
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,620
I hope one day

618
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,840
I can have my own understanding.

619
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,370
You will.

620
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:40,130
♫How regrettable I am♫

621
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,160
This...

622
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,220
What's that sound?

623
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,280
What's that sound?

624
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,150
[Qian, Chen Boliang]

625
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,540
Who is singing?

626
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:51,610
♫Things didn't work out right♫

627
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,780
No way.

628
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,280
Could it be...

629
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,210
This is so scary.

630
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,190
Let's go.

631
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,910
S-Shi Luqing.

632
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,460
You shouldn't be here.

633
00:22:52,430 --> 00:23:01,160
♫I had a sad fate, but nobody felt sorry for me♫

634
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,560
Let's go back

635
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,810
Go back. Go.

636
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,790
Isn't it just an actress

637
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,960
singing backstage?

638
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,090
What's wrong with everyone?

639
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:04,840
The voice

640
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,000
belongs to Shi Luqing.

641
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,060
Shi Luqing?

642
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,740
What happened to her?

643
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,310
She's been dead for half a year.

644
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:13,940
What?

645
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,070
Shi Luqing was an actress.

646
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,280
Without others knowing the reason,

647
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,420
she suddenly committed suicide.

648
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,240
But recently,

649
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,590
someone heard her voice

650
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,450
on the eve of the Ghost Festival.

651
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,130
At first,

652
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,810
everyone thought someone was up to some mischief.

653
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,930
But after searching everywhere,

654
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:27,930
nobody was found.

655
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,000
Later, there was a rumor

656
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,970
that Shi Luqing's soul returned

657
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,970
because the Gate of Hell had opened.

658
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,550
Jun.

659
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,660
Let's get out of here too.

660
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,020
Hurry up!

661
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,800
♫How regrettable I am♫

662
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,220
Hanzheng.

663
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,530
You may leave now and

664
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,270
go back to Shuobei on your own.

665
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,940
From now on,

666
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,610
we will never meet again.

667
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,850
Regarding the Qi Vital Stone,

668
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,940
I've sent a letter to the King of Xueqi.

669
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,270
His Majesty thinks that

670
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,100
since the Black Market

671
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,160
is in the territory of the Qian people,

672
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,690
we can't simply meddle in it

673
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,900
but only investigate in secret.

674
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,190
Next,

675
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,730
my men will ask

676
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,090
those homeless Qi

677
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,580
who have nowhere else to go.

678
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,340
If they are willing to return to Shuobei,

679
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,740
I'll make arrangements.

680
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,150
In the beginning,

681
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,590
I didn't understand

682
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,650
why Qi people lived such miserable lives

683
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,780
in the state of Qian,

684
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,860
but they still didn't want to go back to their hometown.

685
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,130
After spending some time

686
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,610
here,

687
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,950
I realize that people will develop some concerns

688
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,880
after staying here for a long time.

689
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,490
Your concern

690
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,150
is Su Jiu'er, isn't it?

691
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,340
When did you become so gossipy?

692
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,310
The anecdotes between

693
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,250
the Prince of Qi and the female inspector from the Inspection Bureau

694
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,300
have been written into a script

695
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,320
by the storyteller

696
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,140
and spread all over Jiuxiao City.

697
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,600
No way for me not to listen.

698
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,280
If so, I'll listen to it

699
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,090
when I'm free.

700
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,440
Do you really like Su Jiu'er?

701
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,450
Even if Qian-Qi Six Treaties proceeds smoothly,

702
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,590
Qian and Qi

703
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,390
are allowed to get married legally.

704
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,640
But we are different races.

705
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,200
Interracial couples can't give birth to children.

706
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,660
Let alone the average Joe,

707
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,350
you are the heir of Qi.

708
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,100
Your father and the whole Qi race

709
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,550
will definitely not agree.

710
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,280
Are you clear

711
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,530
about this?

712
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,240
I never wanted

713
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,140
to be the king of Qi.

714
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,670
Even without Su Jiu'er,

715
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,880
this is not what I want.

716
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,470
But since I was young,

717
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,350
everyone told me

718
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,130
this was my responsibility.

719
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,060
And nobody gave me

720
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,060
room for choices.

721
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,820
So I resigned myself to my fate.

722
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,930
Since you have resigned to it, you have to persist.

723
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,170
What kind of woman

724
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,100
you are together with in the future

725
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,760
and who you will get married to

726
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,150
is not up to you.

727
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,240
The old man doesn't want to marry you.

728
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,040
Even a cripple doesn't want you.

729
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,300
Don't you know

730
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,820
what your reputation is like?

731
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,680
Leave me alone.

732
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,610
Then I'll never marry forever.

733
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,210
You...

734
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,710
-You really piss me off!
-Such a beautiful girl.

735
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,370
Why does she have to be with a Qi

736
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,940
and ruin her reputation?

737
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,000
Who would like her?

738
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,020
Exactly.

739
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,610
She's already 30 years old.

740
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,810
Now she's destined to be forever alone.

741
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,300
Keep your distance away from Jiu'er.

742
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,430
In the state of Qian,

743
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,420
if a woman has such a reputation,

744
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,700
she will be treated with countless

745
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,030
disdain and criticism.

746
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,510
I'll take care of it.

747
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
I know

748
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,530
you may look willful,

749
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,430
but in fact,

750
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,660
you know how to make the right decision.

751
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,350
Where are you going?

752
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,890
I'm going to see Su Jiu'er.

753
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,130
I haven't given her

754
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,510
today's health and longevity yet.

755
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,110
Jun.

756
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,170
Qi people are afraid of heat.

757
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,910
I don't think they can stand it.

758
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,000
Boss Chen believes that.

759
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,530
Please bless us.

760
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,040
Please bless us.

761
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,600
Master.

762
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,520
In broad daylight,

763
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,770
how dare you bully Qi people!

764
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,370
Hanzheng.

765
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,950
Su Jiu'er.

766
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,060
Did you just

767
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,560
stand idly by and watch this happen?

768
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,220
Brother Han, you got us wrong.

769
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,120
Here, Master.

770
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,380
He's gone too far.

771
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,580
Be careful.

772
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,660
I quit.

773
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,760
Master!

774
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,310
Master, please don't go!

775
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:13,870
Master!

776
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:16,630
This...

777
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,190
You ignorant Qi.

778
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,740
How dare you disturb our ritual!

779
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,910
He's just doing a ritual.

780
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,390
He didn't mean to make things difficult for

781
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,210
this Qi buddy.

782
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,260
A ritual?

783
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,100
-Such a ritual
-What are you doing?

784
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,100
is not only an insult to the Qi people

785
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,580
but also makes you yourselves

786
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,580
look ridiculous.

787
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,380
Ridiculous?

788
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,060
How dare you say that?

789
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,100
I sympathized with him.

790
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,970
Go ask around.

791
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,020
Ten taels of silver for a ritual.

792
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,930
In the entire Jiuxiao City,

793
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,510
you Qi people will never find

794
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,440
such a good deal.

795
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,100
Su Jiu'er.

796
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,720
You are an Inspector.

797
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,740
Why don't you get

798
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,000
the troublemaker out?

799
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:55,170
Boss.

800
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,310
This Qi

801
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,740
seems to be an Inspector.

802
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,690
And I heard

803
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,060
he's the female inspector's lover.

804
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,970
How could an Inspector

805
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,640
fall in love with a Qi?

806
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,710
I...

807
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,370
Fine.

808
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,040
If you don't help me,

809
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,740
we'll go to the Inspection Bureau

810
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,940
to see Commander Yan.

811
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,680
Boss Chen.

812
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,100
These are

813
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,480
all rumors.

814
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,880
Prince Han is a Patrol.

815
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,300
He's also my partner.

816
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,820
He must have misunderstood the situation.

817
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,020
Boss Chen, calm down.

818
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,420
Let me explain to him.

819
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,220
Hanzheng.

820
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,380
You got it wrong.

821
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,790
This Qi buddy

822
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,300
did it willingly.

823
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,440
And Boss Chen

824
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,500
did pay him.

825
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,050
He didn't force the buddy.

826
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,720
Shut up!

827
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,990
Brother Han.

828
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,940
What is with your attitude while

829
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,270
talking to Miss Jiu'er?

830
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,590
I'm talking to you properly.

831
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,860
Why are you yelling at me?

832
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,340
They are really having an equal deal.

833
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,540
And Boss Chen did

834
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,310
pay him.

835
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,180
You keep saying

836
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,640
that Qian and Qi are equal.

837
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,140
But during this period,

838
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,010
I've never seen

839
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:49,970
any equality

840
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,900
in Jiuxiao City.

841
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,180
Inspector Su.

842
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,570
It's almost time.

843
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:54,660
Hurry up

844
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,490
and get your partner out of here.

845
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,360
Stop making trouble here.

846
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,420
Go back to the Inspector Bureau with me.

847
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:00,840
Fine.

848
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,790
I won't bother you then.

849
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,970
Hanzheng, you...

850
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,410
What happened?

851
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,540
Are they disbanded?

852
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,600
Are they really not a Qian-Qi couple?

853
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,080
I'm confused too.

854
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,350
[Qi, Young Master of Cangqi, Keyuncha]

855
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,900
The Qi is so fierce.

856
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,280
He and Inspector Su

857
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,880
don't look like a pair.

858
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,940
Where is the Qi?

859
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:20,940
I spent a lot of money

860
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,870
to find that Qi.

861
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,480
He took my deposit and ran away.

862
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,040
None of the Qi people

863
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,580
is good.

864
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,020
Inspector Su.

865
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,340
Since it happened

866
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,280
under your nose,

867
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,190
it is your responsibility.

868
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,620
I'm going to see Commander Yan.

869
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,950
-Boss Chen.
-Boss Chen.

870
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,960
Don't be angry.

871
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,880
I'll compensate you for the loss.

872
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,660
The weather is dry and so are things,

873
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,280
watch out and do not kindle them.

874
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:06,730
♫How regrettable I am♫

875
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,110
The weather is dry and so are things...

876

Do you know

932
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,900
the strange thing that happened in The Western Chamber?

933
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,700
Do you mean the revival of

934
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,760
Shi Luqing's soul?

935
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,050
Who is

936
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,420
Shi Luqing exactly?

937
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,380
Shi Luqing

938
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,160
was an out-of-towner.

939
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,420
At first,

940
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,310
she always went to The Western Chamber to watch opera.

941
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,730
She was pretty.

942
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,170
And then,

943
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,660
I heard that one day,

944
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,010
she found the boss and complained,

945
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,620
saying she was in a hopeless dilemma.

946
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,680
Firstly, Boss Chen is soft-hearted.

947
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,550
Secondly,

948
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,180
he heard she could sing opera.

949
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,440
So he gave her a chance.

950
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,590
After that,

951
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,350
she officially

952
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,970
joined The Western Chamber.

953
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,060
Anyway,

954
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,780
Shi Luqing became famous after her first show.

955
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,600
Later, she became more popular.

956
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,500
She did sing well.

957
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,150
But rumor had it that

958
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,409
her private life was promiscuous.

959
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,610
She could meet her former lovers wherever she went.

960
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,010
I don't know if it's true.

961
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,570
She was a big hit for some time.

962
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,880
Not long after that,

963
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,100
she suddenly jumped off the city tower.

964
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,030
That's strange.

965
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,350
Since she became famous for singing,

966
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,699
her life should be

967
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:32,540
on a roll.

968
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,630
Why did she jump off the city tower?

969
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,449
You're asking me?

970
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:36,380
Who should I ask?

971
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,400
Let me tell you.

972
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:39,670
On the day she jumped off the tower,

973
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,620
I was on duty.

974
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,679
I saw it with my own eyes.

975
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,090
She was wearing red

976
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,159
and muttering something.

977
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,170
Then, she jumped off all of a sudden.

978
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,170
No one pushed her.

979
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,870
We filed a case.

980
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,880
No matter how we investigated it, the result showed it was a suicide.

981
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,470
What's wrong, girl?

982
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,010
Are you feeling unwell?

983
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,180
I'm fine.

984
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,680
I just feel a little dizzy.

985
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:04,990
Are you tired?

986
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,550
Just take a rest here.

987
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,390
I'll get you something to eat.

988
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,050
Wait for me.

989
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,960
Hurry up. Come and help me.

990
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,720
I...

991
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:22,990
I'm about to faint.

992
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,280
Come closer.

993
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,030
Come closer.

994
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,030
It feels so comfortable.

995
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,680
It's like the grass

996
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,020
suddenly

997
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,190
getting the first rays of spring

999
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,400
The grass is nice and warm.

1000
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,120
So comfortable.

1001
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,600
Anyway,

1002
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,150
don't you still

1003
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,140
treat me

1004
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,770
as a tool?

1005
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:55,380
No.

1006
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,980
Don't be so petty.

1007
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,170
You've warmed me, who is like a small grass.

1008
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,300
And I've cooled you,

1009
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,140
who is like a massive furnace.

1010
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,980
It's fair.

1011
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:05,920
No.

1012
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,820
I even took you to investigate the case.

1013
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,870
You've gained a profit.

1014
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,130
You've made a killing.

1015
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,610
You really know how to settle a score.

1016
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,360
I'll hold it more for a while.

1017

You two

1023

pretend not to get along in front of others.

1024
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,930
But you are so lovey-dovey in secret.

1025
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,710
Keep your voice down, Godfather.

1026
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,390
We have no choice,

1027
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,570
don't we?

1028
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,630
Right?

1029
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,270
-Yes.
-We just want to

1030
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,740
replenish our energy

1031
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,410
while not being watched.

1032
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,580
You know that

1033
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,540
gossip is a fearful thing.

1034
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,470
It's all because

1035
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,740
you Qian people

1036
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,980
love to gossip.

1037
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,610
You're so stubborn.

1038
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,490
Look at your face.

1039
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,310
You look a little angry.

1040
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,660
Nice acting, young man.

1041
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,480
Take it.

1042
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,720
What are you looking at?

1043
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,800
I've entrusted my daughter's life

1044

to you.

1045
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,660
If you want to replenish for her, just do it in public.

1046
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,390
Do your best.

1047
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,560
Spare no effort.

00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,500
I won't disturb you anymore.

1049
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:24,890
Go on.

1050
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:25,990
Go on.

1051
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,840
I'll keep watch for you.

1052
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,280
It's sweet. Eat it.

1053
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,080
Eat.

1054
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,110
I'll try it first.

1055
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,230
It's really sweet.

1056
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,180
Try it.

1057
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,830
No.

1058
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,510
You don't even eat it when I feed you myself.

1059
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,570
Try it.

1060
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:01,500
How is it?

1061
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,660
Is it sweet?

1062
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,640
Did my godfather

1063
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,740
give you a shock just now?

1064
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,470
How could I be scared of

1065
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,600
such a trivial matter?

1066
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,910
Yue Daren is here.

1067
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,030
I love seeing you

1068
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,070
embarrassed.

1069
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,860
It's really awkward.

1070
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,260
Godfather, you scared us.

1071
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,840
I won't scare you anymore.

1072
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,200
I'll keep watch for you.

1073
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:29,760
Go on.

1074
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,770
Go on.

1075
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,690
The Tanghulu is wasted.

1076
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,460
Leave it.

1077
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,940
I'll buy you another one.

1078
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,660
Hold on.

1079
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:44,880
Your hand.

1080
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,970
Tanghulu is not in a hurry.

1081
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,550
I haven't got enough

1082
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,870
health and longevity.

1083
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,970
It's so warm.

1084
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,360
Wait.

1085
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,740
Many people are watching the rehearsal today.

1086
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,530
Remember,

1087
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,590
we are now

1088
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,010
partners in a stalemate.

1089
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,490
Then why do we go together?

1090
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,640
If so, I'll come back later.

1091
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,640
Go in and find Jun.

1092
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,100
Wait.

1093
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,740
It's the Ghost Festival.

1094
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,750
You're a girl.

1095
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,590
You can't simply wander around.

1096
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,450
That makes sense.

1097
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,300
How about this?

1098
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,160
You go in first.

1099
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,740
I'll go in after I go for another circle.

1100
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,000
Okay, I'll go in first.

1101
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:41,320
Go.

1102
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:44,740
Hanzheng.

1103
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:46,220
Come back early.

1104
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,530
Okay, stop.

1105
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,080
Remember.

1106
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,360
When the boat comes,

1107
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,560
pull it to the center.

1108
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,180
Noted.

1109
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,580
Okay.

1110
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,460
Come on.

1111
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,250
I hope it's a

1112
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,460
heart-to-heart communication.

1113
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,890
Okay, you guys continue.

1114
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,280
Okay.

1115
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,000
Is it started?

1116
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,990
Not yet, but soon.

1117
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,650
Where's Brother Han?

1118
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,580
Isn't he coming?

1119
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,740
Did he forget?

1120
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,460
Don't worry.

1121
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:39,660
He won't forget.

1122
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,790
Where did he go?

1123
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,390
With his martial arts,

1124
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,320
he would have gone back to Shuobei.

1125
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,150
If you are bored,

1126
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,240
I'll walk with you.

1127
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,180
No need.

1128
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,930
There are so many people here who need you.

1129
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:53,800
You must be very busy.

1130
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,000
Don't worry about me.

1131
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,350
By the way,

1132
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,360
I do have one thing that needs your favor.

1133
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,880
My good friend, Hua,

1134
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,760
knew I'd be here to watch the "Painting Immortal,"

1135
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,050
so she asked me

1136
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,110
to get her the autograph of the male lead.

1137
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,910
Is she also a fan of Ren Fengyang?

1138
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:07,860
Kind of.

1139
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:09,620
She likes whoever is popular.

1140
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,010
Okay.

1141
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,360
Leave it to me.

1142
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,270
♫In a flash♫

1143
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:24,900
♫I turn out to be haggard♫

1144
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,820
♫As beauty♫

1145
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,100
♫Is a fragile gift♫

1146
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,410

1147
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,760
♫High as mountains and long as rivers♫
