[Episode 22]

4
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,620
Shi Luqing only had

5
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,420
these left.

6
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,729
I was going to burn them.

7
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,860
A few days later,

8
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,390
the new tenant will move in.

9
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,490
I'll wait for you outside.

10
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,810
But,

11
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,240
don't stay too long.

12
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,460
I have something to do this afternoon.

13
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,210
Auntie.

14
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:53,700
Sister!

15
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:55,960
Sister.

16
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,759
Sis...

17
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,400
Are you calling me?

18
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,080
Yes.

19
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,080
You must be joking.

20
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,170
Sister.

21
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,060
I think you're only a few years older than me.

22
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,060
Isn't that common

23
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,000
if I address you as Sister?

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,840
Not at all.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,440
I'm already

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,760
in my forties.

27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,880
But

28
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,540
they all said...

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,320
They said I don't look like one.

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,050
I can't tell.

31
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,920
I really can't.

32
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,920
Sister.

33
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,420
Why did you ask Wen Jun

34
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,770
to come here at this moment?

35
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,780
He's very noisy.

36
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,000
Just wait and see.

37
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,340
At most, you're in your twenties.

38
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,140
Is that true?

39
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,660
Yes.

40
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,530
Thank you so much.

41
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,770
You're dignified in appearance.

42
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,370
You must be a nobleman.

43
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,590
Yes.

44
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,110
Sister.

45
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,650
Well,

46
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,270
after Shi Luqing moved in,

47
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,300
did she have close contact

48
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,060
with anyone?

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,240
No.

50
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,260
Since she moved into this house,

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,100
I've never seen her contact

52
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,370
with anyone.

53
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,770
Usually,

54
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,710
she was a loner.

55
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,600
After she passed away,

56
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,780
did any of her family

57
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,900
come to ask about it?

58
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,400
No one came.

59
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,660
I've never seen anyone

60
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,740
pack her things.

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,290
I even suspected

62
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,470
she was an orphan.

63
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,370
Thank you.

64
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,710
-I won't disturb you anymore.
-An orphan?

65
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,260
I'll ask you later if I have any questions.

66
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,130
Okay.

67
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,810
I'll wait upstairs then.

68
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,090
Take your time.

69
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,230
There's no rush.

70
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,170
Thank you.

71
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,190
Thank you.

72
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:22,850
Thank you.

73
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,870
You're welcome.

74
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:24,730
Jun.

75
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,010
You're really likable.

76
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,970
As long as I can help you.

77
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,390
Find the clues quickly.

78
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,280
We're in a hurry.

79
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,430
Let me help you.

80
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,640
We're not in a hurry.

81
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,900
Look at this.

82
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,670
What is this?

83
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,340
Shi Luqing's room

84
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,100
is so shabby.

85
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,460
It seems that

86
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,329
she was not well-off.

87
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,450
But the jade

88
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,670
is of top quality.

89
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,730
It seems that the center part

90
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,130
is not formed naturally.

91
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,470
Let me have a look.

92
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,890
It seems to belong to the He's Troupe.

93
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,160
The He's Troupe?

94
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,570
In the state of Nan,

95
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,400
there's a big opera troupe.

96
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,060
Their leader's surname is He.

97
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,650
I watched a few of their performances before.

98
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,760
I heard that their leader

99
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,050
treasures disciples very much.

100
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,170
Hearsay had it that

101
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,149
each of his disciples

102
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,880
gets a jade pendant carved with the He character.

103
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,960
Was Shi Luqing

104
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,650
a disciple in the He's Troupe?

105
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,520
This is a useful clue.

106
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,860
We can't find anyone

107
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,920
related to her in Jiuxiao City,

108
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,030
but we can make it in the state of Nan.

109
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,700
Yes.

110
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,120
Right?

111
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,810
Jun.

112
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,790
You're really knowledgeable.

113
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,820
Stop praising me.

114
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,440
Am I not the one

115
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,970
who found the jade pendant?

116
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,470
Where are you going?

117
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,270
To find clues.

118
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,920
What clues will there be outside?

119
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,659
There's nothing unusual

120
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:54,580
in this yard.

121
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,340
Did you have some new findings?

122
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,870
I won't tell you.

123
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,380
Prince Han.

124
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,910
You're impressive too.

125
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,340
Look.

126
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,540
You're observant and insightful.

127
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,420
Tell me.

128
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,310
Did you really

129
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,570
make new discoveries?

130
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,660
Impressive too?

131
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,260
The best.

132
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,570
You're the best.

133
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,090
The best of the best.

134
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,220
Go away.

135
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,340
This is it.

136
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,290
Isn't this

137
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,700
an ordinary flower stand?

138
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,860
Many people like to

139
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,460
place several pots of plants on it.

140
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,590
What's the big deal?

141
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,380
There's also

142
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,260
an identical flower stand there.

143
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,930
Are you saying

144
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,310
there are two

145
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,070
identical flower stands here?

146
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,290
And the flowers inside

147
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,930
also withered at the same time.

148
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,550
This means

149
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,220
the occupants of these two rooms

150
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,420
left at the same time.

151
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,170
Perhaps

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,030
they would

153
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,110
have some connections.

154
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,890
I'll go upstairs to have a look.

155
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,040
I'll ask the landlord then.

156
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
No, it's Sister.

157
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,670
Sister.

158
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,330
Look at him.

159
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,160
He's so glib-tongued.

160
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,690
He's not telling the truth.

161
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,580
You're clearly prejudiced.

162
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,560
Jun is clever and adorable.

163
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,590
What?

164
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,110
Do you like him?

165
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,830
No, I don't.

166
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,360
Don't talk nonsense.

167
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,080
You can't use

168
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,159
the word casually.

169
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,640
Do you not like him?

170
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,960
No.

171
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,740
It's not the kind of love

172
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,740
between a couple,

173
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,180
but

174
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,210
between friends.

175
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,030
Sister.

176
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,970
That room is the one

177
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,170
I just told you about.

178
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,700
That one?

179
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,030
That one is mine too.

180
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,530
It's been unoccupied for half a year.

181
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,420
Six months ago,

182
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,110
the tenant...

183
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,500
He's a young man.

184
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,060
Oh, he's a Qi.

185
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,630
He's a Qi?

186
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,610
But I didn't find that Shi Luqing

187
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,010
had any contact with him.

188
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,390
What's his name?

189
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,820
Do you have his pass?

190
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,080
It was rented by a middleman.

191
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,390
I can't remember his name.

192
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,650
Earlier,

193
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,070
Qian and Qi weren't in such a tense situation.

194
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,670
Besides,

195
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,210
the government didn't say

196
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,100
we must collect the pass

197
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,360
to rent out a house.

198
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,250
Does that Qi

199
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,780
have any characteristics?

200
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,380
He seems tallish.

201
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,150
Yes.

202
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:39,770
After he left,

203
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,320
when I was cleaning the room,

204
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,280
I found

205
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,130
a very strange bracelet.

206
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,940
Wait here. I'll get it for you.

207
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,730
A bracelet?

208
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,230
This is it.

209
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,659
It looks exactly

210
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,200
the same as the one you wear.

211
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,230
Do you know each other?

212
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,970
Keyuncha told me

213
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,840
he had lost his bracelet.

214
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,780
Didn't he say

215
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,780
he once had a Qian partner?

216
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,860
The one who left him.

217
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,010
Keyuncha.

218
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,580
Boss Chen...

219
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,860
Boss Chen is in danger.

220
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,450
Where could he be now?

221
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,350
He should be

222
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,010
in The Western Chamber at this moment.

223
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,550
Let's go.

224
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,780
What about me?

225
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
Goodbye, Sister.

226
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,360
Take care, Young Master.

227
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,030
Excuse me,

228
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,010
may I ask where Boss Chen is?

229
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,000
I think I saw him just now.

230
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,110
Did you see Boss Chen?

231
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,780
I think he went out.

232
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,110
He went out?

233
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,390
Are you sure he went out?

234
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:52,790
No.

235
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,840
He's inside.

236
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,040
Where is Boss Chen?

237
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,280
He's in the prop room backstage.

238
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,200
I just cleaned it yesterday.

239
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,600
Why is there so much dust?

240
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,890
Black powder?

241
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,780
What's wrong?

242
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,940
The black powder causes an explosion when ignited by flame.

243
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,740
Could it be...

244
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,410
I'll go take a look.

245
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:19,840
Wait.

246
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:20,950
I'll go.

247
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,000
Stay still.

248
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,790
Han Zheng.

249
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:24,920
You...

250
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,900
This room is in a worse situation.

251
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,330
Which bastard

252
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,480
did this?

253
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,600
Cui.

254
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,310
Clean this room thoroughly.

255
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,570
This...

256
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,690
Put out the candle flame! Hurry!

257
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,130
Hurry!

258
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:51,910
Han Zheng.

259
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,760
Han Zheng.

260
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,770
Han Zheng!

261
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,710
Han Zheng!

262
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,170
Han...

263
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,160
Inspector Su, it's dangerous here.

264
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,790
Let's go.

265
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,750
I can't leave.

266
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,130
Report to the Inspection Bureau immediately.

267
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,100
Call for rescue.

268
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,470
Go.

269
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,100
Han Zheng!

270
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,790
Han Zheng!

271
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,520
Han Zheng!

272
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,220
Where are you?

273
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,920
Han Zheng!

274
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,180
Come out!

275
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,350
Han Zheng. Where are you?

276
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,620
Han Zheng!

277
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,720
Don't scare me.

278
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,810
Han Zheng.

279
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,490
Han Zheng.

280
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,700
Han Zheng.

281
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,610
Han Zheng!

282
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,580
Han Zheng.

283
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,050
Come out, please.

284
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,080
Don't scare me.

285
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,850
Han Zheng!

286
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,990
Where are you?

287
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,900
Han Zheng.

288
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,790
This is his clothing.

289
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,830
Could he have been...

290
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:23,980
Impossible.

291
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,260
Isn't the Qi race

292
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,240
super mighty?

293
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,250
How could he

294
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,370
die so easily?

295
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,100
Han Zheng!

296
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,620
Come out!

297
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,920
Come out now!

298
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,820
Tell me you're fine.

299
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,820
Do you hear me?

300
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,700
Han Zheng!

301
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:41,670
Idiot.

302
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,410
What are you looking for?

303
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,610
Han Zheng.

304
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,300
Boss Chen.

305
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,060
Boss Chen.

306
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,750
Let's go.

307
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,560
Boss Chen.

308
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,820
Han Zheng.

309
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,710
Han Zheng.

310
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,400
You nearly scared me to death.

311
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,540
I thought you were dead.

312
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,040
You scared me.

313
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,640
Stupid.

314
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,060
I'm fine.

315
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,160
Why are you crying?

316
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,070
Why do you call me an idiot,

317
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,320
then a fool?

318
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,030
At such a moment,

319
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,330
why are you still so annoying?

320
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,700
Don't cry.

321
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,240
It turns out

322
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,890
you care about me.

323
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,290
I care about you.

324
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:44,780
Mother.

325
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,330
How do I know

326
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,870
whether I've fallen in love with someone?

327
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,370
You'll naturally know

328
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,320
when you fall in love with someone.

329
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,720
Please enlighten me.

330
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,420
When you

331
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,590
like someone,

332
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,910
he will become the person

333
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,570
you miss and care about the most.

334
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,740
You will

335
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,190
be desperate to see him

336
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,590
and get close to him.

337
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,680
When you think of him,

338
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,640
you can't help but be happy.

339
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,620
You would like to share the trivialities

340
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,110
with him.

341
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,550
Because of that person,

342
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,480
a never-changing life

343
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,140
has become more interesting.

344
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,170
You'll care about

345
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,090
each of his little emotions

346
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,420
and enjoy his kindness to you.

347
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,540
And

348
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,220
you will think of treating him better

349
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,150
and being afraid of losing him.

350
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,300
Because once you fall in love with someone,

351
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,700
you can never get used to

352
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,330
living without him.

353
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,010
It turns out

354
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,150
this is the feeling

355
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,710
when liking someone.

356
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,920
Alright. Stop crying.

357
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,260
I'm not hurt.

358
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,170
If you are sad,

359
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,020
I'll be unhappy too.

360
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,420
Are you okay?

361
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,750
I'm fine.

362
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,030
No.

363
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,470
Does it hurt?

364
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,360
No.

365
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,640
No.

366
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,160
What about the other hand?

367
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,460
It doesn't hurt too.

368
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,180
What happened?

369
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,620
Don't you ever

370
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,580
leave me alone

371
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,580
and do

372
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,750
such a dangerous thing anymore.

373
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,540
Do you hear me?

374
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,000
Hold on.

375
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,390
Get your hand off first.

376
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,190
If I had taken you with me just now,

377
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,150
I wouldn't have had time

378
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,810
to care about

379
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,870
Boss Chen during the explosion.

380
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,670
I would only think of saving you.

381
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,090
If something like this happens again,

382
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,250
keep your distance

383
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,460
and stop being a burden.

384
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,080
Do you hear me?

385
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,610
It hurts.

386
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,310
Okay.

387
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,690
Roger that.

388
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,590
Hurry up.

389
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,240
Search

390
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,150
and see if anyone is dead.

391
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,750
Yes.

392
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,930
Your Highness.

393
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,840
Your...

394
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,290
Girl.

395
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,270
You...

396
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,710
Godfather.

397
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,359
Come here.

398
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,170
Let's go.

399
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,829
Come on.

400
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,520
Godfather.

401
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:11,839
What happened?

402
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,339
Why did you come to the prop room?

403
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:13,810
How are you?

404
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,740
Did you g-get hurt?

405
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,660
I'm fine.

406
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,980
It's just a minor injury on my hand.

407
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:20,990
Boss Chen

408
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:22,859
is still in good health.

409
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:23,589
He's moaning

410
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,470
for us to send him to the clinic.

411
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,720
Godfather.

412
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,300
Apart from Boss Chen,

413
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,570
everyone in The Western Chamber

414
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,290
mustn't be allowed to leave.

415
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,350
Don't worry. Girl.

416
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,490
The Western Chamber

417
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,420
has been surrounded by our people.

418
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,100
Everyone here

419
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,980
is suspicious.

420
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,770
What's going on?

421
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,560
Why did the prop room explode?

422
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,090
Uncle Hu.

423
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,980
We should ask everyone in The Western Chamber

424
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,040
to gather at the front yard first.

425
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,370
Okay.

426
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,800
Let's go.

427
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,070
That's all you know.

428
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,740
Yes, that's all.

429
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,510
Stay here.

430
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,070
Okay.

431
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,260
Next.

432
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,900
Shi Luqing was Keyuncha's lover.

433
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,400
Could the explosion

434
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,650
be Keyuncha's doing?

435
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,820
Your Highness.

436
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,620
I almost lost you again.

437
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,240
No, I'm fine.

438
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,970
Go away.

439
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,220
Luckily, you two are fine.

440
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:16,860
Did you

441
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,740
do this?

442
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,820
What did I do?

443
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,990
We've known about

444
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,660
you and Shi Luqing.

445
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,830
So you think the explosion

446
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,560
was my doing?

447
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,450
Do you think I risked your life

448
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,050
to take revenge on Boss Chen?

449
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:34,620
Fine.

450
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,920
I trust you.

451
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,250
But you have to tell me.

452
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,830
What else are you hiding from me?

453
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,080
I will tell you.

454
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,470
-Maybe...
-I know.

455
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,150
Keyuncha

456
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,090
didn't cause the explosion.

457
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,840
Hu.

458
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,530
Is everyone in The Western Chamber

459
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,370
all here?

460
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,530
Yes.

461
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,660
But Boss Chen isn't here.

462
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,700
No.

463
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,700
I remember

464
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,110
there was a hunchback old man,

465
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,190
seeming to be mute.

466
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Why isn't he here?

467
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,240
You're talking about Zhang, who takes charge of the props,

468
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,900
aren't you?

469
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,300
I saw him just now...

470
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,400
I did see him just now.

471
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,140
Why did he disappear?

472
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,260
He didn't disappear.

473
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,970
He just made a perfect disguise.

474
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,330
You did the explosion,

475
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,340
right?

476
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,960
Old Man Zhang.

477
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,140
He...

478
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,330
Old Man Zhang?

479
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,910
How is that possible?

480
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,350
But

481
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,270
I really haven't

482
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,550
met this person before.

483
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,280
Is he from The Western Chamber?

484
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,740
I haven't seen him before.

485
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,390
I didn't even notice it.

486
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,590
How could a stranger

487
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,150
wear

488
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,570
our costume?

489
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,250
Because he wants to hide the clothing of Old Man Zhang

490
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,450
with a large costume.

491
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,220
That's right.

492
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:15,990
It's him.

493
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,770
Young lady.

494
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,200
How do you recognize me?

495
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,380
When I entered the yard,

496
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,880
I found a large amount of powder

497
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,900
on Old Man Zhang.

498
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,900
It is very likely

499
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,680
he got them

500
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,960
when he was setting up for the explosion.

501
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
When we asked

502
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,720
where Boss Chen was,

503
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,040
he told us outside the theater.

504
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,440
Apparently,

505
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,260
he wanted to distract Han Zheng and me from the theater.

506
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:45,960
But all these

507
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,220
are not enough to prove

508
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,470
Old Man Zhang did it.

509
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,230
Until I found

510
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,010
Old Man Zhang had disappeared,

511
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,340
and a stranger appeared

512
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,100
in the crowd.

513
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,390
That person

514
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,560
is you.

515
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,920
I'm the leader of the He's Opera Troupe from the state of Nan,

516
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,730
He Yuqin.

517
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,830
Shi Luqing

518
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,310
is my daughter.

519
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,780
If so, we would like to invite Mr. He

520
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,000
back to the Inspection Bureau with us.

521
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,620
Also, Keyuncha.

522
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,130
We need

523
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,620
your cooperation in the investigation too.

524
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,070
Please.

525
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:57,940
This way.

526
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,520
He Yuqin.

527
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,310
Tell us one by one.

528
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Besides the explosion,

529
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,300
what else are you hiding?

530
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,610
Are you playing tricks with us?

531
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,930
Don't think we can't do anything

532
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,190
if you just keep quiet.

533
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,760
What more crimes do you want me to confess?

534
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,840
I'll admit all of those.

535
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,070
You...

536
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,180
You...

537
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,030
Mr. He.

538
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,830
Have some tea.

539
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,500
Mr. He.

540
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,900
Although you are now in the Inspection Bureau,

541
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,180
if possible,

542
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,080
I hope

543
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,880
you don't take our conversation

544
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,080
as an interrogation,

545
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,210
but

546
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,230
as a chance to pour out your heart.

547
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,100
I know injustices had happened

548
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,250
to Shi Luqing.

549
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,100
That's why

550
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,360
you came to this point.

551
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,790
You must have a lot to say.

552
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,780
Miss.

553
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,220
You look

554
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,940
around the same age

555
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,190
as Qing.

556
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,620
When I see

557
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,220
girls similar to her age

558
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,550
still living

559
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,540
their own lives

560
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,010
and experiencing

561
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,210
the ups and downs,

562
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,830
and I recall Qing

563
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,700
had left this world long ago

564
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,400
with despair,

565
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,460
I feel more hatred toward those criminals

566
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,260
who destroyed Qing.

567
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,590
So,

568
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,230
to avenge Shi Luqing,

569
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,210
you disguised yourself as Old Man Zhang, took charge of the props

570
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,210
and worked in The Western Chamber

571
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,340
to investigate

572
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,300
the ins and outs.

573
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,740
Shi Luqing.

574
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,780
Even now,

575
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,750
I still can't

576
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,940
get used to the name.

577
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,710
She renamed herself

578
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,900
after she ran away from home.

579
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
My daughter's real name was He Qing.

580
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,730
She was the eldest daughter

581
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,980
of the fourth generation in the He's Troupe in the state of Nan.

582
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,380
Everyone in the He family

583
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,600
had high expectations for her.

584
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,500
And Qing

585
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,500
did work very hard.

586
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,460
There were no characters she couldn't sing.

587
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,100
I was proud of her.

588
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,650
But she fell in love with

589
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,030
a Qi person.

590
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,970
Do you mean Keyuncha?

591
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,880
Because of her,

592
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,140
the He family was embarrassed.

593
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,450
I even threatened her

594
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,590
with breaking up the relationship.

595
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,730
Then she ran away from home.

596
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,350
But Mr. He,

597
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,620
have you thought about it?

598
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
A Qian-Qi romance

599
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,840
has never been thought highly of

600
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,650
by the public.

601
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,180
But she

602
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,360
still chose to fight against everything

603
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,830
to be with Keyuncha.

604
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,270
That means she had made up her mind

605
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,430
and could bear

606
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,690
all the consequences.

607
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:36,950
Your forcing

608
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,800
would only drive her into a corner.

609
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,190
Maybe.

610
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,800
Until now,

611
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,460
I am still being regretful.

612
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,580
Half a year ago,

613
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,810
I heard that

614
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,420
an understudy

615
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,910
became famous overnight.

616
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,930
Moreover, she had

617
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,600
the singing style of the He's Troupe of the state of Nan.

618
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,740
So I put aside

619
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,770
everything

620
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,400
and came to Jiuxiao City.

621
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,890
But in the end,

622
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,270
I was late.

623
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,830
Qing

624
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,660
jumped off

625
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,040
from the city tower.

626
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,060
I...

627
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,580
I didn't even get to see her

628
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,400
one last time.

629
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,470
I went around to inquire about the details,

630
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,470
with the pain of losing my daughter.

631
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,180
But I heard

632
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,200
Qing had a bad reputation.

633
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,510
People said she had close contact with many men.

634
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,300
How was that possible?

635
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,440
How was that possible?

636
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,980
She's my daughter.

637
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,670
I know her best.

638
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,790
Qing always maintained her moral integrity

639
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,320
and was dedicated to a relationship.

640
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,400
There must be

641
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,430
something fishy.

642
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,530
But I had no other choice.

643
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,950
I could only pretend to be Old Man Zhang

644
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,790
and hid in The Western Chamber

645
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,780
to look into the real cause of Qing's death.

646
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,500
Regarding the haunting in the theater at the beginning

647
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,230
and the murder of Ren Fengyang,

648
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,750
are you the culprit?

649
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,390
I'd thought about

650
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,060
making

651
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,400
the person who killed Qing

652
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,260
give himself away for a long time.

653
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,370
Then I thought of

654
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,390
resurrecting Qing

655
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,270
to find out others' reactions.

656
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,580
The one who reacted the most

657
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,310
was Ren Fengyang's maid,

658
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,610
Mei.

659
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,880
Sister Shi.

660
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,420
I'm sorry.

661
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,860
If I had canceled my appointment

662
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,540
with you that day,

663
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,920
you might not have

664
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,990
come this far.

665
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,840
We were best friends when you were alive.

666
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,040
Please don't hate me.

667
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,180
Who is it?

668
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,080
It's you.

669
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,120
I'm fine.

670
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,520
I'm just too scared.

671
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,560
Tell me.

672
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,400
If I burn some joss paper

673
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,830
for Sister Shi every day,

674
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,880
will she feel better

675
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,900
under the ground?

676
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,030
It saddens me

677
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,240
when I hear people say that

678
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,760
she behaved dishonorably

679
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,630
and deserved the misfortune that happened.

680
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,740
Because I don't believe

681
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,940
she was such a person.

682
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,680
She wouldn't take the initiative to

683
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,710
seduce Mr. Ren.

684
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,280
That night,

685
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,730
Mr. Ren must have forced her.

686
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,450
That night,

687
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,480
I finally found out

688
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,930
the truth.

689
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,270
Why did my precious daughter

690
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,390
jump off

691
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,540
from the city tower?

692
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,750
Because she was humiliated

693
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,750
by a bastard.

694
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,100
He assaulted

695
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,190
and humiliated her

696
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,120
with such an indecent trick.

697
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,380
Didn't he deserve to die?

698
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,420
On the Painting Immortal rehearsal,

699
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,610
I drugged

700
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,030
Ren Fengyang's pear soup

701
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,790
to make him mute

702
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,120
and go weak at the knees.

703
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,960
The Qing's voice he heard

704
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,890
was my imitation.

705
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,390
If he was not guilty,

706
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,640
he wouldn't be so afraid

707
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,890
of Qing's voice

708
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,710
and even fell

709
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,800
from the platform.

710
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,540
What about Boss Chen?

711
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,840
How did you know

712
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,700
he sexually assaulted Shi Luqing too?

713
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,700
I thought killing Ren Fengyang

714
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,390
was enough to avenge Qing.

715
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,220
But unexpectedly,

716
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,220
Mei suddenly died.

717
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,010
And it was done by a silk merchant, Zhou Guanglin,

718
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,830
who had nothing to do with it.

719
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,180
I think

720
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,860
it must be related to Qing's death.

721
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,580
Does the Inspection Bureau

722
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,110
have no respect for the law?

723
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,930
We don't mean to arrest you.

724
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,060
We just want you to come with us

725
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,040
to answer a few questions.

726
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Don't overreact.

727
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,560
Be cooperative.

728
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,620
So that we don't need to use violence.

729
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,240
What do you want to ask?

730
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,820
Can't you ask here?

731
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,570
I'll ask you then.

732
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,250
Did you sexually assault Shi Luqing

733
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,660
together with Zhou Guanglin?

734
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,010
How could this happen?

735
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,880
Nonsense!

736
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,490
I witnessed Boss Chen

737
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,540
request Shi Luqing

738
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,600
to be his mistress.

739
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,670
Shi Luqing rejected him directly.

740
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,570
I finally figured out

741
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,070
the truth.

742
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,290
I found

743
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,670
what kind of injustice and despair Qing was

744
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,600
when she jumped off the city tower.

745
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,350
Zhou Guanglin killed Mei.

746
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,440
According to the law of the Great Qian,

747
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,230
he couldn't escape death.

748
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,990
But for Boss Chen,

749
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,370
leaving him unpunished,

750
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,110
I was reluctant.

751
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,280
How could I resign myself to this?

752
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,740
So you did all the set-up

753
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,850
on your own?

754
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,380
Of course.

755
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,750
Keyuncha.

756
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,550
You know he's in Jiuxiao City, right?

757
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,860
Are you saying

758
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
I conspired with a Qi?

759
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,480
From the beginning,

760
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,720
I disagree with this Qi guy

761
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,540
being with Qing.

762
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,640
If he hadn't

763
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,500
seduced Qing

764
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,120
and instigated her to run away from home,

765
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,610
Qing wouldn't have ended up like this.

766
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,860
My daughter.

767
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,970
I'll avenge her.

768
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,240
I don't need any help from a Qi person.

769
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,920
So after Shi Luqing died,

770
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,350
you insisted on staying in Jiuxiao City

771
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,330
to find out

772
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,140
the cause of her death, didn't you?

773
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,160
Do you know how it feels?

774
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,920
We used to depend on each other

775
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,720
and live happily together.

776
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,320
But one day,

777
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,340
she was depressed

778
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:03,970
and cried all day.

779
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,340
I was right beside her,

780
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,870
but I didn't know what to do.

781
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,580
Because I found that

782
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,790
every time I asked,

783
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,280
I intensified

784
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,520
her pain and sadness.

785
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,010
I guess

786
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,840
she was afraid

787
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,040
you would do something impulsive

788
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,520
if you knew the truth.

789
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,490
I thought if I kept her company,

790
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,620
as time went by,

791
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,420
she would get better.

792
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,400
But one day,

793
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,770
she said she wanted to eat sweet dumplings.

794
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:38,680
When I returned,

795
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,140
I only saw her last words written in a letter.

796
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,840
She said she wanted to be free

797
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,260
and asked me to forgive her.

798
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:57,950
So,

799
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,010
you didn't conspire

800
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,470
with Shi Luqing's father.

801
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,310
Later, in the name of work,

802
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,670
I often went to The Western Chamber

803
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,030
to find out

804
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,320
the cause of her death.

805
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:14,030
But unexpectedly,

806
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,699
someone created the illusion

807
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,100
that Qing was still alive

808
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,199
and killed Ren Fengyang.

809
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,909
Since then, I've been following you

810
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,710
until I get closer

811
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,540
to the truth

812
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,699
and find out

813
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,760
it is Qing's father behind this.

814
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,370
Maybe you don't believe me.

815
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,690
But it doesn't matter.

816
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,480
Now that Qing is gone,

817
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:37,679
I'm no longer concerned about my situation.

818
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,620
Keyuncha.

819
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,159
I trust you.

820
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,690
Keyuncha, I trust you too.

821
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,790
I'll pass the testimony

822
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,420
to Commander Yan first.

823
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,750
Do you need me

824
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,270
to stay here with you?

825
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,040
No need.

826
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,790
I want to be alone.

827
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,590
Unfortunately,

828
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,800
Boss Chen was the last one

829
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,690
but you saved him.

830
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,490
Are you protecting justice

831
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,680
or conniving the criminals?

832
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,100
We promise you

833
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,140
we will do our best

834
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,980
to prove Boss Chen's guilty

835
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,820
and bring him to justice immediately.

836
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,040
How many years

837
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,760
for a rape crime?

838
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,200
Can it bring Qing back to me?

839
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,190
I want him to die!

840
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,150
I want him to die!

841
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:52,600
Mr. He.

842
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,480
I understand your pain.

843
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,370
But please don't be impulsive.

844
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,500
Have you thought about it thoroughly?

845
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,960
Even if you kill Boss Chen,

846
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,240
so what?

847
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,820
You'll only sacrifice your life

848
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,610
in vain.

849
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:05,910
I know

850
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,570
in this world,

851
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,310
there are no ghosts

852
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,200
or past life.

853
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,440
Revenge

854
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,340
is not to comfort the dead,

855
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,420
but to let the living

856
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,190
feel relieved

857
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
in their hearts.

858
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,150
My only wish now

859
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,100
is to let him die.

860
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,070
As long as Chen Boliang is alive,

861
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,430
justice is absent,

862
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,480
and God is ruthless.

863
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,850
I, He Yuqin, will never rest in peace.

864
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,260
I, He Yuqin, will never rest in peace.

865
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:48,860
Look.

866
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,170
Is there something else?

867
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,030
It seems to be recorded here.

868
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,800
Look.

869
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,590
This case

870
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,270
must be related to that.

871
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,960
-Prince Han.
-Prince Han.

872
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:56,940
Han Zheng.

873
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,500
Why can't we

874
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,450
let Keyuncha go?

875
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,810
He just found out

876
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,640
what Boss Chen did to Shi Luqing.

877
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,130
I'm afraid he'll take revenge

878
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,750
on Boss Chen on the spur of the moment.

879
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,440
So are you going to

880
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,630
keep locking up Keyuncha?

881
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,430
Of course not.

882
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,610
Boss Chen was terrified.

883
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,080
He just said

884
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,860
he wanted to hide outside the city for a few days.

885
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,620
According to the procedure

886
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,080
of the Inspection Bureau,

887
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,090
even a suspect without evidence

888
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,790
has to be detained for 24 hours.

889
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,610
So we'll release him

890
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,770
when Boss Chen leaves here

891
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:27,610
tomorrow.

892
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,690
Is this

893
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,440
the law of the state of Qian?

894
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,690
A lustful and wicked person

895
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,800
like Mr. Chen

896
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,080
won't be punished.

897
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,860
But Keyuncha,

898
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,790
who did nothing,

899
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,550
has to be detained as a suspect.

900
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,190
I'm trying to protect him.

901
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,340
Regarding those

902
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,260
Boss Chen did,

903
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,960
I will find the evidence

904
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,360
and bring him to justice.

905
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,480
But before that,

906
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,610
I must prevent Keyuncha

907
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:47,870
from acting on impulse

908
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,500
and harming himself.

909
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,640
Also,

910
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,530
the truth

911
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,280
hasn't been known thoroughly.

912
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:00,950
What if...

913
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,960
I mean what if.

914
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,310
What if Keyuncha and He Yuqin

915
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,270
collaborated?

916
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,960
He Yuqin deliberately took the rap for the crime

917
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,610
and allowed Keyuncha

918
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,970
to kill Boss Chen.

919
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,080
That makes sense.

920
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,320
Besides, he loves Shi Luqing so much.

921
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:19,930
So,

922
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,830
are you still suspecting Keyuncha?

923
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,230
Didn't I just tell you?

924
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,020
What if...

925
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,440
Don't you understand human language?

926
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,640
Why are you so fierce?

927
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,800
You always say that

928
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,060
evidence is crucial in an investigation.

929
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,580
But now,

930
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,310
you have no evidence

931
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,380
to prove Keyuncha

932
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,450
has something to do with the case.

933
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,910
And you still suspect him.

934
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,540
Is it because

935
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,140
he and Shi Luqing were lovers

936
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:38,860
or because

937
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,790
he's a Qi person?

938
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Here you go again.

939
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:42,910
You always implicate

940
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:43,670
the relationship between Qian and Qi.

941
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,470
That's right.

942
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,450
I'm telling you.

943
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,610
If he wanted to

944
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,500
kill Boss Chen,

945
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,060
he could do it last night.

946
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,270
He doesn't have to wait till today.

947
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,750
It's a piece of cake

948
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,060
for us, Qi people,

949
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,380
to kill a Qian.

950
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,310
We don't need to go through all the trouble.

951
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:04,920
Forget it.

952
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,200
Su Jiu'er.

953
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,430
Jiu'er.

954
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,350
What's wrong?

955
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,180
Why am I yelling at her again?

956
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:17,010
Can't I

957
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,010
stop being so impulsive?

958
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,100
What's wrong with you?

959
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,860
Did you quarrel with Jiu'er again?

960
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,300
Can't you talk nicely?

961
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,290
What were you arguing about?

962
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,510
She was upset after you fought.

963
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,880
I think you are upset too.

964
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,960
I feel delighted.

965
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,510
That's enough, Han.

966
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,840
Why do you always make a fuss

967
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,970
about my daughter?

968
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,950
Just give in to her.

969
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,790
Coax her.

970
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,300
And the issue will be settled.

971
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:50,610
No.

972
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,920
Why should I coax her?

973
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,230
Are men born

974
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,500
to coax women?

975
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,420
You're so angry.

976
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,680
What you said

977
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,290
makes sense.

978
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,910
Why? Right?

979
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,320
Why should we

980
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,200
always give in to women?

981
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,230
Nonetheless,

982
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,830
it's not a big deal if you don't give in to other girls.

983
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,720
But if you don't

984
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,360
pamper the one you like,

985
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,580
someone else will pamper her.

986
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,220
Who?

987
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:23,860
No.

988
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,590
What girl do I like?

989
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,990
I don't understand.

990
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,330
Stop pretending.

991
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,580
Always pretending.

992
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,720
Han.

993
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,920
Regarding your crush on Jiu'er,

994
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,370
I'm telling you that

995
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,240
heaven knows,

996
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,730
the earth knows,

997
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,640
I know,

998
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,590
and everyone knows.

999
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,930
Only my silly daughter

1000
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,030
doesn't know.

1001
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,470
And let me tell you.

1002
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,550
She has you in her heart.

1003
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,490
That's the most important thing.

1004
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,570
My daughter

1005
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,460
doesn't understand much

1006
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,200
about love.

1007
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,010
She hasn't realized it yet.

1008
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,410
Do you need me

1009
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,080
to help you enlighten her?

1010
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,460
But what's the point?

1011
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,710
Everyone said

1012
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,220
we couldn't be together.

1013
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,560
There's no result for the love

1014
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,330
between a Qian and a Qi.

1015
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,250
Nonsense.

1016
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,030
What are you talking about?

1017
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,170
The identity

1018
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,350
and status

1019
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
are all bullshit.

1020
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,280
In this world,

1021
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,130
as long as you like her

1022
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:31,890
and she likes you,

1023
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,610
that's the most important

1024
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,620
and rare.

1025
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,420
Go on.

1026
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:40,950
In this world,

1027
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,310
it's usual that you like a girl,

1028
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,410
but she doesn't feel the same way.

1029
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,580
You favor her.

1030
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,780
But she has no feelings for you.

1031
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:53,120
It's a great fate

1032
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,880
for a couple to love each other.

1033
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,590
Han,

1034
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,340
stop being stubborn.

1035
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,910
Maybe

1036
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,950
you'll choke death on water.

1037
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,790
Maybe I

1038
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,010
live longer than you.

1039
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,070
It's just an example.

1040
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,230
We don't know

1041
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,730
what will happen tomorrow.

1042
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,190
We need to care about today

1043
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,120
and cherish the present.

1044
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,800
Pour me some tea.

1045
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,870
Uncle Hu, please.

1046
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,920
Good boy.
