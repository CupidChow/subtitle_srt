8
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,910
don't turn us

9
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,860
away.

10
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,180
We just want to protect you.

11
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,540
Lord.

12
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,180
- Exactly, Painter Lin.
- Lord.

13
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,340
Lord, please stop shouting.

14
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,810
Senior was frightened today,

15
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,610
it's not convenient for him to see any more guests.

16
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,850
That's fine.

17
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,630
But let my

18
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,610
guards stay here

19
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,800
to take care of him.

20
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,380
Senior also asked me to convey that

21
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,380
he has to turn away

22
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,370
your guards too.

23
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,210
Please take them back too.

The most handsome man in the world is really angry?

25
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,320
He's so angry that he's willing to risk his life.

26
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,340
Painter Lin,

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,690
sorry for offending you today.

28
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,820
But we're doing this for your own good.

29
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,820
How about this?

30
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,420
we'll stay outside tonight.

31
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,160
Just turn a blind eye to it,

32
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,300
and we can talk tomorrow.

33
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,670
It's a deal then.

34
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,840
It's a deal.

37
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,110
are we really staying here?

38

Let's go.

40
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,460
Your Highness,

41
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,440
you have a meal

42
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,770
with Her Majesty tomorrow morning,

43
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,910
so you can't stay here

44
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,710
to accompany Miss Jiu'er today.

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,290
I'll just get up early.

46
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,090
I will make it.

47
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,160
No way.

48
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,070

49
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,630
us Inspection Bureau orders you around like this,

50
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,430
and get angry,

51
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,320
I'll be fired.

52
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,960
By then, you won't have your

53
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,380

54
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,900

55
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,730
I can't bare

56
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,120
to see you so down.

57
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,520
I'm just tired.

58
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,140
I'll be fine after a sleep.

59
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,740
Besides,

60
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,370
Lin Zhixing is being guarded

61
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,070
by our men.

62
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,020
There's nothing to worry about.

63

64
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,450
Let's go back.

65
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:48,820
Fine.

66
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,120

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,570
Goodbye, Your Highness.

69
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,970
Goodbye, Your Highness.

70
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,480
His Highness is right.

71
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,180
I can't bear to see you

72
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,780
look so down.

73
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,890
I can't bear to see it either.

74
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,310
Thinking about Han Zheng?

75
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,390
That brat

76
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,990
always throws a tantrum

77
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,350
and disappears all the time.

78
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,450
Why do you miss him?

79
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,130
Godfather,

80
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,010
was it also this hard for you

81
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,660
when you partnered with my father?

82
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,940
Of course not.

83
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,900
Actually, there are instances.

84
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,170
Your father,

85
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,520
though he is easy-going,

86
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,580
but you have to follow his lead.

87
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,400
Otherwise,

88
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,360
he would get angry sometimes.

89
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,050
How did you deal with it then?

90
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,310
I just listened to him.

91
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,450
Your father was so smart.

92
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,909
I just had to listen to him.

93
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,340
That's of no help.

94
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,010
Wait up,

95
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,350
the bedroom is over there.

96
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,620
I'm going to go think about the case.

97
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,680
You go sleep first.

98
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,960
Your Highness.

99
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,350
They have left.

100
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,900
Come out.

101
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,180
Are you eavesdropping up there?

102
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,360
He's not here?

103
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,560
Where did he go?

104
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,760
Is it because...

105
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,060
I said you're stingy

106
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,860
and you got angry

107
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,240
so you won't come out to see me?

108
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,970
Come out and argue with me then.

109
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,510
Come out and scold me.

110
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,610
If those two

111
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,270
died because of the Qi Vital Stone,

112
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,300
it's very likely that

113
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,080
it is related to

114
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,480
that three-scar Qi man you're looking for!

115
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,370
Oh no.

116
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,659
It's all your fault.

117
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,450
You just have to pat the tiger's butt every day.

118
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,909
Now the tiger has ran away.

119
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,540
What should I do?

120
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,130
I knew you wouldn't leave.

121
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,659

00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,140
Inspector Su.

123
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,050
This is the hand warmer

124
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,250
Master Ming asked me to prepare for you.

125
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,550
Thank you.

126
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,440
Give it to me.

127
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,470
Bad news!

128
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,280
Lass!

129
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,710
- Godfather.
- Bad news!

130
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,570
What happened?

131
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,920
Lin Zhixing was kidnapped!

132
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,230
How did he disappear?

133
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,310
He jumped out of the window.

134
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,420
Is there anything missing from the room?

135
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:36,880
No.

136
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,270
Was he taken away

137
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,470
when he was sleeping?

138
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,300
The pillow is cold.

139
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,700
No one has slept on it yet.

140
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,330
Who?

141
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,470
Han Zheng!

142
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,760
You are still here.

143
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,520
I did leave.

144
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,290
But I'm too fast.

145
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,370
While you guys

146
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,770
have been rambling away,

147
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,720
I've already asked around

148
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,650
in Jiuxiao City,

149
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,790
and found out some

150
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,010
interesting things.

151
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:10,650
But...

152
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,430
take a look at this first.

153
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,660
Rambling?

154
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:23,990
You...

155
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,500
Why did you eavesdrop on me?

156
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,540
I was just listening to

157
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,050
what's going on around here.

158
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,820
And so...

159
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,550
I heard it.

160
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,210
It's because...

161
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,940
Take a look at this first.

162
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,770
It should be written an hour ago.

163
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,700
It'll be too late if we don't go now.

164
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,940
See you at the the Temple Ruins at midnight.

165
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,810
[See you at the the Temple Ruins at midnight. Don't think you can escape.]

166
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,380
Temple Ruins?

167
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:49,750
Where is it?

168
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,750
At the back mountain.

169
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,940
It's at the halfway of the mountain.

170
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,690
No wonder

171
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,710
he can run away right under our nose.

172
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,370
But what is he going there for?

173
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,600
The murderer is luring the snake out of its hole.

174
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,640
Wait.

175
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,040
Prince Han,

176
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,710
you said you found

177
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,800
some interesting things in the city.

178
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,590
What was it?

179
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,060
I know the cause of their death.

180
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,640
What?

181
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,700
The Qi Vital Stone again?

182
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:20,740
Yes.

183
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,100
The Qi Vital Stone.

184
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,450
Qi people are strong.

185
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,200
How can a weak body of a Qian's

186
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,400
bear it?

187
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,500
If it is used too much,

188
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,540
it will backfire.

189
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,179
This is the cause of death?

190
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,740
That's right.

191
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,530
That's why

192
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,100
they show signs of dying of fear

193
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,289
because of the heart rupture.

194
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,500
Not necessarily, Prince Han.

195
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,700
What if you're wrong?

196
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,460
They might have actually

197
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,659
been scared to death.

198
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,909
Let me show you this.

199
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,370
What is this?

200
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,380
Wolf Herb.

201
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,900
It is very sensitive to Qi's power.

202
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,950
It can make the Qi Vital Stone more active.

203
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,490
But it's doesn't have any effect on

204
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,270
other things.

205
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:56,930
No wonder.

206
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:57,850
It turns out

207
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,890
we can't even detect this poison.

208
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,450
What are you saying–

209
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,580
It's not poison.

210
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,590
It's not poison.

211
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,380
Daren,

212
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,040
this is the essence of Qi people,

213
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,010
it's very precious.

214
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,540
How could you say it's poison?

215
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,010
Right, right.

216
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:09,810
Right, right.

217
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,300
Not only it's not poison,

218
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,430
it's also an amulet.

219
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,610
Yeah. It's an amulet.

220
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,540
What do you mean?

221
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,170
I...

222
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,050
Your Highness.

223
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,180
I have another question.

224
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,390
If

225
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,580
they really took the Qi Vital Stone,

226
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,620
how long will it take for the effect to take place?

227
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,340
Right, right.

228
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,540
The more, the faster.

229
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Just this little,

230
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,020
dissolved in water and drank in one gulp,

231
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,680
with the weak body of you Qian,

232
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,620
it would take less than the time it takes to burn half an incense.

233
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,810
Does this thing

234
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,740
taste weird?

235
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,930
The Qi Vital Stone itself

236
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,710
has no smell.

237
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,270
If only a little is taken,

238
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,790
it will make people's five senses

239
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,120
become more sensitive.

240
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,000
So how this murderer kills

241
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,860
is to find a way to make them overdose

242
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
in a short time.

243
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,030
That's right.

244
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,400
Besides, if it's an outsider,

245
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,140
they wouldn't have been able to

246
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,920
make it through the gate of Nanfeng Studio.

247
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,210
Moreover, they would never know

248
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,740
what are some aftereffects

249
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,580
after consuming Qi Vital Stone.

250
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,810
So it's very likely that the murderer...

251
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,640
is someone from Nanfeng studio?

252
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,080
Yes.

253
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,140
From Nanfeng Studio?

254
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,740
Someone from Nanfeng Studio...

255
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,540
Lin Zhixing must know

256
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,670
who the murderer is.

257
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,600
He knows?

258
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,620
How do you know?

259
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,850
The sword on the table.

260
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,700
When he left,

261
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,600
he took the sword on the table.

262
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,040
Why are there so many vines?

263
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:35,460
Keep up.

264
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,180
Be careful.

265
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:36,690
Lass.

266
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,420
Come on, be careful.

267
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,080
Be careful.

268
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,470
It's so hard to walk.

269
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,810
Be careful, Prince Han.

270
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:46,900
Are you okay?

271
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,100
What's wrong?

272
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,910
Did you hurt your hand?

273
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,870
I'm fine.

274
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,580
Here.

275
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,110
Done.

276
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:57,630
Wait.

277
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,980
Lin Zhixing

278
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,500
couldn't have gone to the Temple Ruins.

279
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,400
I see.

280
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,260
This is the only way to go up the mountain.

281
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,860
There are so many vines on the way.

282
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,490
If someone passes by,

283
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,690
there must be traces.

284
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,460
Besides,

285
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,220
Lin Zhixing is holding a sword.

286
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,310
It doesn't look like

287
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,300
it has been slashed through by a sword.

288
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,830
This is just a distraction.

289
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,390
Prince Han.

290
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,780
Don't you remember what happened to you

291
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,690
when you left without me

292
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,380
last time?

293
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,660
You have to take me with you.

294
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,870
Your Highness, take me with you too.

295
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,870
It's tiring to go down the mountain.

296
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,590
How petty!

297
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,620
You're already bringing along one person,

298
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,950
what's it to make it two?

299
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,120
Come out.

300
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,570
I already know who you are.

301
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,250
Why hide?

302
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,460
You came

303
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,700
just for that thing.

304
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,000
Come out!

305
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,010
Let's finish this

306
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,290
in person.

307
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,590
There's no need to make things more complicated.

308
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,220
I'm not afraid of you.

309
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,580
I...

310
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,810
I'm not afraid of you.

311
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,980
Senior.

312
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,790
Are you really not afraid of me?

313
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,680
I'm not.

314
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,010
I...

315
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,820
I'm not afraid of you.

316
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,650
He must still be here.

317
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,790
Oh no!

318
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,250
Wait!

319
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,320
Bad news! Send help!

320
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,760
What's wrong?

321
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,500
Senior Lin.

322
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,770
Senior Lin has...

323
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,770
What happened?

324
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,820
Senior Lin.

325
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,590
Senior Lin.

326
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,270
How could this happen?

327
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,730
Everything was fine.

328
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,730
Exactly.

329
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
What should we do?

330
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,070
See you in the warehouse at midnight.

331
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,300
[See you in the warehouse at midnight. Don't think you can escape.]

332
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,340
Don't think

333
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,420
you can escape.

334
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,660
The Flying Lady painting.

335
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,440
This...

336
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,960
Isn't this Senior Feng's painting?

337
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,990
Is the Painting Immortal

338
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,650
going to kill Senior Feng too?

339
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,120
He wouldn't even

340
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,960
step on an ant.

341
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,660
How would he

342
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,550
be targeted?

343
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,650
Exactly.

344
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,150
What should we do?

345
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,660
Who is it?

346
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,660
No.

347
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,450
[Inspection Bureau]

348
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,840
Are you stupid?

349
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,210
Are you stupid?

350
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,270
The murderer has already told you

351
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,140
who he is going to kill.

352
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,100
How could you let him

353
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,700
die under your nose?

354
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,560
What's the reason?

355
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,500
Speak!

356
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,900
Commander,

357
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,320
Lin Zhixing is not pleased

358
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,760
and refused to cooperate.

359
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,690
I have no choice.

360
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,210
In this situation,

361
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,090
do you have any countermeasures?

362
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,000
Move aside.

363
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,720
What about you?

364
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,690
Any clues?

365
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,180
Where's your partner

366
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,140
who keeps bossing

367
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,740
me around?

368
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,000
Commander,

369
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,380
- that Han– - You shut up.

370
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,180
You tell me.

371
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,270
Commander,

372
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,300
we found that the three victims

373
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,360
used Qi Vital Stone

374
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,000
when they paint.

375
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,680
This should be the reason

376
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,620
why the murderer targeted them.

377
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,660
So he went to look at

378
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,190
Painter Feng's paintings.

379
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,370
You're wrong.

380
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,060
Only the previous three painters

381
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,800
had a change in their painting style.

382
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,100
Now you’re talking about Feng Muyuan,

383
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,730
what does this have to do with him?

384
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,920
How do you know it has nothing to do with him?

385
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,380
Enough!

386
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,810
Do you even think?

387
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,590
You knew this case

388
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,040
is related to the Qi Vital Stone,

389
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,970
yet you sent a Qi to investigate it.

390
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,980
Pass my order.

391
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,280
Solve this case

392
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,300
within seven days.

393
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,970
Also,

394
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,920
keep an eye on Feng Muyuan.

395
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,420
Don’t let anything happen again.

396
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,420
Otherwise, all of you

397
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,470
will be flogged.

398
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,400
Yes.

399
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,600
Why are you staring so hard at

400
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,880
a beautiful painting?

401
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,000
Did it piss you off?

402
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,670
Feng Muyuan pissed me off.

403
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,770
What did he do?

404
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,170
He was kneeling in front of

405
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,300
the Painting Immortal for the whole night,

406
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,700
saying he knows nothing.

407
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,210
So you took the chance

408
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,490
to search his room

409
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,230
to look for Qi Vital Stone?

410
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,390
And found nothing.

411
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,560
Your Highness,

412
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,490
do you think Feng Muyuan

413
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,740
is innocent?

414
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,480
He didn't use Qi Vital Stone.

415
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,810
Are we going in the wrong direction?

416
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,870
I’d rather believe

417
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,210
this Feng Muyuan

418
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,620
is just better at covering his tracks.

419
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
He and those three

420
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,740
who used Qi Vital Stone

421
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,070
for their own pleasures

422
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,140
all have their own secrets.

423
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,390
Your Highness,

424
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,680
this is prejudice.

425
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,000
It's not.

426
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,670
I just think Qi Vital Stone

427
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,930
is the key to this case.

428
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,260
What do you think?

429
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,220
I think if we can

430
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,650
put Qi Vital Stone aside,

431
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,560
we might be more objective.

432
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
Do you think

433
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,630
because I'm a Qi,

434
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,869
I am blinded

435
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,880
and only think about Qi Vital Stone

436
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,810
and not the case?

437
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:09,980
Fine.

438
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,619
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

439
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,349
I'm the one with the prejudice.

440
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,390
That wasn't sincere enough.

441
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,560
I was really wrong.

442
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:23,490
I was prejudiced.

443
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,589
I'm sorry.

444
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,849
Be more sincere.

445
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,760
Your Highness!

446
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,710
It's not that I'm not sincere enough.

447
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,620
I just don't think

448
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,820
I'm wrong at all.

449
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,330
You think the whole case

450
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,860
has something to do with Qi Vital Stone,

451
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,700
but I think we should

452
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,860
find out the relationship between

453
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,710
the three victims and Feng Muyuan first.

454
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,300
You are getting bolder.

455
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,550
- Do you believe if I–
- All right. All right.

456
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,350
Stop arguing.

457
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,070
You always think

458
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,170
I have prejudice against you.

459
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:49,780
I always think

460
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,020
you have prejudice against the case.

461
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,640
Neither of us

462
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,040
can convince each other.

463
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,750
How about we

464
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,030
have a bet?

465
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,490
Whoever finds the murderer first,

466
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,710
the other party should

467
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,970
sincerely apologize.

468
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,640
Interesting.

469
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,170
But if anyone loses,

470
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,420
don't apologize.

471
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,600
I don't want to hear

472
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,000
your insincere apology.

473
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,300
How about this?

474
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,630
I want you to stay quiet

475
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,110
for 24 hours.

476
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,800
You do whatever I say.

477
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,690
And you can't resist.

478
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,790
How is that?

479
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,240
That's a hefty bet.

480
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,820
You don't dare?

481
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:28,810
I dare.

482
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,820
I only have one life anyway.

483
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,380
But if I win,

484
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,590
I will get to

485
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,350
replenish my health from you for 24 hours.

486
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,010
How's that?

487
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,700
Why are you laughing?

488
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,400
I'm one step closer to getting you to shut up.

489
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,800
I found out that

490
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:49,760
that letter

491
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,860
wasn't left by the murderer.

492
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,220
What?

493
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,440
The letter

494
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,390
next to Lin Zhixing's body

495
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,630
and the one on his bed

496
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,470
are of his handwriting.

497
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,900
[The Evil Flower]

498
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,060
He was the one

499
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,420
who lured us to the Temple Ruins.

500
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,880
The letter beside his body

501
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,450
smells like incense.

502
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,550
But the one on the bed doesn't.

503
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,680
I think

504
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,340
he must have known

505
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,540
who the murderer was,

506
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,950
and used a letter to meet the murderer.

507
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,270
As for the other one, he used it to distract us

508
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,030
to buy time.

509
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,290
He took the sword to kill the murderer.

510
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,010
But what he didn't expect was

511
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,200
he got killed by the murderer instead.

512
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,130
Why are you laughing?

513
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,180
I'm one step closer to sucking up

514
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,470
all your vitality too.

515
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,540
Let's go.

516
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,960
I know how to find

517
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,160
their relationship.

518
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,990
Where are you going?

519
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,850
Just follow me.

520
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,340
Let's go.

521
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,040
Your Highness,

522
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,310
you can lend me

523
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,350
a jade, token or something that shows your identity.

524
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,280
You don't have to come personally.

525
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,600
If I give you a token,

526
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,860
they might give you a hard time.

527
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,590
With me here,

528
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,140
it will be more convenient.

529
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,310
That's for sure.

530
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,810
But

531
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,130
you don't like

532
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,220
that place, do you?

533
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,910
It's the most important to be able to help you.

534
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,720
Where are we going?

535
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,380
Lin Zhixing didn't know the identity

536
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,860
of the murderer from the beginning.

537
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,720
Otherwise, he would have

538
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,220
wrote that letter to meet them way earlier.

539
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,950
It was when he returned after

540
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,050
ditching us at the market did he decide

541
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,430
to meet the murderer personally.

542
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,820
So during this period of time,

543
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,050
he must have got some

544
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,730
very important information.

545
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,930
According to the time he was missing for,

546
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,080
and where he could've reached

547
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,190
by feet,

548
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,610
there's only one place he could've gone.

This way, please.

555
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,970
Be careful.

556
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,290
Be careful.

557
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,250
Where is he?

558
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:01,850
In front.

559
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,180
I'll go first–

560
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,650
Your Highness.

561
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,560
Marquis is waiting over there.

562
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,980
Your Highness.

563
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,430
Why?

564
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,450
Are you scared? Wanna run?

565
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,360
Who's scared?

566
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,520
Where?

567
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,210
That way.

568
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,980

he's here.

00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,490
Greetings, uncle.

[Qian, Marquis Xian]

574
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,660
Jun,

575
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,160
you're not avoiding me anymore?

576
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,400
I'm not avoiding you.

577
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,030
I've been busy lately.

578
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,970
How can I avoid my uncle,

579
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,370
right?

580
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,670
All you knows is to write your scripts.

581
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,580
Everyone knows

582
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,190
we are the only two people

583
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,060
who does nothing in Jiuxiao City.

584
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,680
Uncle is right.

585
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,650
I want to be like you.

586
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,750
To be leisurely all day long,

587
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,620
and do nothing but

588
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,520
collect paintings and play cards.

589
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,470
What a life!

590
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,380
Enough.

591
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,090
We're just the same.

592
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,610
No one's better off.

593
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,270
It just makes me think,

594
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,560
why would Heyin

595
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,780
fall in love with you?

596
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,090
Uncle.

597
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,230
Have some water.

598
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,380
Have some water.

599
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,430
What brings you here

600
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,550
this time?

601
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,100
To be honest,

602
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,380
I have been

603
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,500
investigating a case with the Inspection Bureau.

604
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,560
There is a case related to this place.

605
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:39,460
It's an emergency,

606
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,340
so I can't be bothered to

607
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,270
go back and forth with Shopkeeper Li,

608
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,610
so I came to you directly.

609
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,440
I hope you can help me.

610
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,640
You took the initiative

611
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,520
to come to me, right?

612
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,820
My Lord,

613
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,310
you mean you want me to cooperate?

614
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,900
Cooperate?

615
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,750
Jun needs my help.

616
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,930
Of course we have to cooperate.

617
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,420
But,

618
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,110
whether the answer is true or not,

619
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,210
it depends on whether he will

620
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,380
go to the hunting ground with Heyin

621
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,780
to hang out for a few days.

622
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,810
Uncle...

623
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,800
Why are we talking about this?

624
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,750
We're talking about business.

625
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,210
Heyin is the most important business for me.

626
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,810
Don't always look like

627
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,090
you're forcing yourself.

628
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,170
On the surface,

629
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,290
you look exactly like those painters under me

630
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,820
who don't care about money.

631
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,060
But they will do anything

632
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,150
for their pride.

633
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,110
I'm not saying

634
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,470
you value those things.

635
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,520
But since Heyin likes you,

636
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,150
you should try getting along with her.

637
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,350
It's not a bad thing.

638
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,160
My Lord,

639
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,000
His Highness is still young.

640
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,910
He hasn't figured it out yet.

641
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,430
Since you know,

642
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,800
you should help him.

643
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,940
Yes.

644
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,990
When he gets it,

645
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,110
he will know Heyin

646
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,800
is the best in the world.

647
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,810
Yes.

648
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,180
Exactly.

649
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,600
Anyway,

650
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,450
I've arranged this meeting

651
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,710
on the hunting ground.

652
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,500
Having entered my place,

653
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,560
you won't be able to

654
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,370
escape this time.

655
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,850
Shopkeeper Li,

656
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,770
serve them well.

657
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:39,620
Yes.

658
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,370
Uncle,

659
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,820
I shall take my leave.

660
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,610
Hunting ground.

661
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,130
Hunting ground.

662
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,060
Hunting ground.

663
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,720
Hunting ground...

664
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,340
Don't hang out too much with Qi people in the future.

665
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,630
Has he left?

666
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,030
Yes.

667
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,620
Jun.

668
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,230
I finally know

669
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,210
why you don't dare to come here normally.

670
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,990
My Lord and the Marquis

671
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,280
have been at odds since childhood.

672
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,500
He has tried everything

673
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,100
but is still no match for him.

674
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,970
As you can see,

675
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,900
I can't do anything

676
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,500
about him.

677
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,120
What about that Heyin?

678
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,620
Her Ladyship and the Marquis's personally

679
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,280
are exactly the same.

680
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,560
They...

681
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,740
like to force other people.

682
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:37,840
Yes.

683
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,780
She's a good match for you.

684
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,030
Yes.

685
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,930
Just like my parents.

686
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,910
One thing subdues another.

687
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:45,670
Who says

688
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,010
when two people are together,

689
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,220
one has to subdue the other?

690
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,490
Can't you be friendly,

691
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,840
and know each other's heart?

692
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,970
With your weak body,

693
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,420
you should go to the hunting ground

694
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,290
to work out.

695
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:54,760
That–

696
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:55,710
The Marquis

697
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,740
knows you well.

698
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,520
Sorry to keep you waiting.

699
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,500
- Your Highness, you look...
- Enough.

700
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,630
No need to be polite.

701
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,180
We don't have much time.

702
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,640
Shopkeeper Li,

703
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,340
why did Lin Zhixing come

704
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,170
yesterday?

705
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,700
Inspector Su,

706
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,070
he did exactly the same thing as

707
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,020
Painter Wang did.

708
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,350
He redeemed a painting?

709
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,040
Yes.

710
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,020
That day,

711
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,860
he put down a big umbrella

712
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,660
and came to me.

713
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,120
Sir,

714
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,600
I have a request.

715
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,780
Nanfeng Studio happens to be in trouble.

716
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,870
I want to take back our paintings

717
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,510
that has been collected by Nameless Publisher

718
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,240
previously.

719
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,620
Would that be

720
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,400
possible?

721
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,490
Painter Lin,

722
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,180
are you going against the buyer?

723
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,270
I wouldn't dare.

724
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,570
It's just that there's a rumor that the Painting Immortal

725
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,180
has been up to no good going around Nanfeng Studio recently.

726
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,740
The master said

727
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,310
we need to redeem all the paintings

728
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,810
to eliminate evil spirits.

729
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:54,410
That's why

730
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,730
I'm here to ask you for this huge favour.

731
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,530
Evil spirits?

732
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,100
There's still one painting of yours.

733
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,390
As for Painter Wang and Painter Xu,

734
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,040
there are three all together.

735
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,040
But Meng Huaiyun's paintings

736
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,690
were long gone.

737
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,490
Aren't there

738
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,820
two excellent paintings by Junior Meng?

739
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,020
Why are they all gone?

740
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,760
Although they are excellent paintings,

741
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,280
but someone gave something even better

742
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,320
in exchange for it.

743
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,120
That's why it has been considered.

744
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,270
Some collector must have

745
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,990
exchanged for it from us.

746
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,270
Sir,

747
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,280
do you know

748
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,290
who bought it?

749
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,990
I just want to see if

750
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,210
I can find the buyer

751
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,200
to redeem them all together.

752
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,900
Lin Zhixing didn't bring any money

753
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,240
with him when he

754
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,390
came out yesterday.

755
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,980
What did he use to redeem the painting?

756
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,570
Maybe he just wanted to see

757
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,710
who redeemed the painting.

758
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,970
He can just ask directly.

759
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,730
Why did he have to say that he's here to redeem the painting?

760
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,500
Maybe

761
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,540
he doesn't want others to know.

762
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,590
Lin Zhihang calls Meng Huaiyun

763
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,640
his junior.

764
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,070
Could Meng Huaiyun

765
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,530
also be someone of the Studio?

766
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,630
I remember now.

767
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,100
I once saw this name

768
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,900
on the list.

769
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,860
But I've never seen this person

770
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,940
at Nanfeng Studio.

771
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,810
How could there be a painter

772
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,150
I don't know of?

773
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,510
Shopkeeper,

774
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,600
who is Meng Huaiyun

775
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,520
to him?

776
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,030
Meng Huaiyun

777
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,450
is Wei Gonglin's youngest disciple.

778
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,710
She joined Nanfeng Hall five years ago.

779
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,440
Although she joined late, she was very talented.

780
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,490
Many excellent paintings

781
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,920
were painted by her.

782
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,180
Even the Empress Dowager had summoned her

783
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,440
to paint in the palace.

784
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,860
Unfortunately,

785
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,090
she stayed in Nanfeng Studio

786
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,420
for only less than a year

787
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,300
and went back to her hometown with her parents.

788
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,210
I see.

789
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,340
No wonder I don't know about her.

790
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,320
So,

791
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,550
the important news Lin Zhixing got

792
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,830
was that someone redeemed

793
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,290
Meng Huaiyun's painting.

794
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,780
What does this

795
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,410
have to do with the murderer?

796
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,770
Why was he so surprised

797
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,140
that his junior's painting

798
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,120
got redeemed?

799
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,860
Isn't it normal

800
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,590
that someone has taken a liking to an excellent painting?

801
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,610
I may

802
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,730
have an answer to this question.

803
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,170
The paintings the gallery collects,

804
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,680
as long as it's source is clear,

805
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,810
one wouldn't ask who the collector is.

806
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,350
If it weren't for

807
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,980
the mysterious murders lately,

808
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,820
I wouldn't have found

809
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,080
what's weird about it.

810
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,720
What Painter Lin did yesterday

811
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,300
reminded me of something,

812
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,140
so I went through

813
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,400
the previous ledgers.

814
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,190
Meng Huaiyun's paintings

815
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,870
were not sent in by herself.

816
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,370
Who sent it in then?

817
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,260
Found it.

818
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:01,860
Xu Youdao.

819
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,240
Lin Zhixing.

820
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,670
Feng Muyuan.

821
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,250
Wang Jirong.

822
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,790
So...

823
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,020
The Qi Vital Stone is but

824
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,280
a tool for inspiration

825
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,900
for three people who has lost their motivation.

826
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,900
It isn't why they were being targeted by the murderer.

827
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,970
The real reason is Meng Huaiyun.

828
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:26,810
Wait.

829
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,530
You agree with me, right?

830
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,860
This one is on me, right?

831
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,940
Of course not.

832
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:32,920
Isn't this

833
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,070
all thanks to His Highness?

834
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,680
What are you arguing about?

835
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,340
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

836
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,570
We're just thinking about

837
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,130
what's the story

838
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,150
between this lady

839
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,260
and them,

840
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,690
causing three people to lose their lives.

841
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,530
What do you want to do now?

842
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,600
Your Highness,

843
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,610
if

844
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,520
I want to borrow your nose,

845
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,080
and we find any clues,

846
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,100
whose will it be?

847
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,690
Of course it's mine.

848
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,630
Why?

849
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,740
Use your nose

850
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,970
to search for it then.

851
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,220
So stingy.

852
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,940
Stingy.

853
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,160
Your Highness,

854
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,530
are you willing to

855
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,610
use your nose

856
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,940
and go to Nanfeng Studio

857
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,800
to look for Meng Huaiyun's clues.

858
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,960
I'll tell you later.

859
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,820
Later.

860
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,270
Go ahead.

861
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,270
What are you doing?

862
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,210
Su Jiu'er, Su Jiu'er,

863
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,860
every time you smile like this,

864
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,000
you want to use me.

865
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,990
But this time round,

866
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,160
you have your own way.

867
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,400
I have my own method too.

868
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,330
Time is limited.

869
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,380
I won't help you.

870
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,710
Let me see,

871
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,000
without my nose,

872
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,000
can you find

873
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,080
the clues you want?

874
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,480
How do you want to investigate it?

875
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,020
How about

876
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,630
you just give up?

877
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,500
No way.

878
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,090
This time,

879
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,430
we'll go our own way

880
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,440
and leave each other alone.

881
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,500
Bye.

882
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,230
The cart hasn't stopped yet.

883
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,780
Let's go.

884
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,920
He ran so fast.

885
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,610
Does he have an idea already?

886
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,830
No, I can't lose.

887
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,530
Jiu'er, Jiu'er!

888
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,370
Jiu'er!

889
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,210
What are you two up to?

890
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,740
We made a

891
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,150
on the life and death bet

892
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,020
on who'd finds clues first.

893
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,730
Never mind.

894
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,080
Even without his nose,

895
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,950
I still have a way.

896
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,550
How about this?

897
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,700
Let’s go look for Feng Muyuan

898
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,020
and see what clues he can provide.

899
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,180
When I find a clue,

900
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,450
I must force him

901
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,220
to listen to me talk about morals

902
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,350
nonstop for 24 hours

903
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,320
and piss him off.

904
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,620
Let's go.

905
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,450
[Nanfeng Studio]

906
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,580
Your Highness.

907
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,720
Lass.

908
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,400
Now that the case is like this,

909
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,600
do you have new clues?

910
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,870
Tell me if there is.

911
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,580
We're friends after all.

912
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,980
You help me and I help you.

913
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,720
Here's the clue you asked for.

914
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,220
Where is it?

915
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,990
Move aside!

916
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,240
- Let's go!
- Where to?

917
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,970
Su Jiu'er, are you crazy?

918
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
Just wait and see.

919
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,270
The murderer made three people into paintings,

920
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,250
repeatedly reminded us

921
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,590
that the painting is very important.

922
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,540
Why did they

923
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,150
kill people with Qi Vital Stone?

924
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:28,980
As far as I know,

925
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,580
the paints of the painters

926
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,840
are made by themselves.

927
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,990
The same color

928
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,380
can have different formulas.

929
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,250
Some use flowers,

930
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,110
and some trees.

931
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,540
So the most important thing now

932
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,470
is to find

933
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,630
the source of the dull yellow

934
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,120
to find the murderer.

935
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,620
Dull yellow...

936
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,780
Could it be...

937
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,880
this is

938
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,429
the color of the fisherman?

939
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,630
But why did the murderer

940
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,600
have to set this up?

941
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,290
The Flying Lady painting.

942
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,699
Feng Muyuan.

943
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,030
How long has

944
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,380
Painter Feng been kneeling here for?

945
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,260
I think he has been

946
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,060
kneeling here since last night.

947
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,570
Last night...

948
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,820
Sorry to disturb you, Painter Feng.

949
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,350
I have something to ask you.

950
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,150
Go ahead.

951
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,770
Meng Huaiyun is your junior, right?

952
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,310
Yes.

953
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,030
What's the relationship between

954
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,350
the three painters,

955
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,250
you, and her?

956
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,780
We have the same master, that's all.

957
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,610
Where is she now?

958
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,090
Why did you

959
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,220
sell her paintings?

960
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,400
Junior has long returned home

961
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,440
with her family.

962
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,960
Master asked us

963
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,350
to sell it off

964
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,160
according to her own will.

965
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,970
Is that really true?

966
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,050
What else could it be, Inspector Su?

967
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,840
There's no problem with selling the paintings.

968
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,890
But she has no reason

969
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,040
to stop painting.

970
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,590
And why

971
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,080
are the paintings you sold

972
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,140
paintings she did

973
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,670
before she left this place?

974
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,310
The shopkeeper of Nameless Art Gallery said

975
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,380
there hasn't been

976
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,160
any new works by Junior Meng in the State of Qian

977
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,150
since then.

978
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,080
Why is that?

979
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,070
I just sold the paintings

980
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,870
according to Master's instructions.

981
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:54,580
As for why Junior Meng

982
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,640
stopped painting,

983
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,860
I have no idea.

984
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,080
He has no idea but I do.

985
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,910
I even know

986
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,850
what's with the Painting Immortal

987
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,020
in Nanfeng Studio.

988
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,860
Prince Han,

989
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,700
this is an important evidence.

990
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,030
Yes, and a masterpiece.

991
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,690
Don't worry.

992
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,700
His Highness must be extremely confident

993
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,090
if he's doing this.

994
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,190
Don't worry.

995
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:37,880
No, no.

996
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,810
Wouldn't that ruin it?

997
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,410
Isn't this ruining Master's

998
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,130
Fishing Alone at Han River painting.

999
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,690
That's right. What a pity.

1000
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:45,440
Jun.

1001
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:46,980
Can you understand

1002
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,820
what he wrote?

1003
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,800
I think it says

1004
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,150
Su Jiu'er, you're an idiot.

1005
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,810
He wrote that.

1006
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,700
Idiot?

1007
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,520
How dare you call me an idiot?

1008
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,660
This color...

1009
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,800
is exactly

1010
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,170
the color of the old man's straw clothing.

1011
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,460
May I ask

1012
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,030
what color did you use?

1013
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:17,680
You...

1014
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,880
really don't know?

1015
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,870
This is Wolf Herb.

1016
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,530
What?

1017
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,180
Wolf Herb.

1018
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,940
Wolf Herb likes Yin.

1019
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,810
So under the light,

1020
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:32,640
it shows a dull yellow

1021
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,070
with no vitality.

1022
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,350
It is also the color

1023
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,200
of the old fisherman's straw clothing

1024
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,220
in this Fishing Alone at Han River painting.

1025
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,210
As for why he disappeared,

1026
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,530
Lay it flat.

1027
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,260
Let me do it.

1028
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,780
Qi Vital Stone?

1029
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
It's really gone.

1030
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,980
It really disappeared.

1031
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,380
Whoa.

1032
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,980
That's amazing.

1033
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,550
For real.

1034
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,770
It's really gone.

1035
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,540
This Wolf Herb is so interesting.

1036
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,140
It's so interesting.

1037
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,470
This is so interesting.

1038
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,140
This is Wolf Herb.

1039
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,510
Once it meets the power of the Qi people,

1040
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,890
it will try to attach itself on it.

1041
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,630
If you look at the painting again now,

1042
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,560
who can tell that

1043
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,920
I've once destroyed this masterpiece.

1044
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,250
Yes, I can't tell at all.

1045
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,100
Such a mysterious painting

1046
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,370
must be carefully designed by someone.

1047
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,900
The murderer used Wolf Herb

1048
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,990
to replace the paint for the straw clothing,

1049
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,830
and made the old man disappear.

1050
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,620
Let me do it.

1051
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,260
It's to scare Wang Jirong.

1052
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,480
Although this is strange,

1053
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,460
it wouldn't have been enough to make a miser

1054
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,650
like Wang Jirong spend so much to redeem it.

1055
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,650
He's so scared...

1056
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,390
Could there be another reason?

1057
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,120
You're finally smart for once.

1058
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,740
Then guess,

1059
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,880
why did he redeemed the painting?

1060
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,540
Is it because this person–

1061
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,340
That's right.

1062
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,240
Because the person who disappeared from this painting

1063
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,100
reminded him of another painting

1064
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,200
and his secret.

1065
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,180
What secret?

1066
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,440
What secret?

1067
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,600
What is the Painting Immortal's

1068
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,470
secret then?

1069
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,370
You should ask that to Painter Feng.

1070
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,490
What priceless treasure?

1071
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,900
Painting Immortal unleashing his vengeance?

1072
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,400
It's just to make people develop a fear

1073
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,660
towards this painting

1074
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,780
and dare not make a counterfeit of it.

1075
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,240
The first time I came here,

1076
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,860
I noticed something strange in the painting.

1077
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,860
Where it is covered with cinnabar red,

1078
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,600
there is a light smell of blood.

1079
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,350
However,

1080
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,300
it's not surprising for one

1081
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,810
to paint with blood.

1082
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,860
So I didn't think too much.

1083
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,770
But recently I visited Nameless Art Gallery

1084
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,000
and found out

1085
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,640
a female disciple of your studio

1086
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,930
went missing.

1087
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:16,780
Missing?

1088
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,780
And her paintings

1089
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,830
was sold

1090
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,660
by a few of you.

1091
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,540
If I'm not mistaken,

1092
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,780
the missing Meng Huaiyun

1093
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,050
has passed away.

1094
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,460
Passed away?

1095
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,700
No way.

1096
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,870
Didn't they say she returned home?

1097
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,750
Exactly.

1098
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,530
Your Highness,

1099
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,400
don't you think

1100
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,290
this is too bold of an assumption?

1101
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,260
First,

1102
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,380
the day Meng Huaiyun left

1103
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,810
was four years ago,

1104
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,070
on the New Year's Eve of Dingkun.

1105
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,040
It's almost the same time as when

1106
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,620
the Painting Immortal appeared on the painting.

1107
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,070
Yes, that's the time.

1108
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:48,830
It matches.

1109
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,360
Second,

1110
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,940
Lin Zhixing distracted the Inspection Bureau

1111
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,740
to meet with the murderer himself and got himself killed.

1112
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,800
What kind of secret

1113
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,650
would make him rather die

1114
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,050
than to tell the truth?

1115
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,840
It could only be

1116
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,470
cause he has murdered someone before.

1117
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,700
I think what Han said

1118
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,430
makes sense.

1119
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,690
In that case,

1120
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:11,860
it makes sense.

1121
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,350
So at the start,

1122
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,840
the murderer used the disappearance of the fisherman

1123
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,960
to arouse Wang Jirong

1124
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,220
and Xu Youdao's guilt.

1125
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,100
They then redeemed their paintings to take a closer look.

1126
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,920
The murderer made it look like the paintings came to live

1127
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,160
and murdered people.

1128
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,310
But the truth is that the Painting Immortal

1129
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,140
doesn't exist at all

1130
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,740
and this drop of blood belongs to Meng Huaiyun.

1131
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:30,820
So,

1132
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,630
is it Junior Meng's spirit seeking vengence,

1133
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,840
or is someone taking revenge for her?

1134
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,920
Painter Feng,

1135
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,370
what do you think?

1136
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,190
When Lin Zhixing knew someone redeemed

1137
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,590
Junior Meng's painting,

1138
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,960
he knew immediately

1139
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,780
that someone is seeking revenge.

1140
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,040
So he wanted to confirm

1141
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,920
who that person is immediately.

1142
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,190
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

1143
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,240
If you want to buy an excellent painting,

1144
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,460
you need a lot of wealth.

1145
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,420
At the same time,

1146
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,620
you also need to love Meng Huaiyun a lot.

1147
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,170
Not many people

1148
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,700
meet these two conditions.

1149
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,220
Could it be...

1150
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,160
Nanfeng Studio's old painter that has been

1151
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,580
traveling around for long,

1152
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,580
Wei Gonglin.

1153
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,720
Isn't this nonsense?

1154
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,340
You can't say that without evidence.

1155
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,160
My master has been

1156
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,060
traveling around for a long time.

1157
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,260
How dare you suspect him?

1158
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,790
Exactly.

1159
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:21,910
You are speculating unreasonably

1160
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:22,740
and slandering.

1161
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,450
What's the reason?

1162
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,630
Why would Grandmaster do that?

1163
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,750
You few

1164
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,640
murdered his favorite disciple.

1165
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,890
In order to hide this,

1166
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,670
you even altered his painting.

1167
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,130
Isn't that enough reason?

1168
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:34,300
How is that possible?

1169
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,540
Is it true?

1170
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,950
But he has to show some evidence.

1171
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,680
Feng Muyuan,

1172
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,810
if you don’t tell the truth,

1173
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:43,670
I'm afraid

1174
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,900
you won't live long.
