he knows how to apologize.

8
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,150

both of you have your own ways.

10
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,860
I shouldn't interfere.

Without you and him,

12

I can't say

without telling me?

43
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,660
It's just a pack of candy.

93
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,000
You leg is recovering well.

94
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,070
Of course.

95
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,610
I recover quickly.

96

Why is this iron?

103
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,150
It's so heavy.

104
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,920
Let me do it.

105
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,460
Let me do it.

106
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,470
- Godfather.
- Give it to me.

107
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,220
Do we have to go this lengths?

108
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,140
Your Highness.

109
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,490
I think I should knock the gong instead.

110
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,750
Given your small body,

111
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,300
I...

112
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,330
No.

113
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,580

No one

116
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,800
should take this task from me.

117
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,630
Fine.

118
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,690
What happened?

119
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,740
I haven't finished packing.

120
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,460

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,060
Let's go.

122
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,700
Take it.

123
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,710
Let's take a look.

how is it?

126
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,910
I got everyone here.

127
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,170
They sounded the gong.

128
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,060
Amazing.

129
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,390
Isn't it just hitting the gong?

130
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,260
Are you okay?

131
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,560
What?

132
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,890
Are you okay?

133
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,180
Louder!

134
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,429
What did you say?

135
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,740
Everyone.

136
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,549
The Inspection Bureau is investigating a case.

137
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,340
It's too much of a hassle

138
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,299
if I question all of you one by one.

139
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:41,780
So,

140
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,179
I gathered all of you here

141
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,380
to ask everything in one go.

142
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,300
Please forgive me.

143
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,100
Inspector Su,

144
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,820
please go ahead.

145
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,060
Here's the thing.

146
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,740
Yesterday,

147
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,030
I visited Nameless Art Gallery at night.

148
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,610
The manager told me

149
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,990
there is a deity

150
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,230
in Nanfeng Studio

151
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,540
and she lives in the painting.

152
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,000
She can come and go freely.

153
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,230
I just want to ask everyone,

154
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,410
if that is true?

155
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,160
Yes, yes.

156
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,960
Have you heard

157
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,780
Wang Jirong also has

158
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,950
a Fishing Alone at Han River painting?

159
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,710
It is said that the old fisherman in this painting

160
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,860
disappeared.

161
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:19,480
This...

162
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,280
Something like this happened?

163
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,180
How could this happen?

164
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,100
Isn't this a good thing?

165
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,920
Then your painting

166
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,450
will be worth a lot of money.

167
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,420
Yes.

168
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,050
Then why did Senior

169
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,310
redeem that painting?

170
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,330
What’s so strange

171
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,120
about Second Senior redeeming a painting?

172
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,790
But he redeemed it and threw it away.

173
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,900
He seemed afraid of that painting.

174
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,780
Why is that?

175
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,660
Second Senior is eccentric.

176
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,320
We can't guess what's going on his mind exactly.

177
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,820
Then I have to catch the person in the painting

178
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,020
and interrogate him.

179
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,780
She's laying a trap again.

180
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,600
This is ridiculous.

181
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,880
You'll know

182
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,460
if it's ridiculous when I catch the person.

183
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,350
Now I want to ask

184
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,040
if that old man is a man or a woman?

185
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,670
Is he fat or thin?

186
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,420
Is he tall or short?

187
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,000
What special features does he have?

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,580
What clothes was he wearing?

189
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,860
Tell me right now, immediately.

190
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,660
The old man

191
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,380
I saw on the painting

192
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,310
wore a dull yellow straw clothing.

193
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,980
Well...

194
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,580
Is there anything else?

195
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,380
Inspector Su,

196
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,700
are you really going to catch the man in the painting?

197
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,590
Not only that.

198
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,870
I want to have a good chat

199
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,600
with the immortal in the painting.

200
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,130
I want to see what kind of clues

201
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,090
she can give me.

202
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,550
You were born in the spring of 25th year of Dingkun.

203
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,030
Then... what did she say?

204
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,290
And appeared in the 29th year of Dingkun.

205
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,370
And appeared in the 29th year of Dingkun.

206
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,140
Painter Lin.

207
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,910
This girl's investigation

208
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,910
is so unreliable.

209
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,600
Stop wasting time here.

210
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,600
Go back to your room to rest up.

211
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,930
Let's disperse.

212
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,900
Let's go.

213
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,500
Let's go.

214
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,440
They're going.

215
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,130
They're going?

216
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,460
Yes.

217
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,120
They're all gone?

218
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,650
All gone.

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,460
Jiu'er.

220
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,430
You've been on this the whole morning.

221
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,340
How do you want to investigate this?

222
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,520
Isn't it obvious?

223
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,350
She's afraid that there'll be too many people in Nanfeng Studio and they collude with each other.

224
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,610
That's why she tried to

225
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,310
gather all of them in one go.

226
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,280
Amazing.

227
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,930
Note that down.

228
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,650
Okay, let me note that down.

229
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,590
And we got

230
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,350
the most important clue today.

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,780
What clue?

232
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,440
That old man.

233
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,260
Old man?

234
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,610
What old man?

235
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,680
The people who came here

236
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,880
are all young people.

237
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,840
What are you talking about, Godfather?

238
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,770
My partner is indeed the smartest.

239
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,790
Actually, this is thanks to my mother.

240
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,520
The person in the painting disappeared.

241
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,550
Isn't that just because

242
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,550
the color has disappeared?

243
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,220
It's not that it disappeared out of nowhere.

244
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,350
Why did you spend the whole morning...

245
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:43,840
This...

246
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,060
I just want to know

247
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,890
how many colors

248
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,430
were used for that old man.

249
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,810
So you're talking about

250
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,340
the old man in the painting?

251
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,240
Don't note this.

252
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,840
So this morning,

253
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,270
you said so much on purpose...

254
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,350
You want the murderer to know

255
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,150
your purpose?

256
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,450
That's right.

257
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,880
Amazing.

258
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,310
Note this down.

259
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,770
As far as I know,

260
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,300
the painters' paints

261
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,630
are made by themselves.

262
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,620
The same color

263
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,260
can have different formulas.

264
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,930
Some use flowers,

265
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,990
and some use trees.

266
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,650
So the most important thing now

267
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,390
is to find

268
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,820
where that dull yellow color came from,

269
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,750
so we can find the murderer's traces.

270
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,940
Where that dull yellow color came from...

271
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,140
I–

272
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,460
You can unravel

273
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,450
such a complicated relationship.

274
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:32,910
Jiu'er,

275
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,120
you're so smart.

276
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,380
Jun,

277
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,800
stop praising

278
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,540
me.

279
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,670
I have

280
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,650
but no choice.

281
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,720
Xu Youdao and Wang Jirong's

282
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,570
causes of death are unknown.

283
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,130
Lin Zhixing

284
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,060
got targeted by the murderer

285
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,070
for no reason too.

286
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,010
I can only find another way.

287
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,750
If I were the murderer,

288
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,820
I'd throw away all these paints.

289
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,820
We haven't

290
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,540
seen each other for so long,

291
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,800
you're still as smart.

292
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,280
Jiu'er,

293
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,620
how did you learn to investigate cases?

294
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,140
Me?

295
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,600
I

296
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,800
was lucky

297
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,730
to be taught by the Chief Inspector at the Inspection Bureau,

298
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,260
so

299
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,750
my thoughts became agile

300
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,020
and I became experienced.

301
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,280
Am I right, Godfather?

302
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,530
Yes.

303
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,110
Very much so.

304
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,110
Listen, kid.

305
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:19,680
I...

306
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,060
am a lucky person.

307
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,720
Hu solved the case

308
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,260
because of my daughter's intelligence.

309
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,380
Sir Han...

310
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,590
He's missing again.

311
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,910
I really don't want to see

312
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,910
that useless guy who only knows how to flatter people.

313
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,450
Young Master H–

314
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,520
Han.

315
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,360
Why are you looking for me?

316
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,340
Brother Han,

317
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,360
you came out of nowhere.

318
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,750
Lass said

319
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,870
you would keep an eye on Lin Zhixing.

320
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,450
She's afraid you can't handle it alone,

321
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,730
so she asked me to help you.

322
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,820
She's getting all flattered

323
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,680
by that Wen Jun.

324
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,540
Why would she think of me?

325
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,720
Are you...

326
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,500
Jealous?

327
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,060
The password.

328
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,300
Speaking of which,

329
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,170
you were obviously jealous.

330
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,300
You're jealous.

331
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,950
Painter Lin,

332
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,180
these dishes

333
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,170
were carefully prepared

334
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,380
by us Inspection Bureau,

335
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,540
there won't be any problems.

336
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,000
Thank you, Inspector Yue.

337
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,200
You're welcome.

338
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,370
We can help each other

339
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,780
on this case,

340
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,100
and get what we need.

341
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,990
After we catch the murderer,

342
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,820
we won't bother you anymore.

343
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,700
But Officer Yue,

344
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,150
the Inspection Bureau is so blatant about protecting me.

345
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,690
Will the murderer not show up

346
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,750
if he's hiding in a corner observing?

347
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,430
That is a possibility.

348
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,870
But what we think is,

349
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,730
we're just trying to protect you.

350
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,820
In that case,

351
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,840
how long does Inspector Yue need to protect me?

352
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,010
Well...

353
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,290
We won't stay in Nanfeng Studio

354
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,350
forever in any way.

355
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
I'll protect you.

356
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,930
On the other hand,

357
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,100
Jiu'er and the Prince of Qi who will go after the murderer

358
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,060
together.

359
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,900
The case will be solved soon.

360
00:15:59,360 --> 00:15:59,820
What?

361
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,240
You don't believe me?

362
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,780
I do have a lot of business matters of

363
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,840
Nanfeng Studio I have to take care of.

364
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,240
I have been kept locked in my room.

365
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,900
It's really

366
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,930
inconvenient for me.

367
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,270
You're right.

368
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,750
Let me think of a way for you.

369
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,750
The carriage is ready.

370
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,580
I'll take care of Lin Zhixing.

371
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,110
I'm sure it'll be fine.

372
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,440
Okay.

373
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,580
You guard Nanfeng Studio.

374
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,440
- Okay.
- Don't let that lass Jiu'er come look for me.

375
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,600
What do you want?

376
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,180
That damn Yue Daren.

377
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,050
Has he never thought

378
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,000
that Lin Zhixing

379
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,400
might have some secrets?

380
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,670
When did you come?

381
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,360
I told you.

382
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,490
Jiu'er asked me to help you.

383
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,260
I didn't say

384
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,520
Jiu'er wouldn't come.

385
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,610
You're so funny.

386
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,020
Your Highness.

387
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,510
Well,

388
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,930
they are riding a carriage.

389
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,190
They must be very fast.

390
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,740
Can you

391
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,069
take me flying with you?

392
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,950
What are you talking about?

393
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,380
Can you take me with you?

394
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,180
Sorry.

395
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,089
I can't.

396
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,740
No.

397
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,670
You have to take me with you.

398
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,880
I can bring you along.

399
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,900
But get rid of that

400
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,480
burdern.

401
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,230
B-burden...

402
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,950
Are you trying to kill me?

403
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,020
My butt!

404
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,550
Come here.

405
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,740
- Lass.
- Jiu’er, quick.

406
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,100
Are you okay?

407
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,840
- Help her up.
- I'm fine. Help me up.

408
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,340
That's good.

409
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:36,640
Come on.

410
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,900
Thank god you're fine.

411
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,020
My butt!

412
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,110
Why did you run away again?

413
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,040
Lass,

414
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,150
can you be

415
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,850
more ladylike?

416
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,390
You were so crude just now.

417
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,090
Sorry for having you see this, Your Highness.

418
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,750
She's doing this for the case.

419
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,610
Yes.

420
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,230
It's for the case.

421
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,420
Ma'am,

422
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,900
please give me a discount.

423
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:00,820
Miss,

424
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,660
this is the cheapest I can go.

425
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,500
This looks nice.

426
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,160
Boss,

427
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,020
is there anything

428
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,210
lighter for this green one?

429
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,160
Lighter?

430
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,640
Let me take a look.

431
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,410
Move aside.

432
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,660
This one, lady.

433
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,940
This green is actually quite pretty.

434
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,890
It's the most popular color now.

435
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,060
Make way.

436
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:15,660
Look.

437
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,030
It looks good on you.

438
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:17,710
Be careful.

439
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:18,920
Ma'am,

440
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,010
is there any other color for this umbrella?

441
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,750
This one...

442
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,110
Yes, it's in the back.

443
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,120
I'll go get it for you.

444
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,440
Move aside please.

445
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,550
How's this umbrella?

446
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,590
Be careful.

447
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,090
Ma'am!

448
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,170
Coming.

449
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,990
Which umbrella do you want?

450
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,740
This one.

451
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,540
I'll get it for you.

452
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:39,840
Thank you.

453
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,520
This one?

454
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,360
Be careful.

455
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,170
My umbrella!

456
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,540
- I’m sorry, Ma'am.
- What happened?

457
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,260
Sorry.

458
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,180
Don't worry.

459
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,310
Okay, thank you.

460
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,510
I didn't mean it.

461
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,860
Here. Slowly.

462
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,820
What's going on?

463
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,350
This Lin Zhixing

464
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,250
is indeed suspicious.

465
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,040
Put it here.

466
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:58,980
Thank you.

467
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,340
Painter Lin!

468
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,700
Killed on the spot.

469
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,300
Why do you keep circling around here?

470
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,080
Live fish.

471
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,280
Killed on the spot.

472
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,310
This fish...

473
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,920
Come again, sir.

474
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,430
It's fresh. Killed on the spot.

475
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,430
Are the fish fresh?

476
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,900
They have just been killed.

477
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,630
Give me this.

478
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,300
Okay.

479
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,170
Make it clean.

480
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:31,950
Okay.

481
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,900
How is it? Have a look.

482
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,700
Clean, right?

483
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,620
All right. I'll take this one.

484
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,850
I will take this one.

485
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,960
Killed on the spot!

486
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,520
Goodbye, sir.

487
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,110
I let him escape...

488
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,730
What do you think of this one?

489
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,660
Is it fat enough?

490
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,670
This is good.

491
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,310
Okay.

492
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,800
The temperature here

493
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,400
is much higher than outside.

494
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,590
There is also a lot more disgusting smell.

495
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,840
Your Highness.

496
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,800
Do you miss me?

497
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,950
What are you doing?

498
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,500
I'm helping you cool down.

499
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,360
How did you find me?

500
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,440
What do you mean?

501
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,240
Can't you leave a mark?

502
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,230
If I hadn't been smart,

503
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,820
you would've been dead

504
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,020
on the Niulan Street.

505
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,370
It's not that I don't know how to leave a mark.

506
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,290
I just don't want to.

507
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:04,570
You–

508
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,680
What?

509
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,880
You found me

510
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,630
in the end anyway.

511
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,160
I told you

512
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,640
that's because I'm smart.

513
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,010
I went to

514
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,010
Lin Zhixing's room

515
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,610
to take a look after you left.

516
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,030
It's not hard for him to get rid of Yue Daren.

517
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,490
If he wants to get rid of you,

518
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,290
he has to come up with something.

519
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,780
When Lin Zhixing went out,

520
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,460
it was noon.

521
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,770
It's when the sun is the brightest.

522
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,900
The hottest

523
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,740
and smelliest place in Jiuxiao City

524
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,200
can only be Niulan Street.

525
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,140
What are you thinking?

526
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,270
I'm thinking

527
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:40,940
how you should repay me

528
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,470
for having saved your life.

529
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,850
Candy?

530
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,040
A brocade?

531
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,200
Or cosmetics?

532
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,810
Forget it.

533
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,280
Just take me to Deyue Restaurant

534
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,280
to have a big meal.

535
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,130
Can you stop thinking with that

536
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,870
accountant-minded mind of yours?

537
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,760
Why should I?

538
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,420
You don't trust me anyway.

539
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,120
Then turn our trust

540
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,070
into a ledger.

541
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,480
It's not that I don't trust you.

542
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,570
I just think

543
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:04,910
when I'm alone,

544
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,420
my thoughts are clearer.

545
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,280
Your Highness,

546
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,080
are you willing to trust me now?

547
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,340
And sit here

548
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,530
and wait quietly.

549
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,700
Wait for what?

550
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,490
Lin Zhixing might have really ran away.

551
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,300
Don't worry.

552
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,090
I've been to

553
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,810
his room.

554
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,490
He didn't take anything with him.

555
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,490
He won't run away.

556
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,750
I thought

557
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,580
he wouldn't try to get rid of you.

558
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,530
I didn't expect him to be so confident

559
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,730
about his own safety.

560
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,880
I guess Lin Zhixing

561
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,990
will be back soon.

562
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,040
Just right,

563
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,590
the view here is good.

564
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,100
You can recover

565
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,650
while I keep a lookout.

566
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,770
Look at that.

567
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,910
Daren that fool

568
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,260
is also looking for him.

569
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,220
Ma'am,

570
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,300
excuse me.

571
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,670
Do you know where

572
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,420
that customer in white went to?

573
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,200
I think he ran this way.

574
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,930
[Nameless Publisher]

575
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,660
Painter Lin.

576
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,620
Painter Lin.

577
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,600
Painter Lin.

578
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,730
Where did he go?

579
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:28,730
Kaha!

580
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,380
Push!

581
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,590
Stop skiving.

582
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,200
General.

583
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,900
Isn't that someone from the Inspection Bureau?

584
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,330
If he's wandering around here,

585
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,690
His Highness must be here too.

586
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,650
You're not going to work if His Highness is here?

587
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,410
His Highness assigned

588
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,340
this work to you.

589
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,920
That's not what I meant.

590
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,150
I mean

591
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:47,840
what kind of clues can we get

592
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,250
working hard labor here?

593
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,310
Cut the crap.

594
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,260
Go push the cart.

595
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,050
When we get there, act miserable.

596
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,320
I'm good at acting.

597
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,090
Don't worry.

598
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,690
Pork for sale!

599
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,430
I just slaughtered the pig.

600
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:07,430
You guys.

601
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,650
Can anyone help us?

602
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,070
Go move it.

603
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,470
Hurry.

604
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:09,910
Hurry.

605
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,580
Go.

606
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,320
All right.

607
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,630
Come on.

608
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,340
Your goods are too heavy.

609
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,300
Watch out.

610
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,990
Go ask the boss for money.

611
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,120
Thank you.

612
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,470
Go.

613
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,780
Unload the goods. Hurry.

614
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,780
You, tell them.

615
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,290
Boss, the goods are here.

616
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:29,590
Here.

617
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,340
Leave.

618
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,060
So little?

619
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,370
Boss,

620
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,000
can you give us more?

621
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,230
You have so many goods

622
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,100
and they are so heavy.

623
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,600
That's all the work you've done.

624
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,550
How much more do you want?

625
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:41,860
No.

626
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,480
Just give us some more.

627
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,680
My sister is so exhausted.

628
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,230
Boss,

629
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,020
please give us

630
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,910
- one more tael.
- No way.

631
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,540
That's all you get.

632
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,600
Take it or leave it.

633
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,060
You two want money, right?

634
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:56,520
Come here.

635
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,850
Are you two Qi people?

636
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:07,860
Yes.

637
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,470
It's easy for you Qi people to make

638
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,380
quick money.

639
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,260
Why compromise

640
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,140
here?

641
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,070
Boss,

642
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,060
what do you mean?

643
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,380
Don't you know?

644
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,660
You Qi people

645
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,820
have a natural precious herb

646
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,650
on your bodies.

647
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,260
You can

648
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,980
exchange this for money.

649
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,590
Brother,

650
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,810
tell use where we should go.

651
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,060
Follow me.

652
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,350
Amazing.

653
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,110
She's eloquent and likes eating sunflower seeds.

654
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,710
She must've been a parrot in her previous life.

655
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,450
Lin Zhixing is indeed back.

656
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,120
Painter Lin,

657
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,110
where did you go?

658
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,140
I've been looking for you.

659
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,000
Inspector Yue,

660
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,420
where have you been?

661
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,560
I bought a lot of things,

662
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,780
but I didn't see you when I turned back.

663
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,820
I got very anxious.

664
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,170
I've been looking for you everywhere,

665
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,500
but I couldn't find you.

666
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:10,950
Well,

667
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,870
it seems like we went in different ways.

668
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,580
Luckily, both of us are smart

669
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,530
and know to wait at the same place.

670
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,730
That's right.

671
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,070
You've spent so much time here

672
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,400
just to buy this?

673
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,350
You mentioned that the painting has committed murder,

674
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,680
so I want to buy tributes

675
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,150
to pray in the Studio

676
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,820
and see if it can repel the evil spirits.

677
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,460
So Lin Zhixing

678
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,400
is so confident in his own safety

679
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,280
because he think

680
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,950
it's a supernatural force causing all these.

681
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,080
That's why he picked

682
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,780
noon, which is when the yang is the strongest,

683
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,290
to come and make his purchase

684
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,490
before going back to exorcise the evil.

685
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,830
You just made

686
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,500
so many inferences on him just now.

687
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,830
You overestimated him.

688
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,490
Why are you laughing?

689
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,460
What's so funny?

690
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,130
Lin Zhixing,

691
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,090
my judgment on you is in vain.

692
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,970
All you did was

693
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,370
bring these things back.

694
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,060
No.

695
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,290
I need to think

696
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,130
about where,

697
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,740
within an hour,

698
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,830
can he walk to.

699
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,410
I need to check it again.

700
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,170
Don't waste your energy.

701
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,170
I have an idea now.

702
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,980
Do you want to hear it?

703
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,320
Your Highness,

704
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,560
you're finally going to show

705
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,420
your strength.

706
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,660
Master,

707
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,900
will this

708
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,720
agitate the Painting Immortal?

709
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,610
As long as we are sincere,

710
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,620
it will be fine.

711
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:49,950
Lord Yue,

712
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,860
do you want to burn some yellow paper

713
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,460
to ward off evil spirits too?

714
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,780
Painter Lin,

715
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,850
I only worship the God of Wealth.

716
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,580
You go ahead.

717
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,640
We need to search

718
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,860
while he's not around.

719
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,030
I thought

720
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,660
you were up to something big.

721
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,560
So it's another sneak and search.

722
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,910
I think this place

723
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,520
has already been searched.

724
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,820
If something was wrong,

725
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,280
they should have found it.

726
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,240
Do you think–

727
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,380
Are you going to say

728
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,960
us Qians

729
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,560
are not as good as Qis when it comes to searching?

730
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,620
Why ask if you knew?

731
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,610
Can I, a Qian,

732
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,520
sit here

733
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,080
and watch you, a Qi, search?

734
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,720
Fine.

735
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,060
Since you almost

736
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,460
lost your life today,

737
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,210
I'll help you with searching.

738
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,040
There's no secret drawer.

739
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,560
And there are plants

740
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,720
all over this house.

741
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,970
What should we look for?

742
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,650
There are two ways we can think of this.

743
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,850
If he is the murderer,

744
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,090
there must be

745
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,780
a feud between them.

746
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,940
If he is not the murderer,

747
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,140
but the next target,

748
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,070
then there must be something

749
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,270
similar between him,

750
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,940
Xu Youdao, and Xu Youdao.

751
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,460
Something similar between them...

752
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,580
Must be painting!

753
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,130
Xu Youdao painted animals.

754
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,260
There's a head in the body of an animal.

755
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,930
Lin Zhixing paints plants.

756
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,020
But there are so many plants

757
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,160
in this room.

758
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,140
He should paint...

759
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,050
This is the oddest one

760
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,250
in this entire house.

761
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,360
What's odd about it?

762
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,080
The silver fox flower is not in season.

763
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,530
It requires a lot of sun and does not keep well in the dark.

764
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,560
And the location of this pot of flower

765
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,220
is strange.

766
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,490
Sunlight rarely penetrates in.

767
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,540
How could these flowers

768
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,420
bloom so well?

769
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:49,540
This root...

770
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,770
This root is way too thick!

771
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,380
It's so abnormal!

772
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,200
Wait.

773
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,350
Don't move.

774
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,370
Could there be a trap?

775
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,880
Wait for me.

776
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,700
Why are you always like this?

777
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,240
Your Highness!

778
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,050
Your Highness!

779
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,550
Stop!

780
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,390
What are you doing?

781
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,200
L-lord.

782
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,100
What is this for?

783
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,530
How did you get this?

784
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,190
L-lord.

785
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,470
Could there be any misunderstanding?

786
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,030
I bought this legally.

787
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,560
Stop!

788
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,470
Han Zheng! Han Zheng!

789
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,100
Han Zheng! Han Zheng!

790
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,020
Are you okay, Painter Lin?

791
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,840
Calm down.

792
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,600
Brother Han.

793
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,390
How are you?

794
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,720
- Calm down. - Calm down.

795
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,820
Young man.

796
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,010
Calm down, Brother Han.

797
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,080
We can talk

798
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,310
if there's anything.

799
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:27,970
Right?

800
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,090
That's right.

801
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,490
You can't commit murder.

802
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,860
What on earth is that?

803
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,580
Everyone,

804
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,020
my senior said

805
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,350
he was frightened today

806
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,900
and didn’t want to see you again.

807
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,250
Especially this Inspector Han.

808
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,650
He can't trust the people

809
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,670
of the Inspection Bureau.

810
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,600
He doesn't want you to protect him anymore.

811
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,240
Please

812
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,640
return.

813
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:07,930
Painter Feng,

814
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,739
to be honest,

815
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,500
what happened today

816
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,780
is just a misunderstanding.

817
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,940
I'm on a mission.

818
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,320
Can I explain

819
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,199
to painter Lin?

820
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,040
Painter Feng.

821
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,050
Your Highness, you're being ridiculous.

822
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,110
If Painter Lin complains about this

823
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,300
to the Inspection Bureau,

824
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:25,960
then you...

825
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,920
and Jiu'er have to take up this responsibility.

826
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:30,500
No.

827
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,090
Then I...

828
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,000
Fine.

829
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,810
There must be something fishy about this.

830
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:35,580
Otherwise, His Highness

831
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,580
can't be so angry.

832
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,889
But Your Highness,

833
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,620
what is this?

834
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:42,900
How could it

835
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,830
get you so angry?

836
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,320
Brother Han, are you so angry

837
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,840
because that thing is

838
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,790
the legendary Qi Vital Stone?

839
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:54,000
- The Qi Vital Stone? - The Qi Vital Stone?

840
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,980
What is the Qi Vital Stone?

841
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,560
This is a kind of medicine.

842
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,020
And it's quite expensive.

843
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,820
It's not a medicine itself.

844
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,740
It's just being used as a medicine by Qian people.

845
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,090
Then what is it?

846
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,540
It is said that

847
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,750
it's Qi peoples' amulate.

848
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,100
- Amulet? - Amulet?

849
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,670
Qi people are powerful.

850
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,540
But when they are born,

851
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,490
they aren't stable.

852
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,020
So they found a spirit stone

853
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,960
which can help them stabilize.

854
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,280
As time goes by,

855
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,020
the Qi Vital Stone will have form a symbiotic relationship

856
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,880
with its owner.

857
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,700
The stronger the Qi person is,

858
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,500
the stronger the Qi Vital Stone will be.

859
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,420
On the other hand,

860
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,270
when they lose their Qi Yuan Stone,

861
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,130
their strength

862
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,860
will also be greatly weakened.

863
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,450
Your Highness.

864
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,220
Why did you

865
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,900
know so much

866
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,580
about us Qi?

867
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,840
No...

868
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,450
Brother Han, you misunderstood.

869
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,810
It's just because my elder brother

870
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,320
specialized in Qi's affairs,

871
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,730
So...

872
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,740
I just heard about it.

873
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,460
In other words,

874
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,460
the person who use the Qi Yuan Stone

875
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,780
are plundering the power of the Qi people.

876
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,180
Right?

877
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,160
You can say that.

878
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,810
Because in the beginning,

879
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,860
Qian people did not know the origin of the Qi Yuan Stone.

880
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,090
They just know that this stone

881
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,560
has the power of the Qi clan.

882
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,540
So it was used

883
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,500
as treatment initially.

884
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,160
Treatment?

885
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,500
How?

886
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,890
You can soak in water with it, or apply it heated on yourself directly.

887
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,090
If you use it appropriately,

888
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,020
it will heighten your five senses.

889
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,640
Isn't that just a medicine?

890
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,960
It will also make you strong

891
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,980
and full of energy.

892
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,440
You won't even feel tired.

893
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,220
If you use it inappropriately,

894
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,740
it will make you dizzy

895
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,620
and hallucinate.

896
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,730
Why is that?

897
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,780
Because the Qi Vital Stone

898
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,130
is not a medicine.

899
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,800
It's just a power of the Qi race.

900
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,760
This power can only be obtained

901
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,740
for a short period of time.

902
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,600
Your Highness,

903
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,290
why does Painter Lin

904
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,330
need this?

905
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,730
Some scholars and artists

906
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,830
always come up with

907
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,500
some weird ideas when they have an artist's block.

908
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,300
But doing this

909
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,120
is deemed unethical by most moral people.

910
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,030
The paintings and poems

911
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,510
made while on the Qi Vital Stone

912
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,130
will be despised by most people.

913
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,140
That's why Lin Zhixing

914
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,380
buried this Qi Vital Stone

915
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,540
in the plants.

916
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,080
This clue is useless then,

917
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:58,740
Your Highness.

918
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,460
Not really.

919
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,420
I rushed here

920
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,380
because I found

921
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,060
some things related to the Qi Vital Stone

922
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,920
this afternoon in the warehouse.

923
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,820
What is it?

924
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,130
Your Highness.

925
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,500
There are so many kinds of yellow.

926
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,940
How long more do you have to test?

927
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,620
Here, eat something first.

928
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:16,910
Move aside.

929
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,510
I'm happy to help Jiu'er.

930
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,870
Your Highness, look.

931
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,140
Although Lin Zhixing's

932
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,870
paintings now are quite weird,

933
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,410
but

934
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,420
the paintings he drew before

935
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,730
are quite normal.

936
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,640
Everyone,

937
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,000
please look at the paintings on both sides.

938
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,860
How do you feel?

939
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,620
The painting on the right,

940
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,710
feels traditional and normal.

941
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,100
The painting on the left

942
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,500
gives off some evil aura.

943
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:08,820
What else?

944
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,740
These are the paintings of those three people,

945
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,650
just of a different period!

946
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,410
That's right.

947
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,860
Although the three of them

948
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,180
have their own characteristics,

949
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,230
but they all have

950
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,290
an odd thing in common.

951
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,710
Suddenly, at some point,

952
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,190
their style changed.

953
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,650
Could this be–

954
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,070
It's because of this

955
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,060
that I remembered

956
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,140
the shopkeeper of Nameless Art Gallery told me

957
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,950
some painters

958
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,540
will have a great change in their style

959
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,060
when they use Qi Vital Stone.

960
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,950
Look at them.

961
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,180
Don't they fit

962
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,440
this characteristic?

963
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,380
Jun.

964
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,760
You're amazing.

965
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,870
I know.

966
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,820
The reason the murderer

967
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,280
took them as their targets

968
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,110
is because they

969
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,400
used the Qi Vital Stone secretly.

970
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,710
Hearing you say that...

971
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,200
The murderer is...

972
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:58,990
a Qi.

973
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,260
Daren.

974
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,100
You can eat anything you want,

975
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,140
but you can't say anything you want.

976
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,900
We don't know what

977
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,900
the murderer's motive is yet.

978
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,770
Right.

979
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,180
Daren,

980
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,510
as a inspector,

981
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,860
we can't be so arbitrary.

982
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,500
Go.

983
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,470
Anyway,

984
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,720
Lin Zhixing will be in danger.

985
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,000
Your Highness.

986
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,220
We know

987
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,780
what you're going through.

988
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,300
But now,

989
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,460
we have to

990
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,930
protect Lin Zhihang first.

991
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:28,440
Enough.

992
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,790
I won't protect

993
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,620
someone who uses Qi Vital Stone.

994
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,650
General,

995
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,850
do you really have to give it

996
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,470
just to find some clues?

997
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,990
You don't want to leave your child, but you can't get the wolf.

998
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,050
With such a business in Jiuxiao City,

999
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,850
many people must be implicated.

1000
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,880
We must follow the clues

1001
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,330
and find out the truth.

1002
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:57,860
General,

1003
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,150
I finally

1004
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,040
got smarter,

1005
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:00,780
but now I have to

1006
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,310
give away my Qi Vital Stone,

1007
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,360
won't I get more dumb?

1008
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,750
Should we give mine instead?

1009
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,400
No, no, no.

1010
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,820
You're a girl.

1011
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,000
If we have to take it again,

1012
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,560
let's just take Kaha's.

1013
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,960
What are you doing at my house?

1014
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,030
Waiting for you.

1015
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,670
Waiting for me?

1016
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,470
What's wrong?

1017
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,920
I have found some clues about what

1018
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,520
you asked me to investigate.

1019
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,160
Buy mine.

1020
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,230
Buy mine.

1021
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:28,920
Thank you.

1022
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,340
Okay.

1023
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:30,240
Go back.

1024
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:30,840
Thank you.

1025
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,790
Thank you.

1026
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,490
Buy mine.

1027
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,980
Buy mine.

1028
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:34,890
Listen.

1029
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,190
It's not that I don't want it,

1030
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,870
but your body can't take it.

1031
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:38,970
We can.

1032
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,150
I can. I can.

1033
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,330
It's all to make a living.

1034
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,600
Don't hurt yourselves

1035
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,350
nor me.

1036
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:46,970
Okay?

1037
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:49,900
Go ask around.

1038
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,770
Look at me, how does mine look?

1039
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,120
I...

1040
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,020
Come on.

1041
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:00,450
I'm going.

1042
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,640
Mine works too.

1043
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,280
What?

1044
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,580
Someone is collecting Qi Vital Stone in the black market?

1045
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,370
They look for Qi people

1046
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,570
who are desperate

1047
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,720
and persuade them to

1048
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,180
sell their Qi Vital Stone.

1049
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,670
Damn it...

1050
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:13,890
How did they know

1051
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:14,890
about this thing?

1052
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,930
It's not surprising they know about it.

1053
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:18,700
Every Qi person

1054
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,300
has their own Qi Vital Stone.

1055
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,850
The Qi Vital Stone stabilizes

1056
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,080
the thoughts and abilities of their owners.

1057
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,540
It's a protection amulet.

1058
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,540
The stronger the Qi person is,

1059
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,180
the stronger the Qi Vital Stone is,

1060
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,220
and it will also go on to get stronger.

1061
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,550
They must have found

1062
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,640
it can carry

1063
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,740
the power of Qi people

1064
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,740
and want to use it.

1065
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,980
But the more the Qi Vital Stone is dug away from them,

1066
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,910
the weaker the Qi

1067
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:38,940
will become.

1068
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,590
That's why this business

1069
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,020
is only under the table.

1070
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,550
They will only look for

1071
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,080
those Qi who are desperate.

1072
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,620
What the Qian doesn't seem to know

1073
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,400
is the tight bond between Qi Vital Stone

1074
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
and their master.

1075
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,440
Every time they use,

1076
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,360
their consciousness

1077
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,620
connect temporarily.

1078
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,550
So,

1079
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,600
Xu Youdao thinks

1080
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,900
it was just a dream.

1081
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:58,750
I've seen it

1082
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,080
many times when I dream.

1083
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,510
What it also means is...

1084
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,030
Mu Yan

1085
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,640
should still be alive.

1086
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,220
How did he

1087
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,650
even end up

1088
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,430
having to sell his Qi Vital Stone?

1089
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,240
What if he's just trying to set a trap for you?

1090
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,970
Impossible.

1091
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,040
You still think it's impossible?

1092
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,500
I believe he won't hurt me.

1093
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,870
If it's really him,

1094
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,090
I will find him again.

1095
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,850
General.

1096
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,460
Please.

1097
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,030
You have to work hard

1098
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,460
to advocate for the Qian-Qi Six Treaties,

1099
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,540
and add a line that

1100
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,380
forbids them to transact Qi Vital Stone

1101
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,540
into their law.

1102
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,380
Easier said than done.

1103
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,770
How can you not

1104
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
have even such confidence?

1105
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,460
How naive.

1106
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,270
This has nothing to do with my confidence.

1107
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,380
Making a law

1108
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,310
and making a ban is not difficult.

1109
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,340
But countless Qi people

1110
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,720
who were discriminated in Jiuxiao City

1111
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,570
won't be able to continue living

1112
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,110
just because of this ban.

1113
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:06,680
Take it.

1114
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,340
Thank you.

1115
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,370
Thank you.

1116
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,180
Only by eliminating

1117
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,110
the barrier

1118
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,390
between the two clans,

1119
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,340
can the Qi people

1120
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,220
and live a good life in the State of Qian.

1121
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,080
I don't even know

1122
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,010
my own race.

1123
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,280
Don't worry too much.

1124
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,440
The Qi Vital Stone is not something

1125
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,800
the Qian can handle.

1126
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,600
If they use it too much,

1127
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,690
they will die because they can't bear it.

1128
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:35,530
It won't develop into

1129
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,120
the terrifying state

1130
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,270
that Xuanqi race did when they used it.

1131
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:44,880
General.

1132
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:47,070
Did you bring Wolf Herb

1133
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,730
into Jiuxiao City this time?

1134
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,040
What do you need it for?

1135
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:50,840
An autopsy.

1136
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,200
An autopsy?

1137
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:53,660
I think...

1138
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:55,570
I know the cause of their death.
