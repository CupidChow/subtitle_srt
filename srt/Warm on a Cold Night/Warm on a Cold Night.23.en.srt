[Episode 23]

4
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,330
Get out of my way.

5
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,270
What do you want?

6
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,470
Well...

7
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,190
The case of The Western Chamber has been solved.

8
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,600
I haven't rested for days.

9
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,460
It's too tiring.

10
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,950
By the way,

11
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,980
Uncle Hu invited us to dinner.

12
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,380
Yes.

13
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,620
I wonder what's wrong with him.

14
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,680
He's so happy today

15
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,829
that he's even willing to treat us to dinner.

16
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:27,760
Drink more then.

17
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,250
Uncle Hu's liquor is very good.

18
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,540
Okay. Let's go.

19
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,170
Why are you taking advantage of me?

20
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:33,900
You bastard.

21
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,579
You hugged me first.

22
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,220
Who is taking advantage?

23
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:39,740
You...

24
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,180
I want to go down.

25
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,620
I want to go down.

26
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,180
Go ahead.

27
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,150
This...

28
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,500
Remember that you forced me to do this.

29
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,530
Enough, Su Jiu'er.

30
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,440
Be careful.

31
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,300
Su Jiu'er.

32
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,160
Listen carefully.

33
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,010
I...

34
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,020
was wrong.

35
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,140
What did you say?

36
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,770
I said I was wrong.

37
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,750
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

38
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:26,550
From now on,

39
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,740
I will control my temper

40
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,450
and won't make you sad anymore.

41
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,380
You...

42
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,220
Are you apologizing to me?

43
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,950
A-Are you really yourself?

44
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,190
Don't tell me

45
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,900
you're making fun of me

46
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,310
with a Hanzheng-like face mask on you.

47
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,550
Enough.

48
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:55,850
Ouch!

49
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,710
Are you okay?

50
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,510
Did I hurt you?

51
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,120
I'm fine.

52
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,320
My skin is rough.

53
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,220
This is nothing.

54
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,600
Don't say that again.

55
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,920
You don't care about it

56
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,630
but I do.

57
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:21,910
Alright.

58
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,340
I've apologized.

59
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,090
We should go into

60
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
the second issue.

61
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,100
What is it?

62
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,630
Does it hurt?

63
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,300
Just a moment.

64
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,620
It'll be ready soon.

65
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,420
Done.

66
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,960
This...

67
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,890
This...

68
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,340
What is this?

69
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,580
How can I move

70
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,980
with you tieing my hands together?

71
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,110
You have too many wounds on your hands.

72
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,920
Luckily, my bandaging skills

73
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,580
are not bad.

74
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,780
Not bad?

75
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,760
This is great.

76
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,340
Fine.

77
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,120
It looks nice.

78
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,730
But with my hand wrapped like this,

79
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,530
how can you replenish my health?

80
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,540
This is easy.

81
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,800
If it's not enough...

82
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:12,800
Jiu'er.

83
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,420
I...

84
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,250
You...

85
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,010
Actually...

86
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,990
Actually what?

87
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,420
Hu told me

88
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,630
he invited us to Deyue Restaurant.

89
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,360
Impossible.

90
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,260
He can't afford Deyue Restaurant.

91
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,820
With his monthly salary,

92
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,420
he can only afford Drunkery.

93
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,190
That's acceptable too.

94
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,750
Alright.

95
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,100
Hu is with his good liquor.

96
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,630
Let's go.

97
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,810
Well,

98
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,360
what did you want to tell me?

99
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,790
I...

100
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,620
I'll tell you

101
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,350
when I'm ready.

102
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,890
Look at that cloud.

103
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,610
Doesn't it look like a puppy?

104
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,860
Are you saying that?

105
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,510
Yes.

106
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,550
It really looks like a puppy.

107
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,210
Look at its four legs

108
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,460
flopping around.

109
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,680
So cute.

110
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,540
Silly girl.

111
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,180
She's so easy to fool.

112
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,760
What was he trying to say?

113
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,220
I want to know

114
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,360
but I don't dare to.

115
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,220
Oh, Hanzheng.

116
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,360
There are times when you dare not.

117
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,090
Oh, Jiu'er.

118
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,350
W-What are you nervous about?

119
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,770
You're amazing.

120
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,370
This move

121
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,950
really hurts.

122
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,950
Many people can't stand it.

123
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,950
As a man,

124
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,580
If I can't even bear this pain,

125
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,040
how can I call myself a man?

126
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,660
Hang in there.

127
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,320
It's done.

128
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,160
It's done?

129
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,380
It's done?

130
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,210
When you reach home,

131
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,540
cook these two packages of herbs.

132
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,870
You'll be fine after taking them.

133
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,470
Take them.

134
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,140
It's you.

135
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,190
How can I accept that?

136
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,010
You...

137
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,540
Are you the Inspector

138
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,670
who helped me close my stall last time?

139
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,530
Hu!

140
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,230
Let's go.

141
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,100
Hurry!

142
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,830
Let's go.

143
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,510
You've paid too much money.

144
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,850
Didn't I mention

145
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,980
the girl I liked with you last time?

146
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,600
I remember.

147
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,740
You said she's your crush.

148
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,470
Didn't you say you would arrange a meeting for us?

149
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,000
Actually,

150
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,100
she...

151
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,620
Why does it suddenly rain?

152
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,410
Hu.

153
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,460
Go back on your own first.

154
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,720
Be careful on the road.

155
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,450
It's raining heavily. Where are you going?

156
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,250
Does it hurt?

157
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:31,650
No.

158
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,300
Okay.

159
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,840
-I…
-I...

160
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,750
-You go first.
-You go first.

161
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,300
I also had

162
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,650
a bad attitude just now.

163
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,020
I know Keyuncha

164
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,500
has suffered a grievance.

165
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,940
But what I do

166
00:11:59,230 --> 00:11:59,940
is not to

167
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,980
protect Boss Chen

168
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,260
but to protect Keyuncha.

169
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:04,630
Let me do it.

170
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,680
I understand that.

171
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,610
Tomorrow morning,

172
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,580
I will fetch Keyuncha back home

173
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,620
and talk some sense into him.

174
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
So that he can

175
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,300
free himself of all this.

176
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,870
We need to keep him company.

177
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,680
We can take him

178
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,620
to have tasty food in Jiuxiao City

179
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,590
and to the suburbs

180
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,790
to visit the hot springs.

181
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,850
Silly girl.

182
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,790
Have you ever seen Qi people

183
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,540
like to go to the hot springs?

184
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,530
It hurts.

185
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,380
Why do you always pinch my face?

186
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:36,980
Don't you know

187
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,140
the more you pinch, the bigger my face will be?

188
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,700
If so...

189
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,550
Pinch me too. Take revenge on me.

190
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,430
I want to make your face bigger too.

191
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,390
Make your face bigger.

192
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,040
Help!

193
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,640
The suspect ran away!

194
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,410
Help!

195
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,020
Hurry!

196
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,130
He ran away!

197
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,650
What happened?

198
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,370
Who ran away?

199
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:54,860
Is it He Yuqin?

200
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,320
What happened?

201
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:55,970
What happened?

202
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,210
Keyuncha ran away!

203
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,040
What?

204
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,320
He ran away.

205
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,100
The prisoner ran away.

206
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,430
Let's go.

207
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:00,960
Let's go.

208
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:01,880
This...

209
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,030
We used agarwood

210
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,450
to block his five senses.

211
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,230
He shouldn't have escaped.

212
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,680
What happened?

213
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,680
He shapeshifted into the Qi form

214
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,270
and cut off his arm.

215
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,380
Boss Chen.

216
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,710
He must have gone to Boss Chen.

217
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,420
Hanzheng.

218
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,220
Wait for me!

219
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,020
Girl.

220
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,200
Look at your hand.

221
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,060
You're injured.

222
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,740
Don't go to dangerous places anymore.

223
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll keep an eye on him.

224
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,400
Slow down.

225
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,140
Master.

226
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
Master!

227
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,440
This is no time

228
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,690
for you to take your things.

229
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,460
It's more important to run for your life.

230
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,990
You guys keep watch outside

231
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,900
and wait for me.

232
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,540
No, Master.

233
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,070
Master!

234
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,600
Master!

235
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,450
D-Don't kill me!

236
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,640
Don't kill me.

237
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,720
It's yours.

238
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,380
It's yours.

239
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,780
They're all yours.

240
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:30,910
Here.

241
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,500
Take them.

242
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,080
Take them.

243
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:43,740
No!

244
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,980
Don't kill me!

245
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,340
Don't kill me!

246
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,900
No!

247
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,420
Don't kill me.

248
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,990
What's that sound?

249
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,220
It seems to be Master.

250
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,200
Let's go in and have a look.

251
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,270
I can go back to the Inspection Bureau with you.

252
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,840
Let's go. I'll take you to Chilan.

253
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,000
What for?

254
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,640
I'm a murderer.

255
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,910
You should arrest me.

256
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,370
Cut the crap. Come with me.

257
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:00,990
Chilan has

258
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,040
a secret escort team

259
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,970
in Jiuxiao City.

260
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,140
She must have a way

261
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,670
to take you back to Shuobei.

262
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,460
I don't want to implicate you.

263
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,420
Do you want to die like this

264
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,780
for a villain

265
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,570
who hurt your beloved one?

266
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,840
Trust in Chilan and me.

267
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,990
Come with me.

268
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,720
What are you doing?

269
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,430
Do you want to take him away?

270
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,550
Hu, get out of the way.

271
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,860
Prince Han.

272
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,980
Do you think it is a faithful act to your friend?

273
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,630
Keyuncha has killed someone!

274
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,500
He must go with me to the Inspection Bureau.

275
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,200
If he has any grievances,

276
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,400
pour out those in the Inspection Bureau.

277
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,580
If you help him to escape from this,

278
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,630
you'll become his accomplice.

279
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,590
I'll resign myself to it.

280
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,060
Hu.

281
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,260
You know you can't stop me.

282
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,180
Fine.

283
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,380
I know I'm no match for you.

284
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,060
So what?

285
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,780
The Inspector is on duty.

286
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,900
Keyuncha.

287
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,750
Come with me.

288
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,700
Han.

289
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,660
Calm down.

290
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,740
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,060
Keyuncha.

292
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:10,820
Get up.

293
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,020
Let's go home.

294
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,250
They are here to catch him, aren't they?

295
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,850
Look, he's covered in blood.

296
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,590
He's bloody.

297
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,740
Yes.

298
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,900
That's scary.

299
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,860
What's going on?

300
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,170
It's him.

301
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,660
The one who is without his arm.

302
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,790
He killed Boss Chen.

303
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,760
I know you.

304
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,410
You're a Qi Patrol of the Inspection Bureau.

305
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:53,940
What?

306
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,700
Are you trying to cover up for a murderer?

307
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,540
I can't manage that much. Let's go.

308
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,000
Hold on.

309
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,030
I did kill Chen Boliang.

310
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,490
Take me away.

311
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,900
This has nothing to do with him.

312
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,380
Shut up!

313
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:08,720
Trust me.

314
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,150
Let's go home together.

315
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:11,770
Hanzheng.

316
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,320
Be rational.

317
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,800
I can't go back anymore.

318
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,150
Don't be implicated by me.

319
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,350
You haven't found Muyan yet.

320
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,690
You have things to do.

321
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,380
I don't care anymore.

322
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,450
Come with me.

323
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,160
How arrogant you are!

324
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,460
No matter how mighty you Qi people are,

325
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,700
you're no match for

326
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,700
the shining spears and heavy armors

327
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,940
in Jiuxiao City.

328
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,790
I don't want to implicate you.

329
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,710
I also don't want the Qian-Qi Six Treaties

330
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,370
to be suspended because of me.

331
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,170
All of this

332
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,900
is my choice.

333
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,690
I have no regrets anymore.

334
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,900
Keyuncha!

335
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,690
I killed Chen Boliang alone.

336
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,520
Three, two, one.

337
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:22,990
Open your eyes.

338
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,280
Look.

339
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,260
This is a pair of shoes I chose for you.

340
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,900
Does it look good?

341
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,430
Yes.

342
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,500
Yes.

343
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,490
Try it on.

344
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,490
From now on, you have to wear

345
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,290
the pair of shoes I chose for you.

346
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,140
I will.

347
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,380
I'll wear it till my death.

348
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,750
What's wrong...

349
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,950
with you?

350
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,800
Why did you kill my godfather?

351
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,490
Kill?

352
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,390
Is Hu dead?

353
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,720
Godfather!

354
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,080
Godfather, what's wrong?

355
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,360
Godfather, get up.

356
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,210
Godfather, get up.

357
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,390
Godfather.

358
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,350
Don't scare me, please.

359
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,710
Godfather!

360
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,450
Wake up, Godfather!

361
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,220
Wake up!

362
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,720
Please wake up!

363
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,260
Godfather!

364
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,460
Godfather!

365
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,570
Wake up, Godfather!

366
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,380
Why?

367
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,560
My godfather treated you so well.

368
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,700
Answer me.

369
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,830
Why did you kill my godfather?

370
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,710
How would I kill Hu?

371
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,910
Stop quibbling.

372
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,450
Answer me.

373
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,140
Why did you kill my godfather?

374
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,500
Just because you wanted to

375
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,620
save Keyuncha,

376
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,620
do you have to

377
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,420
sacrifice my godfather's life?

378
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,500
Jiu'er.

379
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,000
How was that possible?

380
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,590
Did I really

381
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,020
kill Uncle Hu by mistake?

382
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,620
You didn't see

383
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,320
how fierce that Qi was.

384
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,290
Senior Inspector Hu was trying to stop him from taking the murderer away.

385
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,290
Without a word,

386
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,610
he slapped Senior Inspector Hu far away.

387
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,630
I thought...

388
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,970
Are you sure

389
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
it's Hanzheng...

390
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,020
Is it Hanzheng

391
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,740
who knocked Senior Inspector Hu down?

392
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,710
Of course.

393
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,020
I saw it with my own eyes.

394
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,700
Senior Inspector Hu was lying on the ground

395
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,940
and couldn't get up.

396
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:30,970
I realized that

397
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,020
Senior Inspector Hu

398
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,790
couldn't stop him.

399
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,020
So I went to ask for backup.

400
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,380
I went straight to Dongyang Gate

401
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,830
and found Guard Commander Li.

402
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,530
I took Commander Li

403
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,530
back to the scene.

404
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,460
After that,

405
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,700
they saw it too.

406
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,710
When I kept my chin up and walked into the yard,

407
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,640
I didn't expect

408
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,090
Boss Chen to be dead.

409
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,860
Senior Inspector Hu was also lying on the ground.

410
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,660
His head was beside the table

411
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,500
and bled a lot.

412
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,360
When I checked his breathing,

413
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,440
I found he was dead.

414
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,140
After the analysis,

415
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,040
Hu was indeed hit

416
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,320
in the back of his head.

417
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,700
What he said

418
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,590
fits with the situation.

419
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,080
That Qi was so cruel.

420
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,840
I'm scared just thinking about it.

421
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,390
Enough.

422
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,150
Don't say anything unnecessary.

423
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,950
See if there's any problem with the testimony.

424
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,560
If there's no problem, sign it.

425
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
You can leave now.

426
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,190
It seems

427
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,190
Hanzheng did cause Hu...

428
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,800
But I believe

429
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
he didn't mean it.

430
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,720
You know Qi is strong.

431
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,500
He must not have expected it

432
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,550
to be like this.

433
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:50,840
Girl.

434
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
There's nothing.

435
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,990
I really can't find anything.

436
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,250
Hanzheng.

437
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,930
I am reluctant to believe it's you.

438
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,800
But I really can't find

439
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,960
any other evidence.

440
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,810
I don't know what to do.

441
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,620
Young Master Han.

442
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,090
Eat something.

443
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,820
Uncle Liu.

444
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,220
I want to see Jiu'er.

445
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,320
I have something to ask her.

446
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,200
Tell her

447
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,240
to see me.

448
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,200
Can you do that?

449
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,040
To be honest,

450
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,260
I don't even want to see you now.

451
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,560
not to mention Jiu'er.

452
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,260
Jiu'er.

453
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,300
Is that you?

454
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,130
I can recognize your scent.

455
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,670
Can you say something?

456
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,290
I did fight

457
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,110
with Uncle Hu.

458
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,630
But I stopped where it should have.

459
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,900
I couldn't and shouldn't

460
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,220
have hurt him.

461
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,750
I didn't want to believe it was you.

462
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,370
So I went back to that yard

463
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,010
and inspected the scene

464
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,910
thoroughly.

465
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:47,830
Except you,

466
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,910
Boss Chen's servant and coachman,

467
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,240
there is no trace

468
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,160
of others.

469
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,380
And the footprints of the servant

470
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,330
and the coachman

471
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,010
were far away from my godfather.

472
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,100
Also, they are

473
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,390
feeble people.

474
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,420
They couldn't

475
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,240
kill my godfather with a strike.

476
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,710
I really...

477
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,730
really wish I could find

478
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,130
another person's trace.

479
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,660
But I couldn't.

480
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,790
There was nothing there.

481
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,090
I really couldn't find anything.

482
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,150
Except you.

483
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,210
Could it really...

484
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,130
be me?

485
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,710
At that time,

486
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,250
perhaps you only

487
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,480
cared about Keyuncha

488
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,540
and had no time

489
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,830
to care about my godfather's situation.

490
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,520
Maybe

491
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,310
you didn't do it on purpose.

492
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,220
But...

493
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,930
But Hanzheng,

494
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,350
I really...

495
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,490
I really can't forgive you.

496
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,180
From now on,

497
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,060
we should

498
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,900
part ways

499
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,730
and break up our relationship.

500
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,110
Jun.

501
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,030
Jun.

502
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,810
Mother.

503
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,820
You're getting more and more unruly.

504
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:21,780
You don't even

505
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,270
greet me when you meet me.

506
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,060
It's not that I don't want to.

507
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,190
My legs are numb.

508
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,280
Are you okay?

509
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,620
I'm fine.

510
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,870
Your legs are numb,

511
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,630
but you stayed here all afternoon.

512
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,889
The fish should have been annoyed by you.

513
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,100
Mother.

514
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,670
I heard that

515
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,150
the fish only have a moment of memory.

516
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,389
Do you think they are boring

517
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,960
swimming in there?

518
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,290
Or don't they know

519
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,179
they are bored?

520
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,400
I don't know whether the fish are bored.

521
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,070
But I think you are quite bored.

522
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,900
You've been in my palace

523
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,930
for three days.

524
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,260
When will you

525
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,940
return to your residence?

526
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,820
You always blame me when I don't visit you.

527
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,080
Now that I'm here, you disfavor me too.

528
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,220
I'm not disfavoring you.

529
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,900
It's just that

530
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,740
even if you stay here all day,

531
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,600
you can't cure your illness.

532
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,590
I'm not sick.

533
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,820
What's wrong with me?

534
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,520
You cared neither for food nor drink

535
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,680
but daydreamed every day.

536
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,300
What disease could it be?

537
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,660
It's lovesickness.

538
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,360
If you're in a bad mood,

539
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,510
go out more often

540
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,620
and do things that make you happy.

541
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,450
Naturally,

542
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,320
your anxiety will be relieved.

543
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,750
Mother.

544
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,380
I feel

545
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,700
everything is boring.

546
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,640
I want to be with Mother

547
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,790
and Eldest Brother,

548
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,360
just like when I was young.

549
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,370
I'll feel much better with that.

550
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,670
I'll assign someone

551
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,060
to summon your brother

552
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,680
and ask him to have afternoon tea

553
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,370
with us.

554
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,780
By then, tell us

555
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,030
which girl

556
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,050
has charmed

557
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,370
our Prince Jun.

558
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,970
That's about it.

559
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,590
She is the little girl

560
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,550
who saved your born mother, right?

561
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,340
No wonder.

562
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,120
You've been obsessed with her since you were young.

563
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,730
You always wanted to leave the palace

564
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,990
and repay her and her mother's kindness.

565
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,210
I didn't expect that after so many years,

566
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,240
you had reunited under that circumstance.

567
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,500
It's indeed your fate.

568
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,350
What does she look like?

569
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:36,750
She...

570
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,050
has a small mouth,

571
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,320
big eyes,

572
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,030
and a small face.

573
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,800
Anyway, she has a pretty smile.

574
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,330
Is she as pretty as you said?

575
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,150
She's just an ordinary girl.

576
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,670
How is she ordinary?

577
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,130
Have you seen her before?

578
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,330
She's an Inspector of the Inspection Bureau.

579
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,660
We met each other before

580
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,790
because of a case.

581
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,050
A girl, being an Inspector,

582
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,860
must be an interesting person.

583
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,300
No wonder Jun is so obsessed.

584
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,760
He's always

585
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,430
interested in

586
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,860
weird people and things.

587
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,300
Mother, Eldest Brother.

588
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,720
I'm pouring out my heart to you.

589
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,620
But you...

590
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,560
are making fun of me.

591
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,340
Later, if I have any secrets,

592
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,780
I'll keep them to myself.

593
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,500
Fine.

594
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,330
I promise you.

595
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,510
Whether she's a daughter of an eminent family

596
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,930
or a daughter of a humble family,

597
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,610
I will support you.

598
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,380
But what's the use of liking her?

599
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,700
She doesn't like me.

600
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:37,640
Why don't you

601
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,450
put your hobbies aside

602
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,300
and do something serious?

603
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,100
For instance,

604
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,320
you may help me

605
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,870
to deal with government affairs

606
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,470
and share Father's burdens.

607
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,510
I don't think so.

608
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,220
Your father is such a womanizer.

609
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,960
He falls in love with every girl he meets.

610
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,880
While you two

611
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,450
are so dedicated.

612
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,240
The Crown Princess

613
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,270
has been gone for so many years.

614
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,450
When are you going to remarry?

615
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,060
We're talking about Jun.

616
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,860
Why did you suddenly involve me?

617
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,610
I'm just worried.

618
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,570
Jun is still young.

619
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,430
He's naughty and likes to be free.

620
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,160
Unlike you.

621
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,570
As the Crown Prince,

622
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,310
you are responsible for carrying on the ancestral line

623
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,750
of the royal family.

624
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,600
That's right, Eldest Brother.

625
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,460
Although I know

626
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,190
you and Sister-in-law had been very close,

627
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,760
she had been gone for many years.

628
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,440
Can't you stop thinking about her?

629
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,640
It's not that I can't.

630
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,230
But after having her,

631
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,470
I can't

632
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,460
fall in love with others anymore.

633
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,580
Rong was an angelic girl.

634
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,920
But she was ill-fated.

635
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,350
I got it.

636
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,140
What is it?

637
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,940
Compared to Eldest Brother,

638
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,980
I'm quite lucky.

639
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,520
Although the girl I have a crush on

640
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,550
doesn't like me,

641
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,900
I still can meet with her.

642
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,300
Right?

643
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,800
Small streams and rivers seem like nothing to someone who has seen the ocean.

644
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,380
I've met a girl

645
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,540
I favor so much.

646
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,310
How can I give up easily

647
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,170
and abandon myself to despair?

648
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,520
Sounds reasonable.

649
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,320
But something doesn't feel right.

650
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:15,760
Mother.

651
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,950
I've figured it out.

652
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,440
Even if she doesn't like me,

653
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,150
so what?

654
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,410
At least I can stay

655
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,470
by her side, right?

656
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,340
I can accompany her to have fun

657
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,300
and relieve her boredom.

658
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,020
I'm happy as long as she's happy.

659
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,340
Now I'm going back

660
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,670
to find Miss Jiu'er.

661
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,230
I'm leaving now.

662
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:32,370
Jun.

663
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,950
-Jun.
-I'm leaving.

664
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,800
Your Highness!

665
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,310
Something happened!

666
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,700
What happened?

667
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,650
Hu Badao is dead.

668
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:41,440
D...

669
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,380
Dead?

670
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,420
[Godfather, Hu Badao's memorial tablet]

671
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,380
Physician Qin, where's Jiu'er?

672
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,850
She said she wanted to buy another bottle of liquor for Hu.

673
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,490
Maybe

674
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,590
she doesn't want to witness the scene.

675
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,610
Silly Godfather.

676
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,050
He even forgot to take the flagon.

677
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,930
He'll come back for it.

678
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,410
Inspection Bureau

679
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,530
has a unique rule.

680
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,830
Owing it's a

681
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,670
very life-risky job,

682
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,440
so everyone writes

683
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,520
a last letter

684
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,590
on the first day in the office.

685
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,640
If

686
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,800
we die one day,

687
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,660
we can leave a message

688
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,860
for our beloved ones.

689
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,560
This box

690
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,760
hasn't been opened

691
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,710
for years.

692
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,160
I didn't expect...

693
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:37,900
Uncle Liu.

694
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,920
Read it when Jiu'er comes.

695
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,090
She must be listening somewhere else.

696
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,220
When her father left,

697
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,220
she was like this.

698
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:45,860
Read it.

699
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,210
When I first wrote my last letter,

700
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,720
I was 20 years old.

701
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,790
I thought the rule was ridiculous.

702
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,670
So I drew a big tortoise in the letter.

703
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,720
Until my best pal, Su Huan,

704
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,520
suddenly passed away,

705
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,190
I realized

706
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,740
that, in this world,

707
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,540
impermanence is a fact of life.

708
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,590
So I'll write a few sentences.

709
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,030
At this moment, I'm 40 years old.

710
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,870
I have no wife or children.

711
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,410
Maybe in ten years,

712
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,280
I'll also be alone.

713
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,580
But it's okay.

714
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,510
Because in my heart,

715
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,470
Jiu'er is my daughter.

716
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,910
Inspection Bureau is my home.

717
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,720
All the Inspectors

718
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,610
are my family.

719
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,180
Of course,

720
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,110
not everyone

721
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,500
is close to me.

722
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,100
For example, Yan Kuan and Yue Daren.

723
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,050
You know well in your hearts.

724
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,290
But as a family,

725
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,760
we have some close

726
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,830
and some not so close.

727
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,220
We're still a family.

728
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:54,900
You...

729
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:56,460
Nonsense.

730
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,390
You cheated.

731
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:58,820
You are lost.

732
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,850
Are you not admitting it?

733
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:00,900
When I was young,

734
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,750
I devoted myself to achieving great missions

735
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,180
and solving high-profile cases.

736
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,890
I wanted to become a hero

737
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,300
who cut off evildoers for the people.

738
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,590
Now,

739
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,220
I understand it completely.

740
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:12,560
I'm different from Su Huan.

741
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,790
I'm not

742
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,100
a capable Inspector.

743
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,100
Only so-so.

744
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,260
Top 3 in the state.

745
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,810
But I'm not upset at all.

746
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,470
Regardless of

747
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,860
the abilities,

748
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,750
as the person is a responsible Inspector

749
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,950
who protects the world

750
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,330
and fulfills his duty, that'll be enough.

751
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,030
I'm a loner

752
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,720
in my life.

753
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,660
Not much money I left behind.

754
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,950
But there are aged liquors

755
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,430
hidden in the yard.

756
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,830
If I die one day,

757
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,510
my family from the Inspection Bureau

758
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,770
should bid me farewell

759
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:49,710
with those liquors.
