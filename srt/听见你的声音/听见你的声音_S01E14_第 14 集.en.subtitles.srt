1
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,162
Father, please tell me it's not true.

2
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,336
Just like me!

3
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:40,106
You must think
your father was a good person.

4
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,145
She'll resent me more
if she finds out about this.

5
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,247
What about your memory? Not yet?

6
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,049
Not yet.

7
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,184
If your memory returns,
you have to do as you promised.

8
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,019
You can never come looking for me again.

9
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,722
Su-ha, don't pretend to be an adult.

10
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,157
Try acting like a real adult.

11
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,059
What are you thinking?

12
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,727
I want to ask you to stay by my side.

13
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,328
If I tell her the truth...

14
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,430
Did you get your memory back?

15
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,731
will she look at me like this?

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,803
I guess he has no reason to lie to me.

17
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,404
He wouldn't do that.

18
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,219
I...

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,589
know who Hwang Dal-jung's daughter is.

20
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,991
Really? Who is it?

21
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,526
Seo Do-yeon.

22
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:40,867
How did you know this?

23
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,236
I saw Judge Seo Dae-seok

24
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,105
when I went to the Prosecutors' Office.

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,041
And...

26
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,243
I saw his eyes.

27
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,545
"Saw his eyes"?

28
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,382
Do you mean...

29
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,184
The ability has returned.

30
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,523
And my memory, too.

31
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,727
Since when?

32
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,898
When the appeal was withdrawn.

33
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,467
My gosh.

34
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,303
So he knows how I feel?

35
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,707
So he knew this whole time,
but pretended not to know?

36
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,538
This is a great house.

37
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:53,006
It has a great view, too.

38
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,474
Su-ha.

39
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,513
Shall we not move abroad,
and just live here together?

40
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,882
Yes, I want that.

41
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:08,054
He is like a winning lotto ticket
that continuously pays out.

42
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,256
The insurance payout was huge.

43
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,825
What else could there be?

44
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,496
There is a lot more. The lawyer told me.

45
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:20,600
There's the severance pay
that Dad got from his work.

46
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,502
He has a pension and some stock, too.

47
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,438
What is this? How did he know?

48
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,706
Is he a monster?

49
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,875
I'm not a monster.

50
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,680
How... How did you...

51
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,981
It's true!

52
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,749
He's reading my mind.

53
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,851
He's a real monster.

54
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,656
-Uncle.
-Don't come near me. Don't.

55
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,227
Uncle!

56
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,698
Uncle!

57
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,868
Please open the door, Uncle!

58
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,004
I'm not a monster!

59
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,308
Please open the door, Uncle!

60
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,077
I couldn't hate my uncle.

61
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,646
It was so natural.

62
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,618
Seeing his innermost thoughts
he didn't want others to discover.

63
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,953
I must've seemed
like such a monster to him.

64
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,032
Delivering the truth is always

65
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,034
painful.

66
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,385
Are you okay?

67
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:20,953
Your arm seems to be broken.

68
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,756
It's bearable.

69
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,592
Did Min Jun-guk tell you where he's going?

70
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,962
No. I lost consciousness,
so I don't remember that.

71
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,567
Wasn't Min Jun-guk's target
Jang Hye-seong and Park Su-ha?

72
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:35,768
I know.

73
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,639
Why did he suddenly go see you, Mr. Cha?

74
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,842
He said he came to tell me something.

75
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,345
What did he say?

76
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,521
Don't worry. I won't kill you.

77
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,223
After all,

78
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:01,427
You were the only person in the world
who was on my side.

79
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,096
Not anymore.

80
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,498
It doesn't matter now...

81
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,535
whether you're on my side or not.

82
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,337
Why?

83
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,905
Why did you come to me?

84
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:17,643
I felt...

85
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,782
there needed to be at least one person
who knew my story.

86
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:26,953
Because...

87
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,423
I am going to take this to the end.

88
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,191
What are you thinking?

89
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,094
What end?

90
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,898
I didn't come to talk about the end.

91
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:43,469
I came to tell you about my beginning.

92
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,706
They were like his last words.

93
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,611
I think Min Jun-guk is going
to take this all the way to the end.

94
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,014
"To the end"? What does that mean?

95
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:00,787
Doesn't it mean he's going to kill
Ms. Jang and Park Su-ha?

96
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,475
WHITE SOCKS

97
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,711
Yes, Mr. Cha.

98
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,647
Are you with Ms. Jjang?

99
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,517
Yes. Why?

100
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,653
She has a trial this morning.

101
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,155
Will you walk her to court?

102
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,591
Yes, I will. Why?

103
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,026
I'm just worried.

104
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,495
Min Jun-guk is in Yeonju

105
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,497
and I feel uneasy.

106
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,033
Please take care of Ms. Jjang.

107
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:48,601
And be careful yourself.

108
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,736
Yes, I will.

109
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,749
I prepared breakfast. Come on out and eat.

110
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,918
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

111
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,254
I know I can't make any excuses.

112
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,256
From now on,

113
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,392
I will never look you in the eye.

114
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,801
You can just use my eyes for your trials.

115
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,036
If you...

116
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,909
If you don't want that either,

117
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,478
and don't want to see me again,

118
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,714
then do that.

119
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,251
But, until Min Jun-guk is caught,

120
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,552
let me stay by your side

121
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,221
It's too dangerous
for you to be alone right now.

122
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,726
I'll wait outside. Come out after you eat.

123
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,656
Is there anything else
you haven't told me?

124
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:53,326
Is that all you lied about?

125
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,794
What?

126
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,364
Your father

127
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,970
killed my wife with his cunning tongue.

128
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,742
I'm not the one who started all of this!

129
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,312
It was your father!

130
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,083
There's nothing else.

131
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:01,087
I'm here.

132
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,421
You can go.

133
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,593
Text me when you're done.
I will come pick you up.

134
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:09,829
Okay.

135
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,825
I didn't look. I mean it.

136
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,199
I like you, Su-ha.

137
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:52,972
As a younger person, as a friend and...

138
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:57,777
as a man.

139
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:07,553
After I started liking you,
your ability scares me. I don't like it.

140
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,056
I have more thoughts
I don't want you to see.

141
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,628
I think I'll resent you
whenever you catch me in those moments.

142
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:20,132
And I hate to think
my resentment will hurt you.

143
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,639
There are so many other reasons
why we can't be together.

144
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,841
So I think we should end things
at some point.

145
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:29,975
But...

146
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,477
But I still like you.

147
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,114
A lot.

148
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:42,488
So let's not waste this time
thinking of how it will end.

149
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,925
Let's see each other's faces
and laugh when we want to,

150
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,195
and be honest with each other.

151
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,429
Okay?

152
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:53,599
Okay.

153
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:56,569
You should go.

154
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,758
What are you doing?

155
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,495
Thank you. Thank you so much.

156
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,091
What did I just do?

157
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,329
Can I do this?

158
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,572
How are you feeling?

159
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,241
It's bearable.

160
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,345
Do you remember Jang Hye-seong,
the lawyer?

161
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,350
I'm thinking of doing a jury trial
with her.

162
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,718
What do you think?

163
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,054
I like that.

164
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,893
What is it that you want?

165
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,396
What do you want out of the trial?

166
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,598
An apology.

167
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,735
I don't care who it's from.

168
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,338
But I spent the last 26 years in prison.

169
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,642
I want an apology.

170
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,514
To do that, we must prove
that the victim, Son Chae-ok,

171
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,117
is Jeon Young-ja, your real wife.

172
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,419
So prove it.

173
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,056
I remember her face very clearly.

174
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,060
That can't be used as evidence.

175
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,564
We need objective evidence
that you were a married couple.

176
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:12,438
So, Ms. Jjang and I are
looking for your daughter.

177
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:13,772
What?

178
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,040
Ga-yeon?

179
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,545
If we find her and do a DNA test,

180
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,814
that will prove that you two were married.

181
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,248
You're right.

182
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,686
We're trying our best,
but it's quite difficult.

183
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,689
She was adopted such a long time ago

184
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,324
that we can't find records.

185
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,494
I really wonder...

186
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,129
where she is.

187
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,037
Why are you doing this again?

188
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,439
The case has been reassigned
and it's been approved already.

189
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,308
It's not that I want the case back.

190
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,444
The Hwang Dal-jung case is
going to be a jury trial.

191
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,615
Since you need two prosecutors,
I want to be the other one.

192
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:57,783
Hey.

193
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,286
Why do you want that case so much?

194
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,356
Why do you want to take it away
from me so much?

195
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,624
Well, that's...

196
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,695
It's such a horrible case.

197
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,797
It doesn't make sense.

198
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,501
I've done mutilation
and serial murder cases, too.

199
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,202
Give me a reason that I can accept.

200
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,305
What did my father do to you
that you're doing this?

201
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,343
Hey, am I chopped liver? Why do you think
I would be affected by him?

202
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,880
If not, let me be on that case.

203
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,016
I can't believe this.

204
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:34,953
I have a call.

205
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,457
Hello?

206
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,559
It's you.

207
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,827
It's me.

208
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,430
About the woman attacked
by Hwang Dal-jung.

209
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,532
Where is she hospitalized?

210
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:47,866
Oh, her.

211
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,103
I wonder where that is.

212
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,609
I will find out
and contact you right away.

213
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,844
All right.

214
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,115
They requested a jury trial
for the Hwang Dal-jung case again.

215
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,817
I know.

216
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,519
Why is Mr. Shin doing this?

217
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,688
It's a sickness
to make things complicated.

218
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,024
He probably picked it up from Ms. Jjang.

219
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,359
I know. So...

220
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,365
I guess he made a decision
that's favorable to the defendant.

221
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,970
Naturally, if I were a lawyer,

222
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,774
that's the right decision to be made.

223
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:30,442
How can you say that?

224
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,882
Is Ms. Jjang behind me?

225
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,657
Hello, Ms. Jjang.

226
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,798
I have a question for you, Judge Kim.

227
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,466
Sure, go ahead.

228
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,437
Let's assume you were the judge

229
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,572
who found Su-ha guilty

230
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,408
for murdering Min Jun-guk.

231
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,278
Why do we have
to make such a horrible assumption?

232
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,314
But what if Min Jun-guk,
who was thought to be dead,

233
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,617
turned up alive before you.

234
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:15,621
Why are you doing this?
Why are you making scary stories?

235
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,790
What would you do?

236
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,726
What?

237
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,961
Obviously, I would inform the prosecutor
and public defender

238
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,564
that Min Jun-guk is alive.

239
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,634
And tell them to have a retrial.

240
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,604
Right? A person should admit
he is wrong and make things right.

241
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,306
Of course.

242
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,411
But what if a judge knew about it,

243
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,214
but still didn't make things right?

244
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,783
What could we charge the judge with?

245
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,986
I don't know.

246
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,722
I don't think there are
any charges to make.

247
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,326
Really?
Even though he ruined a man's life?

248
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,094
No, there isn't.

249
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,463
We could criticize his morals.

250
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,333
But there's no legal recourse.

251
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,470
But if it were me,
I would make things right.

252
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,873
A person should do that.

253
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,744
I'm not saying that you did it!

254
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,455
How can this be?

255
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:27,726
Seo Dae-seok ruined a man's life,
but he can't be held responsible?

256
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,231
Is there anything
we can get out of this trial then?

257
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,801
If we prove that Hwang Dal-jung
is Do-yeon's birth father,

258
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,737
I would only end up feeling sorry
for Do-yeon who had no clue.

259
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,239
Look at me.

260
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,541
Did I just worry about Do-yeon?

261
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,677
Oh my gosh. Worry about yourself.

262
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,446
Are you done?

263
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,349
What are you doing here?
What about classes?

264
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,652
I came because it's break time.

265
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,120
Are you going back to the office?

266
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,688
Let's go. I'll walk you.

267
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,858
It's right here. You don't have to.

268
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:01,860
Hold on.

269
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,264
Here.

270
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,067
This is my phone.

271
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,570
Yes. I got it from the prosecution.

272
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,605
It's broken, but I still got it back.

273
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,540
Thanks.

274
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,244
-Let's go.
-Hey.

275
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,681
Here you are.

276
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,283
Ms. Jang.

277
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,052
Yes, Detective Kang.

278
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,055
Did you hear about Mr. Cha?

279
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,790
What? About what?

280
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,661
Last night,
Mr. Cha was attacked by Min Jun-guk.

281
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:37,863
What?

282
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,931
Why did he go to see Mr. Cha?

283
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,301
He wanted to talk to Mr. Cha.

284
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,870
He left his last words it seems.

285
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,973
It looks as if Min Jun-guk is going
to take this all the way.

286
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,510
We are going to protect you closely.

287
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,246
We're going to stake out
by your house and work place.

288
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,547
Don't worry too much.

289
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,183
If you see anything suspicious,
please call us right away.

290
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,218
Yes.

291
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,921
Is Mr. Cha okay? How bad is he hurt?

292
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,757
He broke his arm
and hurt his head a little.

293
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:06,992
What?

294
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,832
"Get well soon, Bone!"

295
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,436
I can't believe this.

296
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:21,239
At your age, bones don't heal that easily.
It's so unfair.

297
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,409
Thank you so much for consoling me.

298
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,678
It's nothing. I'm the best, right?

299
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,048
What is the new public defender like?

300
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,149
Mr. Eom?

301
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:32,984
He is really something.

302
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,487
He comes early
and goes to the scenes himself.

303
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,689
He does all the filing
for the compensation paperwork himself.

304
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,059
There are 133 victims
in the pyramid scheme case.

305
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,428
And he says he's going to be the custodian
for all of their money!

306
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,463
No way!

307
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,467
No way. How can a lawyer handle
the deposits for 133 people himself?

308
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,369
I know. Isn't it amazing?

309
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,039
He only stays at his desk
about 10 minutes a day.

310
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,941
I see.

311
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:59,644
No wonder I didn't get the job
and got second place.

312
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,016
Hey.

313
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,452
What happened, Mr. Cha?

314
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,254
I heard Min Jun-guk went to you.

315
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,423
Hello. Hey.

316
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,158
How did you get hurt?

317
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,693
Are you hurt badly?

318
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,830
I didn't get hurt much.
I got hurt trying to catch him.

319
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,533
The reward on Min Jun-guk is huge.

320
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,369
Why did he go see you?

321
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:28,974
He said he had something to talk about.

322
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,076
But I didn't listen to him
because we were fighting.

323
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:36,314
I bet neither of them know
about Min Jun-guk and Su-ha's father.

324
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,852
In any case,
the police are really worked up right now.

325
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,088
They're going to distribute posters
and intensify their search,

326
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,723
so they'll definitely catch him this time.

327
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,933
Hwang Dal-jung doesn't want
a not-guilty verdict.

328
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,803
He wants an apology for the verdict
from 26 years ago.

329
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:01,773
To do that, we have to prove
that the victim

330
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,976
is the wife
who was supposedly murdered 26 years ago.

331
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,649
Min Jun-guk is in Yeonju.

332
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,217
What?

333
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,221
Last night,
Mr. Cha was attacked by Min Jun-guk.

334
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,325
So we need to check the DNA

335
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,895
of Hwang Dal-jung, his wife and daughter.

336
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,398
This is the hardest part.

337
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,902
One moment please.

338
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,838
I need to go in there for a moment.

339
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,272
Okay, sure.

340
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,180
Hey, Yu-chang. What's up with Ms. Jjang?

341
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,850
Cover your ears.
If not, you'll be in for a shock.

342
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:45,917
What?

343
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,053
Min Jun-guk!

344
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:52,557
You are not even human!
You're the child of a dog!

345
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,726
Min Jun-guk, you jerk!

346
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,428
I'm not scared of you anymore!

347
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,731
You don't scare me!
Get the eff out of here!

348
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,068
Why is she doing that?

349
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,136
She does that sometimes.

350
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,939
CONSULTATION ROOM

351
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,718
Did I do anything wrong to you?

352
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,920
Tell me if I did.

353
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:23,989
Sure. I will.

354
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,258
Let's get started. Where were you?

355
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,160
I talked about DNA testing.

356
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,630
But we haven't found the daughter yet.

357
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,499
Mr. Shin,

358
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,770
let's pretend we found the daughter.

359
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,639
And let's pretend

360
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:45,243
she thinks her parents
are her birth parents.

361
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:49,447
What if she believes
her family is part of her pedigree?

362
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,250
Should we still tell her?

363
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,119
Of course...

364
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,388
we should.

365
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,358
Of course. Her birth father is looking
for her frantically.

366
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,595
You're speaking
from Hwang Dal-jung's perspective.

367
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,031
Shouldn't we think
about the daughter's perspective?

368
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,439
I'm not sure that just to free someone
of his regrets,

369
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:18,610
we should shake up the life of someone
who is completely unaware.

370
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,445
I am torn about it.

371
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,015
Mr. Yang.

372
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,351
Please get the Hwang Dal-jung files.

373
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,120
Wasn't it reassigned to Mr. Cho?

374
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,589
It's a jury trial.

375
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,625
I got the second prosecutor spot.

376
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,296
You did it after all. I will go get them.

377
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:48,039
Jeon Young-ja's airway
and throat are both damaged.

378
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,908
And now she has pneumonia.

379
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,411
And septicemia has now kicked in.

380
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,717
When will she wake up?

381
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,119
I can't say that she will.

382
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,688
You should prepare for the worst.

383
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,309
Father?

384
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,745
Who? Your father?

385
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,215
Maybe it's not.

386
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:33,084
Why would he come here? Is he sick?

387
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,786
No.

388
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,056
I guess I was mistaken.

389
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,259
Is Son Chae-ok even awake?

390
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:42,827
Maybe we shouldn't have come.

391
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:46,231
Still. We should check
what state she's in.

392
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,406
Did you come to pick Ms. Jjang up?

393
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,708
-Yes.
-Why did you come here then?

394
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,510
I came to ask you something.

395
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,047
What is it?

396
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,287
What did Min Jun-guk tell you?

397
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,324
He didn't say anything.

398
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,762
Did Su-ha get his memory back?

399
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,565
Does he know about his father?

400
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,701
I got my memory back.

401
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,769
So please tell me the truth.

402
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,039
Did Min Jun-guk talk about my father?

403
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:30,875
What?

404
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:32,711
Yes.

405
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,179
How much does he know?

406
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:38,383
Does he know that his father caused
Min Jun-guk's wife to die?

407
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,856
How much do you know?

408
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:46,758
I know everything.

409
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,262
Min Jun-guk told me
at the fishing place a year ago.

410
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,365
What will I do if he tells her?

411
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,535
Should I beg him not to tell her?

412
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,155
Did you tell Ms. Jjang, too?

413
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,225
No, not yet.

414
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:24,229
I think he's going to tell her.

415
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,632
Don't tell her. Not even in the future.

416
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,704
I don't think Ms. Jjang
will treat you differently if she knew.

417
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,072
She's not such a person.

418
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,674
But, I don't think it's something
that she would want to know.

419
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,443
And she doesn't have to.

420
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,480
There are some truths
that don't have to be revealed.

421
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:43,748
Okay?

422
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,552
Min Jun-guk started this.

423
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:48,887
Not your father.

424
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,156
I should go.

425
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,124
Okay.

426
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,359
Park Su-ha!

427
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,562
Don't blame yourself needlessly.

428
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,966
Stop it. It's getting irritating.

429
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,280
What's wrong with him?
I was just giving him advice.

430
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,418
Hello?

431
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,421
Mr. Choi! It's been a long time.

432
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,958
How is Mae-ri?

433
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,429
Dinner?

434
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:59,023
Why does he keep making me
out to be so childish and pathetic?

435
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:00,391
It's so miserable.

436
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:34,692
As soon as
Hwang Dal-jung was released on parole,

437
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,628
he ran into his wife whom he had killed.

438
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,931
No, whom he thought
he had killed 26 years ago.

439
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,099
Your Honor,

440
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:44,936
defense counsel is speculating
and distorting the truth.

441
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:49,807
Currently, the victim's registered name
is not Jeon Young-ja, but Son Chae-ok.

442
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,776
She changed her identity.

443
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,112
She cut off her hand 26 years ago,

444
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:56,814
pretended to be dead,
and lived under another name.

445
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,583
If you look at the security video,

446
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,387
Jeon Young-ja was frightened
when she realized who my client was.

447
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,658
That's because he is the husband
that she sent to prison 26 years ago.

448
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,026
Your Honor.

449
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,763
A man aggressively approached
a woman who was alone at night.

450
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,565
Any woman would be scared!

451
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,401
The victim's left hand is missing.

452
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:17,702
Twenty-six years ago,

453
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,438
only the left hand of the wife
who was supposedly murdered turned up.

454
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:21,906
Is this a coincidence?

455
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:26,444
They are only speculating
that Son Chae-ok is Jeon Young-ja!

456
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,515
They should provide hard evidence
such as DNA or fingerprints.

457
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,317
Prosecution wins!

458
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,018
Are you happy that you won?

459
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,154
No.

460
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,424
I think we're going to need
Hwang Dal-jung's daughter.

461
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:40,591
Without a DNA test,

462
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:44,963
it'll be hard to prove
that the victim is Mr. Hwang's wife.

463
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,066
Ms. Jjang, by chance...

464
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,902
have you found that daughter?

465
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,607
No, not yet. Why?

466
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,978
If you've found her,

467
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:04,248
and are hesitating whether to tell her...

468
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,284
It's not like that.

469
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,023
When you're debating about
how to say something,

470
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,092
it's best to tell the truth.

471
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,362
I think that is right.

472
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,843
I can't believe I have to eat so sloppily.

473
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,345
Why did you have to ask to eat now?

474
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,148
I know. Looking at you,

475
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,919
I'm not sure
if my law firm should recruit you.

476
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,556
"Recruit"? What do you mean?

477
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,059
Our firm's criminal law side
is a little weak.

478
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,795
So we were looking for a lawyer,

479
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,130
and decided on you.

480
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:56,100
Judge Kim Bong-soo recommended you.

481
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,301
Judge Kim did?

482
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,604
What a surprise.

483
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,005
He must like you.

484
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,774
Anyway, that's that.

485
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,409
So what do you think?

486
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,578
I heard you didn't
get the public defender job.

487
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,981
Hey!

488
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,384
I was in second place
and it was a close competition.

489
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,720
Okay. You're so high and mighty.

490
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:19,524
A law firm would have
a better work environment.

491
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,260
And our firm does

492
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,163
a lot of pro bono work, too,
that you like so much.

493
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:26,998
What do you think?

494
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,167
I think it's a pretty good offer.

495
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,774
Get in. It's raining. I'll drop you off.

496
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,410
It's okay. I'll walk off the alcohol.

497
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,913
Okay. Call me when you decide.

498
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,085
Oh, Mae-ri?

499
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,321
I'm going now.

500
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,324
I didn't drink.

501
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,467
He's under his wife's thumb.

502
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:18,416
I should tell Do-yeon the truth
for Hwang Dal-jung's sake.

503
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:20,685
But it's too cruel.

504
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,421
Or shall I meet Seo Dae-seok?

505
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,958
Shall I tell him to testify in court
about what he did?

506
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,994
But he would never do that.

507
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,063
It hurts.

508
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,198
Didn't you meet Seo Do-yeon yet?

509
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:35,500
No.

510
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:36,400
Why?

511
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,036
How can I tell her this?

512
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,273
"Your father put your birth father
in jail for nothing.

513
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,875
And for 26 years at that."

514
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,913
If I tell her, she's going to go crazy
given her personality.

515
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,381
So will her mom.

516
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,116
Do you know what's funnier?

517
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,753
Even if I reveal everything,
we can't punish Seo Dae-seok legally.

518
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,821
How can that be?

519
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,223
We won't get anything out of it.

520
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:00,958
I see.

521
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,761
But Mr. Shin wants me to tell her.

522
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,963
He said when you're confused about
what to say,

523
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,099
say the truth.

524
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,002
Do you agree?

525
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,337
Should we tell the truth,

526
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,239
when you know it will hurt everyone?

527
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,612
There are some truths
that don't have to be revealed.

528
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,914
Okay?

529
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,119
No. Don't tell her.

530
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,589
Really? Don't tell her?

531
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,591
Yes.

532
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,460
Just let it pass.
If that's the best for everyone.

533
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:40,631
This is so not like you.

534
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,068
What?

535
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,237
You always insisted
on revealing the truth.

536
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:49,674
Don't you remember? For Seong-bin's case
and the twin's case as well.

537
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:52,376
You made me reveal the truth.

538
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:53,945
Very persistently, too.

539
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,346
Did I do that?

540
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:59,517
Yes, you said that
the truth will win in court.

541
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,152
And you called me the worst.

542
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:04,322
Wow. I am such a gracious person.

543
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,023
How could I let you say that to me?

544
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,292
It's impossible for most people.

545
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,529
You said your character surpasses most.

546
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:12,730
That's right.

547
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,100
So you don't want me to tell her, right?

548
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:22,840
If you say so,
that must be the right thing.

549
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,014
But why does it feel
as though I wiped my rear

550
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,149
with dirty toilet paper?

551
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:37,782
Of course.

552
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,885
I'm buying today.
Order everything you want.

553
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,019
Really?

554
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,791
I want soup.

555
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,392
Did you drink a lot yesterday?

556
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,795
Perhaps.

557
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,002
-Please excuse me.
-Okay.

558
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:10,014
Why did you stare at me?
Do you want to say something?

559
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,316
I didn't stare at you.

560
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:17,188
Did you hear that I'm going to be
on the Hwang Dal-jung case?

561
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,292
Didn't the case get reassigned?

562
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,561
I'm back on it.

563
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,797
I heard you're making
interesting arguments.

564
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,667
"He killed a ghost, not a person."

565
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:31,736
It's very original.

566
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,539
Stay off this case.

567
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,108
What?

568
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,845
Who are you to say that?

569
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:44,215
Don't take it the wrong way.
I am giving sincere advice.

570
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,219
Why is everyone doing this?

571
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,788
The chief, my father and you, too.

572
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,291
Why is everyone so sensitive about me
and Hwang Dal-jung?

573
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,028
Tell me. What's the reason?

574
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,530
Do you know something?

575
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:02,600
No, I don't.

576
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,103
I just don't want to go up against you.

577
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,339
I should go.

578
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,445
What's wrong with her?

579
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,650
I'm back.

580
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,420
Mr. Shin just fell asleep.

581
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,156
Why? Did he stay up all night again?

582
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,527
Yes, he was going through precedent
and applying it to Hwang Dal-jung's case.

583
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,862
He's even looking into precedent
from foreign jurisdictions.

584
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,166
Where's Mr. Eom?

585
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,967
He went to interview someone.

586
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,371
He is working so hard.

587
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:44,175
Come to think of it, I don't think
I've seen his face since he started.

588
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,811
What is he like? I heard he's amazing.

589
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,514
I heard he's from a good family
and very handsome, too.

590
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,284
I don't know.

591
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:57,955
I'm back!

592
00:40:58,522 --> 00:40:59,924
My gosh.

593
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,095
Is your nose bleeding?

594
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:08,265
Yes, I was up all night
writing up argument summaries,

595
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:09,633
and might have overdone it.

596
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,239
Are you Ms. Jang?

597
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:18,809
We finally meet.

598
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,778
Nice to meet you.

599
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,213
I am Eom Gi-jun.

600
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,582
You're quite beautiful.

601
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,450
-Thanks.
-Yes.

602
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,189
He's the total package.

603
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:37,361
Mr. Eom, aren't you working too hard?

604
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,497
You'll wear yourself out.

605
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:44,001
No, it's all for the clients
and it doesn't tire me at all.

606
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,303
It actually gives me more energy.

607
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,371
Let's go!

608
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:48,572
Let's go!

609
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,810
That's right.
Yu-chang, here are my receipts.

610
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:57,815
These are for getting the deposits
for 133 people.

611
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,885
And these are taxi fares
from when I went to interviews.

612
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,821
And these are for my computer
and supplies.

613
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,990
And this is...

614
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,791
What is all this?

615
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,060
Why are you giving me this?
What should I do?

616
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,162
What do you mean? Process them for me.

617
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,131
These can't be processed.

618
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,868
How can that be?
I used it for the clients.

619
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,270
I still can't do it.

620
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:23,007
Mr. Shin, these can't be processed, right?

621
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,909
No, those can't.

622
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,812
This doesn't make sense.

623
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:32,650
I spent over 1,000,000 won
getting all these deposits.

624
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,452
And I spent over 300,000 won in taxi fare.

625
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,555
Are you saying I should pay it all
out of my salary?

626
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,057
Of course. That's not all.

627
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,294
We have to pay for Yu-chang's salary, too.

628
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,628
Why?

629
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,897
Why should we pay his salary?

630
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,166
It's all included in our salaries.

631
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,136
We have to pay for copies, too.

632
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,572
And we have to buy our own supplies.

633
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,206
We have to pay insurance, too.

634
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,044
Do you think that this makes sense?

635
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,448
If we use this out of our salaries,
what will we have left?

636
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,417
Isn't this too depressing?

637
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,954
You said you don't tire at all
when you think of the clients.

638
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,490
That's when there's the premise
of being paid for what I do.

639
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,993
This is unfair exploitation of labor.

640
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,895
We should report this
to the Ministry of Labor.

641
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:21,732
I cannot defend people
under such circumstances.

642
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:23,400
Shoot.

643
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,370
My money!

644
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,348
Mr. Cha!

645
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:40,684
Hello, Mr. Shin.

646
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,120
Good to see you.
Did you clear out your office?

647
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,023
Yes, but why did Mr. Eom quit his job?

648
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,758
I heard that he was very passionate.

649
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,793
He was too passionate
and ran out of energy.

650
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:52,563
Where's Ms. Jjang?

651
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,231
She's in the office.

652
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,532
You should go in.

653
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,034
Okay.

654
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,806
-Hello.
-Hi.

655
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,609
I heard you were second place
in the interviews.

656
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,111
So it must be true.

657
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:08,779
Of course it's true.

658
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,682
Let's work well together,
Ms. Jang Hye-seong.

659
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:16,820
I'm glad you came.

660
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,459
I guess you had nowhere else to go
but here.

661
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,462
You must have lied
about having good grades.

662
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,231
I guess so.

663
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,172
Park Su-ha.

664
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:36,573
Su-ha!

665
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,679
You're always together these days.
What's up?

666
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,814
We're going to register
for night classes here.

667
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:45,516
You? Study?

668
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:49,386
You might not remember,
but we three used to have good grades.

669
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:52,289
After exams, you would come to me
and compare answers.

670
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,792
I haven't been studying much these days.

671
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,227
But I should find my way now.

672
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,764
Guys.

673
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:03,901
All my memories came back.

674
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,437
-Really?
-Yes.

675
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,938
Everything?

676
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,139
Yes.

677
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,809
I told you we shouldn't lie.

678
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:15,379
I shouldn't have worn the glasses.
This is so embarrassing.

679
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:16,914
I'm not doing this!

680
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,351
This is good. This is really good.

681
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:25,422
If you got your memory back,
you must know my grades were bad.

682
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:26,924
Yes.

683
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,093
I'm still going to register here.

684
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,527
You're going to the police academy.

685
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:33,564
I should go to college to be
on the same level as you.

686
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,034
What if he says I'm just being a burden?

687
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,036
What if he tells me not to?

688
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:42,306
You can register on the second floor.

689
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,075
Okay. To the second floor.

690
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,014
There she goes again.

691
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:56,386
Why does he let her continue
if he doesn't have feelings for her?

692
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,525
What are you looking at?
Do you have something to say?

693
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:05,028
Poor little orphan.

694
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,731
I was nice to him because I felt bad.
What a waste.

695
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,536
It's nothing. I'm going inside.

696
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:24,047
My salary just leaks out of my account.

697
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:26,884
I'm sorry.

698
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,886
I don't know what to say.

699
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:33,023
I didn't know
Mr. Cha would change his mind so easily.

700
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,759
-Mr. Cha?
-How can you say that?

701
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,829
How can he think lightly of your law firm?

702
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,533
It's the first time he got recruited
and didn't know what to do.

703
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,369
If it were me,
I would've gone to your firm obviously.

704
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,171
Recruited?

705
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,907
It's because he's still very green.

706
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,610
I'm not saying your law firm is tarnished.

707
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,913
Why are you distorting what I said?

708
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,080
Hello?

709
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,482
What's with Mr. Cha?

710
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,251
Why did he lie to me?

711
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,107
Hey. Ms. Jjang.

712
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,079
Thank you.

713
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:31,615
Where are you going?

714
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,350
I'm going to trial right after lunch.

715
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,018
Why are you going alone?

716
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,422
I can only eat sandwiches or hotdogs
with this arm.

717
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:39,823
The others don't like them.

718
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,894
Then, do you want to go to lunch with me?

719
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:47,631
I would like that.

720
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,470
What would you like?

721
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:54,771
An omelet roll.

722
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,812
-Why did you lie?
-About what?

723
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,847
I heard you got an offer from a law firm.

724
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:07,084
-I heard the conditions were good.
-How did you know that?

725
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,119
I found out.

726
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:12,289
I told you before.
Being a public defender was my dream.

727
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,424
Dream comes before conditions.

728
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:16,593
Bean sprouts.

729
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:20,163
Mr. Cha.

730
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,634
If you decided to come here because of me,

731
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,536
-it's a little...
-Ms. Jjang.

732
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:30,140
I do like you,
but I wouldn't base my decision on that.

733
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:33,644
I see. Really?

734
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,284
Didn't you have any conflicts
when you were deciding?

735
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:45,689
No, I decide on the one-percent
I have more confidence in.

736
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,224
Pickles.

737
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,828
But they gave you a really good offer.

738
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,263
Don't you regret it?

739
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,365
That's why the one percent is important.

740
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,535
If I decided the other way, I would regret
it one percent more than now.

741
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,508
The one percent is important.

742
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,414
Thank you, Mr. Cha.

743
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:12,816
For what?

744
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,285
For everything.

745
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,460
Like Mr. Cha,

746
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:26,663
I always decided on whichever felt
one percent more correct.

747
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,866
And I always regretted those decisions.

748
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,771
I still regret having opened
the court door that day.

749
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:39,209
If hadn't opened that door,
this tragedy wouldn't have started.

750
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,311
However...

751
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:46,616
Do you know how much I regret that moment?

752
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,157
I should have gone back to testify.

753
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,361
I still regret it.

754
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,296
All the time, even now.

755
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,303
This is the first time I'm thinking this.

756
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,406
If I had decided the other way,

757
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,441
maybe I'd be regretting it more.

758
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:13,977
About one percent more.

759
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,259
Mr. Shin, I've made up my mind.

760
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,895
-Decide what?
-I'll reveal everything.

761
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,765
I'll meet Hwang Dal-jung's daughter
and tell her everything.

762
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,933
And I'm going
to take this fight all the way.

763
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:43,173
Have you really found the daughter?

764
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:49,646
Mr. Shin, please don't ask me

765
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,315
how I found out what I'm about to tell you
and hear me out.

766
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:53,884
Trust me.

767
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:54,951
Okay.

768
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:57,521
Why are you being so scary?

769
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,175
It's the police.

770
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,578
They're going to stake out around us
until Min Jun-guk is caught.

771
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:22,979
I see.

772
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:35,492
-Don't you mind it?
-Mind what?

773
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,427
You didn't like to hold hands
in front of people.

774
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:40,330
Not anymore. I decided not to dislike it.

775
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,132
It's one percent more correct.

776
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:46,970
What does that mean?

777
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,139
You don't have to know.
Don't read my mind.

778
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:51,608
Hey?

779
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,845
You decided not to dislike it. Let's go.

780
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,620
You can do it. You can do it well.

781
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,123
Go to Seo Dae-seok
and say what you have to.

782
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,625
And hear what you need to.
That's what you'll do.

783
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,332
Don't be scared.

784
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,234
I'm perfect right now.

785
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:19,836
You seem very nervous.

786
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,173
"Nervous"? What is that?

787
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,542
Is it a food?

788
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,878
You don't look bad in that.

789
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:30,780
But isn't a t-shirt
with that skirt a little off?

790
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,121
Shoot.

791
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,341
Hello, Mr. Seo.

792
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,148
Hi.

793
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,784
What are you doing here?

794
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:09,653
I have something to tell you.

795
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,321
About what?

796
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,391
Please have the people go away.

797
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,693
It's about the Hwang Dal-jung case.

798
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,829
Mr. Seo, aren't you going inside?

799
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,266
You go on and head inside first.

800
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:32,409
I will be arguing the Hwang Dal-jung case.

801
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,980
But I found something interesting
while investigating.

802
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,349
What are you trying to say?

803
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,920
Hwang Dal-jung served time
for a crime he didn't commit.

804
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:45,355
For 26 years.

805
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,959
Have you come to ask about the verdict?

806
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,861
A verdict from 26 years ago?

807
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,331
That verdict was not your fault.

808
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,801
The victim had fabricated the evidence.

809
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:01,438
I didn't come to blame you for that.
However...

810
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:07,410
But, knowing the truth,
but pretending not to...

811
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:10,013
That I can't forgive.

812
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,684
I don't know what you're talking about.

813
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:20,724
In my 20 years as a judge,
I did nothing to be ashamed of.

814
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:24,628
You haven't changed one bit.

815
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,932
-Hye-seong.
-Yes.

816
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,134
I'm not listening because I believe you.

817
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,703
I'm waiting.

818
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:42,946
Mr. Seo, I'm not listening
because I believe what you're saying.

819
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,381
I'm waiting.

820
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,082
Waiting for what?

821
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:51,254
For you to admit your fault,
repent and apologize.

822
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:56,259
For you to admit your fault,
repent and apologize.

823
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,862
If you admit it now

824
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,930
and apologize to Do-yeon,

825
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:05,902
I will forgive you and keep things
as they were for your future.

826
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,071
You should admit it now.

827
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,874
And apologize to Hwang Dal-jung sincerely.

828
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,043
Then I will stop here.

829
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:17,781
But if you keep saying
that you don't know anything...

830
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,351
I'm going to take this all the way.

831
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:22,986
"All the way"?

832
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:26,790
I'm curious what that means.

833
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,758
Does that mean you won't apologize?

834
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,493
I have nothing to apologize for!

835
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,166
It's the answer I expected.

836
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:40,704
Anyway, I came here out of courtesy

837
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:42,739
because of our relationship
from 11 years ago.

838
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,276
I understand how you feel.
So I'll get going now.

839
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:56,686
By the way,
I'm telling you this just in case.

840
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:01,624
I don't think you'll stoop so low
as to do such a thing,

841
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:05,462
but if you're considering anything sneaky,
don't do it.

842
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:10,433
These days,
the police are guarding me 24-hours a day.

843
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,941
I should get going then.

844
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,682
Jang Hye-seong, you're awesome.
You're amazing.

845
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,618
Are you watching, Mom?
Wasn't I so charismatic?

846
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,898
How could you come here alone?

847
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,600
How did you know to come here?

848
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:45,535
I read your mind in the morning.

849
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,840
Did you read Seo Dae-seok's mind, too?

850
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:52,075
Yes.

851
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:53,276
Will he apologize?

852
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,812
No, not at all.

853
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,180
Geez.

854
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,681
I knew it.

855
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,251
Is it Do-yeon's turn now?

856
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,556
Hwang Dal-jung will insist
Son Chae-ok is Jeon Young-ja

857
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,092
who died 26 years ago.

858
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:13,129
The defense can argue
for a dismissal or a not-guilty.

859
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,298
And then they'll try
to reduce the sentence.

860
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,133
How can they do that?

861
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:18,535
He stabbed a person.

862
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:24,140
You're right, but if she is the wife,
he must feel wronged.

863
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,510
He served 26 years
for killing a person who is alive.

864
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:31,281
And he won't live long
because of a brain tumor.

865
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:34,884
That doesn't mean he should get off
with attempted murder.

866
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:38,721
Jeon Young-ja and Son Chae-ok
can't be the same person.

867
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,958
Even if they are,
this is this and that is that.

868
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:45,495
I know. It's different.
That's what we will argue.

869
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:47,964
Hye-seong is always like this.

870
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:51,301
It's like she became a lawyer
to mess up the legal system.

871
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:57,006
Ms. Seo, Jang Hye-seong
has come to meet you.

872
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,341
What?

873
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,943
Speaking of the devil.

874
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,378
Do you think she heard what we said?

875
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,081
You should go hear what she has to say.

876
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,917
Don't try to pick a fight with her.

877
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:10,253
Okay.

878
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,298
-I got caught.
-How will I return this?

879
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,013
Drink it. It's chrysanthemum tea.

880
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,082
Okay.

881
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:41,851
What's the occasion?

882
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:44,020
It's the first time I see you here.

883
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:47,557
You're right.

884
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,292
What is it?

885
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:58,902
Oh no, I totally ruined my English test.

886
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:02,038
Not as worse as me.
I think I wrote the answers wrong.

887
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,908
Yes! It seems I can be
in first place this time.

888
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:08,545
Really? What will you do?
This is really serious.

889
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,446
Serves you right!

890
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:21,057
What makes the world
or a relationship peaceful,

891
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:22,992
are more often the lies than the truth.

892
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:28,064
Lies close up conflicts
and calm anxious feelings.

893
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,267
That is really cheap.
It's the cheapest in Korea.

894
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:32,602
Really?

895
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,604
What is this?

896
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,073
It was originally 4,000 won,
but you tagged it as 6,000 won.

897
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,909
Why did you take that off?

898
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:46,215
Because the truth is uncomfortable,
most people want to look away.

899
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:49,686
So do I.

900
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,122
You must have heard, too.

901
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:57,794
The defense is going to argue that
Jeon Young-ja,

902
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,897
who was supposedly murdered 26 years ago,
is Son Chae-ok.

903
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,533
Yes, I know.

904
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,469
But I heard you have no way to prove it.

905
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:08,438
Isn't it a stretch?

906
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:10,640
There's a way to prove it.

907
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,277
We found Hwang Dal-jung
and Jeon Young-ja's daughter.

908
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:16,946
Really?

909
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:18,948
Did you do a DNA test?

910
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:21,284
We're going to.

911
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:37,667
It's always painful to deliver the truth.

912
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,839
So sometimes, when faced with the truth...

913
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:46,943
I close my eyes.

914
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,382
Why are you telling me this?

915
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,518
You can just submit it
as evidence at the trial.

916
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,788
Because I need you.

917
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,525
Me?

918
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:04,727
Why?

919
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,232
You're Hwang Dal-jung's daughter,

920
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,334
Hwang Ga-yeon.

921
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,203
What?

922
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:16,472
I'm sorry, Do-yeon.

923
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:27,183
But somehow my Jjang of Arc

924
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:31,954
was pursuing the truth more than me,
who can see it.

925
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:33,923
