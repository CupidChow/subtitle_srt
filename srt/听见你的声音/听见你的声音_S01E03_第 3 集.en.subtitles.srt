1
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,840
Thank you for letting me
watch your trial, Mr. Cha.

2
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,376
I learned a lot today.

3
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,113
I learned how dangerous it is
to blindly trust your defendant.

4
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:52,719
And I also realized how incompetent
a lawyer without expertise can be.

5
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,320
Thank you.

6
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,294
What is she going to do
if she doesn't believe her client?

7
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,264
Why didn't she become a prosecutor then?

8
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,600
-Don't you agree?
-Why are you asking me?

9
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,803
-Don't you agree?
-Why are you asking me?

10
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:14,541
I'm going to watch her.
And if she does it wrong, I'll report her.

11
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,809
Just you see.

12
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:18,978
Good luck!

13
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:31,424
It's your turn, counsel.

14
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,798
Look at that. She is totally nervous.

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,968
-Counsel.
-Yes?

16
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,003
Do you agree with the indictment?

17
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,805
Let me guess.

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,409
"Yes, I do."

19
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,311
That is what she'll say.

20
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,952
I do not agree with the indictment at all.

21
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,420
What?

22
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,858
The defendant is pleading not guilty.

23
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:22,142
She said she didn't ostracize the victim,
and it was just a joke.

24
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,044
Was it really just a joke?

25
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,416
Let me read the texts
that she sent to the victim.

26
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,687
"Hey, you effing asshole.
Why do you keep bitching at me?

27
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,724
No wonder you're surrounded by flies.

28
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:42,362
If you act up again,
I'll cut your double eyelids open.

29
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:45,999
So shut up and only breathe
through your silicon nose.

30
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:49,068
You are such a hideous, fatass pig."

31
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,882
You cannot say she's a criminal
just because she swears.

32
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:07,220
That isn't even that bad
considering kids these days.

33
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:13,459
"Hey, you bitch." That's just...

34
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,364
It just means you two were friends.

35
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:25,738
That lawyer is insane.
How can she say that?

36
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:38,384
You witnessed the defendant
pushing Mun Dong-hui, right?

37
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,786
Yes.

38
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,057
I heard Dong-hui and Seong-bin fighting.

39
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,326
Then I heard a thud.

40
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,462
And Dong-hui was lying on the flower bed.

41
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,199
That's all.

42
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,438
You said you looked
after you heard the thud.

43
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,110
So you didn't actually see
the defendant push the victim.

44
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,378
What?

45
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,584
No, but...

46
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,020
You said you looked
after you heard a thud.

47
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,023
Let me ask again.

48
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:23,229
Did you witness Ko Seong-bin
push Mun Dong-hui yourself?

49
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,499
No, but it's the same thing.

50
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,103
I saw it indirectly. Isn't that the same?

51
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,341
Is she trying to plead not guilty?

52
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,709
No further questions.

53
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,215
The defendant does have a point.

54
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:52,458
The intent to kill is
most important in attempted murder.

55
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,996
The defendant said that
she wanted to kill the victim many times.

56
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:00,667
If saying she wanted
to kill the victim is evidence,

57
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,602
then everyone
at the school should be indicted.

58
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,939
The teacher who said she would kill kids
for having bad grades should be here.

59
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:17,016
The defendant saw the victim sitting
by the window and pushed her.

60
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:23,189
If she had been pushed,
most of the wounds should be in the head.

61
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,793
But the victim's wounds
are mostly in her legs.

62
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,936
I was at the scene.
And I saw what happened.

63
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,039
That man...

64
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:51,050
hit the driver's head with an iron pipe.

65
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,319
He told us to keep quiet.

66
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,490
He said the man died
because he didn't keep quiet.

67
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,562
I took a photo of him
hitting the man with the pipe.

68
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,897
Can't this be used as evidence?

69
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,841
The defendant was
the only person in the classroom.

70
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,711
And circumstantial evidence that
witnesses heard them fighting...

71
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:24,083
Basing attempted murder
on circumstantial evidence is dangerous.

72
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,521
You know Article 307
of the Criminal Procedure Code, right?

73
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:33,593
"Facts should be based
on relevant evidence."

74
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,162
We need direct evidence.

75
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,606
Does the prosecution
have anything else to say?

76
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:53,212
Counsel pointed out
something very important.

77
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,918
Facts should be based
on direct evidence, where possible.

78
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,255
I overlooked that.

79
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,424
So...

80
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,962
If counsel allows it,

81
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,800
I would like to bring the victim
as a witness.

82
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,236
But she's unconscious.

83
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,306
She woke up this morning.

84
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:24,944
I didn't bring her as a witness
because I didn't think it would be needed.

85
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,415
But as counsel said,
I think it's necessary.

86
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,086
I'm saved.

87
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,156
If she testifies, this will be all over.

88
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,997
Counsel, defendant. Do you object?

89
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,501
No, I agree.

90
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:54,340
Okay, then we will take a break
until she comes.

91
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,504
Someone will be there for me?

92
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,472
Is this spam?

93
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,944
Hey, Stalker!

94
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,016
This was pretty good.

95
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,320
You're like a monster,
but a pretty useful one.

96
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,589
Do you have to be so mean
when you thank me?

97
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,860
-Do this again for me in the hearing.
-For free?

98
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,597
Here.

99
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,833
-What?
-Here.

100
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,234
What?

101
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,705
Okay.

102
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,145
Thank you. Happy now?

103
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,914
What are you doing?

104
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,850
A kiss is too much.
This is all you'll get.

105
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,854
I didn't want a kiss.
You have a pen mark on your cheek.

106
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,090
Oh, was that it?

107
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,264
-Where are you going?
-To wash my face!

108
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,468
Why did she do that?
She took me by surprise.

109
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,738
Jang Hye-seong.

110
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,373
Where do I get the revenue stamp?

111
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,043
-This is a terrible trial.
-Where is the toilet?

112
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:41,414
That kid is a public defender here?
This is interesting.

113
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:49,755
Kid, it seems all the fools in here
are on my side.

114
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,281
-What?
-I'm sorry.

115
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,258
No way.

116
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:33,265
Ms. Jjang stared at the prosecutor
and showed that she's a lawyer.

117
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,267
First, she dominated her with her eyes.

118
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,136
Then she started her defense.

119
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,507
When the prosecutor fought back,
she launched another attack even harder.

120
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,847
Aren't you all shocked?

121
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,517
I knew she wasn't a very nice person.

122
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,853
I didn't know she was such a gamecock.

123
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,323
She's not a gamecock.
She was like a female warrior.

124
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,258
Jjang of Arc.

125
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,001
Which lawyer have you come to see?

126
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,405
I've come to see Ms. Jang Hye-seong.

127
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,607
Ms. Jang? Please wait.

128
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:19,545
-What's your name?
-I'm Eo Chun-sim.

129
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,548
I'm Hye-seong's mother.

130
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,351
Really?

131
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,088
-Hello.
-Hello.

132
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,826
We will begin the witness examination.

133
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,961
Please take the oath.

134
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:40,666
"I solemnly swear to tell the truth,

135
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:44,336
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth

136
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,707
under the penalty of perjury."

137
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,743
Witness, Mun Dong-hui.

138
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,348
Tell me if you're not feeling well.

139
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,585
The prosecution will question her first.

140
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,531
On May 24th, around 5:00 p.m.,

141
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,568
you fell from the fourth floor
of Yeonju High School

142
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,370
and have been unconscious until today.

143
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:20,372
Yes.

144
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,244
There was someone who pushed you, right?

145
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:29,815
Yes.

146
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:31,817
What?

147
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,921
Is that person present in this room?

148
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,096
Yes.

149
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,565
Please stop, Your Honor.

150
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,834
Can you tell us who it was?

151
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,250
Hey, Mun Dong-hui!
You can't do this to me!

152
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,051
Sit down and put the wig back on.

153
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,787
You sit down!

154
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,724
My goddamn life is going to be ruined
because of that brat!

155
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:13,559
Hey.

156
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,427
Hey!

157
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:20,065
You bitch! If you almost died,
you should live properly!

158
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,968
-Why are you freaking lying?
-Order!

159
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,438
Let me go!
I'll die if I don't do something!

160
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,708
Order! What are you doing?

161
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,245
She is freaking lying!

162
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,381
I can't tell the truth.

163
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:40,052
Everything will be over
if I tell the truth about why I fell.

164
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,521
Hey! Stop right there!

165
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,058
-You liar! Damn it!
-Calm down!

166
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,395
Why can't you control that girl?

167
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,311
Your defense was impressive.

168
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,682
So don't beat yourself up.

169
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,484
You did pretty well...

170
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,589
for a public defender.

171
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,555
I looked into Dong-hui's eyes.

172
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,859
Get lost. Don't ever appear before me.

173
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:08,140
I brought two more drumsticks each.
Please eat as much as you can.

174
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,608
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

175
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,345
You should have some, too.

176
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,516
If you insist.

177
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,219
I won't embarrass you by refusing it.

178
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,360
Hye-seong is new here.

179
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,429
She has a lot to learn, right?

180
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,332
She is very stiff.

181
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,970
-She is a little--
-No, not at all.

182
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,907
She could appear tough,
but she's not so on the inside.

183
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,111
I'm glad you see that.

184
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:51,283
She didn't attend high school as a kid.

185
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,686
So she's not very sociable.

186
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,690
She may look rough on the outside,

187
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:03,362
but she actually has a very warm heart.

188
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,564
Shut up! I said, get lost!

189
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,434
It's your fault.

190
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,604
If she admitted to it and repented,
things wouldn't be so bad now.

191
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,240
-Why should she admit it?
-Look at how things are.

192
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,943
Seong-bin will go to jail
for attempted murder.

193
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,579
And I was embarrassed
in front of the prosecutor, okay?

194
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,983
Seong-bin didn't push Dong-hui.
She fell by accident.

195
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,584
Dong-hui is lying.

196
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,486
Stop it already. I don't need all this.

197
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,588
How can you say that?
Why are you giving up?

198
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:33,325
Do you have to go to the Himalayas
to know it's cold?

199
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,194
Do you have to jump
into the fire to know it's hot?

200
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:39,365
The victim testified.
What can we do? It's a lost game.

201
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,033
Do you have a death wish?

202
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,672
What are you doing here?

203
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,410
You're talking rubbish out of your mouth.

204
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:55,581
How can a lawyer compare someone's life
to a game?

205
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,516
You don't know anything.

206
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,086
-Do you know who I lost to?
-Do I have to know that?

207
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,989
-It's Do-yeon. Seo Do-yeon.
-So what?

208
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,426
Don't you remember the Seo Do-yeon
who put us out on the streets?

209
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,494
So what?

210
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:12,498
I met her after ten years
and I was humiliated in front of her.

211
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,934
-Your daughter, Hye-seong!
-You're humiliating me!

212
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,004
My gosh.

213
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:24,043
I boasted to everyone
that the loach became a dragon.

214
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,880
But the loach has become a worm.

215
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,415
Right?

216
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,756
Please, ma'am.

217
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,925
Are you leaving?

218
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,929
I suddenly remembered
that I have to do something.

219
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,197
I see.

220
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,569
I am taking down all the banners.

221
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,604
And stopping the promotion.

222
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,375
I am too humiliated
to keep them up anymore.

223
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:00,646
How can you call yourself a lawyer?

224
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,615
My gosh. What are you looking at?

225
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:21,733
That lady has a really bad temper.

226
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,969
-Yoo Jae-suk.
-Yoo Jae-suk.

227
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:28,373
It runs in the family.
Ms. Jjang is worse. Kang Ho-dong.

228
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,913
So do you think
her mother's scolding had an effect?

229
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:36,882
Not at all.

230
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:40,719
She'll probably quit in a month.

231
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:47,392
So how old is Ms. Jjang? Park Myeong-su.

232
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:53,665
She is probably around 27 or 28 years old.

233
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,800
Lee Bong-won.

234
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,339
What is it?

235
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,175
Are you thinking about your daughter?

236
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,280
My Ga-yeong must be around that age, too.

237
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,382
Yes, probably.

238
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,121
It's your turn.

239
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,657
Yes.

240
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,062
Didn't a Min Jun-guk come to your office?

241
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,733
No. Why? Who is he?

242
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,935
He was recently released.

243
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,039
He seemed close to a new lawyer
who works at your office.

244
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:40,045
He said he owed that person.
Lee Kyung-kyu.

245
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,247
Who?

246
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,749
Lee Kyung-kyu!

247
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,652
No, the person who was released.

248
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,122
Jun-guk. Min Jun-guk.

249
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,936
If you almost died,
you should live properly!

250
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,505
My goddamn life is going to be ruined
because of that brat!

251
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,441
Let me go!
I'll die if I don't do something!

252
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,812
You're talking rubbish out of your mouth.

253
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:18,050
How can a lawyer compare someone's life
to a game?

254
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,852
Your defense was impressive.

255
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,690
So don't beat yourself up.

256
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,359
You did pretty well...

257
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,529
for a public defender.

258
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,239
Hey, you! You!

259
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,043
Don't you remember me?

260
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,780
It's that lady.

261
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:54,019
You threw our ball into the road
and it got ruined.

262
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,554
Remember?

263
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,296
I don't remember.

264
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,900
So you're running away.

265
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,272
Hey, stop right there!

266
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,340
Hey!

267
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,845
-Where are you going?
-Stop!

268
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,013
Hey!

269
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,959
Where are you going to go now?

270
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,161
You're in trouble now.

271
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:44,836
You crawled your way
into the perfect spot.

272
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,508
Hey, you guys. I could sue you for this.

273
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,910
If you even touch me,
it will be assault and battery.

274
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,447
It's at night
and there are several of you.

275
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,050
So there could be additional punishment.

276
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,793
Hey. Stalker.

277
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,428
"Stalker"?

278
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,966
Please call the police.

279
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,436
Or go get some people.

280
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,372
Promise me something.
Then I'll get rid of them.

281
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,207
Promise what?

282
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,409
Promise you won't give up on Seong-bin.

283
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,778
Why are you talking about that here?

284
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,314
I won't give up.

285
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,184
Never.

286
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,955
I wasn't going to give up on her.

287
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,193
What are they talking about?

288
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,530
Hey, look at me.
Don't you get this situation?

289
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,066
You were talking to me.

290
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,671
Come over here.

291
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,807
Who are you? You come here, you bastard.

292
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:56,975
Hey, hold it.

293
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,747
That is Park Su-ha.

294
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,349
Chung-gi got beat up by him.

295
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,386
You know, Kim Chung-gi,
our local taekwondo representative.

296
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:08,820
My back hurts.

297
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:12,958
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I saw it myself.

298
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,194
Hey, stop right there.

299
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,231
We would love to talk to you right now.

300
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,834
But it's kind of late.

301
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,070
We have to go attend classes.

302
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:28,073
So let's talk another time.

303
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,246
No. I want to talk right now.

304
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,983
I would love to do that,
but we just don't have the time.

305
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,652
We have to go attend classes.

306
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,993
-Hey, wait for me.
-Hey.

307
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,129
I have nothing against you.

308
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,033
I never had anything against you.

309
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,411
-Is that it?
-Don't forget your promise.

310
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,447
Take care of Seong-bin until the end.

311
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,284
Hey. You didn't do anything.

312
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,626
So Dong-hui fell after hanging
from the windowsill?

313
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,396
-Yes.
-Why was she hanging there?

314
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,131
There wasn't anyone in the classroom.

315
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:30,469
I'm not sure, I wanted to find out more,
but it was too chaotic.

316
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,272
So she fell
after hanging from the windowsill.

317
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,444
How do I prove that?
Shall I call Dong-hui back to court?

318
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,515
No, but what if she lies again?

319
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,117
I have to find evidence.

320
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,889
I really thought
you had given up on Seong-bin.

321
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,292
Shut it. I didn't decide not to give up
because of you.

322
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:56,995
Go on in.

323
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,566
Hey, Stalker.

324
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,172
You didn't really save me.

325
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,609
So I'm only kind of grateful.

326
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:28,627
How did he know where I live?

327
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,605
It's "I'll be there" again.

328
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,543
No way.

329
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:03,662
Oh my gosh. It must be him.

330
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,973
You can use road-view maps
instead of crime-scene photos.

331
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,575
They do it a lot at trials.

332
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,443
I see.

333
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,845
That way you will do less legwork.

334
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,981
You were going to go straight
to the crime scene, right?

335
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,349
Yes.

336
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:34,059
I must prove Ko Seong-bin is innocent
in this trial.

337
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,227
-Help me.
-I don't want to.

338
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,830
Why should I help you?

339
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,806
The victim's testimony is all they have
as evidence.

340
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:50,008
But the victim keeps lying.

341
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,877
-What should I do when...
-My gosh, the battery is dead.

342
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:57,882
My hearing aid is out.
I can't hear anything now.

343
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,425
I'm sorry for being impudent.
Please help me.

344
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,636
I will be responsible
for your coffee from now on.

345
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,141
I'LL PESTER YOU UNTIL YOU HELP ME

346
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,109
I'LL DO MY BEST

347
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,443
PLEASE HELP ME THIS ONCE

348
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,612
Enough.

349
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,448
Where do you...

350
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,855
Shall I help you instead?

351
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:40,258
I was famous for field investigation
in my police days.

352
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,626
Forget it!

353
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,300
Gosh.

354
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,269
And used up all my Post-its to boot.

355
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,305
That was so distracting.

356
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,049
How are you going to help?

357
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:10,188
I have the tricks and know-how
that I developed as a police officer.

358
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,125
Are these your tricks and know-how?

359
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,431
We have to get inside the lives
of the victim and defendant.

360
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,467
They're both students,
so we need to start at the school.

361
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,804
You should go and talk to the students.

362
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,606
I will go and investigate the crime scene.

363
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:45,790
Seong-bin is unbelievable.
She swore in court, too.

364
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:49,594
That lawyer is hopeless.
How can she say she's innocent?

365
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,929
How can she do that?

366
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,732
-She's a monster.
-I know.

367
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,835
-That is so totally foolish.
-I know.

368
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,439
Who are you?

369
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:09,748
Yello, friends.
I'm Jang Ye-ri, a new student.

370
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,018
Seong-bin led in picking on Dong-hui?

371
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,489
That's right. She's the one
who made the nickname "Double Nose."

372
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,925
Why did she pick on her?
What did Dong-hui do wrong?

373
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,428
What did she do wrong?

374
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:27,932
She is just too perfect.
She was too pretty for her own good.

375
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,768
She had good grades, too.

376
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,971
She got a full scholarship,
and started school two years early.

377
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,975
So did you take part
in picking on Dong-hui?

378
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:41,613
It's not like that.
But we would get picked on if we didn't.

379
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:13,678
Did Dong-hui say that
she didn't want to live?

380
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,582
Of course not. She got into that agency.

381
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,819
What did she do during breaks?
I heard she had no friends.

382
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,989
She would play the piano
or study in the computer room.

383
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,691
The computer room?

384
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:29,894
What is this?

385
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,070
How do I find the computer
that Mun Dong-hui used?

386
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,143
This is the one that Mun Dong-hui used.

387
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,411
Really?

388
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,249
When did you come?

389
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,491
I know. I'm embarrassed, too.

390
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,995
I'll take care of things. You can go now.

391
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:51,142
I've turned it on. What should I do now?

392
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,345
What are you doing?
Can't you find internet history?

393
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:55,647
Of course I do.

394
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,652
"Find the internet history"?
Isn't that what hackers do?

395
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,502
SEARCH HISTORY

396
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:22,874
Wow, awesome. All the details are here.

397
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,909
COMPUTER ROOM DAILY LOG
THURSDAY, MAY 24, MUN DONG-HUI

398
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,978
Look at the records
between 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. on the 24th.

399
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:27,979
Okay.

400
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,617
Hey, why are you bossing me around?

401
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:36,854
This is the computer usage record.
Dong-hui's usage time is all here.

402
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,122
Really?

403
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,160
I'll take care of it.

404
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,264
Look at this. The search words are odd.

405
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,599
What?

406
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,973
GETTING RID OF CIGARETTE SMELL
HOW TO BUY CIGARETTES ONLINE

407
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,176
Wasn't Dong-hui a model student?
Wasn't she about to debut, too?

408
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,112
-Yes.
-So why would she look this up?

409
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:06,351
Ms. Jjang, I found out
why Mun Dong-hui fell.

410
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:20,064
You want me to go back and take the stand?

411
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:21,766
Why?

412
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:26,004
You lied last time,
so you should tell the truth.

413
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,107
I didn't lie.

414
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,977
You smoke, don't you?

415
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:38,683
No. Why suddenly bring that up?

416
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:43,388
I went to your school
and looked up your search history.

417
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,592
"Cigarette vending machine location."
"How do minors buy cigarettes?"

418
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,128
"Internet purchase of cigarettes."
"How to get rid of cigarette smell."

419
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,763
"Cigarette-purchasing agents."

420
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,132
And then...

421
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,871
-This.
-How do you have...

422
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,107
I went to your school today.

423
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,511
Weren't you smoking that day?

424
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:11,616
But Seong-bin came in, so you hid outside
the window and fell, right?

425
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:17,288
I can sort of understand
why you lied on the stand.

426
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:21,592
You're about to debut, so you're worried
about people knowing you smoke.

427
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,563
But that's no reason
to ruin someone else's life.

428
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:31,769
Let go of me!
I need to hear what that brat says.

429
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,304
Stay here.

430
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,043
Did you get the summons?

431
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,312
Please come to the trial
at three tomorrow.

432
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:45,216
Come and testify
that Seong-bin is innocent, okay?

433
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,552
I don't want to.

434
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,222
Mun Dong-hui, it's not about wanting to.

435
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,525
No. I'm not going.

436
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,095
Look at that freaking bitch...

437
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,233
Hey, Double Nose. Let's talk.

438
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,869
I told you to stay still.
What are you doing here?

439
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,071
I'm just going to talk. Just talk.

440
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,909
Let me ask you
why you're doing this to me.

441
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,912
Is it just because
I called you "Double Nose"?

442
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,215
Is that why you're doing this to me?

443
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:18,850
"Just because"?

444
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,623
Okay. Let me ask you.

445
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,593
Why did you pick on me?

446
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,328
What?

447
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,331
What did I do to you that you tease me?

448
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,968
What did I do to you that you outcast me?

449
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,908
What did I do to you
that you put a rag in my lunch?

450
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,313
What did I do to you?

451
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:55,219
Why did you call my mother an idiot?

452
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,659
-Hey, that's--
-Dong-hui.

453
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,462
That's one thing. This is different.

454
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,864
That's no reason to make her a murderer.

455
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:10,401
Seong-bin could go to jail because of you.

456
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:11,802
So, let her go.

457
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,872
I've been living in a prison anyway.

458
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:22,146
I lived in a prison she created.
And I didn't even know what I did.

459
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:27,885
I didn't know why
or how long I had to be in there.

460
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,355
I lived all alone like that.

461
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:38,196
So let her go live in prison.

462
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,033
With no friends.

463
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,670
Or anyone on her side.

464
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,406
She should live like that.

465
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:50,942
Just like I did.

466
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:02,887
My friends, my lawyer.
No one will believe me.

467
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,523
What's the use of living?

468
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,627
Will they believe me if I just die?

469
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,763
Will they regret not believing me?

470
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,070
Mun Dong-hui. That's no reason to--

471
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:20,671
Let's go.

472
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,776
What do you mean?
She is the only one who can...

473
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,645
Let's just go.

474
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,984
I'll be tried without Dong-hui.

475
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:39,056
Of course, I could prove your innocence
without her.

476
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:44,528
But we could lose. What will you do then?

477
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,833
It can't be helped.

478
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:50,835
What?

479
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,039
I'm sorry.

480
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:00,745
I know this may sound like an excuse,
but I did it because I was jealous.

481
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:06,517
I think I lost it
when others joined in on it.

482
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,289
I didn't know I was holding a stone
in my hand.

483
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:17,795
And I didn't realize
a frog could die if I hit it.

484
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,533
I'm really sorry.

485
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,614
What will you do?

486
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,085
You're the one
with the stone in your hand.

487
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:45,289
Are you going to kill the frog
as Seong-bin did?

488
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:14,452
What should we do?
What if Dong-hui doesn't come?

489
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:18,456
-She'll come.
-Did you look into her mind?

490
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:23,494
She said what she wanted to say
and heard what she wanted to hear.

491
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,196
So, she'll come.

492
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,500
Then I'm done here. Let's go.

493
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,743
KO SEONG-BIN CASE FILE

494
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,715
Here. Let me do that for you.

495
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,820
Thank you.

496
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,527
Ms. Jjang.

497
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,164
You're going
into Seong-bin's trial, right?

498
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,600
Yes.

499
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,204
This is for you.

500
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,107
Why are you...

501
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,045
No. It's too much.

502
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,416
It's just a small gift. Please take it.

503
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,352
We're not close enough
to exchange such things.

504
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,320
This is too fast.

505
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,859
-What do you mean?
-Absolutely fast...

506
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,230
What is this?

507
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,299
Give me your hand.

508
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,870
Don't wet your hands with saliva
to flip the pages in court.

509
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,874
Use this instead. Like this, okay?

510
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,445
I'm kind of grateful.

511
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,246
I should go.

512
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,917
Here.

513
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,853
Good luck with today's trial, Ms. Jang.

514
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,022
-Good luck, Ms. Jjang.
-Good luck!

515
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:02,893
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

516
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,862
-Good luck!
-Good luck! Good luck!

517
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,299
What? Me? What about me?

518
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:12,736
I thought Ms. Jang
was the kind who didn't work.

519
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,674
But she worked quite hard.
She investigated the school.

520
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,776
-She stayed up all night, too.
-Yes.

521
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,645
Look at how many precedents she looked up.

522
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,014
ATTORNEY JANG HYE-SEONG

523
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,484
If you're dumb,
it's your body that suffers.

524
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:44,301
-Aren't you getting on?
-I will.

525
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,943
You asked Mun Dong-hui to testify again.

526
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:55,446
Will she do it?

527
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,350
She said Seong-bin is very much like you.

528
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,719
How you were ten years ago
when the firework incident happened.

529
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,955
Let me ask you
why you're doing this to me.

530
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,958
Is it just because
I called you "Double Nose"?

531
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,127
Is that why you're doing this to me?

532
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,465
I have a question.

533
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:16,567
What?

534
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,703
Why did you lie ten years ago?

535
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,506
Why did you frame me like that?

536
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,776
What do you mean? It's all in the past.

537
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:32,082
Back then, I just thought
that you were a horrible person.

538
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:36,854
I never thought about why you had done it.

539
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,224
Why are you doing this?

540
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,627
Are you trying to work me up
before we go into trial?

541
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:49,733
No matter what you say or who you bring,
the truth doesn't change.

542
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,604
We'll begin
the examination of the witness.

543
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:54,538
IN SESSION

544
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,507
Mun Dong-hui should come to the stand.

545
00:42:57,374 --> 00:43:01,378
"I solemnly swear to tell the truth,

546
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:04,748
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth

547
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,051
under the penalty of perjury."

548
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:09,053
Witness, Mun Dong-hui.

549
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:13,724
Counsel, please begin.

550
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,328
Just a moment... Your Honor.

551
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,966
There is something
the witness should know first.

552
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,169
Can we start after I tell her this?

553
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,471
Sure, go ahead.

554
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:32,710
Witness, you took the oath last time
and then gave your testimony.

555
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,214
If you change your testimony,
one of them will be false.

556
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,049
And you'll be punished for perjury.

557
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,684
PERJURY: WILLFULLY LYING IN COURT
UNDER OATH

558
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:41,852
"Perjury"?

559
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:49,259
Your Honor, this is the same
as threatening the witness not to talk.

560
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:52,329
Punishment for perjury is
up to five years in jail,

561
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:56,266
or a fine of up to ten million won.

562
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,836
Please remember that.

563
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,307
The witness should be put
on notice about it.

564
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,310
Witness, did you understand?

565
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:08,612
Yes.

566
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:12,816
If I tell the truth, it will be perjury.

567
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,319
What should I do?

568
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,924
What are you doing?
Please begin the examination.

569
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,201
ATTORNEY JANG HYE-SEONG

570
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,372
Counsel! Begin your examination!

571
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:38,575
YOU HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE

572
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,278
ATTORNEY SHIN SANG-DEOK

573
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,647
CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE ARTICLE 159

574
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,488
Counsel! If you're not going to...

575
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,525
You can take your time if you want.

576
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,927
Your Honor, please lend me the code book.

577
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,563
-What?
-Hurry up!

578
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,466
Sure. Here it is.

579
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,079
A WITNESS MUST BE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING...

580
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:24,521
Witness, you started school early
because of good grades, correct?

581
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:28,425
Yes, I started school two years early.

582
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,829
How old are you?

583
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,566
My birthday hasn't passed,
so I'm 15 years old.

584
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:44,308
Under Article 159 of the Penal Code,
your oath is invalid.

585
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,312
Since the oath you took loses its effect,

586
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:52,783
you can't be punished for perjury
if you go back on your previous testimony.

587
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:59,089
What do you mean?

588
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:05,395
Since you're young, you won't be punished
for changing the statement.

589
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,064
Really?

590
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:16,106
Witness, can you answer
my questions truthfully now?

591
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:17,875
Yes.

592
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,249
I'll begin the questioning.

593
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,056
-Mr. Cha.
-Yes?

594
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,125
Ms. Jang won the case.

595
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,195
-Really?
-Yes, I just got the call.

596
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,164
The prosecutor canceled the indictment.

597
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:44,968
-Ms. Jjang is a great lawyer.
-No, you're a great lawyer.

598
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:49,740
She won because you found the evidence
with your sharp eyes.

599
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,610
No, she won because of the precedents
that you found.

600
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,513
This isn't Ms. Jjang's victory.
This is our victory!

601
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,182
You're right.

602
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,086
Except for Mr. Shin...

603
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:07,257
I know. He didn't help her at all.

604
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:12,863
I do respect him,
but I like him less when he does this.

605
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:14,498
-A little?
-Yes.

606
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,336
You're not a prosecutor.

607
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,640
What do you mean?

608
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:28,512
You knew Seong-bin was innocent
and that Dong-hui could prove it.

609
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,381
But you stopped her
from making that statement.

610
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:35,152
You tried to stop her
from proving Seong-bin's innocence.

611
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,120
You, the prosecutor.

612
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:41,592
Don't exaggerate.
I just told her about the law.

613
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,928
You're the same as you were ten years ago.

614
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:49,366
A person won't grow
if she doesn't admit her faults.

615
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,302
That is so true, right?

616
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,674
You'll be exactly the same in ten years.

617
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:01,311
You won't admit you're wrong,
hide it and punish the wrong people.

618
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:04,181
But you'll still wear those robes
as a prosecutor.

619
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:07,718
That's enough.

620
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:13,523
Okay, you were pretty good
for a public defender.

621
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,892
I'll admit that.

622
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:20,063
It doesn't mean you can judge me
about being a prosecutor.

623
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:25,903
"For a public defender..."

624
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,574
I was curious when I met you here.

625
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,644
Why did I have to go up against you,

626
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:37,581
who has become a big-shot prosecutor,
when I'm a public defender?

627
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:42,686
Why did God put us like this?

628
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,658
-I know the answer now.
-What are you trying to say?

629
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:53,096
There's no impact if a big-shot prosecutor
loses to a big-shot lawyer.

630
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:58,635
I'm supposed to show you
that you can lose to a public defender.

631
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,638
-Just like today.
-Today will be the last.

632
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:05,409
There will never be a trial
like this again.

633
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:09,579
Really? Okay, then.

634
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:16,753
If this happens again,
you should admit you can be wrong, too.

635
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:24,027
And apologize to me and my mother, too.

636
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:33,470
I was so amazing. So full of charisma.

637
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,700
What is this?

638
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:08,572
He didn't turn up today
and all he did was sending a text.

639
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:14,311
YEONJU DETENTION CENTER

640
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:21,151
-I've come to see someone.
-Sure, let me see your ID.

641
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,027
Hello? Why didn't you answer quickly?

642
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,229
I'm busy. Tell me why you called.

643
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:35,665
Did you take down the banners,
and stop the promotion, too?

644
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,100
Yes, I did.

645
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:41,038
-Are you so ashamed of me?
-Yes, I am. Why?

646
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,408
Just tell me why you called.

647
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:48,512
Mom, I didn't give up on my defendant.

648
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:52,883
I worked really hard
to defend my client and...

649
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,154
PUBLIC DEFENDER JANG HYE-SEONG'S 1ST TRIAL
WINNING WISH, 9,900 WON CHICKEN EVENT

650
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,896
Right. You defended her. And?

651
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,734
She was found innocent.

652
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,007
My defendant's name was cleared.

653
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:21,945
Aren't you proud?

654
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:25,582
Hey, that isn't something to boast about.

655
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,285
You just did your job.
Aren't you a lawyer?

656
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:30,987
-Mom.
-What?

657
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,524
Am I a dragon or a worm?

658
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,727
You're a loach, not a worm.

659
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,498
You have a long way
to go to become a dragon, okay?

660
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,300
Okay.

661
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,447
Min Jun-guk is already out?

662
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:33,650
Yes, Min Jun-guk got out last month.

663
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,155
Do you know where he is now?

664
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,923
No, we don't.

665
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:58,742
The voice I heard was
definitely Min Jun-guk's.

666
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,983
Please stop.

667
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,097
There are never empty seats on this bus.

668
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,266
I am so tired.

669
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,979
-Hey!
-Come with me.

670
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:39,716
The lady in blue is getting off
at the next stop.

671
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:40,951
Really?

672
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,962
Sell your ability to me.
It's great for taking buses.

673
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:56,366
-How did the trial go?
-What do you think? I won.

674
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,569
The indictment was canceled
and Seong-bin's name got cleared.

675
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,074
I know I shouldn't say this about myself,
but I was pretty amazing.

676
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,210
As soon as Dong-hui took the oath,

677
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:11,414
the prosecutor attacked with perjury
and that's when I got right up...

678
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:17,887
What's with him?

679
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:37,607
He should just thank me.
"I'll be there" is so cheesy.

680
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,282
Do you always come home so late?
Can't you come home earlier?

681
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:47,651
-The streets are dark.
-What's it to you?

682
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:52,522
Did you follow me because you're worried?

683
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:55,325
It's not like that. You should go in.

684
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:02,966
Stop right there.

685
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,536
Don't turn around and just listen to me.

686
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:14,744
I thought a lot about whether to say this.

687
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:18,848
I think as an adult, I should.
So listen to me carefully.

688
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,784
What's with the long prelude?

689
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,453
You know what?

690
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:28,024
I don't have time to accept puppy love
from a kid like you.

691
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:31,127
So you should just give up now.

692
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,195
What?

693
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:35,632
I know it may sound cruel,
but I'm doing this for your own good.

694
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,336
I'm a lawyer
and you're a high school senior.

695
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,872
You should be concentrating
on your studies.

696
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,209
-So--
-Who likes who?

697
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,445
You like me.

698
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,781
-Who says?
-This thing.

699
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:54,651
What did it say?

700
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,527
You think I sent these?

701
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:09,466
Yes, you sent them every day
since the trial started.

702
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,969
Did you fall for me
after seeing me in court?

703
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:18,074
That's not me.
I don't even know your number.

704
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:21,711
-You're lying.
-It's true.

705
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:31,187
See? This is my number.

706
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,093
Then who sent these?

707
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:42,565
It's spam, that's what it is.
They're probably after your money.

708
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:46,736
I can't believe this.
This is total humiliation.

709
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:55,111
Hey, don't look.
If you read my mind or you're dead meat.

710
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,615
"This is total humiliation."

711
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,384
I told you not to read my mind!

712
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,167
I shouldn't have said anything.
I am so embarrassed.

713
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:23,640
So why did he walk
me home every single day?

714
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,211
Maybe he just has good manners.

715
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:34,217
Come to think of it,
I still don't know his name.

716
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:37,954
I don't want to know, either.

717
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,262
Who is this, then?

718
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,236
No way.

719
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,639
Mr. Cha?

720
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,909
ATTORNEY CHA GUAN-WOO

721
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:05,682
-I'm going home now.
-Okay, see you tomorrow.

722
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:10,386
Mr. Cha, do you know
someone named Min Jun-guk?

723
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,389
No, why?

724
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,794
There's a friend in prison
whom I often visit.

725
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:21,264
This guy used to be
in the same room as him.

726
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:25,201
He said Min Jun-guk
said he owes you a favor.

727
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:28,271
"Min Jun-guk"?

728
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:32,809
-I don't know him.
-That's strange.

729
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:38,414
He said the guy recognized your photo
in the newspaper.

730
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:42,018
Ms. Jjang was also in that article.

731
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,355
Maybe he knows her.

732
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:48,525
Most likely.
But what was he in prison for?

733
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:52,595
-I think it was murder.
-"Murder"?

734
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:09,412
JJANG OF ARC

735
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:12,549
SAVE

736
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,491
So who sent those texts?

737
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,526
You think I sent these?

738
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:29,265
Yes, you sent them every day
since the trial started.

739
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,769
When the trial started?

740
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:39,509
That kid is a public defender here?
This is interesting.

741
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,713
Yes, Min Jun-guk got out last month.

742
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:55,992
No way.

743
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:07,670
I think it's Mr. Cha.

744
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,110
I'll be humiliated if it's not.

745
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:20,383
What's there to think?
I'll just call this number.

746
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:25,021
I'll call and check if it's spam
or Mr. Cha.

747
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,579
What is this?

748
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,767
Answer your phone!

749
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:27,583
-Move.
-Why? We need to talk.

750
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:31,254
Just move. Let's talk later!

751
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,489
Why? Let's talk now.

752
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,858
I heard you totally humiliated them.

753
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,861
Move.

754
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:40,129
Don't move.

755
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:54,971
Who...

756
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,541
Who's there?

757
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:14,657
