1
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,896
You can't let Min Jun-guk go!

2
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,298
Did you get his address?
What about his phone number?

3
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:36,102
You don't seem
to understand the situation.

4
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,838
You're the one who hit him
and he got beaten up.

5
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:42,008
You're the attacker
and he is the victim, okay?

6
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,646
Do you know what he said?
He is going to get revenge.

7
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,983
He is going to kill the witness
who testified against him ten years ago.

8
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,652
I got statements
from all of the witnesses.

9
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,254
But he never said that.

10
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,857
Min Jun-guk volunteers
at six different places,

11
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,693
including the soup kitchen
and the abandoned dog shelter.

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,196
Why are you framing someone

13
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,832
who is trying to live a new life
without any evidence?

14
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,335
You should at least bring proof.

15
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,212
-I have proof.
-What? What proof?

16
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,883
-I heard it. I can read his--
-Stop it.

17
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,921
Don't say anything foolish.

18
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,324
You'll just become a laughingstock,

19
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,427
just like you were ten years ago.

20
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,130
Park Su-ha.

21
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,633
I finally remembered your name.

22
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,441
Write your social security number,
address,

23
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,410
and phone number here.

24
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:55,181
He even had a weapon.
Is it okay to release him?

25
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,650
It's not a weapon. It's a hammer.

26
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,153
He brought it to fix my broken door.

27
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,622
Are you close enough to vouch for him?

28
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,925
You're not his family or teacher.

29
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,295
I've known him for ten years.

30
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,765
He is like a brother.
You could say he is family.

31
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,703
You're a lawyer, so I don't expect this,

32
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,672
but you're not lying
to avoid a booking, right?

33
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,608
She is not lying.

34
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,376
It looked as though they live together.

35
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,613
-"Together"?
-Yes.

36
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,250
Remember when they called about
the cell phone?

37
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,719
They called around midnight.

38
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,287
And when I got there, they were together.

39
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,557
And I saw them leave the place together
in the morning, too.

40
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,560
-No, that was--
-Yes, we live together.

41
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,665
He is a high school senior,
so I need to take care of him.

42
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,267
Right?

43
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,335
Call me "Sis." Hurry.

44
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,272
Yes, Sis.

45
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,340
Well, that's cleared then.

46
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,844
Are you repenting for what you did?

47
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,482
Hey, if you harass that man again,

48
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,317
you'll be charged immediately, okay?

49
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,289
Answer him. Say you won't do it again.

50
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,090
Or you can't get out.

51
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,999
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

52
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,136
Why didn't you just say that before?

53
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,705
Stop it.

54
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,608
I could have you charged with assault.

55
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,087
Hey.

56
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,924
There are no buses left.
Do you have money for a taxi?

57
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,492
Yes.

58
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,699
Please get in. We'll give you a ride.

59
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,901
It's okay. We'll take a taxi.

60
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,836
You can't get taxis here.

61
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,473
We have to go there anyway,
so we'll give you a ride.

62
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,576
Hey, Park Su-ha! Get in already.

63
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,454
I knew you were siblings
when I first saw you.

64
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,756
He asked me to find

65
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,659
who put the phone in your house.

66
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,128
He said you can't sleep at night,

67
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,931
so we should do more rounds.

68
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:28,935
He was making such a big deal,
others would envy how close you two are.

69
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:35,174
But what is your relationship
to Min Jun-guk anyway?

70
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,144
He said Min Jun-guk was a suspect

71
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,480
in the phone case, too.

72
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,317
So, did you look into it?

73
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,954
The cell phone had nothing to do with him.

74
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,757
He has been doing volunteer work
since he got out.

75
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,694
What did Min Jun-guk do anyway
for you to be like this?

76
00:04:56,596 --> 00:05:00,166
Min Jun-guk killed
his father ten years ago.

77
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,238
And I was a witness to that case.

78
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,151
I get that you three have a long history.

79
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:21,721
But you shouldn't be bothering a person
who's living a quiet life.

80
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,791
We'll look into Min Jun-guk
on our day off,

81
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,826
so don't make any more trouble.

82
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,630
There could be more questioning,
so answer your phone.

83
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,131
-Okay?
-Yes.

84
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:33,766
Ms. Jang?

85
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,271
If he runs away,
you'll be held responsible.

86
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,575
Sure. Don't you worry.

87
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,950
Why don't you go inside?

88
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,653
We should go inside now.

89
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,425
-Let's go in, Su-ha.
-What? Sure...

90
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,828
Sis.

91
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:19,846
We make rounds very often,
so you can rest without worrying.

92
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,115
Thank you.

93
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,996
These are men's shoes.
Do you live with someone?

94
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,732
I put them there so people would think so.

95
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,637
Is that why you order takeout for two?

96
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,671
Yes.

97
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,040
Have you had dinner?

98
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,743
I'm not hungry. You should eat without me.

99
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,414
Call me "Sis" and I'll give you dinner.

100
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,349
I'm not hungry.

101
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,423
-I should go.
-Just stay here.

102
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,360
We lied to the police
that we live together.

103
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,896
You should stay here for a while.

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,602
What if Min Jun-guk turns up here again?

105
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,005
I'll feel better with this kid around.

106
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:22,542
Give it to me.

107
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,528
Why didn't you tell me?
It took me a while to remember.

108
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,298
I told you that I was Park Su-ha.

109
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,733
I told you, but you didn't recognize me.

110
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,873
Hey. How would I remember
your name after ten years?

111
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,511
I recognized you.
Just by hearing your name.

112
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,146
Even though it's been ten years.

113
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:01,814
What's with him?

114
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,784
Am I his first love or something?

115
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,119
It's not like that.

116
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,957
Then why are you doing this?

117
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,393
Why did you turn up after ten years
and say you would protect me?

118
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:21,067
I didn't want to owe you anything.
That's all.

119
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,796
If it weren't for her,
you would've killed me ten years ago.

120
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,367
So I consider my life a borrowed one.

121
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,602
I'm going to protect her.

122
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,318
CENTER FOR MISSING CHILDREN

123
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,455
Sorry.

124
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,732
Are you going like that?

125
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,668
What's with the umbrella?

126
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,706
Do you think you can fight
Min Jun-guk with that?

127
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,277
Can't you control reading people's minds?

128
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,646
You do it too often.

129
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,949
Is it okay to go to work like that?
Don't you have a trial?

130
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,852
I don't care. I don't want to die.

131
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,455
Shall I learn self-defense?

132
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,993
You should carry it,
not hang it on your back.

133
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,096
It could be over
before you even pull it out.

134
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,000
If someone attacks from behind,
strike him like this very quickly.

135
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,336
If there's no umbrella,
use your elbow like this.

136
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,605
Like this?

137
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,274
Or you can kick the shin,

138
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,442
pressure point like this.

139
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,779
Shin, pressure point, stomach.

140
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,849
-What's next?
-Next...

141
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,651
Just run. Run for your life.

142
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,625
When you met Min Jun-guk yesterday,

143
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,962
did you read his mind?

144
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,865
Yes.

145
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,400
Was he the one

146
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,170
who left the cell phone here?

147
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,139
Yes.

148
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,676
Is he going to seek revenge on me?

149
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,945
He won't do anything right away.

150
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,148
The police are watching,
and I'm here, too.

151
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,350
You, too?

152
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,921
Let's go. We'll be late.

153
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,429
I can't get the girl because of him.

154
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,069
Will this way be easier?

155
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,004
HYE-SEONG CHICKEN

156
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:05,945
MOM

157
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,080
Yes, Mom.

158
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,383
About that date that I told you about.

159
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,552
Do you want me to set a date?

160
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,920
"Date"?

161
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,858
What's he like?
Did you meet him? Is he okay?

162
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,292
Of course.

163
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:24,129
He doesn't let on that he has money.

164
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,598
He seemed really modest.

165
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,300
No, that's not what I'm asking.

166
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,568
Is he big?

167
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,437
Do you think he can fight?
Does he have a nice body?

168
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,638
"Body"?

169
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,108
Hey, didn't you say money
was the most important thing for a guy?

170
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,612
I've changed. It's body over money now.

171
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,113
What's he like?

172
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,983
I'm not sure
since I didn't strip his clothes off.

173
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,288
But he seems to have sturdy-looking arms.

174
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,056
Okay.

175
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,359
I'll make some time next week.

176
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:54,927
Bye.

177
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,333
Will I feel safer if I have a boyfriend?

178
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,272
Give me your phone.

179
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:08,774
Why?

180
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,843
GPS APP

181
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,012
I'm downloading a location-finder app.

182
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:15,915
What is that?

183
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,052
If we both have this,
we can tell where the other is.

184
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,353
Really?

185
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,124
Does that mean you can find me
if something happens?

186
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,191
Yes.

187
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,829
You seem like a CSI agent.
You look really smart.

188
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,999
I'm not smart.
You're just behind the times.

189
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,471
You have a knack for speaking very rudely.

190
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,714
-What do you want?
-I'll have an I.A.

191
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,217
One iced Americano and a red iced tea.

192
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,821
-And please put the points on this.
-Yes, sir.

193
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,159
-Where are Mr. Cha and Ms. Jjang?
-They've gone to meet the twins.

194
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,928
That is a very complicated case.

195
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,398
At first, they both said
they had stabbed the man, right?

196
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,568
Yes. And then the younger one said
that he had stabbed the man.

197
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,071
And the older one said that he hadn't.

198
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,474
And now they are both saying
they didn't stab him?

199
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:19,979
Ms. Jang persuaded the younger one
not to take the fall.

200
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:24,249
Why do they keep changing
their statements?

201
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,351
It's confusing.

202
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,952
I know.

203
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,488
You have a conviction
for theft from two years ago.

204
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:34,293
Pil-seung was whining so much
that he didn't have tuition money.

205
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,161
So I stole from a few empty houses.

206
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,599
Your brother must be pretty smart.

207
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,802
He had an IQ of 152
when he was in middle school.

208
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,540
He is really effing smart.

209
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,910
Why did your brother steal?

210
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,946
He used to be really reliable.

211
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,882
But then he started to gamble.

212
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,753
Oh, please don't mention his gambling
at the trial.

213
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,921
Sure. I'll think about it.

214
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:07,793
So why is your brother trying to put this
all on you?

215
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,728
He just hates me.

216
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:13,599
He always tells me he wants me
out of his life.

217
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,636
So he is trying to put you in jail
with this case?

218
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,737
Yes.

219
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,040
I have a theft conviction.

220
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,842
Everyone will think that I did it.

221
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,679
So why is your brother trying
to put this all on you, Pil-seung?

222
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,750
He was always jealous of my life.

223
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,486
I went to college
and I have no convictions.

224
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,623
He said we have the same face,
but our lives are so different.

225
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,295
He was jealous of everything I have.

226
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:44,763
So...

227
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,167
is that why your girlfriend...

228
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,342
So one stabbed the victim,
and the other stopped him.

229
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,546
But the prosecutor is saying
that it was premeditated.

230
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,648
And indicted them as co-principals,

231
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,418
even though it's obvious one stopping it
on the security camera video.

232
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,255
You said they're twins.
It may be hard to distinguish who did it.

233
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,391
Mr. Cha and Ms. Jang are both

234
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,793
going to enter not-guilty pleas.

235
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,896
This is going to become complicated.

236
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,466
One of the two killed a man.

237
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:24,002
But both of them
are saying they each didn't do it.

238
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,639
And they're twins
who look exactly the same.

239
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,009
If they can't figure out
who the killer is,

240
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,179
then it could become an unsolved case,
like the Itaewon-murder case.

241
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,648
And both of them could be released.

242
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:41,186
The prosecutor charged them
as co-principals to stop that.

243
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,391
Isn't that Ms. Jang?

244
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,026
You're right.

245
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,529
Why does she have an umbrella?

246
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,331
Did they say it would rain today?

247
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:55,033
No, I don't think so.

248
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,270
There's Mr. Cha.

249
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,608
He is going to give her a scare.

250
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,511
He is a very interesting guy.

251
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,279
Did you hear

252
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,348
what happened at the team dinner?

253
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,185
Mr. Cha carried Ms. Jang on his back.

254
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,854
They might become a couple one day.

255
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,956
They could fall in love.

256
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,159
I envy their age.

257
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,052
Shouldn't you get an X-ray?

258
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,789
I'm okay. Besides, I have a trial soon.

259
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,526
Don't you feel bad about this, Ms. Jang?

260
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,828
Not at all.

261
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,631
You shouldn't have scared me like that.

262
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:03,168
It was a violation of my hearing organs,

263
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,403
so it's an assault.

264
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,639
And my action was self-defense
against Mr. Cha's assault.

265
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,408
That was too much.

266
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,144
What would you do

267
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,012
if it's broken down there
and he can't have kids?

268
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,282
This isn't just any injury.
This is a serious injury.

269
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,917
It's not a serious injury.

270
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,687
I checked it and it was fine.

271
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,656
See?

272
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,725
He says it's fine.

273
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,229
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you would be so surprised.

274
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,400
Mr. Cha, you are
too nice for your own good.

275
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,670
You're taking her side
and you're apologizing, too.

276
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,140
I should call you Saint Cha from now on.

277
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,244
Okay, I'll apologize.

278
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,813
I was wrong, I'm sorry. Okay?

279
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,315
Is that an apology? Is that an apology?

280
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,451
She would slap the person next to her,

281
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,286
even though she was the one
who passed gas.

282
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,054
And for this case,

283
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,090
they're not co-principals.

284
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,424
I think so, too.

285
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,828
Good. The older one is the one who did it.

286
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,364
No, that's not right.
The younger one did it.

287
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,666
Never mind. Let's not say any more.

288
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,169
Aren't you going to eat with us?

289
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,804
No! I have plans.

290
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,642
I have no strength in my legs.

291
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,920
Are we close enough to eat together?

292
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,457
We lived in the same house
and went to the same school.

293
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,426
We could say we're close.

294
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,797
-What are you up to?
-Nothing.

295
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,335
Did you meet the defendants
in the twin case?

296
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,838
Did you come to ask that?

297
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:52,744
Be honest with me.
You don't know who did it, right?

298
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:57,649
You're scared you would be wrong
if you picked one of them.

299
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,052
And you have to let them both go
if you say you don't know.

300
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,222
Isn't that why you charged them
as co-principals?

301
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,927
Yes. How did you know?

302
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,029
What?

303
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,498
Are you admitting that you made a mistake?

304
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,368
Yes, I'm admitting it.

305
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,770
You're right again.

306
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:22,841
I think I'm wrong.

307
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,777
Are you teasing me?

308
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,113
No, I'm not teasing you.

309
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,414
Why do you think so?

310
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,549
I'm not stupid.

311
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,485
Who would believe you
when you're looking at me like that?

312
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,421
Right? Don't you think so?

313
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,124
Jeong Pil-seung, Jeong Pil-jae.

314
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,727
They both looked at me like this.

315
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,529
They raised the corners of their mouths...

316
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,299
and the middle of their brows.

317
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,571
That was their expression when they said
they weren't joint offenders.

318
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,440
Do you think they were telling the truth?

319
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,875
Do you think so?

320
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,445
So that's the evidence you have?

321
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,748
Are you going to get them with that?

322
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,917
No. I have another strategy.

323
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:08,920
What is that?

324
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,990
-Will you help?
-Yes.

325
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,093
No, I don't want to.

326
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,495
Why should I do that?

327
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,777
There she goes again.

328
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,183
What is her strategy?

329
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,386
Is Do-yeon just lying?

330
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:45,023
What if she has something?
This is driving me crazy.

331
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,826
Shall I tell them to confess? No, no.

332
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,699
When are you going home?
I'll come to pick you up.

333
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:59,137
That's right. I have my stalker.

334
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,977
I have a favor to ask of you.

335
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,249
OKAY, CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE DONE

336
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,701
"Okay, call me when you're done.

337
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,603
I'll come and pick you up."

338
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:36,441
Teacher! Park Su-ha was texting.

339
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,642
Hey!

340
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,813
You guys have such great lives.

341
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,649
Not only are you texting,
but you're dating someone.

342
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,055
-I envy you.
-It's not like that.

343
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,724
Don't you dare leave detention.

344
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,526
I'm going to keep an eye on you.

345
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,062
Sir.

346
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,731
Can I have the phone?
I'm waiting for an important call.

347
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,067
I'm confiscating it.
Take it after detention.

348
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,609
I can't believe this.

349
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,311
COURT OF KOREA

350
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,149
I am glad that I brought an umbrella.

351
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,728
Ms. Jjang! Ms. Jjang!

352
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:34,799
Hey...

353
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:52,517
What? Were you at court as well?

354
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,986
Yes, I followed you from way back.

355
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,522
Why didn't you call me?
We could have shared my umbrella.

356
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,825
I didn't want to surprise you
as I had done before.

357
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,598
Is something going on?

358
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,366
What?

359
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,201
You look nervous

360
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,904
as if you're being chased by someone.

361
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:14,239
I'm worried.

362
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,543
-It's not like that.
-Okay, then. Let's go in.

363
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,844
Hold on.

364
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,981
About hitting you before.

365
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:27,652
I think you gave me a reason to hit you.

366
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,022
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

367
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,991
But I also admit

368
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,628
that I overreacted a little.

369
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:41,066
So I'll apologize. I'm sorry.

370
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,935
Sure. I'll be more careful.

371
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,941
Could you spare me some time?

372
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,244
I need to talk to you about the twin case.

373
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,213
YEONJU DISTRICT PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

374
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,815
Did the prosecutor say she has a strategy?

375
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:00,518
Yes. Can you guess what it is?

376
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,189
There was no blood trace.

377
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,959
Nor any fingerprints. What could it be?

378
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,795
Are you close friends with Seo Do-yeon?

379
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:14,399
No, I don't like her.
Not liking isn't even enough.

380
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,334
Just hearing her voice
gives me goosebumps,

381
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,671
just like fingernails scratching
a chalkboard!

382
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:22,941
We're not close.

383
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,778
But she came to eat with you?

384
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,647
Yes.

385
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,950
Goodness. She doesn't have a strategy.

386
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,852
She is totally bluffing.

387
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,323
I thought so, too. But you never know.

388
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,393
She wouldn't tell you
if she had something.

389
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,528
She is telling you she has something

390
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,163
because she doesn't.

391
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,865
But still...

392
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,935
Don't be shaken or anxious.

393
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:55,106
An excited bull only sees the red cloth
and not the matador.

394
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:59,310
The prosecutor is waving
a red cloth to affect you, so...

395
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:03,114
That means I'm a bull.

396
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,719
I should get mad.
But why am I not getting mad?

397
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,525
First my eyes and now my brain.

398
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,060
-Ouch.
-What should I do?

399
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,429
Ms. Jjang.

400
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,399
Jinx.

401
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,301
What are you doing?

402
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,772
I feel the same way as you.

403
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,307
So, "jinx."

404
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,109
Don't you know "jinx"?

405
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,246
Oh, that.

406
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,881
I know.

407
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:45,724
I must be crazy. Shoot.

408
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,112
What's with stalker boy?

409
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,547
He isn't answering his phone.

410
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,385
It's early enough to go home alone.

411
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:24,829
Why aren't you leaving?

412
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,032
I'm going to leave.

413
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,871
It's still raining.
I don't have an umbrella.

414
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,474
Ms. Jjang, can I borrow your umbrella?

415
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,277
No. What about me?

416
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,112
This is what we can do.

417
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:44,149
First, we go to your place together
with this umbrella.

418
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,385
And when we get there,
you can lend it to me.

419
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,187
What do you think? Okay, right?

420
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,256
What is this? Is he coming on to me?

421
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,759
Do I look so easy?

422
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,362
You should hold the umbrella.

423
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,097
Yes.

424
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,070
Let's go.

425
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,545
EVENING DETENTION
HOW CAN YOU SLEEP WITH GRADES LIKE THAT?

426
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,267
Park Su-ha.

427
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,556
My stomach! My stomach!

428
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,626
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong with her?

429
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,629
I think I have stomach cramps.

430
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,731
Shit, that hurts!

431
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,801
Someone please take me to the nurse.

432
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,338
Hey! Are you okay? I'll take you!

433
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,342
Please, please take me.

434
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,879
-What are you doing? Take her.
-What? Yes.

435
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,383
My stomach!

436
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,226
You can put me down now.

437
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,965
I thought my arms were going to fall off.

438
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,535
Shouldn't you thank me
for getting you out of there?

439
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,271
I never asked for help.

440
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,275
Are you going to meet the lawyer?

441
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,343
Yes, she said she needs to talk to me.

442
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,717
Here's your phone.
I got it when I collapsed.

443
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,153
Thank you so much.

444
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,555
I'll buy you something tomorrow.
I have to go now.

445
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,724
Su-ha...

446
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,874
-The number you have dialed...
-Why isn't she answering?

447
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,509
Is she still at work?

448
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,044
PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

449
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,296
She isn't there.

450
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,799
That's right. I can trace her.

451
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,603
136 YEONJU-RO

452
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,341
She is almost home already.

453
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,876
Let's do it this way.

454
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,645
Let's try to get

455
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,915
"co-principals" off the table first.

456
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:07,418
Then we can figure out
who is innocent or not.

457
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,989
-Before we do that...
-How should I say goodbye?

458
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,993
Should I bow and say "goodbye"?

459
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,961
That's too stiff.

460
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,999
Or should I wave my hand and say "bye"?

461
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,168
No, that would be too much.

462
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,705
What is better? What should I do?

463
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,442
We should meet tomorrow
and match our lips together.

464
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,543
What?

465
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,080
Why do we have to match that?

466
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:40,785
We're on one team,
so we should be saying the same thing.

467
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,921
Oh, that.

468
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,056
Yes.

469
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,425
Of course we should.

470
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,296
It's raining really hard.

471
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,939
KO SEONG-BIN

472
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,378
-Yes.
-Did you meet the lawyer?

473
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,915
No, not yet. Why?

474
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,819
It's about the first love
you told me about.

475
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,588
It's the lawyer, right?

476
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,591
What an odd question.

477
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,828
Do you still like her?

478
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,366
Of course not. It was a long time ago.

479
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,936
Then why are you so concerned about her?

480
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:34,872
Well, that...

481
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,042
It's because I owe her something.

482
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,779
I don't like to owe things.
I'll repay her and disappear.

483
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,882
Oh. I see.

484
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,051
Is that why you called?

485
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,087
No.

486
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,592
I called to tell you that I like you.

487
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,162
I know. You told the whole school.

488
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:06,370
No, not like that.
I really like you a lot.

489
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,376
I realized that today.

490
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,188
I don't care if you don't like me.
I don't mind having a crush.

491
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:28,392
But when you look at someone else,

492
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:32,597
think about someone else,
and have feelings for someone,

493
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,833
I feel strange. It's not okay.

494
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,207
My heart hurts when I think about you.

495
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,009
I guess it sort of hurts.

496
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,012
And it also races a lot, too.

497
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,251
I think I really like you a lot.

498
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,919
Hello? Hello, ma'am.

499
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,921
I need to tell you something.

500
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,423
So I don't think I should go

501
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,492
on the blind date you had mentioned.

502
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,395
No, it's not like that.

503
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,164
But there is someone
who piques my interest.

504
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,968
I'm sorry. I know you're trying to help.

505
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,737
I think it's such a shame.

506
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,941
She is my friend's daughter,
so I know her very well.

507
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,177
She is very pretty and a lawyer.

508
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,047
She grew up as an only daughter.

509
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,218
I think she would be a great fit for you.

510
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,754
My gosh. What a shame.

511
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,325
Call me if you change your mind.

512
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,161
I'm not going to give up on you.

513
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:15,600
Yes, thanks for calling. Sure.

514
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,735
Geez...

515
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,337
Who are you talking about?

516
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,107
"Pretty," "an only daughter,"
and "a lawyer"? Who is it?

517
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,609
Jang Hye-seong.

518
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,711
You said it's a friend's daughter.

519
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:31,082
If I said it was my daughter,
it would be too much.

520
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:35,286
I had this planned,
but it's not working out.

521
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,855
Did you tell Hye-seong that it's Mr. Cha?

522
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,223
Of course not.

523
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,826
If I did, she would throw a fit.

524
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,495
She has such a temper.

525
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,999
I need to have a subtle plan
to get her to date someone.

526
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,867
Is that "a subtle plan"?

527
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,068
Of course.

528
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:55,673
Relationships don't just
form naturally these days.

529
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,009
You must really like that Mr. Cha.

530
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,410
He is really great.

531
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,846
He is the second son
of a family that owns a sauna.

532
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:05,416
He is a lawyer
and he has a great personality.

533
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,885
He also has very sturdy arms.

534
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,087
But here is the real reason.

535
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,626
-What is that?
-Hold on a moment.

536
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,929
"Man is wood and woman is fire."

537
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,866
"It's as though you've gained a fan
in the summer.

538
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,735
The two love each other
as a married couple.

539
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,371
And they will live a long life together."

540
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,473
I have to make sure he doesn't get away.

541
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,477
-You got their fortunes read?
-Yes.

542
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,548
In this world, speed is everything.

543
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,158
Is that you?

544
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,528
Why didn't you answer your phone?
You said you'd walk me home.

545
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,369
Why are you so wet?
Didn't you take an umbrella?

546
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,385
Stalker, I'm making savory pancakes,
do you want some?

547
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,619
I'm making some for you, too.

548
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,223
Change your clothes. You'll catch a cold.

549
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,793
Wear the blue t-shirt with Mickey Mouse
on it that's in the top drawer.

550
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,328
It should fit you.

551
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,231
Can you come to court
at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow?

552
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:30,668
I have a really
complicated case this time.

553
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,303
They're twins.

554
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:36,240
One stabbed a man,
and the other tried to stop him.

555
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,443
But we can't tell
which one is the murderer.

556
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,145
They look so much alike.

557
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,081
Where is the salt?

558
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:51,322
So you should come to court
and find out who did it.

559
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:55,893
If they weren't under arrest,
you could come and meet them.

560
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,662
But the only way for you
to see them is to come to court.

561
00:39:58,829 --> 00:39:59,997
Can you make some time?

562
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,441
Why haven't you changed yet?

563
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,676
I called, too. You didn't answer.

564
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:15,579
I don't want to eat,
and I don't have time tomorrow.

565
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,722
What's wrong with him?

566
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,898
STALKER (12 MISSED CALLS)

567
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,102
So he did call.

568
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:49,914
Hello.

569
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:53,784
What brings you here?

570
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,821
We have a few questions
about the assault case.

571
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,324
-I see.
-Are you going somewhere?

572
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,026
Yes.

573
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,896
I thought I should leave.

574
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,165
Leave? Why so suddenly?

575
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,735
The boy who assaulted me, Park Su-ha...

576
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:16,173
I did something horrible
to him ten years ago.

577
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:17,975
We heard.

578
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,579
I realized that he must not like
that I live nearby.

579
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:26,050
He will be reminded of me
and would want to seek revenge.

580
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,519
So I think I should leave.

581
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,721
Have you decided where to go?

582
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,958
Thankfully, there is
someone who will hire me.

583
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:38,095
It's a little far from here,
but I'm going to try my best.

584
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,732
What were you going to ask me?

585
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:44,401
Nothing. It's okay.

586
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,338
-Thank you.
-Bye.

587
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,610
If you happen to meet him,
please tell him I'm sorry.

588
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,512
Sure, I will.

589
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:04,755
That guy is leaving for no reason.

590
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,525
He probably wanted
to make a new life here.

591
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,859
I know.

592
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,396
What should we do
about Ms. Jang's phone case?

593
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,299
-Should we keep investigating?
-But nothing went missing.

594
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,735
-Yes.
-End it.

595
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:36,754
HYE-SEONG CHICKEN EVENT

596
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,458
Where did this poster go?

597
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:45,763
Did it fall off?

598
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,808
FOR PUBLIC DEFENDER JANG HYE-SEONG
9,900 WON CHICKEN EVENT

599
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,685
Stalker! Aren't you going to school?

600
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,555
Are you upset?

601
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,292
Okay, I admit we were both at fault.

602
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:19,229
You didn't answer your phone first
so you're at fault.

603
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,198
I admit that I didn't answer either.

604
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,400
That's my fault. Okay?

605
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:28,572
Anyway, please don't be mad
and come to my trial today.

606
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:32,576
I was able to win
the last one because of you.

607
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:36,013
I was able to do it
because you were there to say I was right.

608
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:39,016
So please come to this trial, too.

609
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,118
Are you listening?

610
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,024
I feel at ease when I see your eyes.
I need you...

611
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,362
I must be crazy. That was too much.

612
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:52,963
Hey!

613
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,233
I didn't mean that.
Pretend you didn't hear it.

614
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:02,773
What a relief.

615
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:05,943
Oh my gosh.

616
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,214
-What are you doing here?
-We're late. Let's go.

617
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,382
Did you...

618
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:14,051
Did you hear what I just said?

619
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:15,919
What?

620
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,055
Nothing.

621
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,659
Can you come to my trial today?

622
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:22,926
No.

623
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:24,928
Hey, just come!

624
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:29,967
Please?

625
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,103
Say you're attending a work-study program
at the courthouse.

626
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,008
Hey!

627
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:45,549
We used to get extra credit
for work-study programs.

628
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,518
Don't you have that anymore?

629
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,888
Isn't that important
for when you go to college?

630
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:52,856
Come on.

631
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:56,126
Hello, Ms. Jang. You're still at home.

632
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,696
Hello.

633
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,965
We thought you might be worried,
but Min Jun-guk has moved.

634
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,902
-Really?
-Yes, we just saw him off.

635
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,838
He said he didn't think
he should live close to you.

636
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,808
He said that he should live far away.

637
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,644
Did you check where he is going?
What about his address?

638
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,813
You've done enough.

639
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,348
He said he is moving to avoid you two.

640
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,087
Anyway, you can forget
about him and live in peace.

641
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:26,390
It looks as though he is going
to a place where he knows no one.

642
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,592
I felt bad for him.

643
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,127
What do you mean?

644
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:35,232
Thank you. We have to get going.

645
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,769
-Let's go.
-What? Okay.

646
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,904
Have a nice day.

647
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:43,540
You won't have to see
Min Jun-guk ever again.

648
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:48,579
Can I...

649
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,081
Can I believe him?

650
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:54,585
No.

651
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,695
Crystal. Give me your hand.

652
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,066
You're so good.

653
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,036
You're a cool girl.

654
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:18,308
So your name will be "Crystal"
from now on.

655
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:20,744
Is this about that date again?

656
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,748
Hey! Didn't you say you would go
on this date?

657
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,218
You said you would consider it
as a back-up.

658
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,120
Did I?

659
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:35,125
But I think I should just
concentrate on my career.

660
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,995
If I work hard here,

661
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,564
maybe I will meet someone
to spend my life with.

662
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:45,369
Is there someone you like already?

663
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:49,039
There you go again. It's not like that.

664
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,944
I meant that I could meet someone
while I work here.

665
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,681
Anyway, I don't want to go on a date,

666
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,350
so please let him down gently for me.

667
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,819
Hey!

668
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:04,888
My arrhythmia keeps turning up
because of you.

669
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,658
What does that have to do with me?

670
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,761
My heart can't keep up

671
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,696
with how you change your mind!

672
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:14,431
I'm hanging up!

673
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,703
Calm down.

674
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,872
Please calm down.

675
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,408
I can't believe her!

676
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:29,246
Calm down. You have to calm down.

677
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:34,384
Calm down. What am I to do?

678
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:39,189
Do I have to give up
on this subtle plan of mine?

679
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,193
What a shame. I think it's such a shame.

680
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,031
HYE-SEONG CHICKEN

681
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,915
HELP WANTED: DELIVERY MAN
FOR HYE-SEONG CHICKEN

682
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:20,931
Hello.

683
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:25,402
I came because of the job.
We spoke yesterday.

684
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:28,605
Oh! You're Kim Gil-dong, right?

685
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:32,175
Yes, that's right. Hello, Ms. Eo.

686
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:40,083
Hold on! Hold on.

687
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:52,062
Did you close the door on purpose?

688
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:53,363
No.

689
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:57,067
-I didn't see you.
-What a loser.

690
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,269
You can't fool me.

691
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,371
I don't believe
that you have proof either.

692
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,941
And I'm going to overturn

693
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,743
your co-principal indictment.

694
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:10,614
Did you read precedent cases?

695
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,482
Of course.

696
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,453
The 2006 Yeongchi-dong murder.

697
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:20,157
The 2009 Yeongwol murder,
rape and concealment case.

698
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:23,593
The 2010 Moksan-dong
homicide by robbery case.

699
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,431
The Moksan-dong case
is similar to this one.

700
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,902
Two brothers were involved
and both pleaded not guilty to murder.

701
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:34,504
But they got 15 years
as co-principals, right?

702
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,340
The judge was a fool.

703
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:38,375
Really?

704
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,212
Did you check the judge's name?

705
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,347
The name?

706
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:45,615
It's Kim Gong-suk.

707
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:47,851
He is our judge, too.

708
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,997
She's right. It's Judge Kim Gong-suk.

709
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:01,531
I can't believe this.

710
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,967
How could he just try the case with both
as co-principals?

711
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,268
He probably couldn't be bothered.

712
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,304
There was no proof
and both pleaded not guilty.

713
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,139
I think he even extended the sentence
for contempt.

714
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,075
What if he does that again?

715
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:13,477
I know.

716
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:16,646
Okay, class, this is the criminal court.

717
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,615
Do you know what a criminal case is?

718
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:22,019
Yes, it's crimes like
murder, robbery and theft.

719
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,525
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

720
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,360
Jinx!

721
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:45,108
From looking at the indictment,
this seems like a complicated case.

722
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:49,079
They're identical twins
and I couldn't tell them apart.

723
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:52,082
Just think of it as tough beef.

724
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:55,685
We have to quickly swallow it.
Chewing on it will ruin our teeth.

725
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:58,288
The prosecutor indicted them
as co-principals.

726
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:01,425
Yes, they see each other every day.

727
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,260
They probably knew about the knife.

728
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,162
I think we can see them as co-principals.

729
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,398
Let's get this over.
How about blowfish soup tonight?

730
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:11,301
-There's a new place.
-Yes, sure.

731
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,172
The judges are here.

732
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,407
All rise.

733
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,851
-Cool.
-He is so amazing.

734
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:29,419
Please be seated.

735
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,927
IN SESSION

736
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,197
Wow, they really look alike.

737
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,165
They even have the same hairstyle.

738
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,401
Defendants Jeong Pil-seung
and Jeong Pil-jae

739
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:47,304
conspired to steal money at one location.

740
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,806
When the victim Ham Ki-su turned up,

741
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:53,310
the defendant Jeong Pil-seung
stabbed the victim with a knife.

742
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,746
Jeong Pil-jae did try to stop his brother

743
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,483
at the crime scene.

744
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,119
However, before that,

745
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:05,322
he knew his brother was
in possession of a knife.

746
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:08,558
And he could've predicted
that murder was afoot.

747
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,560
And that establishes them
as co-principals.

748
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:23,106
Defendants. The term "co-principals"
is difficult, right?

749
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,443
It means that more than two people were

750
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,578
at the same place, at the same time,

751
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:31,948
and committed a crime together.

752
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,251
So they will be punished together.

753
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,387
Even if one killed and the other stole,

754
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:40,624
they will both be punished
for killing and stealing.

755
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:41,892
Okay?

756
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,429
The vocabulary is too difficult.

757
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:50,200
We should explain to the defendants
so they can understand.

758
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,402
Such small considerations

759
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,871
build trust in the judiciary.

760
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,375
-Cool.
-He's cool.

761
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:13,089
Jeong Pil-seung's counsel should go first.

762
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:16,359
Yes.

763
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:21,464
Defendant Jeong Pil-seung is pleading
not guilty to the charges.

764
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:30,373
Jeong Pil-seung never
stabbed the victim, Ham Ki-su.

765
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,211
And he didn't know
that his co-defendant had a knife.

766
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:36,913
So he is not a co-principal
in the homicide.

767
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,883
Are you denying the facts
in the indictment?

768
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,551
Yes.

769
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:46,456
Jeong Pil-seung only went with his brother
to steal tuition money.

770
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:50,627
He did not expect
his brother to have brought a knife.

771
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,429
Hey!

772
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,297
You stabbed him and I stopped you!

773
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,233
How dare you lie like that?

774
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:57,734
Please sit down.

775
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,738
Look, Your Honor. I didn't do it.

776
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:04,808
He is trying to put it on me
because I have a conviction.

777
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,577
-I really didn't know.
-Please.

778
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:10,614
Please sit!

779
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,516
Please be quiet.

780
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:17,354
If you speak up like that again,
you will be removed.

781
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,156
Awesome.

782
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:21,625
Please continue.

783
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,596
Does the prosecutor have evidence
I don't know about?

784
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,338
I fully understand

785
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:38,375
why you charged them as co-principals.

786
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:40,810
Someone was killed,

787
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,713
and there is footage from the crime scene.

788
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,250
But you couldn't figure out
which one of them did it.

789
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,121
As you can see,
they look exactly the same.

790
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:56,126
And you couldn't let them both go
because they can't be told apart.

791
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,396
A man was murdered because of this crime.

792
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,732
That's why the prosecutor indicted them
as co-principals.

793
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,934
They were put together

794
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,736
because one knew about the other's knife.

795
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:10,006
But both of them are claiming

796
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,175
not to have known about the other's knife.

797
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,911
One of them must be lying.

798
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:16,579
That means one

799
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,115
of them must be telling the truth.

800
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:20,550
And this also means--

801
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:24,454
That the one telling the truth
will have to go

802
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,156
to prison in vain.

803
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:30,727
I believe it's the tribunal's mission
to stop it.

804
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:34,831
Of course, this will be
a long and hard fight.

805
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:37,300
It was a fight

806
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,502
that even the wise prosecutor gave up.

807
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:49,446
But I believe the judges
should not give up on that fight.

808
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:53,149
No, I believe you already agree with me.

809
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,553
The time spent revealing
the truth and protecting justice

810
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,722
is not wasted.

811
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,364
As both counsels stated,

812
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:11,000
it's hard to consider them
as co-principals.

813
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:12,736
Your Honor.

814
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,705
If one had known about the knife,

815
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,041
then there wouldn't have been the act
of stopping the action.

816
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,977
The one who stabbed the victim will
be charged with homicide by robbery.

817
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,381
The one who stopped him will be charged
with special larceny.

818
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:28,318
The prosecutor should
change the indictment

819
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,054
to homicide by robbery
and special larceny.

820
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:33,590
We will review the evidence after that.

821
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,902
Let me explain.

822
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,738
It means that we don't think

823
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:52,542
they planned this crime together.

824
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,412
So I'm asking the prosecutor

825
00:56:55,478 --> 00:57:00,016
to indict the two men separately.

826
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,086
Correcting the prosecutor's indictment

827
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,756
is part of our job.

828
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,024
Okay?

829
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,564
It's to build trust in the judiciary.

830
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:43,193
Mr. Cha!

831
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:45,962
When shall we have our next meeting?

832
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:48,097
What meeting?

833
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,466
The twin case.

834
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:51,234
We've succeeded the first phase.

835
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,069
Let's work on a new plan now.

836
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,372
-We have to work separately.
-What?

837
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:59,809
It's a fight with you now,
not the prosecutor anymore.

838
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:01,945
Evidence unfavorable to me

839
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:03,913
could be favorable to you.

840
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:06,015
So we can't share evidence.

841
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,253
You do have a point.

842
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:13,323
I should get going. I have another trial.

843
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:22,866
Never mind.

844
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,401
Do you think I like working with you?

845
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,559
Do you know what you did?

846
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:51,961
I know.

847
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,464
Dozens of police officers worked
on this case.

848
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,400
There is no evidence about
who stabbed him or who stopped it.

849
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:58,668
I know.

850
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:00,803
You do?

851
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:03,973
Both of them could be found innocent.

852
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:09,312
But if I didn't do anything,
both of them could have gone to prison.

853
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:13,016
How can someone who murdered be released
as an innocent man?

854
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,619
Isn't it better
than someone innocent going to prison?

855
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,155
Even if you miss ten criminals,

856
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,691
do not punish an innocent man.

857
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:25,361
Didn't you hear that enough
at the Judicial Research Institute?

858
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:30,867
Do you know
who should leave the world of law?

859
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,103
A lawyer who always loses?

860
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,372
A judge who always makes wrong judgments?

861
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:37,840
Or a prosecutor

862
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,677
who always makes the wrong charges?

863
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,312
Shut it.

864
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,181
It's none of the above.

865
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:49,052
The biggest problem is people like you
who won't admit they're wrong.

866
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,288
Remember what I said before?

867
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:55,959
Apologize to my mother if you lose to me.

868
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:59,062
You'll be keeping that promise soon.

869
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:00,496
Be prepared.

870
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:06,235
You were amazing Jang Hye-seong.
You're so charismatic.

871
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:12,809
Hey, Stalker.

872
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:16,846
I was looking for you.

873
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,881
Let's go. I'll buy you dinner.

874
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,914
I was so nervous before.

875
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:55,251
I thought Do-yeon
might have hidden some evidence.

876
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:57,854
But when you said there wasn't any,

877
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,156
I became calm and could speak freely.

878
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:03,059
It felt good to be defending.

879
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,229
You asked about
the firework incident, right?

880
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:07,964
Yes.

881
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:10,933
Someone shot fireworks
toward Do-yeon's eyes.

882
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:14,237
And one of Do-yeon's eyes
was badly injured.

883
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:17,507
Do-yeon said I had done it,
and I said I hadn't.

884
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:19,742
People believed her.

885
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:21,277
And I got expelled.

886
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:25,214
And ten years later,
we meet again as lawyer and prosecutor.

887
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,751
I didn't really want to become a lawyer.

888
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:33,022
And I didn't know
why I had become one either.

889
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:37,260
But I knew
when I saw Do-yeon's expression.

890
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:45,902
I became a lawyer because of that moment.

891
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:48,171
To see her expression.

892
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,107
-Are you that happy?
-Yes.

893
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:53,976
-Why?
-I was right and she was wrong.

894
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:57,947
What if you were wrong...

895
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,349
and she was right?

896
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,322
What do you mean?

897
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:10,426
You're wrong. The prosecutor is right.

898
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:13,930
What?

899
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,368
YEONJU TUNNEL

900
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:34,550
What do you mean?

901
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:39,388
I'm wrong and Do-yeon is right?

902
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,431
The twins planned
to kill that man together.

903
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:50,299
They're co-principals.

904
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,679
They're co-principals?

905
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,617
You're lying, right?

906
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:11,287
Tell me it's a lie!

907
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,796
