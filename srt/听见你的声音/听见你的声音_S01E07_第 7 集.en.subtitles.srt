1
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,068
Enough about the guy
whose family owns a sauna.

2
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,103
I don't plan on getting married
for a while.

3
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:42,375
"Why?" So I can make a lot of money
and let you spend it all.

4
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,210
Hold on.

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,390
It's nothing. I thought
I was being followed, but I was wrong.

6
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,932
Text me your account number.

7
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,101
I'll send you my whole paycheck!

8
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,345
Help me! Mom!

9
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,883
Hye-seong! Hye-seong!
What's going on, Hye-seong?

10
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:25,652
Mom!

11
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,830
Mom! Help me!

12
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,605
Hye-seong, Jang Hye-seong. Answer me!

13
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,073
Hye-seong!

14
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,808
Hye-seong!

15
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,548
How can a dream feel so vivid and real?

16
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,020
Why did I dream such a dream?

17
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,128
It's true!
My mom's dreams have never been wrong.

18
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,497
Are you the type to believe superstitions?

19
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,466
Not at all. I really hate fortune-telling.

20
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,868
But her dreams are that accurate.

21
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,072
-Hey. Help me out here.
-My bag is heavy too.

22
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,608
So how good are her dreams?

23
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,945
In one of her dreams, I had a nosebleed
that filled a bathtub.

24
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,715
They say bleeding
in a dream is really auspicious.

25
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,583
I got into university
after she had that dream.

26
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,620
After she dreamed of a tooth falling out,
my grandma passed away.

27
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,523
I had my mom sell me her pig dream
for 10,000 won.

28
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,125
That's when I got selected and hired
as a public defender.

29
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,793
It's all coincidence.

30
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,599
I really wonder
what this bad dream is about.

31
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,336
Me? Or Mom?

32
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,842
My bus is here. I'm going first.

33
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,224
Why are you here? This isn't your bus.

34
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,760
-I'll go with you to your office.
-Why?

35
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,564
Is it because of my mom's dream?
Are you worried about me?

36
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,000
You wanted me to carry your papers.
Shall I just get off then?

37
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:25,104
No, it's not like that.
But you might be late for school.

38
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,242
It's exam week. I can be a little late.

39
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,547
You don't have to repay a debt to me.

40
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,083
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,419
I heard you're by my side
because you feel obligated.

42
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,622
Seong-bin told me.

43
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,825
She said you don't like feeling
like you owe me a debt.

44
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,461
Why is she talking nonsense?

45
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,998
You're not beholden to me,
so there's nothing to settle up.

46
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,702
I would have testified
even if it were someone else.

47
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,204
And I didn't do it to lord it over you.

48
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,875
I'm not by your side to repay a debt.

49
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,645
Then why?

50
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,684
-There's an empty seat.
-Where?

51
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,319
Where?

52
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,465
Ms. Jjang!

53
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,401
-Ms. Jjang!
-Oh, it's Mr. Cha.

54
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,070
No, I can't look too easy.

55
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,940
Be cool. Be a cool girl.

56
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,543
You're early.

57
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,979
Yes, I have a lot of cases today.

58
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,683
Your style isn't too bad today.

59
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,885
Yes, I tried my best.

60
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,555
I went to a hairdresser for the first time
in my life and got contact lenses.

61
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,858
And look. Today,
I'm not wearing white socks.

62
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,294
That's nothing to boast about,
just common sense.

63
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,362
Oh, really?

64
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,199
Hey, Park Su-ha. We've met before, right?

65
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,269
Is this the friend
you mentioned yesterday?

66
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,938
-The one who got in trouble?
-Oh, yes.

67
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:11,044
What if he thinks there's more to it?

68
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:17,684
My sense of responsibility is too strong,
so I took on playing the role of guardian.

69
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,721
Hey, squirt. Our plans yesterday
got messed up because of you.

70
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,057
From now on, please don't
make any trouble and calmly--

71
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,963
I'm leaving.

72
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,700
Gosh. He's pretty cool.

73
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,236
Give that to me. I'll carry it for you.

74
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,007
By the way. Here.

75
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,775
What is this?

76
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,245
It's chocolate. I bought them for you
yesterday but here is my gift today.

77
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,449
I'm not a kid. Why chocolate?

78
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,656
It's cold. You should have one, too.

79
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:08,735
Come to think of it,
our outfits today look matching.

80
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,002
Like a couple.

81
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,081
I should have worn something
besides my uniform.

82
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,525
Ms. Jang, you have a meeting later
with Lee Dae-song, right?

83
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,363
-You'll need this.
-Water? Why?

84
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,366
-Do you know him well?
-Yes, of course.

85
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,870
In the past, after defending him,
Mr. Shin had to see a doctor for a while.

86
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,808
Why? Is the defendant a mobster?

87
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,843
Or a drug dealer?

88
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,348
It's just repeat theft.
He stole free newspapers at that.

89
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,885
Free newspapers?
The ones handed out on the streets?

90
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,621
Yes. He collects recycled waste paper.

91
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,290
But he stole free newspapers
because he couldn't gather enough.

92
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,026
How is that considered a crime of theft?

93
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,728
I mean, they're free anyway.

94
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:13,099
Even free newspapers
require money to make.

95
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,135
You can take an individual copy
for yourself.

96
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,938
But if you take the whole stack,
then that's definitely theft.

97
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,544
I'm Lee Dae-song.

98
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,413
Who is Jang Hye-seong?

99
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,583
Here I am. Please come this way.

100
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,262
Let's have coffee out on the roof.

101
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,566
Very soon, it's going to become very loud
in here.

102
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,802
This is your 16th theft case.

103
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,273
And you went to jail for repeated theft.

104
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,176
You were released last year
and you did it again?

105
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,646
-It seems you'll be imprisoned again.
-I can't hear you.

106
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:05,318
It will be difficult
to avoid jail time this time around.

107
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,587
You have to settle with the victim--

108
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,155
I said, "I can't hear you."

109
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,059
It's repeat theft, so you'll go to prison.

110
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,727
You're going to jail.

111
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,196
I'm going to jail
for stealing free newspapers?

112
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,433
Yes! You can go to jail,
even for stealing free newspapers.

113
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,969
So you have to go
and settle with the victim.

114
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,505
-That's the only way to--
-I can't hear you.

115
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,810
You need to settle
with the victim to do anything at all.

116
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,518
So this is why he said I would need water.

117
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,420
How can there be no newspapers?

118
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,589
There are so many
used newspapers on the subway!

119
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:47,093
You can pick those up!
Why take those from the stand?

120
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,762
I said there weren't any newspapers.

121
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,467
No wonder you're a public defender.

122
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,536
What did you just say?

123
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,171
There's always a reason
why some things are free.

124
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:04,577
If you were any good, you would already
be a lawyer who makes lots of money.

125
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,682
I can't reason with you.

126
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:15,655
Next time, I'll call your son.
You should come with him.

127
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,356
Don't call him.

128
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,892
I can't reason with you.

129
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,661
I'll tell him to go reach an agreement!

130
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,730
-I said, don't do it!
-I will!

131
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,902
So did you call the son?

132
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,738
No, not yet.
I'll do it first thing tomorrow.

133
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,812
The old man probably won't stand for it.

134
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,350
I don't know.
I'm not talking to him anymore.

135
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,588
If I do, I'll just ruin my voice.

136
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,129
Your throat hurts. Don't talk.
Just think your thoughts.

137
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,900
That's right.
We can do that. That's great.

138
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,836
What about your mother's dream?

139
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,105
It was right, just like always.

140
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,407
I got this terrible client.

141
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,443
That's not too bad
for such a nightmare, right?

142
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,079
"Not too bad"? This is just the beginning.

143
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,915
He's going to become so much worse
when we go to trial.

144
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,719
He's so irritating. He keeps saying
that I'm a public defender.

145
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,220
What's wrong with that?

146
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,993
He says being a public defender is
why I'm insincere, poor, and unmarried.

147
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,527
What?

148
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,908
Is a war going to break out in Yeonju?
When will she eat all this?

149
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,945
It should last a month
if she puts it in the freezer.

150
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,580
Give me an ice pack.

151
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,082
Will you still do this for her
after she gets married?

152
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,319
Of course.
I'll make twice the amount then.

153
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,591
Is Hye-seong dating anyone?
She'll be 30 in two days.

154
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:03,663
I don't think so.
But there seems to be a guy.

155
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,431
Who?

156
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,099
Mr. Cha.

157
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,170
Wasn't that your wish?

158
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:16,308
You tried so hard
to get those two together.

159
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:21,280
I know. I guess they were meant to be
with each other.

160
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,049
That's good.

161
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,718
-Ms. Eo.
-Yes?

162
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:26,619
Take these.

163
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,655
-I enjoyed the food.
-It wasn't too salty?

164
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,091
Not at all. It was really good.

165
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,528
-Sure. Just ask if you want more.
-Thank you.

166
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,329
-Are there any orders yet?
-No.

167
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,465
-I'll go hand out flyers then.
-Sure, you do that.

168
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,466
-See you.
-Okay.

169
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,445
PHOTO OF MY GIRLFRIEND,
CLICK THE LINK BELOW

170
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,082
Why am I getting so many spam messages
these days?

171
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,956
Damn it.

172
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:11,297
Suspicious jerk.
Just take the bait, come on.

173
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,501
What will make him bite?

174
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,338
Don't you have to wear your uniform today?

175
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,642
It's casual-attire day.

176
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,645
-Is there such a day?
-Yes.

177
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,017
Don't bring this stuff home.

178
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,286
You fall asleep without even reading it.
It's just a nuisance.

179
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,821
I read it and then fell asleep.

180
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,428
LOCATION TRACKING

181
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,196
Who is it?

182
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,732
Go in. I'll be right there.

183
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:48,634
Okay.

184
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,904
Is it his girlfriend?

185
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,775
Hello.

186
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,677
Hi. I thought you might be waiting,
so I'm giving you a call.

187
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,946
When can you get it?

188
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,717
I don't know.
He has to click on the text first

189
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,087
for the tracking to begin,
but he's not taking the bait.

190
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,222
Please hurry. It's urgent.

191
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:14,627
Okay, when he bites, I'll text you
right away, even if it's late at night.

192
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,995
So please wait.

193
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,102
Hold on!

194
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,739
Thank you.

195
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,576
Aren't you getting in?

196
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,718
Did you walk Ms. Jjang to work again?

197
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,090
Thank you for taking care of Ms. Jjang
in this dangerous world of ours.

198
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,262
Why would you be grateful?

199
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,567
Hey, kiddo, how old are you?

200
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,172
Younger than you obviously.
Why do you want to know?

201
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,176
No reason. I want to set you up.

202
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,911
My cousin is a high-school junior.

203
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:10,015
She's smart and pretty enough
to get offers from talent agencies.

204
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,383
I already like someone.

205
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,119
Really? Who is it?

206
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,056
Do I have to tell you?

207
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,094
I've been feeling this for a while,
but you don't seem to like me.

208
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,763
Right. I don't like you.

209
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,766
Why? Did I do something wrong?

210
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,337
He seemed irritated every time
I got involved with Ms. Jjang.

211
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,440
Does he like Ms. Jjang?

212
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,342
-Yes.
-What?

213
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,780
You did do something wrong.
You're stepping on my foot right now.

214
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,983
Sorry.

215
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,990
That guy is so hard to handle.

216
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,960
Hey, you. You're in high school.
You should have more respect.

217
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,463
Call me "mister." No, call me "brother."

218
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,100
What are you doing?

219
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,334
What's going on?

220
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,104
Don't come near me.
I'm going to call the police!

221
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,840
Go away. Put that down at once!

222
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,208
I said, "Don't come near me!"

223
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,445
You're fired, you trashy lawyer!

224
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,084
Are you okay?

225
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,687
Yes.

226
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,923
Are you in your right mind?

227
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,326
-Mr. Cha.
-What on earth are you doing?

228
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,994
You almost hurt her!

229
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,096
I should ask you what you're doing!

230
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,499
Is this how a lawyer should act?

231
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,502
-Mr. Shin!
-Hello? Is this the police?

232
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,137
Yu-chang. Hang up.

233
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,007
Yu-chang, report him. This is clearly
business interference and assault.

234
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,278
Everyone stay still.

235
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,887
Excuse me. Please come and talk to me.

236
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,923
-This way.
-Mr. Shin!

237
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,395
Are you hurt?

238
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,665
No, it's just a bruise.

239
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,446
Sir, I know you're angry and feel wronged.

240
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,247
But you can't do this.

241
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:27,353
If someone gets hurt,
you'll be sent to jail for sure.

242
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,487
You'll be in big trouble.

243
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,824
You mean, the police will come
and get me again?

244
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,762
No!

245
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:43,268
That lawyer is more tolerant
than she looks.

246
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,706
She is graceful
and has a great personality.

247
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:52,578
So she will forgive you
and won't report you.

248
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,714
But don't ever do that again.

249
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,618
What? I'm not going to forgive him.

250
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:10,996
Did you hear that? He feels very sorry
for what he did to you.

251
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,267
So don't press charges.
Let's let this pass quietly,

252
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,936
and consider this
as having reached an agreement.

253
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,739
"An agreement"? I don't think so.

254
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,475
I'm going to have him charged
for business interference and assault.

255
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,346
Must you be so harsh to someone
who can barely make ends meet?

256
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,849
-Will that make you feel better?
-Yes, that's right.

257
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:34,186
I think everything should be done
according to the law.

258
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:36,755
Is that so?

259
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:42,194
"The law"? Fine.
Then I should do things by the book, too.

260
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,998
I'll go
to the Attorneys' Ethics Committee,

261
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,501
and accuse you of plotting
with the prosecutor last time

262
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,437
and of deceiving your own client.

263
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,142
That's the easy way,
"according to the law."

264
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,311
Because it's right.

265
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,248
Are you threatening me?

266
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:07,419
Not a threat so much
as it's an agreement-reaching technique.

267
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,323
What do you think? Should I go by the law?

268
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,996
Okay, fine. Then "by the law"--

269
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,932
Stop it.

270
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,204
Tell the old man we won't charge him,
so he doesn't have to worry.

271
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,372
Shut it. You got hurt!

272
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:31,376
Yes, I'm the victim,
so I want to settle this, okay?

273
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,459
Don't follow me.

274
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,963
You're upset that I didn't take your side.

275
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,866
Don't make me feel childish.

276
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,368
I hate it when you act so righteous.

277
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,804
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,308
I'm really sorry. I won't do it again.

279
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,713
Is your arm okay?

280
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,923
You'll be late for school.
You should get going.

281
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,786
Oh my gosh.

282
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,190
Yes, hello?

283
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,526
Yes. What?

284
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,797
Yes, okay. I understand.

285
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,503
Excuse me, Mr. Cha?

286
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,205
Yes?

287
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:13,312
You're now the public defender
for Lee Dae-song's case.

288
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,920
Okay, I understand.

289
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:35,067
This vanilla latte
after eating a spicy octopus stir-fry...

290
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,535
How can I express it?

291
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:41,907
The sweetness soothes lips
that are heated from spice.

292
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:48,814
-Hey, isn't that...
-It's Cha Guan-woo.

293
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,884
I hired that guy. He's a really good one.

294
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,387
His performance
and personality are both good.

295
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,291
He's a model public defender.

296
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,902
Why me? Why?

297
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,012
Back then... He used to be a good model.

298
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,324
See? He is a role model.

299
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,772
Yu-chang.

300
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,844
Tell Ms. Jang to transfer all
of Lee Dae-song's records to Mr. Cha.

301
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:54,713
Yes, sir.

302
00:21:56,782 --> 00:22:00,419
Ms. Jang, could you give me
Lee Dae-song's case files?

303
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:06,958
Tell Mr. Shin it won't be necessary
because Mr. Cha won't take the case.

304
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:08,827
Okay.

305
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,197
-Mr. Shin...
-Tell her

306
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,900
Mr. Cha won't forget his position
unlike a certain someone,

307
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,103
nor fight with his defendant,
so she need not worry.

308
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:24,676
Tell him even a public defender is not
obligated to take a case against his will.

309
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:28,380
Tell her a public defender must not
be picky about cases!

310
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,652
Why are you doing this to me?

311
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,522
Yu-chang, you've copied
Lee Dae-song's case files, right?

312
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,659
Ms. Jjang, hand over the records, please.

313
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,864
Mr. Shin. I'm sorry about before.

314
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:50,035
Do you have any case materials
about Lee Dae-song?

315
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,537
Of course I do.

316
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,674
Just wait a teensy bit.
I'll get them for you in a jiffy.

317
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,579
Where have you been?

318
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,381
I almost suffocated to death.

319
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,816
What are you doing? So creepy...

320
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,521
Isn't there anyone
to write a petition for you?

321
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,391
Don't you have any family or relatives?

322
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,861
How many papers do you collect in a day?

323
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,063
Over 1,200 copies? Or under?

324
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:20,832
DEFENDANT INFO - AGE 79

325
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,639
CHARGE - THEFT, THEFT, THEFT

326
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,547
Hello. I'm Lee Dae-song's lawyer.

327
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,453
That feels cool.

328
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,058
Oh my. Why are you so wet? Is it raining?

329
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:51,263
No, I went to meet the victim,
and I got water thrown at me.

330
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,031
Gosh.

331
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,501
Why did you, the public defender,
go meet the victim?

332
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,004
I think that's a bit much.

333
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,407
I thought the judge might be lenient
if we reached an agreement.

334
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,179
That feels cool.

335
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,747
Does Mr. Cha work that hard?

336
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,920
He's the guardian of human rights.
We should give him a Nobel Prize.

337
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,725
If you think about it,
that old man terrorized me.

338
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,930
Out of loyalty, as my colleague,
he shouldn't be working this hard, right?

339
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,432
What do you think?
Would you be like that too?

340
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,601
But he's still a lawyer...

341
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,072
No, I'd be on your side for sure.

342
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:44,549
To be honest,
I'd begun thinking Mr. Cha was all right.

343
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,552
Not a lot. Just a tiny amount.

344
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,154
Really?

345
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,823
But I just have bad taste.

346
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,425
He's not great at all.

347
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,762
If I deal with him again,
I will change my surname.

348
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,869
Your mother's dream was right.
She predicted the trash terror.

349
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,303
Is that it?

350
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,477
It's a relief that it ended there.
There's nothing strange about it.

351
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,313
But it's not that bad
for how scary the dream was.

352
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:21,019
"Not that bad"?
You're talking poop out of that mouth.

353
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:25,156
Enough of that. It's your payday, right?

354
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,758
What are you doing to do?

355
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,194
What's there to do?
You're taking my paycheck.

356
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,795
Of course I am!

357
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,298
How are you going to give it to me?

358
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,301
Are you just going to wire it?

359
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,672
Or are you going to come here
with it all nicely put into an envelope,

360
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,209
and give it to me yourself while bowing?

361
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,780
You're threatening me
that I have to go to you.

362
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,884
-I'll go this weekend.
-Okay.

363
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,320
See you this weekend.

364
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,223
What are you going to do
with her paycheck?

365
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,125
Buy a car.

366
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,994
-But you don't have a license.
-I don't.

367
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,799
So why? Oh, it's for your daughter.

368
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,734
Pack a size two for me.

369
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,069
Size two?

370
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:14,739
Even a six would be small.
You have to wear an eight.

371
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,842
Is this for your daughter, too?

372
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:22,781
She has no fashion sense at all.

373
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,319
Gil-dong?

374
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,622
Yes, my daughter is coming this weekend.

375
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,391
Go to the mart and buy some ribs.

376
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:40,098
She likes ribs, so I want to marinate some
for her to take back.

377
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,600
Sure, I'll do that.

378
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,469
So she's coming this weekend, right?

379
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,540
If you have any trouble,
you should talk to her.

380
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,908
She'll do it for free.

381
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,111
Okay.

382
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,052
HYE-SEONG CHICKEN

383
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:32,951
Good morning.

384
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,219
Morning.

385
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,323
It's already 8:30 a.m. I'm in trouble.
My trial starts soon.

386
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,358
Where did I put the defendant's
examination questions?

387
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,727
Here they are.

388
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:46,965
My opposing counsel is Seo Do-yeon.
You've been against her many times before.

389
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,300
Do you have any tips for me?

390
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,469
Any special strategies?

391
00:27:56,141 --> 00:28:00,512
Mr. Cha, I didn't want to say this
because I might look bad.

392
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:02,514
What?

393
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:03,982
Aren't you mad?

394
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,118
That old man called me a trashy lawyer.

395
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,387
It wasn't just directed at me.

396
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,791
It was directed at public defenders
in general. Isn't that right?

397
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,459
You're right.

398
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,562
I don't even want you to take my side.

399
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:22,300
But at the very least, try not
to make a fuss about defending him.

400
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,670
To be honest, I'm offended by this.

401
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:28,073
It feels as though you're doing this
on purpose.

402
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,208
It's not anything like that.

403
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:33,078
What is it then?
Why are you going overboard?

404
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,181
Well...

405
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,416
Actually...

406
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,219
IN SESSION

407
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,655
In the past five years, Lee Dae-song has--

408
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,726
Ms. Seo and Your Honor.

409
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,162
Defendant Lee Dae-song
is very hard of hearing.

410
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,033
Could you please speak loudly
when examining him?

411
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:02,173
Okay, the prosecutor should proceed
in a loud voice!

412
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:08,246
In the past five years,
defendant Lee Dae-song has

413
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:13,084
been reported or indicted
for theft 16 times, correct?

414
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,222
That is right, but let me explain--

415
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:19,591
Having treated your previous thefts
as subsistence-related,

416
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,260
the court and prosecution
used their discretion

417
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:28,099
to suspend indictments and summary orders,
and grant probation among other things.

418
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,267
Is that correct?

419
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:33,438
That is true. But I went to jail twice--

420
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:38,543
It's been less than a year
since you got out of prison.

421
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,078
And you stole again.

422
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,482
Yes, I guess I committed a grave crime.

423
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:54,225
You lost your house and hurt your leg
in a landslide five years ago.

424
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,929
And you had to quit your job.
Is that correct?

425
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,330
Yes.

426
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,966
And last year,
your electricity was cut off,

427
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:03,334
because you couldn't pay the bill.

428
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,838
And your tiny room caught fire
from burning candles to endure the night.

429
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,406
That's right.

430
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:12,043
During the last five years,
you've collected waste paper for recyling,

431
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,212
and you stole paper
that someone else had gathered.

432
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,949
And last winter, it was so cold
that you stole oil from a neighbor.

433
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,417
-And--
-Counsel.

434
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:23,555
We can read that in the records.
Please ask your next question.

435
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:25,990
Yes, Your Honor.

436
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,061
Do you have anything more to say?

437
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,966
Yes, I do.

438
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,337
What is it then?
Why are you going overboard?

439
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:40,772
Well...

440
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,174
Actually...

441
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,545
It's because I'm really mad.

442
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:49,948
What?

443
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:54,886
I'm so mad at this old man
for what he did to you.

444
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,223
I'm mad that he looks down
on public defenders, too.

445
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,125
So I'm going to show him at trial.

446
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,206
This is 5,000 won worth of newspaper

447
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,308
that he needs to pay his daily rent.

448
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,409
And...

449
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:26,384
He needs to add this much more
to eat even one meal a day.

450
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:31,122
Your Honor, have you been
on the subway lately?

451
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,861
No one reads newspapers anymore.
They use their smartphones.

452
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,230
I walked around all day.

453
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,433
I picked up 35 used newspapers
off the street.

454
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:46,337
For people who need
to find 800 copies a day just to survive,

455
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:49,774
the free newspapers were their livelihood.

456
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:52,543
Show him what?

457
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:58,850
At trial, I'm going to show him we try
to see the world through defendants' eyes.

458
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:03,288
And that we truly understand them.

459
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,857
So I'm going to get a favorable ruling.

460
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,526
And then...

461
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,461
And then?

462
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,165
I'm going to tell him to apologize to you.

463
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:21,539
I'm making this big fuss,
so I can get that apology.

464
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,481
You might say he should find another job.

465
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,584
Or that he should adjust to the times.

466
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:39,090
But isn't the world changing too quickly
for them to keep up?

467
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:48,466
I ask that you look at this situation
from their perspective just once.

468
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:05,209
Your Honor, have you been
on the subway lately?

469
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:10,882
No one reads newspapers anymore.
They use their smartphones.

470
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:13,985
He's right.

471
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,558
For people who need
to find 800 copies a day just to survive,

472
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,961
the free newspapers were their livelihood.

473
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:25,897
That must be true.

474
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,332
What?

475
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,868
Mr. Cha is so irritating.

476
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,472
He scolded me while pretending
to be on my side.

477
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,841
He told me to be a true public defender.

478
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,643
What does that mean?

479
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,978
I want to help Mr. Cha.

480
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,449
You want to help Mr. Cha?

481
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:49,153
No, I don't want to associate
with him just yet.

482
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,391
I feel bad that he's working
so hard on my former case.

483
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,727
It's not that I have other intentions.

484
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,832
Why should I lie to him?
He'll read right through me.

485
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:09,273
I learned recently
that Mr. Cha actually...

486
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:10,808
Stop.

487
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,789
Why don't we get Chinese food today?

488
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:25,990
I got a coupon this morning.

489
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,960
If all four of us go,
we get a free sweet and sour pork dish.

490
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,961
Really?

491
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:33,564
-Really? That's good. Let's get going.
-Okay.

492
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,500
Let's go, Ms. Jjang.

493
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,603
I have a previous engagement.

494
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,340
It's free if the four of us go.

495
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:46,310
What are you doing? I have plans! Oh, my.

496
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,649
-Oh!
-Look who's here!

497
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:55,253
You're all here. What's the occasion?

498
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,588
You must have come
because of the coupon, too.

499
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,992
It's no wonder you keep losing your hair
with how you like free things.

500
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:08,399
Yes, I brought the prosecutor
to make this a group of four.

501
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,302
Since you're here, shall we sit together?

502
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,371
Shall we?

503
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:19,877
Your trial was very impressive, Mr. Cha.

504
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:24,549
You even brought newspapers.
I heard about it, too.

505
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,685
Lee Dae-song is a very unfortunate man.

506
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:31,756
One time, he lasted three days
on a pack of yogurt. Isn't that right?

507
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:37,628
That's not all. You know the moldy,
stale bread the marts throw out?

508
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,997
He would break off the moldy parts
and eat the rest.

509
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,300
And he lives in a tiny rented room.

510
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,869
Over 100,000 people live
in such tiny rooms.

511
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,973
But not all of them steal to survive.

512
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,741
They live according to their conscience.

513
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:54,378
If we let this slide and that slide,
just because they live in tiny rooms,

514
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,380
then essentially we will create a world
with no laws.

515
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,382
That's not common sense.

516
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:05,256
So is that why you gave
a nine-year sentence

517
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,992
to an 80 year old man
who stole free newspapers?

518
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,927
Is that your common sense?

519
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,867
Yes, that's my common sense.

520
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,837
Lee Dae-song stole 16 times.

521
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,807
Punishment increases for repeat offenses.

522
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,978
What will you say to the victims
if we let him off because he's old?

523
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:33,584
A person doesn't rape or embezzle
just to get by.

524
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:36,320
Naturally additional punishment
should be given for such wicked crimes.

525
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,657
-But he only stole a few--
-Three hundred copies.

526
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,727
Exactly, he only stole 300 copies.

527
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:46,964
To give him additional punishment
as you would for rape or embezzlement

528
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,067
is a judgment
without an ounce of humanity.

529
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:59,010
That's enough. You can't talk
about the case while we're eating.

530
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,613
Both of you, please,
take your hands off the table.

531
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,283
We need to turn it for all of us
to get on with eating our meal.

532
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,465
THREE EGG BREADS - 2,000 WON
TWO BANANA BREADS - 1,000 WON

533
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:35,813
If I ask for one for 500 won,
will they give it to me?

534
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,657
Excuse me!

535
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,127
Sir, do you happen to have 500 won?

536
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,133
I only have 1,500 won.

537
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,236
With 500 won more,
I can buy three egg breads.

538
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:07,978
-Will you share with me?
-Of course. I'll give you two.

539
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,691
She packed so much. It's not as though
a war is going to break out.

540
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,961
My mother always likes to go big.

541
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,263
She sent clothes, too.

542
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,867
-Pretty.
-I am?

543
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:31,602
No, the jacket.

544
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:36,073
You never say anything nice.

545
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,882
Lee Dae-song's sentence
will be announced tomorrow.

546
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,118
Is going to jail the only answer?

547
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,155
Unless Do-yeon changes the indictment,

548
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,658
and removes the "repeat offender" part,
he will have to go to jail.

549
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,261
But she would never do that.

550
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:01,499
If he could only agree to a settlement,
we could reduce the sentence.

551
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,467
But he has no intention to.

552
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,837
Dang it. There is no answer.

553
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:11,108
But it seems he tried
to reach an agreement.

554
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,110
How would you know that?

555
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,079
I met him earlier today.

556
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,250
Really? How did you meet him?

557
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,685
Just by chance.

558
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,988
By chance? Amazing.

559
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:25,623
What did he say?

560
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,261
He ran into the victim and his wife
at a funeral recently.

561
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:31,495
And?

562
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,664
He apologized and said
he'd never do it again.

563
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,132
But they wouldn't listen.

564
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,036
They later came to his house
telling him they would send him to jail.

565
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:44,308
Then the victim doesn't have any intention
to reach an agreement either.

566
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,681
But how did he meet them at a funeral?

567
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,149
He said it was just by chance.

568
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,952
The deceased was a mutual relative.

569
00:40:55,953 --> 00:41:00,124
So the victim and old man are related?

570
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,359
It seems too much to call them relatives.

571
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,896
A cousin on one side, a cousin
on the other, so it's many times removed.

572
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,832
They found out
for the first time that day.

573
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,733
But they're still related,
even if distantly.

574
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:14,104
The "crimes between relatives exception"
could work.

575
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,540
"Crime between relatives exception"?
What's that?

576
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,812
Hey. I think there's a way if you help me.

577
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,185
I'm sorry, sir.

578
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:34,558
I wanted to avoid imprisonment for you,
but I think it might be hard.

579
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,663
I guess I'll just go live in jail.

580
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,368
I don't have to worry about money for rent
or live off sugar water.

581
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,737
It's better actually.

582
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:54,111
Will they take me right away from court
if I get that sentence?

583
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,881
Yes. Probably.

584
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,586
I see.

585
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,411
This is what you usually drink, right?
Fruit Sparkling?

586
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,947
Yes. You came.

587
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,488
Wow, you... You look...

588
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,124
What? You said to wear a suit.

589
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:48,165
They say men look best in suits.
I guess it's true for you, too.

590
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,201
My heart almost skipped a beat.

591
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,173
Moving on. Explain how I can help.

592
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,411
Okay, look. Theft originally is not
an offense subject to a civil complaint.

593
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:01,812
So once the defendant is indicted,

594
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,181
reaching an agreement
with the victim has no effect.

595
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:07,451
But if the victim is a relative,
the situation changes.

596
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,920
If the victim settles
and has the charges dropped,

597
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,088
there can no longer be a trial.

598
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,290
That's the "crime
between relatives exception."

599
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,895
So the old man
and the victim are distant relatives.

600
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:21,932
So if we get them to settle,
we can save the old man.

601
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,300
Exactly.

602
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,936
But the victim has no intention
of settling.

603
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,906
Mr. Cha went to see him,
but got water thrown at him.

604
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,441
That's why...

605
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,777
I need this and you.

606
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:51,695
Who is it?

607
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:55,532
Hello, I'm Public Defender Jang Hye-seong.

608
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,807
Umbrella...

609
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,443
I won't settle.

610
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,946
I came because I have something to ask.

611
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:13,517
I'm Attorney Jang Hye-seong,
and this is Park Su-ha, my clerk.

612
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,186
I told you so many times.

613
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,755
I'm going to go by the law.

614
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:21,759
I'm going to see that old man go to jail,
with my own two eyes, understand?

615
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,695
I heard you went to Lee Dae-song's house.

616
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,432
I heard you caused a scene
saying you would appeal

617
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,100
if he doesn't get jail time.

618
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,836
"A scene"?

619
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:37,174
I just visited. To talk. Dialogue.

620
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,378
Did the old man snitch
about flipping out on me

621
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,213
for not taking off my shoes?

622
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,884
If you go into someone's house
with your shoes on, it's not a visit.

623
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,318
It's called "trespass."

624
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,454
And it could be an even bigger offense
than theft.

625
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:55,826
And here's a phrase from your newspaper.

626
00:44:55,993 --> 00:45:00,064
"This newspaper follows the ethics
code of the Newspaper Association.

627
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,367
And does not
include unsound advertisements."

628
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:07,538
Did they see the ad
for underage female escorts?

629
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:11,442
You allowed ads for female escorts,
didn't you? And minors at that.

630
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:15,879
Per Article 4, section 5 of the Act
on Punishing Procurement of Prostitution,

631
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:19,983
even the advertising of businesses
soliciting prostitution is illegal.

632
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:27,491
What are you doing right now?
Are you threatening me?

633
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:32,229
It's not a threat.
It's an agreement-reaching technique.

634
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,240
What would I have done without you?

635
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,111
Do you want to eat something?
Anything you want to buy?

636
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,879
Say what you want. I'll do it for you.

637
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:50,647
Never mind.

638
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:53,484
There is a place I want to go.

639
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,285
-Where?
-The aquarium.

640
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,156
Aquarium? That's so out of the blue.

641
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,625
I've never been there. Have you?

642
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,962
Of course... I haven't.

643
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:06,930
I only saw it on TV.

644
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,834
Okay, let's go after the trial.

645
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,003
-What time is the trial?
-Eleven o'clock.

646
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,107
Oh my gosh. I'm late.

647
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,412
It is regrettable

648
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:29,153
the defendant's prior convictions
of theft were subsistence-related.

649
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:35,459
However, under the current law,
we cannot suspend your sentence.

650
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:39,997
I hereby announce
that he will receive three years...

651
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,970
My apologies. I have something
important to give to Mr. Cha.

652
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:51,975
For me?

653
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:53,277
Yes.

654
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:56,780
AGREEMENT

655
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,017
DISMISSAL OF INDICTMENT

656
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,420
LEE DAE-SONG

657
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,089
Is this for real?

658
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:17,501
Counsel! What are you doing?

659
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:20,437
This is a court of law!

660
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:23,740
Thank you.

661
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:27,077
Your Honor!

662
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,381
The indictment is invalidated.

663
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,217
What do you mean?

664
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:38,055
The defendant, Lee Dae-song,
and the victim, Lee Man-il,

665
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,858
are cousins thrice removed
according to these documents.

666
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,795
According to Articles 344 and 328
of the Penal Code,

667
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,129
a crime between relatives requires

668
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,632
that the victim accuse wrongdoing
for there to be an indictment.

669
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,802
The "crime between relatives exception."
She managed to find that.

670
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,539
The victim, Lee Man-il,
no longer wants to pursue charges.

671
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:59,576
Since Mr. Lee has dropped the charges,
the indictment must be dismissed.

672
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:09,186
He's right. Criminal punishment
is no longer valid for this case.

673
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:13,523
The defendant may be dismissed.

674
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,000
Ms. Jjang!

675
00:48:58,568 --> 00:48:59,603
Ms. Jjang!

676
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,974
Ms. Jjang! Where are you going?

677
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,710
Oh, it was you.

678
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,346
You didn't know it was me?
I called out really loudly.

679
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:10,847
I had no idea.

680
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,917
She should call me if the trial is over.

681
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:24,962
Thank you so much. If it weren't for you,
he would have gone to jail for sure.

682
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,264
No need. I didn't do it to get praised.

683
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,866
And when I hugged you in court today...

684
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,770
It's okay. I'm cool in that sense.

685
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,707
You can hug a colleague
if you're really happy.

686
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:40,844
Let's do a "colleague" high five then.

687
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,962
What is this?

688
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,468
Be my girlfriend. Let's date.

689
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,236
What?

690
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,340
Well... But... It's...

691
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,477
I may be smiling,
but I'm trembling inside.

692
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:17,781
Answer me quickly. Do you dislike me?

693
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:21,685
No, I like you.

694
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,168
I totally messed up in Science this time.

695
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,836
Just Science?

696
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:43,240
I effed up in Korean, Math,
English, Science, you name it.

697
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,878
-It's Su-ha!
-Where?

698
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:49,579
Over there!

699
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:55,218
That's Su-ha? How can you see that?

700
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,321
He wasn't here all morning.
Why did he come so late?

701
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,291
Hey, you can see that, too?

702
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,528
-Do you have bad eyesight?
-No.

703
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:06,530
Why can't you see that?

704
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:23,980
It's not a date.

705
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:27,117
I'm just taking him
to the movies as a reward.

706
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:29,519
I want to help Mr. Cha.

707
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:35,225
Be my girlfriend. Let's date.

708
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:24,040
Good job, Ms. Jjang.

709
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:28,578
Good job, Ms. Jjang.

710
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,014
What is this?

711
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,985
He said he doesn't like her, but he does.

712
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,072
Why isn't he answering his phone?
He wanted to go to the aquarium.

713
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,207
The person you've called...

714
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,246
Lee Dae-song?

715
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:11,054
-Are you going home now?
-What are...

716
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,324
What are you doing here?

717
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,593
I'm sorry for calling you a trashy lawyer.

718
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,930
Okay? I apologized.

719
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:21,364
Is that an apology?

720
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:24,301
Of course it is.
What does it sound like to you?

721
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,637
You're doing this only
because Mr. Cha made you do it.

722
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,843
I don't need an apology.
Just call your son.

723
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,212
That again?

724
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:39,115
Your son must be so upset
if he knew you lived like this.

725
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,617
That's why I'm not calling him.

726
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,720
I get upset when I see him get upset.

727
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,557
It's better he doesn't know...
For both our sakes.

728
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,320
Ugh. It's lukewarm.

729
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,675
APPLICATION TO AVOID SPAM MESSAGES

730
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,844
I have been getting a lot of spam lately.

731
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,847
VISIT THE URL

732
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,791
Finally, he fell into the trap!

733
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,732
MYEONGWOL-DONG INTERSECTION

734
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,279
I put aside some ribs for you
as I was making them for Hye-seong.

735
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,382
Take them with you later, you hear?

736
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:23,286
Ms. Eo.

737
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:24,988
What?

738
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:27,490
I need to talk to you.

739
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:29,859
About what?

740
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:34,798
It's...

741
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,168
going to take some time.

742
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:57,487
Mom? Why didn't you answer for so long?

743
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:01,024
I was in the bathroom. Why did you call?

744
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,493
Should I bring anything
when I come tomorrow?

745
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,694
I don't need anything.

746
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,863
-Is that why you called?
-No.

747
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,670
Remember the old man
who threw trash at me?

748
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,406
His indictment got dismissed so he's free.

749
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:19,743
That's good. Wasn't it Mr. Cha's case?

750
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:23,279
Yes, but I played a crucial role in it.

751
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:26,883
If it weren't for me, he would've gotten
at least two years in jail.

752
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:30,420
That's good. You're becoming quite good.

753
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,122
Of course.

754
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:37,026
Mom, is there anything you're keeping
from me?

755
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:38,895
What do you mean?

756
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:45,468
You're not hiding that you're sick
or it's too hard to work, right?

757
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:47,737
I am.

758
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,639
What is it?

759
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,977
You said you're married to the law.

760
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,813
I'm worried that you'll never get married.

761
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,483
What? I'm being serious.

762
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:02,852
Anything else?

763
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,088
Nothing else.

764
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:08,792
If there is,
you should be frank with me, okay?

765
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:12,095
-I'm hanging up.
-Hold on, Hye-seong!

766
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:13,596
What?

767
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,265
Hye-seong.

768
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,168
You know what?

769
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,339
"Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth."

770
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:29,245
If everyone lived by that law,
then we would all become blind.

771
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,048
What are you saying out of the blue?

772
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,717
People who harm you...

773
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,022
do it because they are jealous.

774
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,191
It's because you're doing so well.

775
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,928
They're just jealous.

776
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:50,867
Don't hate those people.
Have sympathy for them.

777
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:54,337
Feel sorry for them. Okay?

778
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,807
There you go again.
You're taking Do-yeon's side again.

779
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,609
Don't talk back to me!

780
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,982
Promise me.

781
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:12,789
Don't waste your life
hating someone, okay?

782
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,094
You only live once.

783
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:23,066
There's barely enough time to love people.

784
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:25,802
Okay?

785
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:30,206
Okay, I'll try.

786
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,243
Good.

787
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:35,712
Good.

788
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,948
That's my daughter.

789
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:44,020
You sound strange and congested.
Do you have a cold?

790
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,123
Do I sound so?

791
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:55,198
Don't just drink honey water.
Go see a doctor.

792
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:57,300
At your age, even colds can be dangerous.

793
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,538
Okay, bye.

794
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:11,748
Is that all?

795
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:19,455
You realize those were your last words
to your daughter, right?

796
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:21,891
I know.

797
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,096
Those were my last words.

798
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:39,776
You really didn't tell her.
You did what I said.

799
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,881
Shouldn't you be begging for your life?

800
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,116
Do you think I'm crazy?

801
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:49,819
I know exactly what you want.

802
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,589
Do you think I would fall for that?

803
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,963
You're stronger than I thought.

804
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,466
I told you why I'm doing this.

805
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:06,769
Why I became enemies with your daughter.

806
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:15,078
You know what I'm going to do next.

807
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:18,281
Aren't you scared?

808
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:20,583
I'm not scared.

809
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:27,023
I just feel bad for you
and think you're pathetic.

810
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:29,659
"Pathetic"?

811
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:32,362
"Feel bad" for me?

812
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:35,732
You lived your whole life hating someone.

813
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,669
How hellish must your life have been.

814
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:43,039
Really?

815
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:47,777
Then I guess now your daughter
will live a hellish life like me.

816
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:52,915
She is going to hate me her entire life
for having killed her mother.

817
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:54,951
And prepare for revenge.

818
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:58,588
Right?

819
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,561
She'll never live like that.

820
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,566
I didn't raise her to be pathetic
like you.

821
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,007
Shut it!

822
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,484
LOCATION TRACKING

823
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,587
LOCATION CONFIRMED. SEONGMU CITY,
NEAR MYEONGWOL-DONG INTERSECTION

824
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,024
"Seongmu City"?

825
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,469
Su-ha, you were home.
Why didn't you answer your phone?

826
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,505
-Where's your mother's chicken shop?
-Why do you ask?

827
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:52,108
-Where is it?
-In Seongmu City. Why?

828
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:55,178
It's Seongmu City?
Near the Myeongwol-dong intersection?

829
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:57,046
Yes, that's right.

830
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,450
How do you know that?

831
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,253
Why are you suddenly asking that?

832
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,891
Right now...

833
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,528
Min Jun-guk is there.

834
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,769
Why is he...

835
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,439
Why is he at my mother's?

836
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:36,519
Hello?

837
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,055
Yes.

838
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:51,534
Who was that?

839
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,109
Who was that?

840
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:09,719
I knew then that my mother's
nightmare was just getting started.

841
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:15,391
And it meant something far worse
than I had ever expected.

842
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,961
