1
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,459
DEFENDANT'S WAITING ROOM

2
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,528
You understood what I just said, right?

3
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,297
It means
we're changing our defense strategy.

4
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,766
We're saying that Min Jun-guk is alive.

5
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,702
It's because among the suspects...

6
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:42,942
so don't feel fearful
in front of the jury, okay?

7
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:46,946
What?

8
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,582
How can you believe me
more than I do myself?

9
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,520
How can you be sure that I didn't do it?

10
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,457
I told you. You made a promise to me.

11
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,060
That you would never hurt Min Jun-guk.

12
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:04,464
Is that why you believe me?
Just because of a promise?

13
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,137
Do you know what kind of person you are?

14
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:15,708
You looked for me for ten years
to keep a promise I don't remember.

15
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,778
Does that make sense?

16
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,415
Ten years just to keep a simple promise.

17
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:34,194
I admit that we doubted other suspects
without any grounds.

18
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:39,132
But she said that all of the evidence
points towards only one person,

19
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:43,036
the defendant Park Su-ha.

20
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,905
But there is one more person.

21
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:52,078
He was at the scene
on the day of the crime.

22
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,047
And all of the circumstances match.

23
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:58,384
There were phone records
and he was in possession of the knife.

24
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,088
And he has the strength
to cut off a wrist.

25
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,590
Who is that?

26
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,328
It's the victim, Min Jun-guk.

27
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,297
What are you saying?

28
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:15,001
Min Jun-guk is the victim
who died in this crime.

29
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,872
How can he be a suspect?

30
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,607
Your Honor.

31
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,743
And members of the jury.

32
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:29,516
The defense is arguing that the victim
Min Jun-guk is still alive.

33
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:49,669
Prosecution, Defense Counsel,
approach the bench.

34
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,410
What's wrong with you?

35
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,947
You should have mentioned this
during the preparation period.

36
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:05,018
We would if we could have.
But we only just thought of it.

37
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,220
This is very reckless.

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,322
-Do you realize that?
-Yes, we do.

39
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,826
But we think it's worth trying,
for the defendant's sake.

40
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,295
This is a jury trial.

41
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:19,098
We cannot accept any additional witnesses
or evidence.

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,502
We'll prove it with the evidence we have.

43
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,738
Understood.

44
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:30,710
But you must know
that this is a very exceptional case.

45
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,446
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

46
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:40,253
Then let's begin with
Hwang Dal-jung's examination.

47
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,560
Are you currently serving a sentence

48
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,196
for the murder of your wife 26 years ago?

49
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,731
Yes.

50
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:55,602
It was called the "left-hand murder case"

51
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,538
because only the left hand was found?

52
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,739
Yes.

53
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:05,078
Did you ever tell Min Jun-guk,
your old cellmate?

54
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,246
DEFENDANT

55
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,914
Yes, I did.

56
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,383
PROSECUTOR

57
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,953
Did you hear
that Min Jun-guk was murdered?

58
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,021
Yes.

59
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,757
Did you know that the evidence

60
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:22,562
of the victim's murder was his left hand
found at the scene?

61
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,663
No.

62
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:27,800
Don't you think it's too much
of a coincidence?

63
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,303
Yes, I think so.

64
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,572
JURY

65
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,743
Then let's consider
the following scenario.

66
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:42,715
Min Jun-guk was wanted
for attempted murder and retaliation.

67
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,486
He'd heard about the left-hand murder case
from this witness.

68
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,788
And he got an idea.

69
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,058
He would no longer be wanted
by the police.

70
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:57,130
And he would be able to get revenge on
Park Su-ha, too.

71
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,999
He would cut off his own left hand.

72
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,102
And make it look
as though Park Su-ha had murdered him.

73
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:09,042
Objection! Counsel is distorting the truth
through speculation.

74
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,344
Isn't the prosecution's charge also
based on speculation?

75
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,346
Only the left hand was found.

76
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,015
The rest of the body has never been found.

77
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,018
Without having the body
from the beginning,

78
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:24,123
considering this a murder case is
just speculation. No, it's a guess.

79
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,503
On May 30, 2012,

80
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,007
did Park Su-ha come
to the police station to threaten you?

81
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,478
Yes.

82
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,414
What was the threat?

83
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:57,223
"If you don't do anything,
I might go and kill Min Jun-guk."

84
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,392
That's what he said.

85
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,528
If Min Jun-guk were killed,

86
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,967
who would be the first suspect
to come to mind?

87
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,107
Park Su-ha.

88
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,918
Nothing further.

89
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,792
POLICE'S TESTIMONY

90
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,929
Did you lose your gun on May 31, 2012?

91
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,131
What?

92
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,903
If you don't tell the truth,
I'll kill you.

93
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,605
I'm watching you.

94
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,809
Yes, I did.

95
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,713
Did you name Park Su-ha as the thief?

96
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,951
-Yes.
-Did he really take it?

97
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,821
No. I was mistaken.

98
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:07,860
Did you suspect Park Su-ha
as the murderer because of that?

99
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,367
-I'm not sure...
-Nothing further.

100
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,871
NOT CREDIBLE

101
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:25,845
POLICE TESTIMONY

102
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,449
This knife, which was allegedly used
during the murder,

103
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,218
was the same knife
that the defendant carried around

104
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,787
and had his fingerprints all over it.

105
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,791
Min Jun-guk's fingerprints were also
on that knife.

106
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:44,430
And this knife was taken
by Min Jun-guk when he fled

107
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,999
after harming Jang Hye-seong
and Park Su-ha a week before the incident.

108
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:51,737
Thus, the last person to have the knife
in his hand was Min Jun-guk.

109
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,407
FINGERPRINTS ON KNIFE CANNOT BE CONSIDERED
AS EVIDENCE

110
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:58,978
According to Min Jun-guk's phone records,
the last person...

111
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,850
he talked to was Park Su-ha.

112
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:06,786
PHONE CALL RECORD

113
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,188
The victim was the one who called,

114
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,057
and the defendant answered his phone.

115
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,125
If he had the intent to murder
at their meeting,

116
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,595
the defendant should've been the one
to make the call.

117
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,932
DEFENDANT DIDN'T INITIATE THE CALL

118
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,503
Quite a lot of blood was found
at the scene.

119
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,605
The left hand was found as well.

120
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,508
The defense can only make their argument

121
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:32,812
when they bring evidence
that Min Jun-guk is alive.

122
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:35,882
EVIDENCE

123
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,683
Likewise,
the prosecution should have indicted

124
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,687
with sufficient evidence
of the victim's actual death.

125
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,090
The amount of blood found was not fatal.

126
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:48,728
And, the left hand alone does not prove
that he is dead.

127
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,229
DEAD BODY...?

128
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,098
They're doing well.

129
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,968
They've eliminated most of the evidence.

130
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,170
THE END

131
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,521
Wow! This is so good.

132
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,857
How much for a box?

133
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,025
Fifty thousand won.

134
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:22,028
They're 10,000 won a piece in Seoul.

135
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,664
Can you wrap it up
so I can take it with me?

136
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,800
-Sure. One box?
-No, two.

137
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:35,274
What was Park Su-ha like?
I heard she's really pretty.

138
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,509
Is she curvy?

139
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,912
Yes, she was tall and very curvy.

140
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,214
Really?

141
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,684
But Park Su-ha is a guy.

142
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,523
See? You've never seen Park Su-ha.

143
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,224
How did you know to report him?

144
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,196
Get out.
You're here to get my reward, right?

145
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,032
I'm not selling my peaches to you, so go!

146
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,501
-Go!
-Ouch.

147
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:06,439
I didn't come for the reward!
I swear. It's true.

148
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,308
Just tell me how you knew to report him.

149
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,319
Let me in!

150
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,887
Open the door!

151
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,392
Each side has presented their evidence.
Now, it's time for closing arguments.

152
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,828
Prosecution, please go first.

153
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,037
Last year, I was
in charge of a murder case.

154
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,840
It was a case where the murderer killed

155
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,509
the mother of the person
against whom he had a grudge.

156
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,580
There was plenty of evidence
to prove the defendant did it.

157
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,915
He had a grudge.

158
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,185
He was seen on surveillance video
on his way to break the camera.

159
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,956
There was a fracture on the victim's head
caused by a blow to the head.

160
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,393
It was clearly murder.

161
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,199
Of course, that was according
to my criteria.

162
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,773
But the defense argued
that it was an accident.

163
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:18,144
The victim hit her head
when she fainted from arrhythmia.

164
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,513
And the broken security camera was just
a coincidence.

165
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,649
The defense also argued it wasn't arson,
but a simple fire,

166
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:31,290
saying it was a tragedy caused
by a lot of coincidences.

167
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,126
They argued there was reasonable doubt.

168
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,262
REASONABLE DOUBT:
DOUBT IN A DEFENDANT'S GUILT

169
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,465
In the end,
the defendant was found not guilty.

170
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:45,004
And he terrorized the people he resented
right after his release.

171
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,113
There were many pieces of evidence.

172
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,617
But he was found not guilty
with only 80 of 100 pieces.

173
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:03,389
Because the remaining 20 pieces
could be made to form a different picture,

174
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,493
with that reasonable doubt,
the defendant pleaded not guilty.

175
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,600
Just because you assembled 80 pieces
of that 100 piece elephant puzzle,

176
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,704
that doesn't mean the elephant
looks like a lion or a cat.

177
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:23,442
Even a child can see it's an elephant
before it's finished.

178
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:29,849
You must know what the picture is
from the puzzle I have shown you today.

179
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,151
The knife covered
with the defendant's fingerprints.

180
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,253
A grudge. Phone records.

181
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,056
The defendant's confession
and the left hand.

182
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:42,294
To ensure all this evidence doesn't go
to waste as it did in last year's trial,

183
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:46,432
and that a murderer
doesn't get away with his crime,

184
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:50,536
members of the jury,
I ask that you make a wise decision.

185
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,449
Next.

186
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,585
Counsel, your closing statement.

187
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,731
I'll do it.

188
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,500
Let me do it.

189
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:43,422
I would like to thank the jury
for sitting through this long trial.

190
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,459
I would like to tell you something
before I close.

191
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,429
The prosecutor mentioned a case to you.

192
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,802
The victim of that case was my mother.

193
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:14,119
Then, I cried out that reasonable doubt
and the presumption of innocence

194
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,224
were all rubbish.

195
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,998
I wanted to wring the necks of those
who had created such principles.

196
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:35,007
But today, I finally realized
why we need such principles.

197
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:43,883
Can you believe it?
I hated those principles so much.

198
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,185
But I'm using them to defend a person,

199
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,887
and desperately at that.

200
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:59,331
The defendant has no memory
of what he did one year ago.

201
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:03,702
And Min Jun-guk's left hand was found.

202
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,338
There are two possibilities.

203
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:10,075
One is that the defendant
really did kill the victim.

204
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:14,480
Or that Min Jun-guk set this up
and disappeared.

205
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:24,623
If, after this trial, you think
in your heart that both are possibilities,

206
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,191
then the verdict should be not guilty.

207
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:31,263
When in doubt,
you must rule in favor of the defendant.

208
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,465
That's the principle of a criminal trial.

209
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:40,606
The prosecutor said this case is
like a puzzle with missing pieces.

210
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,545
Of course, an elephant won't look
like a lion because of that.

211
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,748
But because there are missing pieces,
we can't tell

212
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:56,255
if the elephant is killing someone
or kicking a ball.

213
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:05,597
What if you saw an unfinished puzzle
of an elephant...

214
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:10,703
and judged that the elephant
should be punished for killing a person?

215
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,340
And what if after you kill the elephant
you finish the puzzle,

216
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:19,311
and you find out that it was a ball,
not a person in front of the elephant?

217
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,950
We cannot revive a dead elephant.

218
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,355
It's the same with the defendant.

219
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:34,660
If he were to get a long sentence
and spend his best years in jail,

220
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,597
we cannot return the time he lost.

221
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,540
That's why we need those damn principles.

222
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:05,624
They may be damn principles
that let my mother's murderer free.

223
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:20,072
But those principles are the same
upright principles

224
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,141
that can save the defendant before you.

225
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,659
The jury has gone into deliberation.

226
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,394
JURY DELIBERATION:
TIME TAKEN TO REACH A VERDICT

227
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,695
Where are you, Yu-chang?

228
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,331
I'm on my way back to Seoul.

229
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,300
Did you get anything out of Mun Sung-nam?

230
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,471
No. I waited. But she didn't come out.

231
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,940
Okay. See you tomorrow.

232
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,383
Jang Hye-seong.

233
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,019
What?

234
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,520
Let me ask you something.

235
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,390
Don't you feel sorry to your mother?

236
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,059
No. Why?

237
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:20,599
Your defense was what Mr. Cha used
in your mother's case last year.

238
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,801
I know.

239
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,338
Do you mean that Mr. Cha was right?

240
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,041
He let your mother's murderer free
with that logic.

241
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,313
Yes.

242
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,484
I think Mr. Cha...

243
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,920
did his job as a lawyer.

244
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,060
I feel really sorry to your mother.

245
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:52,164
How upset must she be
if she knew you did this.

246
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,267
No. She would say I was right.

247
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:57,903
That I am right.

248
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,973
She'd say I'm doing the right thing.

249
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,310
-I don't think so--
-She's my mother.

250
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,412
I know her best.

251
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,449
I'm sure.

252
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,253
She would tell me that I did well.

253
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,000
Mom. Am I right?

254
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,940
I did the right thing? Didn't I?

255
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,348
What time is it?

256
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,054
It's 10:50.

257
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,292
It's taking longer than I expected.

258
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,560
The jury must be split.

259
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,263
It would finish early
if it were a unanimous decision.

260
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,739
Don't worry, even if we lose.
We can always lodge an appeal.

261
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,711
I wanted to tell you this
before the ruling.

262
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,513
Thank you so much for today.

263
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,717
No. I should be thanking you.

264
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:04,489
You probably don't remember,
but I owe you big time.

265
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,625
I owe Ms. Jjang, too.

266
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:12,597
I wasn't able to be with her
because I couldn't make it up to her.

267
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,469
This trial is an opportunity for me.

268
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,440
A chance to return to Ms. Jjang.

269
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,478
You must have feelings for Ms. Jang.

270
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,481
Yes. A lot.

271
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,018
Get ready. The jury finished deliberating.

272
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,298
IN SESSION

273
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:52,404
Here is the verdict of case number
2013-1241, Defendant Park Su-ha.

274
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,706
Will the defendant please rise.

275
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:09,688
Park Su-ha was indicted
for the murder, dismemberment,

276
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,757
and concealment of Min Jun-guk's body.

277
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:16,294
The defendant argued he did not murder
the victim nor hide the body.

278
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,029
And pleaded not guilty.

279
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:22,401
The charges were murder,
dismemberment of a body, and concealment.

280
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:25,904
The jury's decision was five to four.

281
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,139
Five to four.

282
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:32,210
I will take the jury's decision
into consideration to make a ruling.

283
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,883
In a criminal case,
facts should be verified through evidence.

284
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:44,189
Direct and indirect evidence
can both be used to prove a crime.

285
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:49,528
Park Su-ha confessed to the crime
during the preliminary investigation.

286
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,197
The victim's left hand was found
at the crime scene.

287
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,300
And there doesn't seem to be any proof
that the victim is alive.

288
00:23:55,367 --> 00:24:00,472
And the defendant's prints were
on the weapon found at the scene.

289
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,308
There is a strong suspicion

290
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,179
that the defendant could have killed
the victim and concealed the body.

291
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:14,286
We will take a look
at whether the evidence proves that

292
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:18,490
the defendant murdered,
mutilated, and concealed the body.

293
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,462
First, the defendant's confession was
in line with the charges.

294
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:27,666
The credibility is doubtful
because the defendant has amnesia.

295
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,969
And it's doubtful
that he could have cut up

296
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:35,841
the 80kg victim with a knife
that isn't even 20cm long.

297
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:39,544
And the victim's body
or physical remains were not found.

298
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:40,645
It's enough to doubt

299
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:46,551
that there may be other possibilities
other than those presented in the charges.

300
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:51,523
After the victim took advantage of the law
in a similar case and evaded conviction,

301
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,758
he has continuously sought revenge
through murder,

302
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,627
thus showing
his exceptionally cunning nature.

303
00:24:55,694 --> 00:25:00,365
Also, the victim shared a prison cell
with Hwang Dal-jung.

304
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,901
And this case is too similar to his case.

305
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:07,072
We cannot rule out the possibility
that the victim injured himself and fled.

306
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:12,944
Thus, we cannot deem the evidence to be
beyond a reasonable doubt.

307
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,548
And in this case, we have no choice
but to rule in favor

308
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:20,385
of the defendant,
according to the principles.

309
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:24,823
According to Article 325
of the Penal Code,

310
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,461
the defendant is found not guilty.

311
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:46,912
Good job.

312
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,676
Are you okay? Are you not feeling well?

313
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:22,380
Now that I'm done and free from stress,
I lost all strength in my legs.

314
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,193
Where should I go now?

315
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,063
What are you doing there?
Why aren't you going home?

316
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:46,271
I want to leave,
but I can't remember where I live.

317
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,873
I'll take you there.

318
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,742
I know your address.

319
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:52,744
Thanks.

320
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,384
What are you doing?
It's late. You should go.

321
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,219
I want to record this memory,

322
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,823
the time I spent in here today.

323
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,560
What? What do you mean?

324
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,867
I am going to get hurt a lot
while defending people,

325
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,403
just as in the Min Jun-guk case.

326
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:23,642
I'll be disappointed and hurt
by the defendants' lies.

327
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,277
And a lot of times it will be in vain.

328
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:31,149
And I'll want to give up being a lawyer
each time that happens.

329
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:32,884
Right?

330
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,987
Yes. Probably.

331
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:40,525
Every time that happens,
I'm going to remember this trial.

332
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,394
That's how I will hold on.

333
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:48,366
There are moments valuable enough
to cover all the other pain.

334
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:55,140
And for those moments,
I am going to hold on tight.

335
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:14,192
This is it. Unit 804.
Go on in. I'm leaving.

336
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,878
Why aren't you going in?

337
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,850
I don't remember the password.

338
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,023
Hold on.

339
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,028
LOCKSMITH

340
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,496
Here it is.

341
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:56,067
I'm calling the locksmith.
Change the password later.

342
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,673
Hello? This is unit 804,
Rose Apartment Building 210.

343
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,808
The door lock is broken.
Please come quickly.

344
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,745
What? 30 minutes?

345
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,781
Why would it take so long?
It's not even midnight.

346
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,585
Okay, please hurry.

347
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,721
It's going to take 30 minutes.

348
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,629
Why isn't he coming?
It's been over 30 minutes.

349
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,137
Aren't you worried?

350
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,172
About what?

351
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,810
If Min Jun-guk is alive,
doesn't it mean you're in danger?

352
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,346
Probably?

353
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:49,521
If I had really killed him,
then you wouldn't have to worry.

354
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,256
Don't even say that.

355
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:54,959
It's better that he's alive
than you becoming a murderer.

356
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:57,729
I see.

357
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,760
GO TO THE BANK AND CHECK YOUR BALANCE

358
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,001
PREPARE FOR THE GED

359
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,276
Do not contact me anymore.

360
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:48,359
So did you lose to Hye-seong again?

361
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,461
Don't worry. I'm going to appeal.

362
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:55,933
On what grounds did she argue
that Min Jun-guk is alive?

363
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,671
Do you remember Hwang Dal-jung,
who was Min Jun-guk's cellmate?

364
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:05,009
I remember. His perjury put you in a spot.

365
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:09,614
He was also imprisoned
for a left-hand murder case 26 years ago.

366
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,885
She argued that Min Jun-guk
must have staged it the same way.

367
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,120
-"Staged it"?
-Yes.

368
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:20,725
They said he cut off his left hand
to make Park Su-ha the murderer,

369
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,226
and ran away.

370
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,929
How can that make sense?

371
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,158
Ms. Jjang asked me to thank you.

372
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:58,563
There's no need to thank me.
I just told the truth.

373
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:03,468
But without your testimony,
it wouldn't have been easy.

374
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,036
I'm thankful too.

375
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,105
That's okay.

376
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,744
I think I'm getting out of here next week.

377
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:18,049
Did you pass the parole review?

378
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,219
No, it's a stay of execution.

379
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,355
What? A stay of execution?

380
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,323
Why?

381
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,161
They said there's something up here.

382
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,666
I kept getting dizzy and nauseous,
so I saw a doctor.

383
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,768
He said he thinks there's something here.

384
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,238
He said I didn't have long.

385
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:48,980
When I heard that,
I was reminded of Park Su-ha.

386
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,118
At least he won't have to live like me.

387
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,562
What changed? Your tone has become calmer.

388
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,398
I learned a lot while working at the shop.

389
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:11,869
I shouldn't force my taste on customers,
but find out their tastes.

390
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,272
Ko Seong-bin. You've grown up a lot.

391
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,173
Yes.

392
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,911
You have your badge on.
You didn't for a while.

393
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:20,978
What?

394
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,750
-Yes.
-You said it embarrassed you.

395
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:29,053
Aren't you embarrassed anymore?
Did you change your mind?

396
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,689
Shut it. It's none of your business.

397
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,127
Did you meet Su-ha?

398
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,263
He called me. We're meeting later.

399
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:45,002
When you meet him,
could you do me a favor?

400
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,373
-Are you buying a new phone?
-Yes.

401
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,275
Is there anything you'd prefer?

402
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,746
I'll have this one.

403
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,089
Su-ha!

404
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,260
Do you know how much I've missed you?

405
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,929
What? Okay.

406
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,665
Do you know me?

407
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,971
It's true. You really don't remember me.

408
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:21,973
I'm sorry.

409
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,277
It's okay. We can start over.

410
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,813
I'm Seong-bin. Ko Seong-bin.

411
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,015
You used to like me,
so you followed me around.

412
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,585
Stop lying, will you?

413
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,020
What is that?

414
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,925
Don't be fooled.
Everything she says is a lie.

415
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,760
Why is he here?

416
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,630
Hey, Su-ha called me first.

417
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,698
You're the one who wasn't invited.

418
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,733
Geez!

419
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,102
Thank you.

420
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,272
Here, it's all yours.

421
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:55,706
Thank you.

422
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:04,782
Why are your eyes red? Did you cry?

423
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:08,085
No. I haven't been sleeping.

424
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,555
You must be up watching porn.

425
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:15,760
-That hurts!
-Not everyone is like you.

426
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,062
Why can't you sleep?

427
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,665
I don't know. I guess it's insomnia.

428
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,535
Do you know Jang Hye-seong's number?

429
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,570
Me? I don't.

430
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,640
-Don't you know it?
-What?

431
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:35,680
I know it,
but she told me not to give it to you.

432
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,014
Why?

433
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,518
I don't know, but she asked me not to.

434
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:43,854
You're so childish.

435
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,890
Are you jealous of that lawyer lady?

436
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:50,127
Hey! It's not like that!
She told me not to tell him.

437
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,165
I'm sorry. I promised her.

438
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,972
What's with that lady?

439
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,041
Why is she playing hard to get?

440
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,248
Do you think the prosecutor will appeal
Park Su-ha's case?

441
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:14,885
-She probably will.
-Will he be found not guilty again?

442
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,254
I don't know. I can't be sure of that.

443
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,327
Hello, Mr. Cha. What is all this?

444
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:26,263
I got an office right by yours.

445
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,798
We're neighbors now.

446
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,201
Really? What a good idea.

447
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:33,137
First, I'm going to try
to get court-appointed cases.

448
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:37,274
And I'm applying for the public defender's
special-appointment exam as well.

449
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,478
Will they let you back in?

450
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,279
I'm going to try my best.

451
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:46,517
Let me help you. Why don't we help him?

452
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,553
Sure. I'll support him in my heart.

453
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,188
Good luck.

454
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,492
LAW OFFICE OF CHA GUAN-WOO

455
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,963
You don't have a photocopy machine
or a fax machine.

456
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,297
You have them in your office.

457
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,601
I'll pay for usage. Please let me share.

458
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:08,406
I guess you're going to come by a lot
because of that excuse.

459
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,475
-Am I right?
-About what?

460
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,111
It's an excuse to see Ms. Jang.

461
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,815
My gosh. You're so quick-witted.

462
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,252
That's right.

463
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:23,687
Here.

464
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,224
Isn't this the person
who reported Park Su-ha?

465
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:30,261
Yes, I waited a really long time,
but she didn't come out.

466
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,630
Do you know what was stranger?

467
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:33,964
What?

468
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,437
That person didn't even know Park Su-ha.

469
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,772
She even thought he was a woman.

470
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,243
STATEMENT OF A REASONS FOR APPEAL

471
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,685
Ms. Seo, Mr. Cha Guan-woo is here
to meet you.

472
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,988
Tell him I'm busy. Or that I'm out.

473
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,660
You're in here. Why did you lie to me?

474
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,665
Thank you.

475
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,472
-What are you doing here?
-Are you looking for Min Jun-guk?

476
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,807
No, why would I look for a dead man?

477
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:20,344
Didn't the trial's decision state
that he may still be alive?

478
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,347
I don't believe that.

479
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,350
You should find him yourself
if you want to.

480
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:30,855
Don't you think it's presumptuous to come
and tell me what to do?

481
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,324
MIN'S FARM

482
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:35,860
What is this?

483
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:39,163
It's the fruit-store owner
who reported Park Su-ha.

484
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:44,535
But when we met her,
she thought Park Su-ha was a woman.

485
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:46,904
Isn't that strange?

486
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,406
How can someone
who doesn't know him at all report him?

487
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:52,676
And from Gapyeong,
which is far from Ganghwa Island.

488
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,413
What are you trying to say?

489
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,048
Don't you think it's strange?

490
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,184
Not at all.

491
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,887
-The possibility Min Jun-guk could be--
-There is none.

492
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:06,657
There's less than
a 0.000001% chance of that.

493
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,135
GO TO THE BANK AND CHECK YOUR BALANCE

494
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,042
GET SOCIAL SECURITY CARD

495
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,549
PREPARE FOR THE GED

496
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,083
DON'T SKIP MEALS

497
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,556
STUDY FOR COLLEGE (YOU HAD GOOD GRADES)

498
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:39,723
BUY PENS AND STUDY AIDS

499
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,031
CALL YOUR FRIENDS

500
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,566
GET A GIRLFRIEND

501
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,132
I saw someone who looks like you again.

502
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,970
Where are you right now?

503
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,506
I did not forget you.

504
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:35,879
If I meet you again, I will protect you.

505
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:38,782
I want to see you.

506
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,539
I want to see you.

507
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,991
Don't contact me anymore.

508
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:42,046
Don't worry,
I'm going to do my very best tomorrow.

509
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:45,149
I'm going to get an acquittal
no matter what.

510
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:50,988
Though it's not much, it's my way
of paying back the debt I owe you two.

511
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:55,693
And once I get an acquittal,

512
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:00,064
I'm going to ask you again.

513
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,033
If you can consider taking me back.

514
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,419
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

515
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,089
I've been looking for you for a while.

516
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:27,558
Why?

517
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,493
To give you this.

518
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,528
It's a gift to commemorate
my office opening.

519
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:34,298
I thought I would get rice cakes,
but I put a little thought into it.

520
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,966
Eat it as a snack.

521
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,036
Sure. Thank you.

522
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,205
Ms. Jjang.

523
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:43,273
Yes?

524
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:48,212
Remember what I told you before?

525
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:49,947
What?

526
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,883
That I would ask you after the trial.

527
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,285
Yes.

528
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:59,123
Can you give me an answer now?

529
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:04,495
Well... That is...

530
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,934
I'm sorry, Mr. Cha.

531
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:14,104
My answer is the same as it was then.

532
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:23,046
Do you still resent me?

533
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,050
No.

534
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,220
I don't resent you anymore.

535
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:35,692
Then can I ask you
why I can't be your boyfriend?

536
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,409
ATTORNEY LEE HYEON-YEONG

537
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,778
ATTORNEY LEE HYEON-CHEOL

538
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:08,125
Excuse me. Do you know
where Jang Hye-seong's office is?

539
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,259
I don't know.

540
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:17,568
Pardon me. Do you know
where the public defender's office is?

541
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,904
Isn't that Park Su-ha?

542
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,408
Yes, it is. Hey, Park Su-ha!

543
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:31,415
What are you doing here?
Are you looking for someone?

544
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,718
Do you know
where Jang Hye-seong's office is?

545
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,921
Of course we do. She works in our office.

546
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:42,459
I have to meet her.
Please help me meet her.

547
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,599
-She's not here.
-Ms. Jang, you have a guest.

548
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:54,738
That's strange.
Her trial starts at three o'clock today.

549
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,577
Tell him I'm not here
and get him out of here.

550
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:08,385
That's right. She said she would
go home straight from an interview.

551
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,556
What do you mean? She has a trial soon.

552
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:13,957
The pyramid-scheme one.

553
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:19,396
It's been postponed.
I don't think you can meet her today.

554
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:23,100
Okay. I'll come back tomorrow.

555
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:26,703
Sure. Bye.

556
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,609
He's gone. You can come out.

557
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,549
Shoot. My leg hurts.

558
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:43,020
What is this? Were you avoiding him?

559
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,023
Did you borrow money from Park Su-ha?

560
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,726
I don't want to get involved
with him now that the trial's over.

561
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,329
Are you going to be okay?

562
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:55,132
Today's trial is about a pyramid scheme.

563
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:57,834
That is the worst kind.

564
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,938
There are a lot of victims
who are very aggressive.

565
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:04,374
How aggressive can they be?
They can't attack the lawyer.

566
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,678
-Give me back my money!
-How much did you take?

567
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:09,780
-Hey!
-Oh, shit!

568
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,417
How can you defend someone like him?

569
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,020
You'll regret doing this!

570
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:20,958
How can he send his kid to school abroad
and not pay us back?

571
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:23,727
Why are you doing this to me?
Let go of my hair!

572
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,097
Stop it!

573
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:30,567
Do you want to be charged
for violence and blackmail?

574
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:35,339
She's a public defender.
She doesn't get paid!

575
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,174
Let me go!

576
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,043
-Gosh!
-Oh my goodness.

577
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:49,152
What if I hadn't turned up?
You should have come with someone.

578
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:50,620
I will next time.

579
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:54,524
If I were a little late,
you could have gotten hurt.

580
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:55,926
I'm not hurt.

581
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:58,862
Think about it. If I weren't there...

582
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:02,199
Is it so hard to say "thank you"?

583
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,767
But I'm not thankful.

584
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,737
Why not? I saved you.

585
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:08,305
You're a judge.

586
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:12,809
Taking my side could give
the wrong impression.

587
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:17,114
I think you forgot about
how fair you should be as a judge.

588
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,685
She's an oddity in this legal world.

589
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:24,121
How did she become a lawyer
with such a temper?

590
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,429
-I didn't say anything.
-Walk forward.

591
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,198
-What?
-Hurry!

592
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,400
Why?

593
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:57,854
I should get going.

594
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,690
Are you thankful now?

595
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,393
No, you were going this way anyway.

596
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,896
Your skirt is turned around.

597
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:15,705
She is such an odd one. What an oddity.

598
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,341
REASONS FOR APPEAL

599
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,448
MIN'S FARM

600
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:35,392
Isn't that strange?

601
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:37,561
How can a total stranger report him?

602
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:40,730
And from Gapyeong,
which is far from Ganghwa Island.

603
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:55,178
MIN'S FARM

604
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:03,887
Hello! What can I get you?
Today's peaches are great.

605
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,722
Are you Mun Sung-nam?

606
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,225
You reported Park Su-ha to the police.

607
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:11,862
What is it now?
Did you come to take away my reward?

608
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:14,931
Go away. I'm not selling fruit to you.

609
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:19,970
I could take your reward,
if you don't tell me the truth.

610
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,272
Why are you doing this?

611
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:26,443
It's not as if I broke the law
by reporting a bad person.

612
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,878
Of course not.

613
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:32,382
But how could you report Park Su-ha
when you don't know him?

614
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:37,354
Someone told me I could make money
by reporting him.

615
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,289
That's why I did it.

616
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:40,991
Who was that?

617
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,560
It was someone who bought some fruit.

618
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:46,963
He told me when I gave him a discount.

619
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,132
Do you remember his face?

620
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,700
Could you remember if you saw a photo?

621
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,570
If I see a photo I guess.

622
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:01,178
Is he among these men?

623
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,484
No, he's not here.

624
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,921
-You're not lying, are you?
-No.

625
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:15,358
Shall I just choose one of them?
Will you let me keep my reward then?

626
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:17,894
I'm done here.

627
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:13,250
Please don't avoid me and talk to me.

628
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,319
Okay. Let's talk.

629
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,074
Talk to me. What do you want to say?

630
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:44,481
There's so much to say.
I haven't been able to thank you.

631
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,984
Thank you so much
for believing and defending me.

632
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,390
Okay. I accept your gratitude.
Okay? What else?

633
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,059
Why can't I contact you?

634
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,161
I'm really busy.

635
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:01,531
To handle 30 cases a month,
I need more than 30 hours a day.

636
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:05,101
So I have no time for you. And?

637
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,338
Did I really not like you?

638
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:12,776
You didn't like me. You didn't respect me.

639
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:16,680
You were rude and nagged me.
Is there anything else?

640
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,115
What about you?

641
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,785
Did you not like me?

642
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,657
Shall I be honest?

643
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:31,494
I didn't just dislike you,
I was so tired of you.

644
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:35,432
Do you know how ridiculous it was
to see you pretend to be an adult?

645
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,868
That's not all.
You were good at making me mad.

646
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:43,840
Why did you defend me then?
You said you didn't like me.

647
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,610
I guess that's why you got the wrong idea.

648
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,579
Didn't I tell you?

649
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:53,249
You're not special to me. Min Jun-guk is.

650
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:58,121
I had to get an acquittal
to keep believing in the law.

651
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,023
That's why I defended you so hard.

652
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:07,397
I got all I wanted out of this trial.
I also learned what a lawyer is.

653
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:11,401
I'm grateful for that.
But that's as far as it goes.

654
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,371
So you should stop, too. Okay?

655
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:17,107
It's late. I should go.

656
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,213
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

657
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,450
Even though you hate me so much,

658
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:29,853
couldn't you stay?

659
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:33,456
Let me go.

660
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,327
I feel like all my connections
to this world have been cut off.

661
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:40,530
If you let me go, then...

662
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:47,937
Mr. Cha.

663
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:59,482
You're stuck in a situation, right?
Say you're going to watch a movie with me.

664
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,454
That's right.
We were supposed to watch a movie.

665
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:10,226
I have to go.
I'm sorry. I'm too late, right?

666
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:28,011
Don't go!

667
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,500
Don't go!

668
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,170
Please.

669
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:10,286
-Thank you.
-For what?

670
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,956
Please go to Soojik-dong.

671
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:16,759
No, let me off at the corner.
I can take a bus.

672
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,928
Don't get off. I'll take you home.

673
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,523
I guess this happened before.

674
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,073
-Go on in.
-Okay.

675
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,209
Thanks for today.

676
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,445
Then buy me lunch tomorrow.

677
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,548
Then I take back my thanks.

678
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:17,387
You haven't changed.
I don't have to worry. I should go.

679
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:19,849
Why isn't the bus coming?

680
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:46,142
Do you still resent me?

681
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,480
No.

682
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,783
I don't resent you anymore.

683
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:59,055
Then can I ask you
why I can't be your boyfriend?

684
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,781
I know this doesn't make sense.

685
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,818
I can't believe it either.

686
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:44,167
But I keep thinking about him.

687
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:56,646
I can't believe this.

688
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:01,784
I know this doesn't make sense.

689
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,455
I think I like him.

690
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,029
What should I do with you?

691
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,837
So I'm going to end it. I have to end it.

692
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,440
I can do it.

693
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,768
