1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:55,021
I'm not the one who started all of this!

2
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,958
It was your father!

3
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,397
Is there anything else
you haven't told me?

4
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,000
Is that all you lied about?

5
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,120
What should I tell her?

6
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,023
No excuses will work.

7
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,126
What if she hangs up
when she hears my voice?

8
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,997
Will I be able to live
if this is the end for us?

9
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,717
Hello? It's Su-ha. Don't hang up on me.

10
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,753
I heard everything from Mr. Cha.
You heard about my father--

11
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,223
I've been waiting for you to call,
Park Su-ha.

12
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,261
Are you looking for Jang Hye-seong?

13
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,898
She is with me right now.

14
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,538
Where are you?

15
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,374
Where are you? Where are you right now?

16
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,376
Don't get worked up
and listen to me carefully.

17
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:28,248
Jang Hye-seong's life depends on
what you do now.

18
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,251
If you do anything to her,
I'm going to kill you!

19
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,019
That's what I want.

20
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:39,292
So don't do anything foolish, Park Su-ha.
And don't call anyone.

21
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,661
Come here alone within an hour.

22
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,564
I'm on the rooftop of Gijeong Complex.

23
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:49,602
If it looks like you bring anyone along,
I will kill Jang Hye-seong, immediately.

24
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,437
Got it?

25
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,706
Let me hear her voice.

26
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,243
Let me hear if she is alive!

27
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,681
Talk. He said he wants to hear your voice.

28
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,784
Talk, I said.

29
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,421
Don't you dare come here, Su-ha.
Send the police.

30
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,691
Don't come here alone.
Don't worry about me and--

31
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,662
It can't be.

32
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,804
On July 26, 2013, at 3:10 p.m.,

33
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,540
she was kidnapped by Min Jun-guk.

34
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,109
Two hours and thirty minutes later,

35
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,080
our 11-year story came to an end.

36
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,623
She's disappeared.

37
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,124
What do you know?

38
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,626
The lawyer didn't come.

39
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,828
I think my phone is missing.

40
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,930
I'll find out for myself.

41
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,801
LEGENDARY 100% SUCCESS RATE
HEART TRANSPLANT SURGERY

42
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,135
TO: JANG HYE-SEONG

43
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,165
-Stop right there!
-Stop!

44
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,603
The license plate number is 4885.

45
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,509
-Are you okay?
-Yes. He's out and about early.

46
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,645
I have to get that bag back.

47
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,381
Don't worry. I know who that is.

48
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:46,286
It's me. That 4885 is at it again.

49
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,522
Go to his hideout and bring him in.

50
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,063
Hey, mister, I have the goods.

51
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,965
Where should I meet you?

52
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,339
Mr. Cha. Look at me. Right now.

53
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,707
I'm looking at you.

54
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,279
Explain this. What is this?

55
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,148
Who is Park Ju-hyeok?

56
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,483
And what about the old lady with dementia
and her grandson?

57
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,053
-I can't tell you.
-Mr. Cha!

58
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,222
I can't tell you. I'm sorry.

59
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,626
I don't want to lie to you.
So please don't ask anymore.

60
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,864
You must be doing this for me.

61
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,102
There must be a good reason.
That's the kind of person you are.

62
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,138
It must be one of the following.

63
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,142
Either it will hurt me
or hurt someone else.

64
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,548
If it's me, then I'm really disappointed.

65
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:54,120
I can't believe you think I'm so pathetic
that I can't handle it.

66
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,058
Okay. I'll find out for myself.

67
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,863
Park Ju-hyeok is Park Su-ha's father.

68
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,467
The old lady with dementia
and grandson are

69
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,571
Min Jun-guk's mother and son.

70
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:18,578
And the one
who sent you the letter is Min Jun-guk.

71
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,519
Min Jun-guk sent this?

72
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,054
Why?

73
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:32,492
He didn't just send it to you.
He sent it to me and Su-ha, too.

74
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:34,927
Why?

75
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,663
What does he want to say?

76
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:43,369
I think how his wife died
is somehow related to Su-ha's father.

77
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:51,344
When he came to see me, he told me
that was what started everything.

78
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:56,349
And that he was going to end things soon.

79
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,485
"End things"?

80
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,221
What does that mean?

81
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,270
Hey, mister.

82
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,409
Where's the bag?

83
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,144
Here.

84
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,518
Did he see your face?

85
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,622
No, I was wearing sunglasses.
You told me not to show my face.

86
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,797
-Good job.
-That's it? You only need the phone?

87
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,533
Yes. You can take care of the rest.

88
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,205
I'll pay you once everything ends well.

89
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,808
How can you not pay me right now?

90
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:00,480
I wouldn't have done this
if he hadn't been my cellmate.

91
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,869
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

92
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,006
He's never turned his phone off before.

93
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,547
Seong-bin?

94
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,849
Yes, Ms. Jang.

95
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,919
Have you talked to Su-ha today?

96
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,988
No, he's probably in class right now.

97
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:46,058
He always kept his phone on even
when he was in class.

98
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,027
But it's off right now.

99
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,296
His battery must have died.

100
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,064
Maybe.

101
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,901
Okay.

102
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,207
Who is it?

103
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,678
It was Ms. Jjang. She's worried
because Su-ha's phone is turned off.

104
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,149
He could be in class or the battery died.
Why is she so worried over that?

105
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:14,787
She used to reject him.
Have things changed between them?

106
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,624
Wow, Park Su-ha. He's got skills.

107
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,428
Things haven't changed.
It's still just a crush.

108
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:26,265
No, I think that lady likes Su-ha, too.

109
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:30,202
No. She refused him too hard.
Maybe she always liked him.

110
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,443
It's not like that.
Ms. Jjang is very hard to get.

111
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,978
She wouldn't fall for him.

112
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,614
How do you know that?

113
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,284
I may not know other things,
but I have a black belt in romance.

114
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,455
And why are you getting your hands done
all the time? This isn't like you.

115
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,692
Because... Well...

116
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,261
For my job. I use my hands to make money.

117
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,862
Obviously, I should take good care
of them.

118
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,764
Really?

119
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,701
In any case,
you're helping me raise my sales.

120
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,003
Stay like this for 30 minutes.

121
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,342
I'll paint your pinky for free.

122
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,879
Hey, what about this. Hey, Ko Seong-bin!

123
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,351
Ko Seong-bin,

124
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,453
you don't have a black belt in romance.

125
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,188
You don't even have a white belt.

126
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,668
Hey, 4885, you just got out.
How can you get in trouble again?

127
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:40,940
Right? Change your license plate number.
It's too easy to catch you.

128
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:04,764
Ms. Seo is doing her best
to make her father feel better.

129
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,501
She doesn't seem like the type
who likes to do something like this.

130
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:12,138
I know. Can you send me this, too?

131
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm going to tease her about it later.

132
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,745
Turn on your phone, you fool!

133
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,416
Mine is on.

134
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,919
I didn't mean you.

135
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,090
Ms. Jjang.
Don't you have a 2:00 p.m. trial?

136
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,927
Oh my. I didn't know it was time already.

137
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,563
I'll go with you.
I have a 2:00 p.m. trial, too.

138
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,265
Okay.

139
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:51,210
Mr. Cha could've just gone straight
to court from his interview.

140
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,612
Did he come back to escort Ms. Jang?

141
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,047
I guess so.

142
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,984
Ms. Jang said she has no feelings
for Mr. Cha.

143
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,087
So why does she let him continue?

144
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,789
She should just tell him to stop.

145
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,427
People will say that she's leading him on.

146
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,496
Geez.

147
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,532
Why can't you see more
than just surface-level?

148
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,367
Does that look like she's leading him on?

149
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:19,371
Why did you hit me?
Of course she's leading him on.

150
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,709
Mr. Cha still feels
as though he owes a debt to Ms. Jjang.

151
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,612
He let Ms. Jjang's
mother's murderer get away.

152
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,482
And now that man is trying
to hurt her, too.

153
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:36,122
If she gets hurt, knowing his personality,
Mr. Cha could never be a lawyer again.

154
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:40,025
He'll quit being a lawyer
and won't be able to do anything.

155
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,263
That is why he is doing his best
to protect her.

156
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:48,067
And that's why Ms. Jjang lets him do it.

157
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:54,807
Su-ha.

158
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,176
Here.

159
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,147
You really found it.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

160
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,649
-Check if anything is missing.
-Okay.

161
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,686
It's here.

162
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,890
What about your wallet and mobile phone?

163
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,960
I think my phone is missing.

164
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,763
It's really not here.

165
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,466
When did he take it out?

166
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,669
Don't worry.
I'll tell the guys to look for it.

167
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:27,706
You can take your time.
I've found this, so it's okay.

168
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,608
Thank you!

169
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,677
Hey, stop running.

170
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,696
CALL

171
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,299
JJANG OF ARC

172
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,603
When will your trial end?

173
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,239
It should end at around 3:30 p.m.

174
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,641
Then I'll come and wait.
Let's leave together.

175
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,280
The police are following me,
so you don't have to do that.

176
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,884
There's no harm in being careful.
Call me later.

177
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,454
Mr. Cha.

178
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,423
Yes?

179
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,861
It's nothing. I'll call you when I'm done.

180
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,463
Sure. See you later.

181
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,605
Why can't he be reached?

182
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,646
STALKER

183
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,850
Hey, you fool. Where are you?

184
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,186
Why is your phone off? I was worried.

185
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,787
Do you remember my voice?

186
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,391
Are you looking for Park Su-ha?

187
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,028
Why do you...

188
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,299
Why do you have Su-ha's phone?

189
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,536
Why do you think?
It's because I'm with him.

190
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,172
Is Su-ha safe?

191
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,774
For now.

192
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,845
But things will change
depending on what you do.

193
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,216
What do you want?

194
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,320
Don't worry.
I'm not interested in the kid.

195
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,622
You're the one I have a grudge against.

196
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,557
Where are you?

197
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,161
That's right. That's what you should ask.

198
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,331
Come to the rooftop
of Gijeong Complex right now.

199
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:36,669
If you bring anyone,
this kid and I will both die.

200
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,204
Don't tell anyone and come alone.

201
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,206
Do you understand?

202
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,408
Hello?

203
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:43,375
Hello...

204
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,515
Su-ha... Oh, no...

205
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,839
Please take me to Gijeong Complex,
quickly.

206
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,042
Gijeong Complex?
Hasn't it been demolished?

207
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,910
Not yet. Please hurry.

208
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,025
JUDGE ELECTRIC FAN

209
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,397
The caller you have dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

210
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,600
Why does she have a phone
if she doesn't want to be reached?

211
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:26,178
It looks as if something has come up
for defense counsel.

212
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,180
We will postpone this trial...

213
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,917
to another date.

214
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,427
Hey, it's you.

215
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,796
Isn't Ms. Jang in?

216
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,065
She went to court for a trial at 2 p.m.

217
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,100
She went with Mr. Cha.

218
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,136
Really? Thank you.

219
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:23,902
You're so in love with him
that you can be fooled so easily.

220
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,749
-Yes?
-Is the trial over?

221
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,152
No, we didn't even get to start.

222
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,421
-Why?
-The lawyer didn't come.

223
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:46,492
She didn't come for 30 minutes
so we had the trial postponed.

224
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,361
Why didn't she come?

225
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,696
Who knows?

226
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,632
The judge kept calling,
but couldn't get hold of her.

227
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:55,254
MR. CHA

228
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,390
Hello? Ms. Jjang?

229
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,295
It got cut off.

230
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,131
I walked her to court.

231
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,604
Is it because of that article?

232
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,873
No, that can't be.

233
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:21,413
By any chance, did you tell Ms. Jjang
about my father?

234
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,482
What?

235
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:25,951
Yes.

236
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:31,456
While going through my desk, she found
the articles Min Jun-guk had sent.

237
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,895
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

238
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,931
Does she know everything?

239
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,268
Yes. Almost.

240
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:47,839
So...

241
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,208
That's why she disappeared.

242
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,744
No, this has nothing
to do with her finding out.

243
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,946
-This is--
-What do you know?

244
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,617
Why did you tell her?

245
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,225
Park Su-ha!

246
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:58,910
Are you awake?

247
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,781
How brave you are.

248
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,952
Were you going to go up against me
with just this?

249
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,157
What about Su-ha?

250
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,659
Where's Su-ha?

251
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,294
Park Su-ha isn't here.

252
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:19,631
This is all I have.

253
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:27,172
Even a rational person becomes irrational
in such a situation.

254
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,741
And becomes a fool.

255
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,911
I know because it happened to me, too.

256
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,013
What are you going to do?

257
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,916
What are you up to?

258
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,354
At first,
I was going to kill you and the kid.

259
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,222
But

260
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,959
what that squirt said at the fishing place

261
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,462
truly

262
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,701
infuriated me.

263
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,038
Kill me.

264
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,676
How are you different

265
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,246
from me 11 years ago?

266
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,702
I'm different.

267
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,506
Unlike you,

268
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,075
I won't live like an animal.

269
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,077
Never.

270
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,581
He said he wouldn't live
like an animal like me.

271
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:48,420
He won't live like an animal like me...

272
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:55,393
Will he be able to say that
when he's in the same situation as I am?

273
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,631
He says he won't live
like an animal like me...

274
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,968
What are you thinking?

275
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,103
I decided not to kill you two,

276
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,273
but I have something else planned.

277
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,543
Are you...

278
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,146
I became curious.

279
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,749
Will he really be able to do it?

280
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:22,954
If the kid lost everyone that he has,
just like I did,

281
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,758
will he be able
to resist becoming an animal?

282
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,228
Aren't you curious, too?

283
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,532
I'll show you.

284
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,405
INCOMING CALL

285
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,449
Hello? It's Su-ha. Don't hang up on me.

286
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,219
I heard everything from Mr. Cha.
You heard about my father--

287
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,454
I've been waiting for you to call,
Park Su-ha.

288
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,899
Are you looking for Jang Hye-seong?

289
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,902
She is with me right now.

290
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,438
Where are you?

291
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,508
Where are you? Where are you right now?

292
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,243
Don't get worked up
and listen to me carefully.

293
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:23,181
Jang Hye-seong's life depends
on what you do now.

294
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,485
If you do anything to her,
I'm going to kill you!

295
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,259
That's what I want.

296
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,762
So don't do anything foolish, Park Su-ha.

297
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,831
And don't call anyone.

298
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,000
Come here alone within an hour.

299
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,502
I'm on the rooftop of Gijeong Complex.

300
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:50,442
If it looks like you brought anyone along,
I will kill Jang Hye-seong immediately.

301
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:51,977
Got it?

302
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,979
Let me hear her voice.

303
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,650
Let me hear if she is alive!

304
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,992
Talk. He said he wants to hear your voice.

305
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,162
Talk, I said.

306
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,200
Don't you dare come here, Su-ha.
Send the police.

307
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,203
Don't you dare come here alone.
Don't worry about me and--

308
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,006
POWER OFF

309
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,651
It can't be.

310
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,387
What should I do?

311
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,589
What should I do?

312
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,859
What should I do?

313
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,892
That kid. I almost had him.

314
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:10,482
Gosh. Did you see that?

315
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:15,653
I was just sucking on it
because it was bleeding.

316
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:18,990
Kim Chung-gi,

317
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,092
give me your phone.

318
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,261
My phone?

319
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,030
Why? Did you lose yours?

320
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,704
Hey! Park Su-ha!

321
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:37,108
What did he just do?
Did he steal my phone?

322
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,546
-Where did Park Su-ha go?
-Who are you?

323
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,816
I'm with the police.
Did you just meet Park Su-ha?

324
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,851
Where did he go?

325
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,853
I don't know.

326
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:52,056
You have to get him for me.
He just stole my phone.

327
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,760
-What?
-What's wrong with him?

328
00:29:56,127 --> 00:30:00,298
He seemed strange.
He looked as if he had been crying a lot.

329
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,602
What's your number?

330
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,071
-It's 010...
-Okay. And?

331
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,752
Is this the first time we're talking
to each other?

332
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,756
Even though we've known each other
for 11 years,

333
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,992
we haven't talked much.

334
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,094
Right?

335
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,998
Don't be a fool and give yourself up.

336
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,734
This is the end for you.

337
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,871
I know

338
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,539
that this is the end for me.

339
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:46,778
I brought you here to show you my end.

340
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,381
What is that?

341
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,016
I told you before.

342
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,253
I'm going to turn him
into an animal before I go.

343
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,189
Just like me 11 years ago,

344
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,794
I'm going to show you both
that anyone would have become like me.

345
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,830
That's what I plan to do.

346
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,499
Su-ha will never become

347
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,169
like you.

348
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,472
Don't be so sure.

349
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,542
I didn't know my life would turn out
like this either.

350
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:22,580
I know your whole story.
Why you became like this.

351
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,083
You lost your wife
because of Su-ha's father.

352
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:29,254
And you believe your mother and son died
because of my testimony.

353
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,224
Wow.

354
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:38,229
You're smart. Did you figure it out?

355
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,433
Yes, I'm not the one
who started all of this.

356
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,336
-It was Su-ha's father.
-No.

357
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,906
You're the one who started this.

358
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,610
Don't pretend to be the victim.
You're just a murderer.

359
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,813
When you killed Su-ha's father
and my mother,

360
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,549
any reason or excuse
that you had all disappeared.

361
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,051
That was the beginning.

362
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,923
No one would listen to me,
what could I do?

363
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:09,594
The doctor, the police,
no one would listen to me, no one.

364
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,196
Should I have done nothing?

365
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,632
Endure it?
Do you think that would be possible?

366
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,170
You know what?

367
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,273
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

368
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:28,579
If everyone lived by that law,
everyone would become blind.

369
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,416
People who harm you

370
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,954
do it because they are jealous.

371
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,390
Don't hate those people.
Have sympathy for them.

372
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:43,461
Feel sorry for them.

373
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,363
Okay?

374
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,305
Those were my mother's last words.

375
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:58,042
Looking at you,
now I know why she said them.

376
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:06,184
Now I know what state of mind you were in
for the past 11 years.

377
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,387
Revenge. Resentment.

378
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:14,225
For the past 11 years,
that's all you thought about.

379
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,229
It must have been hell.

380
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,465
What?

381
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,035
Don't think Su-ha will become like you.

382
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,337
Su-ha is different.

383
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,676
I said don't be so sure.

384
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,079
I am sure.

385
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,118
The Su-ha I know is nothing like you.

386
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,655
He's not lousy like you.

387
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,291
Shut it!

388
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,771
The caller you have dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

389
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,481
Hello?

390
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,317
It's me, Park Su-ha.

391
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:16,020
Where are you? Did you find Ms. Jjang?

392
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:17,955
Yes.

393
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,693
Ms. Jjang has just been kidnapped
by Min Jun-guk.

394
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:24,829
What?

395
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,800
He told me to come alone.

396
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,036
He threatened to kill her
if I told the police.

397
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:34,705
Where are you?

398
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,476
I'm almost at Gijeong Complex.

399
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,311
He told me to come to the rooftop.

400
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,514
No, you can't go in there alone!

401
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,250
I have no other choice.

402
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,453
If you go there,
you'll be doing what he wants.

403
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,555
If I don't go, she will die!

404
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,192
You could die as well.
This is not what's best for Ms. Jjang!

405
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,062
So

406
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,731
please save us.

407
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:07,905
I...

408
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:10,842
I don't want to die.

409
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,612
I used to think
that I wouldn't mind dying to protect her.

410
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,682
But not anymore.

411
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,985
If anything happens to me,

412
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,955
she will be hurt.

413
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,892
Please save her

414
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,261
and me.

415
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,664
Bring the police and whoever you can.

416
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,666
Please save us.

417
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,036
I will try to hold out until you come.

418
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,106
Please.

419
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:24,081
Kid, you kept your promise well.

420
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,855
You really came alone.

421
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,273
Taxi!

422
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,579
Gijeong Complex, please.

423
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,851
It's me. Min Jun-guk kidnapped Ms. Jjang.

424
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:06,023
I know. We're tracking
Jang Hye-seong's phone right now.

425
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,093
Ms. Jjang and Min Jun-guk are
at Gijeong Complex.

426
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,995
What? Gijeong Complex?

427
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:12,830
That's about to be demolished.

428
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,833
Park Su-ha is on his way there alone
to save Ms. Jjang.

429
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,102
What? That fool!

430
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:19,670
You should have stopped him.

431
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,672
I have no choice. He's already there.

432
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,508
Can you ask the SWAT team for backup?

433
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,712
I will. We'll leave right now.

434
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,749
Min Jun-guk is planning to kill both
of them and then himself.

435
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,884
If we agitate him, things could worsen.

436
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,154
-Do you mean he'll kill himself?
-Yes.

437
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,724
I have a terrible hunch.

438
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,427
I think Min Jun-guk wants
to turn Park Su-ha into a murderer.

439
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,371
We have to get the hostage
to safety first, so cover this area.

440
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,073
Quietly approach the building
right next to Gijeong Complex.

441
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,509
And you should assist the SWAT team.

442
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,311
-Ask them to come quickly.
-Yes, sir.

443
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,714
And remember that Min Jun-guk could try
to hurt himself.

444
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,883
-Remember that.
-Yes, sir.

445
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,190
POLICE

446
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,868
Where is she?

447
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,806
I came alone as you told me to.
Let her go right now.

448
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,611
You're too calm. This is no fun.

449
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,448
Why don't you jump at me like before?

450
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,652
I know why you are doing this right now.

451
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,590
And I have no intention
of playing along with it.

452
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,030
I told you before.

453
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:03,134
I will never live like an animal like you.

454
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,170
"Animal."

455
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,407
Do you think I was always an animal?

456
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,943
I was a human being, too, at first.

457
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,747
Thank you. Please come again.

458
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,450
I had a wife I loved.

459
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,586
I did everything to save my wife.

460
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,890
They said she could live
if she had a heart transplant.

461
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,860
I worked two full-time jobs
and earned as much as I could.

462
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:36,934
And I was so happy
when we got a heart to be transplanted.

463
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:39,570
I was just a human.

464
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:48,078
But the heart was stolen from us
an hour before the surgery

465
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:49,647
by your father.

466
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:54,351
Your father stole my wife's heart
to save your mother.

467
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,255
He talked the doctor into it
with a few news articles.

468
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,224
He manipulated the transplant list.

469
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:01,992
Did you know that?

470
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,462
I know.

471
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:11,769
Then you must know that it was your father
who started all of this.

472
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,104
No.

473
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,607
You're the one who started all of this,
Min Jun-guk.

474
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:20,644
When you killed my father,
you just became a murderer.

475
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,349
That is exactly what Jang Hye-seong said.

476
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,785
Where is she?

477
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,875
Tell me where she is!

478
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,612
When you lose everything,

479
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,381
any human becomes an animal.

480
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,484
There's nothing to lose.

481
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,210
Actually, I didn't plan to kill her.

482
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:32,383
I planned to use her as bait
to get you here and then let her go.

483
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,153
But

484
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,723
she provoked me, saying
that you would be different from me.

485
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,095
I suddenly got really mad.

486
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,135
So?

487
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,272
Did you kill her?

488
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,707
Yes.

489
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,510
I killed her.

490
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,289
Did you really kill her?

491
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,593
You said you would let her live if I came!

492
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,063
She dug her own grave.

493
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:22,066
How does it feel?

494
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,606
Hurry!

495
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,409
How does it feel?

496
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,851
It feels dirty. You're going crazy.
And you want to kill me, right?

497
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,387
Kill me.

498
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:19,890
Kill me.

499
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,512
Yes. Now you know

500
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,380
how I felt

501
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,116
when I started all of this 11 years ago.

502
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:28,826
Even if you hate him enough to kill him,
don't kill him.

503
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,228
Then all your reasons will disappear.

504
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:45,709
She is alive.

505
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:47,644
What?

506
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,080
You're hiding your eyes from me right now.

507
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,717
That means there's something
you don't want me to know.

508
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:57,121
It means you're lying right now.

509
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:00,824
I'm right, aren't I?

510
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,128
She is alive.

511
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,163
I'm sure.

512
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,238
I already told you I killed her.

513
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:21,078
Jang Hye-seong!

514
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,549
Jang Hye-seong! Can you hear my voice?

515
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:31,455
Listen carefully!

516
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:35,526
I will never kill this man!

517
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,163
I will keep my promise to you!

518
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,367
I will never live like an animal!

519
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:47,070
I will keep my promise to you!

520
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,975
So don't worry and wait. Understand?

521
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:11,295
Ms. Jjang!

522
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,342
Ms. Jjang, are you okay?

523
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,327
I said I killed Jang Hye-seong.

524
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:44,795
How many times

525
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,664
do I have to tell you
before you understand?

526
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,102
No, she's alive.

527
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,038
And even if...

528
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:02,613
Even if she's not,
my decision is the same.

529
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,416
I won't live like you.

530
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,062
You're trying to be cool
until the very end.

531
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,643
-We have to go to the rooftop.
-It's dangerous.

532
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,845
The police are downstairs.
You should go get treated--

533
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,246
I said I have to go!

534
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:49,293
She wouldn't want me
to waste my life seeking revenge on you,

535
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,964
just like your wife.

536
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:03,540
If your wife knew
you were living like this...

537
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:07,511
she would be in pain.

538
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,081
You're a terrible mess right now.

539
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:18,488
You're contemptible.
And I feel sorry for you.

540
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,732
I've made my decision.

541
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:33,303
So don't use me as an excuse
for how your life turned out anymore.

542
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:17,414
This is the end. The police are here.

543
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,049
You should give up and surrender to them.

544
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,940
Bring the heart!

545
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,710
You said she could get surgery!

546
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:51,548
Please do it, I beg of you.
I have the money.

547
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:52,916
Please save her.

548
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:57,888
It's my wife's turn.
Bring her the heart, please.

549
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,189
Please save her.

550
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,558
I don't want to die.

551
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,861
Honey, please,

552
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,397
save me.

553
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:10,434
Okay.

554
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:39,429
Don't worry about the surgery.
It will work out well.

555
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,531
-Thank you.
-Sure.

556
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,680
Give me the heart!

557
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,687
Daddy!

558
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,393
I said I would kill you!

559
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,496
She became a lawyer.

560
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:14,364
That bitch.

561
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,038
The defendant is found not guilty.

562
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,376
Kill me. Just like I did!

563
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,377
Kill me.

564
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:29,212
I'm thinking of what to do.

565
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:33,850
Shall I stop here
or shall I keep going to the end?

566
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,324
What are you doing?

567
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:18,662
I told you. This is the end for me.

568
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,801
Stop it!

569
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:41,918
Park Su-ha.

570
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,354
Let's go together.

571
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,731
Come this way!

572
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,534
-Arrest Min Jun-guk.
-Yes, sir!

573
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,336
Make sure Park Su-ha is safe.

574
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,037
Call an ambulance!

575
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,448
Let me go!

576
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:15,051
Just kill me! Let me go!

577
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,587
Just kill me.

578
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,124
Get in!

579
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,159
Are you okay, Park Su-ha?

580
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,262
Su-ha.

581
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,572
Are you hurt?

582
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,441
Yes, I think so.

583
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:44,180
What about Ms. Jjang? Is she safe?

584
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:47,183
We don't know yet.
We haven't heard anything yet.

585
00:54:59,029 --> 00:54:59,963
No.

586
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,435
No!

587
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,005
No!

588
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,479
No!

589
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,325
Good job.

590
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,828
I couldn't have done it without you.

591
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:08,598
If we found out the location any later,
we couldn't have set up the air mat.

592
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,333
And the SWAT team wouldn't have arrived
in time.

593
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,235
Park Su-ha held out well.

594
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:18,708
-Hello.
-Hello.

595
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:21,244
-Is Hye-seong safe?
-Yes.

596
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:24,781
She hurt her head, but she's okay.
She's being treated now.

597
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:28,752
What a relief.

598
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:31,755
Is Park Su-ha okay?
Did he do anything foolish?

599
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,290
No, he didn't.

600
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,130
That's a relief.

601
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:44,701
I was also worried
that Park Su-ha might kill Min Jun-guk.

602
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,136
What about Min Jun-guk?

603
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,739
The doctor said
that he just has some bruises.

604
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,608
So we sent him to the police station.

605
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,143
We'll start investigating right away.

606
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:55,178
Please let me know
once the investigation is over.

607
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:56,513
Yes, Ms. Seo.

608
00:56:57,514 --> 00:57:00,316
Min Jun-guk will not be able
to get away this time.

609
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:03,486
Murder, blackmail,
retaliation, and bodily injury,

610
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,955
I'm going to indict him
for each and everything.

611
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:09,125
Of course. The death penalty
isn't enough for him.

612
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:13,263
Yes. A man like him should be isolated
from society forever.

613
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,233
Why did you come to me?

614
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:21,838
I felt like there needed to be
at least one person who knew my story,

615
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:23,773
because

616
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:26,810
I am going to take this to the very end.

617
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:32,449
Ms. Seo.

618
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,552
This might sound crazy.

619
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:37,353
But I feel sorry,

620
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,189
just a little sorry,

621
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,858
for Min Jun-guk.

622
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,093
You "feel sorry" for him?

623
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:47,230
You must be crazy.
You're not in your right mind.

624
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,365
He killed so many people.

625
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:52,135
He even broke your arm.

626
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:56,005
I know that he is a bad person.

627
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,352
-Where is she?
-Hold on.

628
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:11,688
-Jang Hye-seong!
-Hold on.

629
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:12,822
Jang Hye-seong!

630
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:16,392
Ms. Seo,

631
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,729
do you know the difference
between Min Jun-guk and Park Su-ha?

632
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:22,098
No, I don't.

633
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,167
And I don't want to.

634
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,107
Please stop.

635
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,644
Min Jun-guk had no one.

636
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:35,879
Where is she?

637
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:39,582
No one who believed him
or would listen to him.

638
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,385
Or anyone to love him.

639
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:47,056
Jang Hye-seong!

640
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:50,260
And he had no one he had to protect.

641
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:58,201
If he had even one such person,
he might have lived differently.

642
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:00,904
Just like Su-ha.

643
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:03,373
That's why

644
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,375
I feel a little sorry

645
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,510
for Min Jun-guk.

646
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:19,622
You fool.

647
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,559
I was worried you were dead.

648
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:28,364
I heard you before.

649
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:30,767
I heard your voice.

650
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:37,574
Thank you for being alive.

651
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:50,086
On July 26, 2013 at 5:40 p.m.,

652
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:52,388
Min Jun-guk was arrested.

653
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:56,859
And the 11 years of history
among the three of us ended.

654
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:07,236
How did your mother pass away?

655
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,842
She died about a month
after the heart transplant.

656
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,611
It got rejected.

657
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,016
That's why Min Jun-guk got even angrier.

658
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:24,153
The heart that was to save his wife
was gone just like that.

659
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:26,956
Yes.

660
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:29,892
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

661
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,029
The more I wanted you,
the more I got scared.

662
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,598
I was scared that I might lose you.

663
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:42,238
Do I look like someone
who would abandon you for that?

664
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,507
I've told you many times.

665
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,476
-I have a personality that
-"I have a personality that

666
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,878
-surpasses the average person's.
-surpasses the average person's."

667
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:00,490
Don't blame yourself.

668
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,291
It's not your fault.

669
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,104
Thank you.

670
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:23,746
But at that time, the two
of us had forgotten one important thing.

671
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:30,253
That once Min Jun-guk was caught,
his past would be revealed to the world.

672
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:33,523
And when his past was revealed...

673
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:53,743
my hidden past would also be revealed
to the world as well.

674
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:12,028
And I love you.

675
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:32,949
We were so happy we were alive
that we forgot all about it.

676
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,221
