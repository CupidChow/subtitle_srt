1
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,995
Around 11:00 p.m. last night
in Myeongwol-dong, Seongmu City,

2
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,297
a fire occurred at a chicken shop.
Its cause is unknown.

3
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:34,434
The fire burned part of the chicken store,

4
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,937
and was put out after 15 minutes,
causing 5.4 million won in damage.

5
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:41,941
The 52-year-old owner
Ms. Eo died in the accident.

6
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,577
And 43-year-old employee, Mr. Min,
who put out the fire

7
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,881
is being treated at the hospital
for burns sustained on his arms and legs.

8
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,618
The police and fire officials are expected
to summon Mr. Min once he is treated

9
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:55,622
to determine the exact cause for the fire.

10
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,096
I would like to be investigated
near my home instead of here.

11
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,131
Could I ask for a transfer?

12
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,768
A FEW WEEKS LATER

13
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,372
The funeral is really late.

14
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,040
Hasn't it been a while since the accident?

15
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,943
Yes, I think it took a long time
because of the autopsy.

16
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,878
I heard the arson suspect was indicted.

17
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:21,448
Yes, did you know it was assigned to us?

18
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,484
I know. Why did it have
to be us of all people?

19
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,086
It happened in Seongmu City.

20
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,956
Since his residence is here,
the defendant asked for a transfer.

21
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:33,993
This is too much.

22
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,864
These are the friends' phone numbers
of the late Ms. Eo.

23
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,501
Please call them.
I'll get the funeral supplies.

24
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,936
Okay.

25
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,039
-Hello.
-Hello.

26
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,466
I don't know how to console you.

27
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,535
Thank you for coming.

28
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:20,039
And Judge, what about my trials...

29
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:20,940
Don't worry.

30
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,910
We already made changes.

31
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:30,016
I heard Min Jun-guk asked
for a public defender.

32
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:31,918
Yes.

33
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:37,390
Please do not assign him
either to me or Mr. Cha.

34
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:42,962
We cannot defend the man
who killed Ms. Jang's mother.

35
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,665
Of course. I'll keep that in mind.

36
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:52,438
But what you just said is very unlike you.

37
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,209
-What?
-The trial hasn't started yet.

38
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,812
I feel bad that Ms. Jang's mother died.

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,117
But we cannot say who did it yet.

40
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,121
I really didn't kill her.

41
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,857
Why would I kill her?

42
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,059
She was so kind to me.

43
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:18,131
It doesn't make sense
that I'm going to trial for killing her.

44
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,667
She must have been a good person.

45
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,002
Good is not enough.

46
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,073
She hired me knowing I had a record.

47
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:33,580
She made me seaweed soup and food
for my birthday.

48
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:38,985
I see.

49
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:43,289
So that's why you ran into the shop,
even though it was on fire.

50
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,024
To save her.

51
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,227
Yes.

52
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,198
I thought I should save her,
even if I ended up dying.

53
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,736
But I read the daughter's statement.

54
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,472
It says she has some history with you.

55
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,875
That's probably why
she thinks I killed her mother.

56
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,944
But that's a misunderstanding.

57
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,813
"A misunderstanding"?

58
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,516
I killed a man
in a car accident ten years ago.

59
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,787
It was an accident,
but she saw it as murder.

60
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,890
And once she said so at trial,

61
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,493
I was charged with murder.

62
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:25,999
So even then it was an accident
and you didn't kill that man.

63
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,069
That means the trial was wrong then...

64
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,105
That's right.

65
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,009
I'm a victim, too. A victim of the law.

66
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,745
There is one thing you don't know.

67
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:45,551
Jang Hye-seong wasn't the only one
who had witnessed that accident.

68
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,387
There was one more person.

69
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,522
What?

70
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,758
And that is me.

71
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,963
What are you doing? Run away!

72
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:03,936
The way I remember it,
it wasn't a simple car accident.

73
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,311
The human mind is quite interesting.

74
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,182
Even if you say ten truths,
but tell one lie,

75
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:22,355
then you start doubting
if those truths were really truths at all.

76
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,026
See you in court, Min Jun-guk.

77
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,306
EMERGENCY CONVOY

78
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,910
Let's think.

79
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,646
What should I do?

80
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,354
You jerk!

81
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,862
Why did you do it? Why?

82
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,131
Why did you kill an innocent person? Why?

83
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:09,235
I didn't do it! I didn't kill her!

84
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,309
Move.

85
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,979
Are you even human?

86
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,815
How can a human do that?

87
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,385
Help me.

88
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,820
Here, eat. You haven't eaten all day.

89
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,957
I'm not hungry. I had some snacks.

90
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,430
We don't have many relatives,
so there's no one to carry the casket.

91
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,365
Do I have to hire people?

92
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,435
Do I have to call her friends
for the procession?

93
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,672
I'll take care of everything.

94
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,874
Let's eat first.

95
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,944
I didn't eat so we could eat together.

96
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,382
Thank you.

97
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,594
You have a lot of trials, right?
You should eat and go home.

98
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,464
No. I'm your boyfriend now.

99
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,934
You'll cry if you're alone.
I can't just leave.

100
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,905
Please let me be alone. So I can cry.

101
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,742
Ms. Jjang.

102
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,614
Can you do that for me?

103
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,784
You're my boyfriend now.

104
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,399
Is something wrong with me?

105
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,105
Or am I just really spiteful?

106
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,281
-Hey.
-Hey.

107
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,686
Where did you go?
I didn't see you all day.

108
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,990
I went to see...

109
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,693
Min Jun-guk.

110
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:51,898
What did he say?

111
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,699
That he didn't do it.

112
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,470
That he has been wronged.

113
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,608
And what did you read?

114
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,511
Did he really not kill her?

115
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,348
No.

116
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:15,288
Did you find out
what her last moments were like?

117
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,792
Yes.

118
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,598
Min Jun-guk...

119
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,271
let her talk to you before he did it.

120
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,041
Talk to me?

121
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,211
What does he...

122
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,449
Mom, is there anything you're keeping
from me?

123
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,252
What do you mean?

124
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:52,124
You're not hiding that you're sick
or it's too hard to work, right?

125
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,126
I am.

126
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,028
What is it?

127
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,565
You said you're married to the law.

128
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,002
I'm worried that you'll never get married.

129
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,452
What? I'm being serious.

130
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,787
Anything else?

131
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,490
Nothing else.

132
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:31,097
If there is,
you should be frank with me, okay?

133
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,033
-I'm hanging up.
-Hold on, Hye-seong!

134
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,010
Hye-seong. You know what?

135
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,780
"Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth."

136
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:54,453
If everyone lived by that law,
then we would all become blind.

137
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,690
What are you saying out of the blue?

138
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,993
People who harm you...

139
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,030
do it because they are jealous.

140
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,566
It's because you're doing so well.
They're just jealous.

141
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,906
Don't hate those people.
Have sympathy for them.

142
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,243
Feel sorry for them, okay?

143
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,746
There you go again.
You're taking Do-yeon's side again.

144
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,214
Mom.

145
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,989
Mom.

146
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:37,897
What am I to do, Mom? I didn't know.

147
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,600
Promise me.

148
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,270
Mom!

149
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:51,610
Don't waste your life
hating someone, okay?

150
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,582
You only live once.

151
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,687
There's barely enough time to love people.

152
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,457
Okay?

153
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,994
Okay, I'll try.

154
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:11,897
Good.

155
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,200
Good.

156
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,236
That's my daughter.

157
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,239
I really didn't know, Mom.

158
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,410
I didn't know that would be the end.

159
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,649
My poor mother.

160
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,919
My poor mother.

161
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,402
Do you like that part of the crab?

162
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:30,609
No, I actually prefer the legs...

163
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,680
People don't know how to eat crab.

164
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,083
This is the highlight of marinated crab.

165
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,120
Judge Kim!

166
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,692
What are you doing here, Mr. Cha?

167
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,328
I cannot defend Min Jun-guk.

168
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,931
I already told you that I cannot do it!

169
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:56,602
I know that. The problem is
I selected other lawyers for him.

170
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,337
But they all quit.

171
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,407
We can't go to trial without a lawyer.

172
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,443
Jang Hye-seong works
at the same office as I do.

173
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,048
-How can I defend the man who--
-We don't know if he did it yet.

174
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,116
We need to go to trial to know that.

175
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,184
Judge Kim!

176
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,120
I know this must be hard.

177
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,356
But this is not a matter of choice.

178
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,192
This is why we need public defenders.

179
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,395
And you are a public defender.

180
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,702
Then please give this case to Mr. Shin.

181
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,104
I will ask him myself.

182
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,573
-That will also be difficult.
-Why?

183
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:40,579
Min Jun-guk asked
that you be assigned to his case.

184
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,152
DEFENDANT: MIN JUN-GUK
REQUEST: ATTORNEY CHA GUAN-WOO

185
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,621
You know Judge Kim.

186
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,923
How can he be so cruel?

187
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,592
Does he not like Mr. Cha?

188
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,794
The other lawyers all quit.

189
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,897
What about our office?

190
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,566
Mr. Cha is the one
who lifts up our spirits here.

191
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,136
If he becomes gloomy,
our office will become gloomy.

192
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,306
Don't you worry.
Your talking will prevent that.

193
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,976
What about Ms. Jang?

194
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,647
She'll go crazy
if she finds out Mr. Cha is his lawyer.

195
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:18,083
Hey! Sit down! You're driving me crazy!

196
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,421
-Ms. Jjang.
-Ms. Jjang?

197
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,224
Who is...

198
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,928
defending whom?

199
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,908
People come to us because either
they took money or someone's life.

200
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,179
Most of them are criminals
who aren't worth defending.

201
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,848
But it's not
as if we can choose not to defend them.

202
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,685
If that happens to you,
how will you defend them?

203
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,500
-Ms. Jjang.
-I heard.

204
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,470
You're defending Min Jun-guk.

205
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,341
Yes, I have no choice.

206
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,444
It's good. I'm relieved.

207
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,179
What?

208
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,215
I was worried
the case would go to Mr. Shin.

209
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:28,053
As an attorney first and colleague second,
he probably would not believe me

210
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,189
and side with Min Jun-guk, right?

211
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,324
But you won't do that.

212
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,962
You're wholly on my side, right?

213
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,670
You believe me, right?

214
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,639
Yes.

215
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,442
I believe you.

216
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:53,912
Thank you.

217
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,616
You're wholly on my side, right?

218
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:36,722
YEONJU DETENTION CENTER

219
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,868
You won't be able to meet
Min Jun-guk today.

220
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,870
Why is that?

221
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,206
He just tried to kill himself.

222
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,341
What?

223
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:03,315
I guess a former convict
shouldn't have asked to be forgiven.

224
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:09,588
I wanted to ask Jang Hye-seong
and Park Su-ha for their forgiveness.

225
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,191
I wanted to tell them

226
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,127
that I would live a good life
and they shouldn't be scared of me.

227
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:20,632
But my very existence was a threat
to them.

228
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,336
I wanted to show them how I felt.

229
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,474
If I couldn't do it directly,
I wanted to do it indirectly.

230
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,845
That's why I went
to Jang Hye-seong's mother.

231
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:38,183
I thought if I showed my sincerity to her,
her daughter would feel it.

232
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,020
Fortunately, Ms. Eo saw how sincere I was.

233
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,023
And she treated me like a human,
not an animal.

234
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,695
Maybe I really did kill her.

235
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,266
I knew she fainted often from arrhythmia.

236
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,767
But I didn't stay by her side.

237
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,273
I should have saved her sooner,
but I was too late.

238
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:06,245
And I have ended up
becoming a murderer again.

239
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,049
If I could avoid being called
a murderer on my tombstone...

240
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,085
I can give up my life.

241
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,522
The late Ms. Eo must know how I feel.

242
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:21,426
She was the only one
who treated me warmly.

243
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,430
I am going to go and be with her.

244
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,051
Are you Cha Guan-woo?

245
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,686
Yes.

246
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,155
How do you feel?

247
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,992
-Can you talk?
-Yes.

248
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,695
Yes, I can.

249
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,634
I don't believe this suicide note.

250
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,636
I think the suicide was a show.

251
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,874
If you really wanted to die,
you should've done it at night.

252
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,911
I guess you could think that.

253
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,582
I have feelings for Jang Hye-seong.

254
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,418
So I have no interest in defending you.

255
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,587
It doesn't matter.

256
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,189
Why me? Why me?

257
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,025
If it's another lawyer,
she won't believe me.

258
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,900
If you prove my innocence,
though you're not on my side,

259
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:41,006
then Jang Hye-seong
would really believe me, right?

260
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,211
ATTORNEYS SELECTED FOR YEONJU DISTRICT
PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

261
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,088
So how were things between
Min Jun-guk and Eo Chun-sim?

262
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,592
SHE HAS ARRHYTHMIA AND NEEDS CONSTANT CARE

263
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,965
Can you rewind it back?

264
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,317
Don't even think about seeking vengeance

265
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,986
on Min Jun-guk.

266
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,387
Okay?

267
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,427
What are you doing? Answer me quickly.

268
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:13,298
What if Min Jun-guk tries to hurt you?

269
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,809
Don't do it even then.
I will protect myself.

270
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,055
You said the trial is
at 10 a.m. today, right?

271
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,769
Don't worry, Mom.
Mr. Cha will be on our side.

272
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,004
I believe in him.

273
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,410
You'll be late. Let's go.

274
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,045
Okay.

275
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,295
What?

276
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,969
Min Jun-guk is in there, right?

277
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,677
It seems like that time ten years ago.

278
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,080
Right?

279
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:03,742
After his release, the defendant wanted
to seek vengeance on Jang Hye-seong

280
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,744
who had testified
against him ten years ago.

281
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,346
That's when he concealed his identity,

282
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,482
and approached Ms. Jang's mother,
Eo Chun-sim, the victim.

283
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,219
The defendant caught the victim off guard.

284
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,155
He hit her on the head with a blunt weapon
and made her pass out.

285
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,458
Then he started a fire
and made it look like an accident.

286
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,829
Not only that, acting as if he had tried
to save the deceased victim

287
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,331
by carrying her on his back,
he attempted to cover up his crime.

288
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:34,339
Thus, the prosecution, pursuant
to Articles 250 and 164 of the Penal Code,

289
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:38,043
is hereby indicting Defendant Min Jun-guk
with murder and intentional arson.

290
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,614
Counsel, do you admit to the charges?

291
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:53,892
Counsel.

292
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,162
No.

293
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,265
What is it?

294
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,205
Counsel, do you admit to the charges?

295
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:21,186
No, I am denying all charges.

296
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,623
The defendant...

297
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,261
is pleading not guilty.

298
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,105
Are you crazy? You think he's innocent?

299
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,207
Ms. Jjang, don't get worked up
and hear me out.

300
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,109
How can you think that he's innocent?

301
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,378
He went to my mother to get revenge on me!

302
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,812
He wanted to ask for your forgiveness.

303
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,982
He didn't think you would accept it,
so he went to your mother.

304
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:54,286
"Forgiveness"? So why did he kill her?

305
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,154
-It was an accident.
-"Accident"?

306
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,823
-Are you out of your mind?
-There's no proof of murder.

307
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,192
The evidence proved that it wasn't arson.

308
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,727
It was a fire caused by the fryer.

309
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,496
There's nothing
on the security footage either.

310
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,666
There couldn't have been
because it was broken.

311
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,368
Did you see what was on the video
before the camera got broken?

312
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,905
It was Min Jun-guk who went
to go break the camera. Explain that.

313
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,541
We can't know for sure
if he was on his way to go break it.

314
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,579
Set aside your emotions
and think about it calmly.

315
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,650
It's a very unlucky accident
for both you and Min Jun-guk.

316
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,987
What about the injury on my mother's head?

317
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,089
She had arrhythmia.

318
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,326
She hit her head on a table
when she collapsed.

319
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,729
Min Jun-guk hit her.

320
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:42,033
Min Jun-guk hit her
on the head with a wrench.

321
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,737
Then he left the fryer on.

322
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,808
And he put on a show of trying
to get her out once she was dead.

323
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,846
And you are being fooled by him.

324
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,616
Yes, you could be right.

325
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,085
But she could have collapsed
from arrhythmia,

326
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:04,556
being unable to turn off the fryer,
and suffocated in the fire as a result.

327
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,460
Please don't do this, Mr. Cha.

328
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,431
If there is a sliver of innocence,
then I must favor the defendant.

329
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:14,933
That's the law.

330
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,435
You can't do this to me.

331
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,705
Ms. Jjang, please think about it again.

332
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:24,509
Maybe you are mistaken about Min Jun-guk.

333
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,879
Stop.

334
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,150
You should be on my side.

335
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:37,222
Your mistake could ruin a person's life.

336
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,266
Please stop.

337
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,570
Yes.

338
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,774
The records from the Park Ju-hyeok case.

339
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:57,842
Could I get them?

340
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,246
I know they might not exist,
but I just wanted to check.

341
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,116
Yes, please send them to me
if you find them.

342
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,521
Yes, I'll read them secretly
and then return them to you.

343
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,257
Thank you.

344
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:17,796
Hello?

345
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,466
Ms. Jang has gone to trial.

346
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,902
Yes, okay.

347
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,039
Is Ms. Jjang not coming
to the office today?

348
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,942
She said she's going home
straight from court.

349
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,415
Are you okay, Mr. Cha?

350
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:38,817
Mr. Shin.

351
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:46,991
I feel like a knight
protecting a very bad king.

352
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,501
-You cleaned?
-Yes.

353
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,638
-What are those plates?
-I'm going to wash them.

354
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,974
I'll help you.

355
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,044
You should go home now.

356
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,083
-Why?
-Why do you think?

357
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,954
Since Min Jun-guk is in custody,
there's no reason for you to be here.

358
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,525
No, I'm not going.

359
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,932
I don't want to see anyone.

360
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,734
I hate you and Mr. Cha.

361
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:33,204
I even feel like fighting with this rag.

362
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,307
I want to be alone,
so leave when I'm asking you nicely.

363
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:37,709
No.

364
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,712
Are you a kid? Don't you understand me?

365
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,747
I don't know what I'll say to you.

366
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:47,051
Yes, I'm a kid who can't understand,
so say whatever you want.

367
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,822
I resent you thousands of times a day.

368
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:54,893
I shouldn't have testified ten years ago.
This is all your fault!

369
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,696
Why? Should I say harsher things?

370
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:02,200
Sure. I'll hear you out.

371
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:13,845
Say it. You can swear, too.
I'll hear you out.

372
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:37,669
Su-ha.

373
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,071
Yes?

374
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:42,774
That's vegetable oil.

375
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,450
Did you read the judge's mind?

376
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,054
-Yes.
-Which side?

377
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,590
Innocent or guilty?

378
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,360
It's 51 percent to 49.

379
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,229
Which is 51 percent?

380
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:07,432
Innocent.

381
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,508
I can do it.

382
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,512
I can't do it. I can do it.

383
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:23,815
I can't do it.

384
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:27,785
I can do it.

385
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,766
I can do this.

386
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,576
My mother doesn't
feel comfortable seeing you.

387
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,345
We should talk here.

388
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:31,316
How do you think
Min Jun-guk's trial will go?

389
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,685
To be honest, it doesn't look too good.

390
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,821
There is no hard evidence.
Everything is circumstantial.

391
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,691
And Mr. Cha is targeting that.

392
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,360
You know who Min Jun-guk is, right?

393
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,296
I do.

394
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,732
If you had testified instead of me...

395
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,035
you would be the one mourning.

396
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,071
I want to get him as bad as you do.

397
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,073
-But there's no--
-Then fabricate it.

398
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,008
Are you crazy?

399
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,280
Jang Hye-seong.

400
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,249
Please.

401
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,988
Help me, Do-yeon.

402
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,325
I didn't know this day would come.

403
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,896
I didn't know I would kneel down
and beg you like this one day.

404
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,067
I have no pride left.

405
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,905
I must get that man,
even if I have to lay everything down.

406
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,943
I will do anything you want.

407
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:36,814
Everything I said,
including what happened ten years ago...

408
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,918
I will apologize if you want me to.

409
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:46,057
I was wrong about everything.

410
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:52,030
So please get him. You're a prosecutor.

411
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,966
Threaten someone or fabricate evidence.
Do whatever it takes.

412
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:59,370
You must never let the man
who killed my mother go free.

413
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,943
Is that apology sincere?

414
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,080
Father.

415
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:17,021
Is that apology sincere?

416
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,794
I'm sorry, Mom.

417
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:31,135
Yes. I was wrong back then.

418
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,440
So please help me.

419
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:43,448
If I were the judge,
I would've ruled not guilty.

420
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:49,554
And if I were the prosecutor,
I would have created more evidence.

421
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,123
Create evidence?

422
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,193
Creating hard evidence
that wasn't there is hard.

423
00:34:55,293 --> 00:35:00,231
But, creating words
that weren't there is easy.

424
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,501
I met all the witnesses
and the people who know him,

425
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:07,371
including the landlord,
police officers and even the pastor.

426
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,374
They all said good things about him.

427
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,611
You have to find
someone who needs something.

428
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,115
Someone who will benefit from testifying.

429
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,016
"Someone who will benefit"?

430
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:24,388
Did you find any of Min Jun-guk's
fellow inmates when he was incarcerated?

431
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,425
No, not yet.

432
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:32,396
How do you know Min Jun-guk?

433
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,765
He shared a cell with someone I know.

434
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:41,405
I think I can find someone.

435
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:46,010
A prisoner will want to be released
on parole.

436
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,580
I will talk to the head of the prison.

437
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,283
Make a deal with that.

438
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,720
You mean I should make him lie
on the stand?

439
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,756
If you can catch the criminal that way,
then you should do it.

440
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,224
But perjury is...

441
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,028
You did it ten years ago, didn't you?

442
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,465
She couldn't have seen it.

443
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,736
No, she didn't.
How could she see what I didn't do?

444
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,070
I saw it, too.

445
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,474
I saw Hye-seong point it at me.

446
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,945
If you're sure he did it
and this is the way to get him,

447
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,781
then I think you should do
everything possible.

448
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:32,056
What do you think? Do you agree with me?

449
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,362
Yes.

450
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,343
Are you doing laundry today?

451
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,214
How can Seo Do-yeon be the only person
I can rely on right now?

452
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,016
How can Mr. Cha be the one
on the other side?

453
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,351
How can it be?

454
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,455
You met with Seo Do-yeon?

455
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,959
Yes, I went and begged.

456
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,996
I kneeled down and begged
for her to get Min Jun-guk.

457
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,565
That's not all.

458
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:18,803
I said I was the one ten years ago
who had caused the firework accident, too.

459
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:33,484
Wash your feet.
You'll just make it dirtier.

460
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:43,327
Jun-guk killed someone?

461
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,428
Yes.

462
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:48,165
He's indicted
for killing Jang Hye-seong's mother.

463
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,968
You shared a cell with Min Jun-guk, right?

464
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:56,407
Did Min Jun-guk ever mention
Jang Hye-seong to you?

465
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,242
Yes, he did.

466
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:03,381
He did, but only
that he owed her something.

467
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:07,184
He didn't say anything else.
This can't be right.

468
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,987
Jun-guk is such a good guy.

469
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:14,025
I think that you are mistaken about him.

470
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,297
-Mr. Yang?
-Yes?

471
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,500
-Please excuse us.
-Yes.

472
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:34,445
You lost your daughter
when you were imprisoned 25 years ago.

473
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:37,648
What?

474
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:40,584
Don't you want to get out and find her?

475
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,821
Can I really get out soon?

476
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:48,826
That depends
on how you answer my next question.

477
00:38:56,634 --> 00:39:00,771
So, you're going to testify
at Min Jun-guk's trial?

478
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,906
Tiffany.

479
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:08,045
Yes, I think I'm going to be
the prosecutor's witness.

480
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,313
Goo Hara.

481
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,883
Why are you the prosecutor's witness?

482
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:16,187
Didn't you say
that Min Jun-guk is a good guy?

483
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,521
Sandara Park.

484
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,292
But then I thought about it.

485
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,761
I think I was wrong.

486
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:27,965
There was something suspicious about him.

487
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,737
Why are you looking at me like that?

488
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,475
What? It's your turn.

489
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,110
I said "Sandara Park."

490
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,648
IU.

491
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,183
If the testimony goes well today,

492
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,821
we can get a guilty verdict.

493
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,957
It's because you were right.

494
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:33,531
Just like your father,
you are always right.

495
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,601
I'm right again, right?

496
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,106
Please tell me so.

497
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:02,960
What are you doing here?
You don't have a trial today.

498
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,797
He has come to support you, Ms. Jang.

499
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,300
It's the last hearing
before the sentencing.

500
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:13,237
I came because I wanted
to ask you something.

501
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:14,672
What is it?

502
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,442
What did you ask
Hwang Dal-jung to do today?

503
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:21,579
Ask him?

504
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,548
I didn't do such a thing.

505
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:29,286
Didn't you ask him to do something
you shouldn't to get Min Jun-guk?

506
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:34,291
-I didn't.
-Why are you quarreling again?

507
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,862
The trial is about to begin.
You should go in, Ms. Jang.

508
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:45,169
What if I did?

509
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:49,406
What couldn't I ask
if we can get the criminal?

510
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:50,841
Ms. Jang.

511
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,010
Are you saying you won't abide
by the rules?

512
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,112
If I abide by the rules,
we will let the criminal loose.

513
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,315
Don't you know it will make things worse?

514
00:41:58,382 --> 00:41:59,783
No! I don't know!

515
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,653
Have you ever been the victim?

516
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:06,757
There is nothing
that a victim can do in this country.

517
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:10,728
I wasn't even able to ask Min Jun-guk
why he had killed my mother.

518
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,063
The victim can't meet the perpetrator.

519
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:18,269
And the judge hears more from
Min Jun-guk than me in court.

520
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,005
The victim feels so wronged
that she could die!

521
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,240
But there is nothing I can do.

522
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,544
Innocent until proven guilty?
Rational principles?

523
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:28,879
It's all rubbish.

524
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,850
As a victim, the principles
and methods are all rubbish.

525
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,518
And the lawyer is a damn jerk.

526
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,222
And I'm also one of those damn jerks.

527
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:52,770
Are you okay?

528
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:59,076
If Min Jun-guk gets released
after being declared not guilty at trial,

529
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,513
do you think Ms. Jang
will continue to be a lawyer?

530
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:09,386
Witness, please take the oath.

531
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,199
"Oath.

532
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,269
I promise to tell the truth"...

533
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,439
Witness, please speak up.

534
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:32,977
"Oath.

535
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:37,681
I promise to tell the truth,
the whole truth"...

536
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,485
What is the judge thinking?

537
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,853
Guilty?

538
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:47,758
"If I say an untruth, I swear I may be
subjected to the penalties for perjury."

539
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:51,195
-Witness, Hwang Dal-jung.
-Then, is it not guilty?

540
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,168
Fifty-fifty?

541
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:03,307
That's good enough.
The last witness is ours.

542
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,209
We can get him to rule guilty.

543
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,512
Please go first, Ms. Prosecutor.

544
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:17,454
You served your jail term in the same cell
as the defendant, right?

545
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,357
Yes.

546
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:26,597
Did you ever hear about Jang Hye-seong
from the defendant?

547
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:32,936
I saw him collect information about her,
saying he owed her something.

548
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,841
What did it seem like he owed her?

549
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:44,248
A grudge.

550
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,450
Why did you think so?

551
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:52,423
He said that he wanted to kill her.

552
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,225
He said he would kill her when he got out.

553
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,129
When did I do that?

554
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,603
Your Honor, as you just heard,

555
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,973
the defendant had a grudge
against Jang Hye-seong, the daughter.

556
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,342
And he planned his revenge over ten years.

557
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:18,148
All the other witnesses said
that the defendant was a good man.

558
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,919
But it was all a facade to seek vengeance.

559
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,123
It was very meticulous and clever.

560
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:31,495
No one saw the real side of the defendant.

561
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:36,400
It's because the defendant was
always pretending to be good.

562
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:40,704
And once his true self behind the mask
was revealed, he killed.

563
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,708
It was Park Ju-hyeok ten years ago.

564
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,711
And the victim, Eo Chun-sim, in this case.

565
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:55,953
If he gets released, he might kill others
who know his true self.

566
00:45:57,154 --> 00:46:02,860
Until now, the law was not able to see
the defendant's true side.

567
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:06,263
And that cost the lives of many victims.

568
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,902
It's time for the law
to see the reality clearly.

569
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:15,672
And protect Jang Hye-seong,
who might be the next victim.

570
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,587
Guilty, right?

571
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,756
No, it's the opposite.

572
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:38,695
The witness has become
the prosecutor's trap.

573
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,398
Counsel, your turn.

574
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:51,341
Did you share a cell
with the defendant for a long time?

575
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,311
-Yes.
-Then you must know him well.

576
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:59,183
Would you say
he's a meticulous and clever guy?

577
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:02,152
Or a slack and foolish guy?

578
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,226
I think he's quite smart.

579
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,629
You agree with the prosecutor.

580
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,301
But don't you think it's strange?

581
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:22,439
If he were so smart, why did he tell
the witness about his plan?

582
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,176
Isn't that too foolish?

583
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:27,444
But...

584
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:31,982
Come to think of it,
he isn't that meticulous and--

585
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:36,653
So he's not meticulous.
That's even stranger.

586
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:41,391
According to the prosecutor,
this was a planned murder.

587
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,094
A slack person could not have done it.

588
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:51,835
So is the defendant meticulous or a slack?

589
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:56,106
Mr. Cha has caught
the prosecutor in a contradiction.

590
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,742
You don't have to answer.

591
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:04,047
You just proved
that the defendant couldn't have done it.

592
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:06,783
Witness.

593
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:11,722
Did the defendant really tell you
about his plans?

594
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,090
What?

595
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:23,467
I can't really remember.

596
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,804
You just took the oath.

597
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,406
Let me ask again.

598
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:32,409
Did the defendant ever say
that he will kill Jang Hye-seong?

599
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,484
I don't think so.

600
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,521
He didn't.

601
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,106
Nothing further.

602
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,014
Do you have any other questions,
Ms. Prosecutor?

603
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,818
Your answer has changed
from when I questioned you.

604
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,486
Please tell the truth.

605
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:21,625
Did you hear Min Jun-guk say
he will kill Jang Hye-seong or not?

606
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:24,161
Please answer me!

607
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,731
Ms. Prosecutor, I think that's enough.

608
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:35,539
I have no choice.
I'll have to rule not guilty.

609
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:07,738
Kid, it seems all the fools in here
are on my side.

610
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:12,075
If I am to be released,

611
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,713
you and that bitch will be next.

612
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:29,559
Are you okay, Ms. Jang?

613
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:31,628
What will happen to Min Jun-guk?

614
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:35,232
He will be released
on the day of the sentencing.

615
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:36,900
But don't worry.

616
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,437
If the prosecutor appeals
and gets a guilty charge--

617
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:41,738
When is the sentencing?

618
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:45,108
They said it's the third of next month.

619
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,845
The third of next month.

620
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,388
Hye-seong.

621
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:02,692
Come quickly when I call you!

622
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,862
It's making noises,
but it's not turning on.

623
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,764
Is it broken or something?

624
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,569
Gosh.

625
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:18,775
You fixed the computer
with just one finger.

626
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,678
Are you Bill Gates?

627
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:26,216
You should study computers, not the law.

628
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:34,424
Shouldn't you wear some make-up
to a wedding?

629
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,693
I'm not the one getting married.

630
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:39,029
What do you think?

631
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,765
Wow. Did you do this?

632
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,701
Are you Picasso?

633
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,170
Shouldn't you study art?

634
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:48,572
What?

635
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,676
You're so great.

636
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:00,517
Aren't you going to eat?
You starved all day.

637
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,088
Are you sleeping?

638
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,171
CHA GUAN-WOO

639
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,773
I'M AT YOUR HOUSE.
I'LL WAIT UNTIL YOU COME.

640
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:35,819
Hey.

641
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,089
Is Ms. Jjang okay?

642
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,325
She's doing her best to be okay.

643
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,761
But you won't be able
to see her for a while.

644
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,732
I don't know how to solve this.

645
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,535
I can't give up on Ms. Jjang like this.

646
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,373
Ms. Jjang likes you a lot.

647
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,442
-What?
-That's why it's so hard for her.

648
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,547
So give her some time,
wait and protect her.

649
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:08,151
I thought you didn't like me.

650
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:10,086
I should go in.

651
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:18,128
Do you also resent me for
taking Min Jun-guk's side?

652
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:26,603
No, you did well.

653
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:30,540
-What?
-I'm rather grateful.

654
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:47,257
Thank you for giving me an opportunity.

655
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,244
SENTENCING

656
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,823
-Ko Seong-bin.
-Yes.

657
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,758
-Kim Chung-gi.
-Yes.

658
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,460
-Lee Jung-hoon.
-Yes.

659
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,196
-Park Su-ha.
-Yes.

660
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,599
Sir! Ko Seong-bin just answered
for Park Su-ha.

661
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:32,636
What? Is Park Su-ha absent?

662
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,137
Yes, he is.

663
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,239
What a jerk.

664
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:41,378
Park Su-ha hasn't been coming
to school a lot.

665
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:44,147
He thinks school is nothing
because he gets good grades.

666
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:47,384
Be quiet.

667
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,735
Ten years ago...

668
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:15,572
I was really scared.

669
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,175
But I testified because of you.

670
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,346
Because you said I'm always right.

671
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:27,016
I thought it was the right thing.

672
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:31,521
But I guess I was wrong.

673
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:35,291
The world is not like a fairy tale.

674
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:41,097
I should have run away
like Do-yeon did, right?

675
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:50,407
I'm sorry, Mom.

676
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,320
What are you doing here?

677
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,756
I read your mind this morning.

678
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,026
Aren't you going to work?

679
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:17,033
If you're not, let's go somewhere.

680
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,136
Where?

681
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,539
The place we didn't get to go.

682
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:33,283
Why did you want to come to the aquarium?

683
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,252
I finally came after four attempts.

684
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,689
Why four attempts?

685
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,061
I wanted to go with my father
but couldn't because he died.

686
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,731
And I almost came on a picnic
in middle school, but I got sick.

687
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:53,503
And then we said we would come
after the old man's trial, but we didn't.

688
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,940
I was going to go, but you didn't show up.

689
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,575
You didn't answer your phone.

690
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,243
Is that right?

691
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,680
Why did you want to come here?

692
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:08,184
You know my world is noisier than others.

693
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:12,989
I thought it would be quiet in here.
And peaceful.

694
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:16,559
You're right. It's quiet in here.

695
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:19,662
As if nothing happened.

696
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,842
I packed up my things from your place.

697
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,278
What?

698
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:39,315
Don't worry. Min Jun-guk won't harm you.

699
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:40,950
You can relax.

700
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,820
How do you know that?

701
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:50,059
I read his mind at trial.
You can trust me.

702
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,865
Is that why you asked to come here?

703
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,936
Is it like a goodbye?

704
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:09,178
And there are a few things
I need to tell you before I leave.

705
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:12,582
What's with this tension?

706
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,818
Are you never going to see me again?

707
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,721
I'm a senior. I should study.

708
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:23,593
Okay.

709
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,763
What do you want to tell me?

710
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,068
About your mother.

711
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:37,574
She was very proud of you
when she passed away.

712
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:39,842
What?

713
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,179
I read Min Jun-guk's mind.

714
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,617
You should know why you are about to die.

715
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:54,591
You're dying because your daughter
testified in court ten years ago.

716
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:58,328
Did you know? You feel wronged, right?

717
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:00,830
Yes, I do.

718
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,635
I didn't know my daughter at all.

719
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:10,440
If I knew she was so brave,

720
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,144
I should have told her
she's doing well more often.

721
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,413
And praised her more.

722
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:22,552
I was too harsh on her.

723
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:34,530
She said to tell you
that she will dance even in heaven.

724
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:40,336
She's always saying stuff like that.

725
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:50,546
So don't blame yourself too much.

726
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,385
Thanks for telling me.

727
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:03,292
And don't resent Mr. Cha too much.

728
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:06,696
He did it because he likes you a lot.

729
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,768
He really believes Min Jun-guk
and thinks that you're mistaken.

730
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:18,374
He wanted you to not be mistaken
because he doesn't know the truth.

731
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,412
It was probably the best he could do.

732
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:25,915
I know.

733
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:32,088
And I think that you know this already.

734
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:41,531
You like Mr. Cha a lot.
That's why it's so painful.

735
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:47,670
So don't hide it for too long
and let him back in.

736
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:49,939
This is best for both of you.

737
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:58,414
I've said everything, so I'm leaving now.

738
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:02,418
-Take care.
-What?

739
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:04,987
Sure.

740
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,462
Hey, Su-ha.

741
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:18,101
Well...

742
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:21,370
It's nothing.

743
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:27,009
Goodbye. Thank you for everything.

744
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,712
Study hard.

745
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:51,901
There is one more thing you don't know.

746
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,166
