1
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,174
-Put it on the end.
-Okay.

2
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,450
Hey. Hurry.

3
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:54,120
-You're not doing it right.
-Hurry up.

4
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,891
What are you doing? This is how you do it.

5
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,766
-Hey. Double Nose is on her way.
-Okay. Hurry.

6
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:13,139
She is here.

7
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,243
Double Nose, go get
the mop and clean this up.

8
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,883
Did they put enough glue on it?
It has to stick really well.

9
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:28,888
She should fall on her face.
Should we have used more oil?

10
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,595
I'll do the mopping. You wash the windows.

11
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,398
-Hey.
-No!

12
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,301
Why?

13
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,438
What is this? What's going on?

14
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:51,077
Is this glue? Who put glue on here?

15
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,683
What a fool! This is all your fault!

16
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,620
Oh, my back. My hand isn't coming off.

17
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,388
This is all your fault!

18
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,691
What am I going to do?

19
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,560
-It won't come off.
-You jerk!

20
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,131
That little...

21
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,336
-What's wrong?
-He wants to fight me.

22
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,340
Okay, Park Su-ha.
You're going to die today.

23
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,408
Why are you acting so scary?

24
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,177
Shut up, you jerk!

25
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,413
He really might kill Su-ha.

26
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,221
Finally, it came off.

27
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,260
Why is he taking it out on Su-ha?

28
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,700
This is so tiring.

29
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,012
Oh. Hey...

30
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,189
Hey. Who said I got beat up?
I just slipped on something.

31
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,492
Su-ha isn't the strongest!
We don't have that at our school.

32
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,727
I'm hanging up. I have to poop.

33
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,404
-Liar.
-You surprised me.

34
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,307
You were fighting really hard back there.

35
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:37,250
Don't feel timid.
You should pee like a man.

36
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,159
You must be curious
as to how I defeated you.

37
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,631
How did he know that?

38
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,102
-Shall I tell you my secret?
-No, thanks.

39
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:06,346
I can read people's thoughts
when I look into their eyes.

40
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:10,550
What they are thinking,
where they will attack or dodge to.

41
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,885
Really?

42
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,223
I'm joking. How can you believe that?

43
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:22,228
I have no secret.
I happened to slip and kick you.

44
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,964
Right? That's all, right?

45
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,800
You should be grateful for that luck.

46
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,472
You poor orphan. I'll let you off.

47
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,309
What?

48
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,873
Are there any good coupons for this month?

49
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,243
Yes, there's a pizza and salad coupon.

50
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,479
And a 40 percent weekday-discount coupon
for Aqua Castle.

51
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,949
-What's "Aqua Castle"?
-You don't know what that is?

52
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,119
It's the biggest aquarium in Korea.

53
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,255
We have to go see this.

54
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,125
I don't want to go.
I've been to many aquariums.

55
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,562
But I haven't. I've never been to one.

56
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,565
So let's go next week, okay?

57
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,836
Let's see.
Don't they have weekend coupons?

58
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:41,641
-I can't go during the week.
-We would only get a 30% discount.

59
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,776
What a shame.

60
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,393
Su-ha.

61
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,630
Su-ha.

62
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,534
-Stay awake.
-Dad.

63
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,673
Are you hurt? Does it hurt anywhere?

64
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,977
My head hurts.

65
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,313
Just wait a little.

66
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,683
Don't you fall asleep, okay?

67
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,837
Excuse me. Please get us out of here.

68
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,074
My son is hurt.

69
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,677
That guy is still alive.

70
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:57,183
He should have died. What a bother.

71
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:01,854
Excuse me. Please open the door.

72
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:08,961
-Dad, get out of here.
-What?

73
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:13,566
That guy is going to...

74
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,782
Dad!

75
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,686
Dad!

76
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:47,200
Since that day,
two sounds exist in my world.

77
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,536
One is the sound everyone else hears.

78
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:55,374
And another is the sound
that only I can hear.

79
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,178
Is it true that Su-ha beat up Chung-gi?

80
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,382
Where's my mobile phone?
Where did I put it?

81
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,487
I got my period. Shall I just take off?

82
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:15,461
My world is a little noisier
than other people's.

83
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:36,148
-What is this?
-Use it to remove the glue.

84
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,919
-Will it remove the glue?
-Yes.

85
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:45,725
But, Su-ha, why did you do that?
Why did you ruin our prank?

86
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,227
Was it a prank? I didn't know that.

87
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,796
Don't you lie. I know you knew.

88
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,199
I didn't know.

89
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,802
Wow. It really came off.

90
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,438
Do you like Double Nose?

91
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,041
No.

92
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,478
You told me there's someone you like
on Valentine's Day.

93
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,282
-So you wouldn't take my chocolate.
-Yes, I like someone.

94
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,385
-But it's not Double Nose.
-Who is it?

95
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,954
Could it be me?

96
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,989
I hope you don't think it's you.

97
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:21,394
Hey, do I look crazy?
I don't think it's me.

98
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,262
Who is it then?

99
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,031
Is it like a first love?

100
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,033
It's my first love.

101
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,335
Who is your first love?

102
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,537
Is she pretty? Is she nice?

103
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,073
She is pretty. Really pretty.

104
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,877
You shouldn't go for the pretty ones.

105
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,680
My teacher said that it all fades away.

106
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,715
She isn't just pretty.

107
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,154
Can you throw the ball to us, lady?

108
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,400
-What the heck.
-Geez.

109
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:07,406
She is nice. Nice and smart.
She is the most amazing woman.

110
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,941
IN SESSION

111
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,310
Your Honors.

112
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:16,682
Defendant Lee Young-cheol admits
the charges and deeply regrets them.

113
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,553
Mr. Lee is currently...
Is your mother alive?

114
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,221
Yes.

115
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:26,425
He is currently working hard
to support his mother.

116
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:30,630
Please think about the mother
who would be left all alone...

117
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,465
Your Honors.

118
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:37,803
Defendant Joo Hyeon-jeong admits
to the charge and deeply regrets it.

119
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,806
She is currently... Is your mother alive?

120
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,642
No.

121
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:49,482
Please understand she lived a lonely life
after her mother had passed away.

122
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,585
But she just passed away last year.

123
00:10:54,286 --> 00:11:00,159
Please understand she was in pain
after recently having lost her mother.

124
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,630
I was in court,
so how could I answer my phone?

125
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,234
Isn't your public defender
interview tomorrow?

126
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,736
Are you prepared?

127
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,639
Everyone passes
the public defender's exam.

128
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,441
Why would I prepare for it?

129
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,544
Don't you get your situation yet?

130
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,947
You need to pay back the money you owe me.

131
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:26,152
I'm probably the only one
who gives her lawyer daughter money.

132
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,822
Don't you watch the news?
The lawyer market is in recession.

133
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,725
There are too many lawyers,
but the number of cases remains the same.

134
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:36,228
One out of six lawyers makes less
than two million won a month.

135
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,563
"Two million won"?

136
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,598
How much did you make last month?

137
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,801
You only made 880,000 won!

138
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,737
I'm part of the "880,000 generation."

139
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,806
It's not my fault I was born
at the wrong time.

140
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,307
Whatever.

141
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,444
Will you get paid regularly
if you get this job?

142
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,514
Once you get your salary,
I will start seizing everything.

143
00:11:55,748 --> 00:12:01,554
-Okay.
-You better get that public defender job.

144
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,857
I don't care what you have to do,
even If you sell your organs.

145
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,661
You'll have to pay back
my 50 million won within a month.

146
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,397
-Okay?
-Okay.

147
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,340
You took some before.

148
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:25,678
I need a lot of these,
and you need to get rid of them.

149
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,486
She is so cheap.

150
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,924
COURTHOUSE

151
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,070
Hello.

152
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,271
Hello.

153
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,244
Hello.

154
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,914
INTERVIEWS, EAST WING, ROOM 529

155
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,184
"Room 529"? Okay.

156
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,455
529
SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM

157
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,023
Room 529.

158
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:30,442
Is this the waiting room
for the public-defender interview?

159
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,145
-Yes.
-Okay.

160
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,960
There aren't many people.
I thought it would be really tough.

161
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,030
This is strange, right?

162
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,501
-I think it's normal.
-I see.

163
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,874
I got some sample interview questions
from my friends.

164
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,276
-Do you want to see?
-No.

165
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,282
I'm so nervous.

166
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:14,787
It was my dream to be a public defender.
How about you?

167
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,860
Not at all.

168
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:26,065
I used to be in the police force,
but I quit and became a lawyer.

169
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,634
To become a public defender to be exact.

170
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,337
Aren't you curious as to why?

171
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,240
No.

172
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,343
I see.

173
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,546
What are you doing here?

174
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,316
I'm waiting for the interview
for the public defender exam.

175
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:48,787
That's in the east wing.
You're in the west wing.

176
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,122
The east...

177
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,824
But--

178
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,058
Hey, wait for me!

179
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,861
I'm sorry.

180
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:57,997
Wait for me!

181
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,901
Excuse me!

182
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,940
Excuse me!

183
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,874
COURTHOUSE

184
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,076
EAST WING

185
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,578
Hold on.

186
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,813
She is so fast. Goodness.

187
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,086
ROOM 529

188
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,293
PUBLIC-DEFENDER INTERVIEW WAITING AREA

189
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,899
Why didn't you wait?

190
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,939
All these people are interviewing?

191
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:44,109
Obviously not.
The interviews go on for three days,

192
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,813
so there should be three times more.

193
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,448
"Three times"?

194
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,119
-Show me.
-Show you what?

195
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,755
-The question list.
-What?

196
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:02,528
RESUME

197
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,529
TRANSCRIPT

198
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,465
-Attorney Cha Guan-woo?
-Yes.

199
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,100
You have high grades.

200
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,871
You must have gotten a lot
of offers from law firms.

201
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,342
So why are you applying
to be a public defender?

202
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,745
I didn't want to become
a lawyer because of money.

203
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:24,383
-I wanted to become a lawyer...
-Darn it.

204
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,118
who stood up for the rights of...

205
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,556
the people.

206
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:38,130
I will work hard to make sure
money doesn't rule over justice.

207
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,567
I'LL MAKE SURE MONEY
DOESN'T RULE OVER JUSTICE

208
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:42,801
Darn.

209
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,207
Former civil rights attorney Barack Obama
said this.

210
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,944
"I am here for the people
that the government cannot see."

211
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,747
I feel the same way.

212
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,682
Shoot.

213
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,551
A LAWYER WITH A MENTALITY THAT...

214
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,993
Attorney Jang Hye-seong, why did
you apply for this position?

215
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:20,672
GREEN DENTISTRY

216
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,510
-What is this?
-It's a dentist's sales hook.

217
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,882
I got it to save on buying Post-Its.

218
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,084
Are you trying to gain sympathy?

219
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,454
I thought I should be honest with you.

220
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,491
I came here because of money.

221
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,529
I am not good enough
to get into a law firm.

222
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,764
I don't have money
to hire a headhunter, either.

223
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:50,803
I got expelled from high school
and attended a regional university.

224
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,671
I make less than one million won a month.

225
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,776
I heard public defenders make
around three to four million won a month.

226
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,946
I've never seen such an honest lawyer.

227
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,216
This is so fresh. We should let her pass.

228
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,121
I guess you wanted a reaction like that.

229
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,990
That's only possible in soap operas.

230
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,926
You got it wrong.

231
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,331
-It's not like that--
-I don't need to see anymore.

232
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,867
You'll be notified through email.

233
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,138
Hold on.

234
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,175
Did you say you got expelled?

235
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,210
Yes.

236
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,348
Why did you get expelled?

237
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,487
Will you let me pass if I tell you?

238
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,091
I could if the story has an impact on me.

239
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,261
-Judge Kim.
-Judge Kim.

240
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,663
"Impact," you say...

241
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,468
-There is an impact.
-Then tell me.

242
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:05,377
I had a friend ten years ago.

243
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,948
She was the daughter
of the family my mother worked for.

244
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,886
She was pretty and got good grades, too.

245
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,522
She really got on my nerves.

246
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,604
And I saw something
that I shouldn't have seen.

247
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:50,856
She went from being in tenth place
in the entire school to first place.

248
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,793
Her mother had a party to celebrate it.

249
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,530
My mother and I had to cook
for that party.

250
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,232
-Ms. Eo.
-Yes?

251
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,801
-Are you ready? They're hungry.
-Yes, we're done here.

252
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,504
-Put that on two plates.
-Okay.

253
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,974
Hye-seong, can't you make it look nicer?

254
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,042
Sure.

255
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,657
Hye-seong.

256
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,460
You should stop working and come join us.

257
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,297
-Is that okay, Do-yeon?
-What? Sure.

258
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,200
Sure. Why not?

259
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,421
Do-yeon!

260
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,025
Call an ambulance!

261
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,129
Ma'am!

262
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,531
Call an ambulance!

263
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,334
-Ma'am! Do-yeon got hurt.
-What?

264
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,336
I think she is hurt.

265
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,942
I was so worried,
and shocked at the same time.

266
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:23,682
But deep inside, I think
I thought she got what she deserved.

267
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:28,086
I didn't like her much.

268
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,826
The CT shows no brain damage
but I'm worried about the left eye.

269
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,496
You're "worried"?

270
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,631
You don't mean...

271
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,136
We'll need to remove the bandages,
but the cornea damage is severe.

272
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,339
She might lose sight in her left eye.

273
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:52,978
Oh, no.

274
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:00,752
Why do we have to do all this for her?

275
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,222
Why do you have to be so mean?

276
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,561
-Hey! Do-yeon isn't any stranger.
-But it's not as though she is family.

277
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:15,167
We lived in the same house for ten years.
That makes us family.

278
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,771
Get dressed.
We have to go to the hospital.

279
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,973
No, you go alone.

280
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,644
I hate her. I don't want to see her.

281
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,214
Why do you keep hitting my head?

282
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,819
Who did this?

283
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:39,391
Who is the one
who did this to my daughter?

284
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,662
I'm not sure. It happened so quickly.

285
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,864
I didn't see who did it.

286
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:50,068
-Did you see?
-Me?

287
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,205
I think I did.

288
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,575
Who was it?

289
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,643
Well...

290
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,549
Hello.

291
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:08,053
Are you okay, Do-yeon?

292
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,423
Hye-seong did it. I saw it.

293
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,826
What did Hye-seong do?

294
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,330
She shot the firework at Do-yeon.
I saw it.

295
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,433
Me? Are you crazy?

296
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,404
When did I do that?
I didn't even light mine.

297
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:33,378
Oh my gosh. How could you?
How could you do that to her?

298
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,280
I didn't do it.

299
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,683
Why are you doing this to me?

300
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,054
Are you sure you saw it?

301
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,389
What?

302
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:50,128
Tell me if it's circumstantial
or if you really saw her do it.

303
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,865
This is important.

304
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:58,069
-Well...
-She couldn't have seen it.

305
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:02,407
No, she didn't.
How could she see what I didn't do?

306
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,142
I saw it, too.

307
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,245
I saw Hye-seong point it at me.

308
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,815
Hey.

309
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,819
See, I'm right. Didn't you see it, too?

310
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:19,424
What? Yes, I think I saw it, too.

311
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,496
Is it...

312
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,737
-Is it true?
-They're lying.

313
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,107
They are trying to blame it on me.

314
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,911
How can you back out like that?
You did this to me.

315
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,153
Excuse me. Let's go talk, Hye-seong.

316
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:52,290
Talk about what?
You should be apologizing!

317
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,293
-Hold on.
-I'm sorry.

318
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,564
Please wait a little.
Let me go talk to her.

319
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:05,337
Mom. You don't believe me either?
Is that it?

320
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,809
Do you really believe Hye-seong?

321
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,082
I didn't do it. I really didn't do it.

322
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:22,053
Look straight
into my eyes and tell me again.

323
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,391
You didn't do it? Are you sure?

324
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,928
No. I really didn't do it.

325
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,765
Even if you did, I will protect you.

326
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:39,538
So just tell me the truth
and nothing else.

327
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:44,009
I may be spiteful, but I'm your daughter.

328
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,846
I'm the daughter of Eo Chun-sim,

329
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,349
who cares more about her employers' family
than her own.

330
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,587
I hate Do-yeon, but not that much.

331
00:25:55,921 --> 00:26:00,392
I know I have a bad temper,
but it's really not to that point.

332
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,362
I'm not that spiteful.

333
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,372
Okay.

334
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:20,512
Stop crying.
Look at you. You're so filthy.

335
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,149
-Do you believe me?
-You told me to.

336
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,852
Because I told you to?
So you don't really believe me?

337
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:31,222
I said I believe you.
Why are you still upset?

338
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,625
I told you not to hit my head.

339
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:39,631
Dad, you believe me, don't you?

340
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,633
Lie down.

341
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,504
-Let's hear their story first.
-Honey.

342
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,050
Mr. and Ms. Seo.

343
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,221
I talked to Hye-seong just now.

344
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:07,025
Hye-seong isn't the one who did it.

345
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:11,463
Look. You shouldn't be trying
to protect her.

346
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,299
It's not like that.
I'm not protecting her.

347
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,336
Hye-seong isn't one to cry easily.

348
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,873
She didn't cry when her father died,

349
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,110
or even when she broke her leg
from skating.

350
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,712
She never sheds a tear.

351
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:33,084
There is only one reason she would cry.

352
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,322
When she is wrongly accused.

353
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:42,927
She was crying so much.
She must be feeling wrongly accused.

354
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:47,265
I'm sure that
someone other than Hye-seong did it.

355
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:51,403
Please believe me.
Please believe Hye-seong.

356
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:55,840
She said she saw it.
There's someone who saw her do it.

357
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,977
There were a lot of kids.
Maybe she got confused.

358
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,980
My child didn't do it. She didn't.

359
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,815
What are you doing?

360
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,285
Are you just going to stand there
and hear her talk?

361
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,462
-Hye-seong.
-Yes.

362
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,432
I'm not listening because I believe you.

363
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,967
I'm waiting.

364
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,738
What are you waiting for?

365
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:31,009
For you to admit your fault,
repent and apologize.

366
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,412
I said I didn't do it.

367
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:37,148
If you admit it now,

368
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,951
and apologize to Do-yeon,

369
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:45,190
I will forgive you and keep things
as they were, for your future.

370
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,793
-Honey.
-But if you keep lying,

371
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:55,567
I don't think I can let you go to
the same school as Do-yeon.

372
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,771
What do you mean?

373
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,609
Do you mean you'll have me expelled?

374
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,346
Mr. Seo. She said she didn't do it.

375
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,649
Why can't you believe me?

376
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:16,921
And you will have to leave my house, too.

377
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:19,824
Leave?

378
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,961
Where would we go?

379
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,630
So apologize and repent sincerely.

380
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:32,570
I'm giving you this last chance
because of our ten years together.

381
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,416
Mom.

382
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,524
I...

383
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,427
I...

384
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,303
I didn't do it!

385
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:10,942
So I have nothing to apologize for
or repent about.

386
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:28,293
We have decided
you should drop out of school.

387
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,362
It would be better for you and the school.

388
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:35,366
-What if I don't agree?
-Then you'll get expelled.

389
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,769
"Expelled"?

390
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:50,949
Thank you so much. You should go now.

391
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:56,187
-Do you have a place to go?
-I do. Don't you worry.

392
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,122
Here.

393
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:03,328
Mr. Seo said it's your severance package.

394
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,496
Don't take it.

395
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:14,973
Don't take it.
If you believe me, then don't take it.

396
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,178
You should take it.

397
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:23,414
You're going to need this money.

398
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,985
Don't take it. Please.

399
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:35,460
How can you take it?
Aren't you mad? I got expelled today.

400
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,763
I got kicked out
even though I didn't do anything.

401
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:42,066
-Get in.
-I won't.

402
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,202
Just get in.

403
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,772
I'm not going to move
until you give that money back.

404
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,175
Then you should walk.

405
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,711
Let's get going.

406
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:28,780
TEARS THAT SAVED THE LAW

407
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,750
TEARS THAT SAVED THE LAW

408
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,380
How long are you going to stand here?

409
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,816
You should go after your mother.

410
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:08,686
How much did you
give my mother in severance?

411
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,057
About ten thousand won? Or one million?

412
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:19,364
I don't know how much it is,
but that's the cost of your conscience.

413
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,101
You gave it because you feel bad.

414
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:27,005
"What if she didn't do it?"
That's why you gave it to her.

415
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,240
Right?

416
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:33,978
With that money,
I wanted to ask your mother

417
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,547
whether she believes you or not.

418
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:43,454
If she believed you, as you said,
she wouldn't have taken the money.

419
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,392
How can I believe you when she doesn't?

420
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,601
Gosh.

421
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,805
Mom.

422
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,080
TEARS THAT SAVED THE LAW

423
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,184
What are you doing?

424
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,887
"A judge with a warm heart."

425
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:23,327
I couldn't feel it when I had read it,
but I can finally feel the warmth now.

426
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,496
I asked, what are you doing?

427
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:30,301
You wouldn't listen to me,
so I wanted to show you.

428
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,571
My daughter didn't do anything.

429
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,808
She got kicked
out of school for no reason.

430
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,646
My daughter is right,
and you are wrong, Mr. Seo!

431
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,049
I wanted to show you.

432
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:52,690
It looks as though
you understand what I mean now.

433
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,092
That's good.

434
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,162
Let's go, Hye-seong.

435
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,364
Okay.

436
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,146
Mom.

437
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,983
Hye-seong, how did I do?

438
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,186
Did I look scared?

439
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,623
Could you tell I had memorized it?

440
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,927
My gosh. Was that all acting?

441
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:34,565
Hold on a moment. Did I say everything?

442
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,401
I think I had left something out.

443
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,072
YOU WON'T SAVE PEOPLE WITH THE LAW.
YOU'LL MAKE PEOPLE CRY.

444
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,640
Here it is.

445
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:47,111
"You won't save people with the law.

446
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,013
You'll make people cry."

447
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:53,050
I left that out. This was the main point.

448
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,086
I can't believe this.

449
00:35:56,521 --> 00:36:00,258
So you did believe me, Mom.

450
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,030
You.

451
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,833
I told you that I believe you.

452
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,303
Don't hit my head.

453
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:18,976
I have to take a qualification exam
and get into college with this head.

454
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,145
And I have to make money.

455
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,882
It's our lifeline now, so don't hit me.

456
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,051
"Lifeline"?

457
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,188
Do you think you can do it
with this brain?

458
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,591
With this? With this head of yours?

459
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,527
That hurt!

460
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,588
Hye-seong. What are you doing?

461
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,023
What are you going to do?

462
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:20,705
Did you really see me point it at you?

463
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:27,011
-You didn't, did you?
-I did! I saw it clearly.

464
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,214
If you did,
then why didn't you do anything?

465
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:34,185
If you saw me point it at you,
you should've avoided it as you just did.

466
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,488
You said you saw it.

467
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,058
Well...

468
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,029
I bet you didn't know I was so smart.

469
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,367
You didn't see it.
Why do you keep lying about it?

470
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:54,372
No, I didn't see it,
but you did shoot it at me.

471
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,341
You kept lying,
so I lied to make you confess.

472
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:04,382
Tell them what you just said.
Tell my mother and your father.

473
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,751
You're the one who did it. Why should I?

474
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,487
-Why should I do that?
-Seo Do-yeon!

475
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,827
What was that sound?

476
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,506
Dad!

477
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,408
What is that?

478
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,912
Did he kill that person?

479
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,988
It looks as though
he is going to kill the kid, too.

480
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,744
What are you doing? Run away!

481
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:13,444
Shoot. I could've ended things
had those brats not been there.

482
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:17,948
Can you hear me?
You're nearby, so you must.

483
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:22,219
You saw me, right?
Do you know why I killed him?

484
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,822
It's because he said the wrong thing.

485
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,659
I killed him because he didn't know
when to stop talking.

486
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:33,697
If you want to live, keep your traps shut
and go on with your lives.

487
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,033
Then nothing will happen.

488
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,337
Without witnesses,
this will just be a traffic accident.

489
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:45,042
If you go to the police
and say this was a murder,

490
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,912
I'll do the same to you.

491
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,881
If you tell your parents,
I'll do the same to them.

492
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,584
So, you two.

493
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:59,390
You need to help me
so that I don't have to kill you.

494
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,724
Okay?

495
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:07,264
Stay hidden just like you are right now.
Don't come forward. Don't speak.

496
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:12,369
I'll kill you if you speak.
I'll kill whoever hears it, too.

497
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,272
Stay hidden for all of your lives,

498
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:21,579
so I don't hear anything
or see anything at all.

499
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,648
Stay hidden.

500
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,870
Around 12:10 a.m., an accident occurred

501
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,840
at an intersection
whereby a car and a 25-ton truck collided.

502
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:54,945
The 40-year-old driver of the car,
Mr. Park, died on the spot.

503
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:58,582
His son is being treated
for head injuries at a hospital.

504
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:04,421
According to police, the truck driver
testified Park ran a red light.

505
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,991
The police are investigating the case.

506
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,926
For SBC News, this is Choi Yoo Seok.

507
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:13,097
Did you hear?
They say it wasn't an accident.

508
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,400
I hear it's a murder
and he's going to trial.

509
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,502
What's the use? They have no evidence.

510
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:22,206
Of course they do. The son said he saw it.

511
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:26,577
He is just a child.
It doesn't help in a trial.

512
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,548
So will it just be an accident
unless a witness turns up?

513
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,416
I guess so.

514
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,327
I'll kill you if you speak.
I'll kill whoever hears it, too.

515
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,430
Stay hidden for all of your lives,

516
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:51,201
so I don't hear anything
or see anything at all.

517
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,474
LOOKING FOR WITNESS OF A CAR ACCIDENT
ON APRIL 24, 2002, AT DAWN

518
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,280
What are you doing?

519
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:04,248
Oh, my!

520
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,551
It's me. Hye-seong.

521
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,987
Oh my gosh. You scared me.

522
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:12,489
Why are you hiding here?

523
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,792
I wasn't hiding.
I wanted to see the phone number.

524
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,264
Are you really going to come forward?

525
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:25,603
Yes, of course. Weren't you going to?

526
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:27,504
I...

527
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,510
Of course. I came to get the number, too.

528
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,213
I'm going to call and say I'm a witness.

529
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,049
You're lying again.

530
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,453
What you mean "call"?
You came because you're scared.

531
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:47,758
You're the one who made up stories
and blamed someone.

532
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:51,128
I've never lied in my life.

533
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,266
Really? So you're not lying
about coming forward?

534
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,936
-Of course.
-Then prove it.

535
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,473
I'll admit it if you go
and testify in court.

536
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,575
I'll admit you're not a liar.

537
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,746
Why? You can't do it?

538
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,283
No. I'll do it,

539
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,453
but you have to testify as well.

540
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,623
-What?
-That's why you came here, right?

541
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,093
If you're not lying, come to court.

542
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,864
Okay, I'll come. I will be there.

543
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,166
I was going to go.

544
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:47,618
Gosh! I must be crazy! What did I do?

545
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,325
Then prove it.

546
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,128
I'll admit it if you go
and testify in court.

547
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,897
I'll admit you're not a liar.

548
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,668
God. I can't believe this.

549
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:07,104
You should wear goggles, too.

550
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,373
Then your eyes won't sting.

551
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,781
-Mom.
-What?

552
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,051
Am I prettier than Miss Korea?

553
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:24,455
Of course not.

554
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:29,593
That's your problem. You're too honest.

555
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:37,935
Then, what about me and Do-yeon?

556
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:45,642
Do-yeon is more of a typical beauty.

557
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,945
But don't you worry.

558
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:53,984
Once I make money to get your eyes done,
you'll be just as pretty.

559
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:59,223
If she is so pretty,
why didn't you take Do-yeon's side?

560
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,724
Because I'm your daughter?

561
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:04,428
How can you say that? Watch what you say!

562
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,564
Why do you keep hitting my head?

563
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:14,271
COURTHOUSE

564
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,375
It's not because you're my daughter.

565
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,578
It's because you were right.

566
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:27,084
Just like your father,
you are always right.

567
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,658
Everyone, rise.

568
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:41,932
Please be seated.

569
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:04,454
I thought you wouldn't come. You're here.

570
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,123
And you are, too.

571
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:12,329
Why did you wear your uniform?
Didn't you quit school?

572
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,631
I don't think that I quit it.

573
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:26,777
IN SESSION

574
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,660
I'll kill you if you speak.
I'll kill whoever hears it, too.

575
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,430
Stay hidden, all of your lives,

576
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:51,568
so I don't hear anything
or see anything at all.

577
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,105
Stay hidden.

578
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:03,680
Why aren't you going in?

579
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,985
What about you? Why aren't you going in?

580
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:14,825
Let's go in.

581
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:18,095
Let's go in together
on the count of three.

582
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,931
Okay. Let's do that.

583
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,106
One.

584
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,842
Two.

585
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:35,646
-Three.
-Three.

586
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,586
So... Who opened the door?

587
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,689
My story...

588
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:49,860
will end here.

589
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,828
Why?

590
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,132
Why are you stopping?

591
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:58,568
I have to be honest in an interview.

592
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,706
But if I told the truth,
it wouldn't help me at all.

593
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,343
She didn't go in. She didn't go inside.

594
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:09,546
She stopped because she went inside.

595
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,449
One thing is clear.

596
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:17,254
It's that I still regret
the decision I made to this day.

597
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,024
And I never want to make
such a choice again.

598
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,062
And that is why I'm here.

599
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,868
What cram school does Su-ha go to?

600
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:36,440
He has everything.
Why would he have to go to cram school?

601
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:40,510
He has good grades. He is tall and...

602
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:47,017
-He is a good fighter, too.
-Hey. I told you. He just got lucky.

603
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,832
Are you dizzy or feeling nauseated?

604
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,968
You still can't speak?

605
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:19,509
We can't get a statement.
He can't speak at all.

606
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:23,914
The accident report
and the suspect's testimony match up.

607
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:29,553
Let's wrap it up as an accident
caused by Park driving while drowsy.

608
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,988
The insurance situation should be simple.

609
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,961
Please take a look at this.

610
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,930
THE TRUCK DRIVER KILLED MY DAD
WITH AN IRON PIPE

611
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:47,337
The truck driver killed
your father with an iron pipe?

612
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:52,109
Are you saying this wasn't an accident,
but a murder?

613
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:58,315
-Can we do an autopsy?
-No, he was cremated yesterday.

614
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:06,590
He is just a kid and hurt his head.
Should we believe him?

615
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:09,092
-Are there any witnesses?
-Not yet.

616
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:14,331
His testimony won't be enough.
We'll need at least one witness.

617
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:21,938
That's not true. It was an accident,
but I didn't kill him with a pipe.

618
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:23,406
How could I do that?

619
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:29,880
The son, Park Su-ha, testified
that you murdered his father.

620
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:33,250
I did break the window with an iron pipe.

621
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,485
I was trying to save him.

622
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:39,055
But once I got to him,
he was already dead.

623
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:43,260
I think the boy misunderstood what I did.

624
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:51,368
The boy's statement is the only evidence
that he killed the man.

625
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:56,039
Park Su-ha is eight years old.

626
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:59,476
He is too young to grasp what happened.

627
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,646
Furthermore, he has a speech disorder
because of the shock.

628
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,184
Do you really think a statement
from a young boy with a head injury

629
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,320
is definitive enough to close this matter?

630
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:21,731
Kid, it seems all the fools in here
are on my side.

631
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:28,805
Was a doctor present
when Park Su-ha wrote his testimony?

632
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:33,977
No, but the doctor said there is
nothing wrong with his brain.

633
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:38,248
"KID, IT SEEMS ALL THE FOOLS IN HERE
ARE ON MY SIDE" IS WHAT HE'S THINKING.

634
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,588
What did he write?
Could someone read it for us?

635
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:50,060
"'Kid, it seems all the fools in here
are on my side.'

636
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,630
is what he's thinking."

637
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,570
What does he mean?

638
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:09,279
"I can read other people's minds."

639
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:19,489
See? He is even lying that
he can read people's minds.

640
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:25,996
Can we consider his testimony
to be consistent and concrete?

641
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:32,435
Why did he have to say that for no reason?

642
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,973
Is there any other evidence?
Are there any witnesses?

643
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,678
I don't know how you read my mind.

644
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:45,282
But thank you. You saved me.

645
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:50,987
Don't hope for witnesses.
I said I would kill them if they came.

646
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,206
What is it?

647
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:12,409
What?

648
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,482
Well... I...

649
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:44,841
I am a witness to this murder case.

650
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,310
I am Jang Hye-seong.

651
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:54,417
I was at the scene,
and I saw what happened.

652
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,487
That man...

653
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:08,164
hit the driver's head with an iron pipe.

654
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,734
He told us to keep quiet.

655
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,671
He said the man died
because he didn't keep quiet.

656
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:19,342
-What did she say?
-What's happening?

657
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:21,845
ATTORNEY SEAT, DEFENDANT'S SEAT

658
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:25,849
Park Su-ha, was this girl
at the scene of the accident?

659
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:30,687
Defendant, have you seen this girl before?

660
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:32,389
No.

661
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:36,126
I've never seen her before.

662
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:40,029
Your Honor, that girl didn't show up
during the investigation.

663
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,699
She isn't qualified
nor holds any credibility.

664
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,402
Park Su-ha said she was a witness.

665
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:49,239
Your Honor, I'd like to register
Jang Hye-seong as a witness.

666
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,875
Park Su-ha has already lost credibility.

667
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:55,445
Didn't you hear him lie
saying he reads people's minds?

668
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:59,249
He is trying to frame the suspect
by lying.

669
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,519
It will be hard to have her as a witness.

670
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,735
I have a photo here.

671
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:28,311
I took a photo of him
hitting the man with the pipe.

672
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,247
Can't this be used as evidence?

673
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:06,282
I said I would kill you if you spoke!

674
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:10,887
I said I would kill you
and those you talked to!

675
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:23,099
It seems the witness cannot testify
in front of the suspect.

676
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:25,568
Please remove the suspect.

677
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:28,338
I'm going to keep my promise!

678
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:30,874
I'm going to kill you!

679
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:34,978
Don't think this is the end.
This is only the beginning!

680
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:40,850
I can't go like this!
I won't let it end like this!

681
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:52,328
Can you testify right now?
Or will you do it another time?

682
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:57,567
No, I won't be able to do it again.
I have to do it now.

683
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:01,738
Okay, then.
We'll question the witness now.

684
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:04,207
Please come up to the stand.

685
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:10,213
Please take the oath.

686
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:19,489
"I will not hide or add to the truth.

687
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,960
I will tell the truth
and if I were to lie...

688
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:28,565
I swear I will be punished for perjury."

689
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,170
I saw someone who looks like you again.

690
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,042
Where are you right now?

691
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:03,866
THANK YOU

692
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,475
Don't thank me.

693
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:15,111
I'm regretting that I came.

694
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,053
Don't come after me!

695
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:32,929
Don't come after me!

696
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:51,481
This is your fault!
This is all your fault!

697
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:54,150
I don't want to see you,
so don't come after me.

698
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:07,930
I shouldn't have come.
What if that man really kills me?

699
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,067
He said he will kill me when he gets out.

700
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:14,170
How will I go on living?

701
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,311
I didn't forget you.

702
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:39,362
If I meet you again...

703
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:44,400
I will...

704
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:49,505
I will protect you.

705
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,310
What is this? You can speak.

706
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,523
I will protect you.

707
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:12,962
I will protect you.

708
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:29,145
I saw someone who looks like you again.

709
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:43,760
I'm sorry.

710
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,195
I SAW SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU
AND CHASED AFTER HER

711
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,197
AUGUST 6, 2011, 10 P.M.
I SAW SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU

712
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:59,575
JANUARY 2, 2011
THIS TIME IT WAS DEFINITELY YOU

713
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,056
APRIL 20, 2012
I SAW SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU

714
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:33,176
I miss you.

715
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:35,778
