1
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:30,096
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,733
Since that day,
two sounds exist in my world.

3
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,770
One is the sound everyone else hears.

4
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,841
And another is the sound
that only I can hear.

5
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:47,814
It was my dream to be a public defender.
How about you?

6
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,183
I came here because of money.

7
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:54,587
I wanted to become a lawyer
who stood up for the rights of the...

8
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,825
I heard public defenders make
around three to four million won a month.

9
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,495
I saw someone who looks like you again.

10
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,566
Where are you right now?

11
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:15,175
If I meet you again, I will protect you.

12
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,447
I will protect you.

13
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,316
I miss you.

14
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,240
Good.

15
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,422
What was that sound?

16
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,696
-What is it?
-What happened?

17
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,967
What just happened?
Isn't that Double Nose?

18
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,301
MUN DONG-HUI

19
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,171
Oh my gosh.

20
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,774
Guys, Seong-bin pushed her out the window.

21
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,610
What?

22
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:26,346
-Call the police!
-I will do it.

23
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,918
What is this?

24
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,192
Lawyers must be going through
hard times these days.

25
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,495
The competition to be a public defender
is so fierce.

26
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,799
I know. What will you do about her?

27
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,335
RESUME
JANG HYE-SEONG

28
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:53,573
Oh, the one who got expelled
because of fireworks?

29
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,809
Her story was pretty impressive,
but I didn't like her much.

30
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,211
Why?

31
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,214
She took some public defense cases
as a private attorney.

32
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:05,685
She has a bad reputation.
Her nickname is "20 Seconds."

33
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,889
All she pleads is "The defendant
is repenting so please have mercy."

34
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:14,093
All it takes is 20 seconds.
I am against hiring her.

35
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,766
Please understand she lived a lonely life
after her mother had passed away.

36
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:23,136
She passed away last year.

37
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,473
Please understand she was in pain
after recently having lost her mother.

38
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,244
But from her story,
she seemed quite promising.

39
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:37,717
Her story was sad, and she was brave.
I think she has potential.

40
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,925
I am a witness to this murder case.

41
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,695
I am Jang Hye-seong.

42
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,431
What do you think?

43
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:57,837
I'm not sure. I can't tell
whether she is a good or bad attorney.

44
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,273
I'm confused.

45
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,514
ONE MONTH LATER

46
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,160
THE DAUGHTER OF HYE-SEONG'S CHICKEN
HAS BECOME A PUBLIC DEFENDER

47
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,864
HYE-SEONG'S CHICKEN

48
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,835
Shoot. I can't believe my mother.

49
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,807
I told you not to hit my head.

50
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:39,479
What are all these?
Why did you put these up?

51
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,082
I'm proud that you're a lawyer
who gets paid by the government.

52
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,886
You're at the same level
as prosecutors and judges.

53
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,122
Just come with me.

54
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,358
-Where are you going?
-Just come with me.

55
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,500
Please look at this

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,071
Please look at my daughter

57
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,473
Look at my pretty daughter

58
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,910
You're just happy that
I'm going to pay you back.

59
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,179
It's not the money.

60
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:17,317
I'm happy you became a public defender.

61
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,119
Really? Then can I not pay you back?

62
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,322
-Hey!
-Mom!

63
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,159
Don't hit my head! I'm old enough now.

64
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,462
You're a public defender now.

65
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,432
You have a long way to go from here.

66
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,967
You should really get a hold of yourself.

67
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,537
It won't be hard.
I chose it because it's easy.

68
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,873
-What?
-They will pay me every month.

69
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,809
And they will bring me cases, too.

70
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,813
I just have to ask for mercy.
It's a piece of cake.

71
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,016
I'll get paid for a few years,
and then get married.

72
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,752
Stop hitting me!

73
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,254
Don't you dare defend people like that.

74
00:05:55,455 --> 00:06:00,360
You could be the first lawyer
to be hit by her mother in court. Got it?

75
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,400
Stop putting them up.
It's nothing to be proud of.

76
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,937
-Did you get a room?
-I found one near the court.

77
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,674
It's a rooftop house,
but it has two rooms and a bathroom.

78
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,676
Good job.

79
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,313
Why does it have to be Yeonju?
It's too far away.

80
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,516
You said you didn't care where I go,
as long as I get the job.

81
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:28,554
Are there any judges
or prosecutors you know there?

82
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:32,492
Have you ever seen me making allies?
I don't need them.

83
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,728
Mom, come on!

84
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,331
YEONJU DISTRICT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

85
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,800
Say it! You pushed her!

86
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,041
If you're going to confess anyway,
just confess it to me.

87
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,311
I'm one of the more polite people
around here.

88
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,981
You would get a good beating
in other places.

89
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,453
You pushed her, right?

90
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,960
You were jealous that
she got picked up on the street.

91
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,365
That's why you bullied her
for having gotten plastic surgery.

92
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,368
And then you pushed her
off the fourth floor!

93
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,938
A lot of kids said they saw it.
That's the fact.

94
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,176
It's not the fact, you jerk!
I didn't know she was in the music room!

95
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,814
I can't believe I'm stuck with this jerk.

96
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,350
Hey! Stop denying the truth!

97
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,854
Look. All your friends wrote statements!

98
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,858
Sir, let me take over now.

99
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,227
Who are you?

100
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,730
Prosecutor Seo, you're going
to question her directly?

101
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,265
Yes.

102
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,267
Have this.

103
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,472
I'm okay. I don't like mints.

104
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,207
You should still take it.

105
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:59,679
A well-mannered person
doesn't let others know what he ate.

106
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,452
Oh, my gosh. She totally got you!

107
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,622
-This is so funny.
-Shut it!

108
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,526
Seong-bin? Come with me.

109
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,130
PROSECUTOR SEO DO-YEON

110
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:20,933
Gosh.

111
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,803
Your nails are amazing.

112
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,239
I did them myself. Shall I do yours, too?

113
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,881
I got some sandwiches.

114
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:43,689
So you didn't know
Mun Dong-hui was in the music room?

115
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,858
Of course I didn't know.

116
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:50,329
And even if I knew, I wouldn't have
pushed her off the fourth floor.

117
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,201
I knew it. That would've been
considered attempted murder.

118
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,436
You're not the type.

119
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,339
Have some drinks. You'll get thirsty.

120
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,044
So you never bullied Dong-hui, either?

121
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,113
No. Never.

122
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,815
I just gave her
the nickname "Double Nose."

123
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,685
And it was just a joke.

124
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,254
Did the kids laugh
when you called her that?

125
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,357
Of course they did. Don't you get it?

126
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,560
Double eyelids and a nose job,
so "Double Nose."

127
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,096
I totally get it.

128
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,401
Did Dong-hui laugh
when you called her that?

129
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:30,803
What?

130
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,573
You said it was a joke.

131
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,410
Shouldn't the person involved find it
funny to be a joke?

132
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,814
If she didn't laugh,
it's not a joke. It's just bullying.

133
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,618
"Bullying"?

134
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,687
She has begun.

135
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,061
It was a joke, but you're not laughing.

136
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,598
Why is that? I see.

137
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,635
It must have been bullying.

138
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,210
Then I shouldn't joke either.

139
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,447
Right?

140
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,253
Shall we get started?
You're Ko Seong-bin, right?

141
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:26,192
Do you know you're being
investigated for attempted murder?

142
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,864
You have the right to refuse
to say anything that might hurt you.

143
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,333
And you can hire a lawyer.

144
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,668
AT A HIGH SCHOOL IN YEONJU...

145
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:36,902
-What?
-No way.

146
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,037
That's crazy.

147
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,141
So Ko Seong-bin was the one who did it.

148
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,376
-Hold on.
-Hold on.

149
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,379
This isn't the time to be studying.
You'll be shocked to see this.

150
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,147
I won't be.

151
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,617
You know Ko Seong-bin, right?
The one who has a crush on you.

152
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,918
I don't know. Don't care.

153
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,988
Hey. Look at this first.

154
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,396
ATTORNEYS SELECTED FOR YEONJU DISTRICT
PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

155
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,167
ATTORNEY JANG HYE-SEONG
ATTORNEY CHA GUAN-WOO

156
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:14,340
-No way.
-See? I said you would be shocked.

157
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:23,149
Hey! Thank you so much!

158
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,952
I have to go.

159
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,422
Where are you going?

160
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,026
Why is he thanking you
that Seong-bin got arrested?

161
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,995
What did I do?

162
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:55,181
-Hey!
-I'm sorry.

163
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,618
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,953
Did you just kiss me?

165
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,207
COURTHOUSE

166
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,211
ATTORNEYS SELECTED FOR YEONJU DISTRICT

167
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,712
She hasn't changed at all.

168
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,280
ATTORNEY JANG HYE-SEONG

169
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,589
YEONJU DETENTION CENTER

170
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,737
Jun-guk, don't you get out next week?

171
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,508
Have you found work?

172
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:57,977
Yes.

173
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,946
A pastor said he would find me a job.

174
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,349
I envy you.

175
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,919
I guess the Bible actually provides a way.

176
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:13,826
Should I read it from now on?

177
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:20,466
What is this? Do you know them?

178
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,269
Yes.

179
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,845
I sort of owe her something.

180
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,014
SELECTED LAWYERS WITH
NONSTANDARD BACKGROUND

181
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,940
Why did I have to dream
of him on my first day?

182
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,058
DRUG USER'S LIMITED AMNESTY
CONFESSION PERIOD

183
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,835
I kept calling you.
I followed you from the bus.

184
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,938
Excuse me.

185
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,542
You're not my type. Okay?

186
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,347
Isn't this your wallet?
You dropped it on the bus.

187
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,753
-It's not mine.
-What?

188
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,290
I'll find the owner. Okay?

189
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:29,795
What do you mean? I saw your ID in there.

190
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,898
Oh, you must be embarrassed.

191
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,771
Don't you remember me?
I'm Cha Guan-woo. We met before.

192
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:41,907
I've never seen you before.

193
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,476
We met at the interview.

194
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,013
Don't you remember grabbing me
by the throat for questions?

195
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,615
I don't remember.

196
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:55,321
I didn't realize it then,
but you're really pretty.

197
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,392
Don't people say you look like someone?

198
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:04,663
It's a foreign actress.
She has thick lips and big eyes.

199
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,702
That's right! Jolie! Don't people say
you look like Angelina Jolie?

200
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,174
Please keep your voice down.

201
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,580
Why? It's a compliment.

202
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,216
I'm just saying you're pretty.

203
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:31,290
By the way, Hye-seong...
Should I call you Ms. Jang?

204
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,827
No. That doesn't sound right.

205
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,531
Ms. Jjang sounds better. Ms. Jjang!

206
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,904
I believe becoming
a public defender was your dream.

207
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,674
You're just embarrassed
to admit it. Right?

208
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:53,212
I realized it a while ago.
You get mad when you're embarrassed.

209
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:58,150
I think I know
why you signed up for Yeonju.

210
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,386
Shall I guess?

211
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,257
Is it because of Mr. Shin Sang-deok?

212
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,330
I came here
because of Mr. Shin Sang-deok, too.

213
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:16,101
He has been a public defender for
40 years. He is my role model.

214
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,103
Is he yours, too?

215
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,907
No!

216
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,344
You're Cha Guan-woo, right?

217
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:30,549
I don't look like Angelina Jolie.
And I didn't know you would come here.

218
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,151
I don't want to be called "Ms. Jjang."

219
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,653
And I didn't come here
because of Shin Sang-deok.

220
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:41,026
The old man with dentures
and a hearing aid isn't my role model!

221
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,704
Here you go.

222
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,811
Are you Shin Sang-deok?

223
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,979
Yes.

224
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,348
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

225
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,385
You should apologize.

226
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,521
Why should I?

227
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:15,294
Never mind. No need to apologize.
Everything you said is right.

228
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,430
Are you the new public defenders?

229
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:22,301
Yes, I'm Cha Guan-woo
and this is Jang Hye-seong.

230
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,572
This is Officer Choi Yu-chang.
You should say hello.

231
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:30,075
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

232
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,511
Me, too.

233
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:38,250
Let's all go out. I'll buy you coffee.

234
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,085
Thank you.

235
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,388
What are you doing? Let's go.

236
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,894
Mr. Shin doesn't forget things easily.

237
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,130
For your sake, you should apologize soon.

238
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,436
What's he going to do?

239
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,505
Is he going to bully me?

240
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,297
Hold on.

241
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:31,703
If you use this,
you don't have to use your saliva.

242
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,674
Thank you, Mr. Shin.

243
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,212
This really helps!

244
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:49,621
Tell her it's the office at the end.
Yes, I'll go out now.

245
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,192
Jo Yeong-sook.

246
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,627
Here it is.

247
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,031
Charged with special larceny
and obstruction of justice.

248
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,099
And she is deaf.

249
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,171
-Come on in.
-Hello.

250
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,942
You know sign language?

251
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,512
I thought I might need it.
I'm learning braille, too.

252
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,082
Please come this way.

253
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,128
Please wait.

254
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,435
Ms. Jang, your client is here, too.
Shall I bring her in?

255
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,703
Yes.

256
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,205
Please come this way.

257
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,478
Excuse me.

258
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,215
I'm Ko Seong-bin.

259
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,720
TEXTBOOKS

260
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,802
Hello, I'm Park Su-ha. Remember me?

261
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,872
What if she doesn't remember?

262
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,477
It's been a long time. I'm Park Su-ha.

263
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,346
That's too plain.

264
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,315
I missed you, Hye-seong.

265
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,588
This is so hard.

266
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,662
It's been a long time, Hye-seong.
Hye-seong.

267
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,699
-No.
-What is he doing?

268
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,467
He is crazy.

269
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,637
What should I say?

270
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,773
I didn't do it.

271
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,749
Everyone who comes here
says the same thing.

272
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:02,521
But look. There's too much evidence.

273
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,824
And you lied to the prosecutor
that you're not the one.

274
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,593
No wonder you were accused
of attempted murder.

275
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,996
That's nonsense! "Attempted murder"?

276
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,298
Why is it nonsense?

277
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,302
The friend you wanted
to bully was sitting by the window.

278
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,341
There was no one else in the room.

279
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,743
You wanted to scare her.

280
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,278
What is it?

281
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,547
But you decided that
you should kill her instead.

282
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:32,551
But she didn't die,
and she is currently unconscious.

283
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,855
If the victim dies,
then you'll be charged with murder.

284
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,024
It's an attempted murder
because she is still alive.

285
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:44,329
I can't believe this! Lady! I mean, miss!

286
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,532
I did swear at kids and take their money.

287
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,936
But it was all reasonable enough.
I never did something terrible.

288
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,372
But attempted murder?
I really didn't do it!

289
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,341
There are people who saw you pushing her.

290
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:59,678
They are just lying
to get me into trouble!

291
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,884
I am defending you
even if you don't pay me a cent.

292
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,353
I can't help you if you act like this.

293
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,188
Do you want to go
to a trial without a lawyer?

294
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:23,301
Don't worry.
The truth always wins in court.

295
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,604
I will show it to you.

296
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,782
Please take care.

297
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:42,721
With this much evidence,
you'll be found guilty.

298
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:46,792
If you try to deny it,
it will only increase your sentence.

299
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,928
You should admit it
and say that you're sorry.

300
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:54,266
I'll say it was an accident.
Then you won't go to jail.

301
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,371
Will you keep denying it?
Or will you admit your guilt?

302
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,442
I really didn't push her.

303
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,144
I didn't even know
she was in the music room!

304
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,849
I didn't do it. I really didn't do it.

305
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,020
Are you going to keep denying it?

306
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,292
Do you want to rot in jail
while your friends have fun?

307
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:26,031
Ms. Jjang. Don't force her.
Like she said--

308
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,234
-This is my client.
-I know I shouldn't meddle, but--

309
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,302
Then don't say anything.

310
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,738
-I think I deserve to say--
-Nothing.

311
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:37,442
Why not?
We are a team that works together.

312
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,010
No, we're not.

313
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,952
Guilty or not guilty? You choose.

314
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,323
I can't be responsible for the result.

315
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:58,330
Okay, I'm guilty! Okay? You jerk!

316
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:31,296
-What about Ms. Jang?
-She wants to finish up.

317
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,468
Mr. Shin, about what I said to Ms. Jjang,
I was right, wasn't I?

318
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,738
-Of course you were.
-We can work as a team, right?

319
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:40,839
Yes.

320
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,575
The prosecutors have a great system.

321
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,578
-We should work together, too.
-Of course.

322
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:51,983
And even if no one else does,
a lawyer should believe his client.

323
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,990
Did I say something wrong?

324
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,160
The elevator is here.

325
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,670
Don't you believe your clients, Mr. Shin?

326
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,039
I try to believe them.

327
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:18,510
But sometimes it can come back
to bite you.

328
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,612
How can you say that?

329
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,014
You have to believe them to defend them.

330
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,216
I believe my client 100%.

331
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:30,455
But if they are found lying,
it would be worse for them.

332
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,858
My client would never lie.

333
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,261
I can just tell.

334
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,430
You can just tell?

335
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,332
I envy you.

336
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,535
I've worked for 40 years,
but I still can't tell.

337
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:46,938
Forty years.

338
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,278
THE DEFENDANT ADMITS TO ALL OF

339
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,016
THE DEFENDANT ADMITS TO ALL OF THE CHARGES

340
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,954
I really didn't push her.

341
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:06,024
I didn't even know
she was in the music room!

342
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:10,261
I didn't do it! I really didn't do it!

343
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:15,700
I didn't do it! I really didn't do it!

344
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:21,239
I know I have a bad temper,
but I'm not that bad!

345
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,676
I'm not that spiteful.

346
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,118
This feels horrible.

347
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:37,956
I don't care.

348
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,996
DIVORCE, TRAFFIC ACCIDENT PROFESSIONAL

349
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,235
PUBLIC DEFENDERS

350
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:54,339
"Public defenders. They total
only one percent of Korean lawyers.

351
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:59,978
They defend those who cannot afford
to hire a lawyer.

352
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:03,581
They work for the people, not for money."

353
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:14,693
"I will not hide nor add to the truth.

354
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:19,497
I will tell the truth
and if I were to lie,

355
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:24,202
I swear that
I will be punished for perjury."

356
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,074
What a perfect job for her!

357
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,879
My head is about to burst.

358
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,817
Let's forget it. Forget it, Hye-seong.

359
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,782
Thank you.

360
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:37,468
It's too dark.
Why aren't there streetlights?

361
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,139
Let's go around.
I'll think of it as exercise.

362
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:56,621
You're the one who just moved in, right?

363
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,158
-Do you like the place?
-What do you think?

364
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,829
Can you see the cards in the dark?

365
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:09,701
Even if it's dark,
I can still see money and cards.

366
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:12,704
-When are they fixing the streetlights?
-No idea.

367
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,840
I called the local government office,
but they directed me to city hall.

368
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,777
So I called today, and
they told me to call another department.

369
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,947
So I called them,
but they told me to call someone else.

370
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,316
So at last I called them,
but everyone had gone home.

371
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:31,122
Anyway, they will fix it soon!
Don't you worry!

372
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:35,093
-Mom, the show has started. Hurry!
-The show?

373
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,195
The show!

374
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,815
MOM

375
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,319
-It's me.
-Yes, Mom.

376
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,487
How was your day?

377
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,756
Nothing much happened.

378
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,226
You said there are
three men in your office.

379
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,163
Isn't there anyone you might want to date?

380
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,765
No, there isn't any. They're all losers.

381
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,469
They're a mix of the worst guys ever.

382
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:54,839
Why? Do they look down on you?

383
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,709
No.

384
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,480
It's not like that.
But they're loud and tiresome.

385
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:08,686
Why do you sound so down?
Did something happen?

386
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,957
No. I'm okay.

387
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,260
You don't sound okay.

388
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,730
Shall I go see you tomorrow?

389
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:23,201
I'm really okay. It's nothing.

390
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,707
It's because of the broken streetlights.

391
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,642
"Streetlights"?

392
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,981
Yes, the streetlights.
I don't like the dark.

393
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,584
That's why.

394
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,424
The streetlights just came back on.

395
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,727
Really? Maybe someone fixed them.

396
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,330
No way. At this hour?

397
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:57,735
Never mind. Go to sleep now.
It's your first trial tomorrow.

398
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,572
All right. Good night, Mom.

399
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,543
Sure. Have a great dream.

400
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:38,042
What is this?
Did someone fix it at this hour?

401
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,373
I guess our civil officials
aren't that bad.

402
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,770
Ko Seong-bin?

403
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,046
How could this happen?

404
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:54,886
I didn't do anything.
Why won't anyone listen to me?

405
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,624
Attempted murder?
I will go to jail, right?

406
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,693
Jail.

407
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,963
Should I just die?

408
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:13,070
My friends, my lawyer. No one believes me.

409
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,806
What's the use of living?

410
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,443
Will they believe me if I just die?

411
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,413
Will they regret not believing me?

412
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,020
Ko Seong-bin!

413
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,991
Stay right there. I'll be right there.

414
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,894
Will Su-ha cry for me?

415
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,900
No, he won't even notice that I'm gone.

416
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:49,774
Don't be silly, Seong-bin!
Stay right there.

417
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:24,075
Ko Seong-bin! No! Don't do it! Don't!

418
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,683
You idiot! What are you doing?

419
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,956
Su-ha.

420
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:01,078
Thank you.

421
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,884
Did you hear about what happened?

422
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,155
-Yes.
-Do you think that Double Nose...

423
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:16,160
Do you think that I pushed Dong-hui?

424
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,563
-No.
-Liar.

425
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,833
He is just saying that
because I might kill myself.

426
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,671
I really believe you. You didn't do it.

427
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,940
Thanks a bunch.

428
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,047
Did you meet a lawyer?

429
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:42,853
Yes, I wish my lawyer would believe me
like you do.

430
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,056
Who is your lawyer?

431
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,526
Why? Will you beat her up for me?

432
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,362
If it's necessary, I will. Who is it?

433
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:55,232
She is a public defender. Jang Hye-seong.

434
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,969
Jang Hye-seong?

435
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,173
Yes, her surname is Jang
and her name is Hye-seong.

436
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,342
She just came to Yeonju.

437
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,879
ATTORNEYS SELECTED FOR YEONJU DISTRICT
PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

438
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,115
She won't believe me.

439
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,485
She scared me saying if I don't
plead guilty, things will be worse.

440
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,654
She is even scarier than the prosecutor.

441
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:59,196
It's a misunderstanding.
Seong-bin has it all wrong.

442
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,065
It can't be true.

443
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:08,973
YEONJU DISTRICT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

444
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,816
Let me see.

445
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,552
Let's try again.

446
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:24,655
What does Judge Mun Chae-shik
like to hear the most?

447
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,457
"Your Honor."

448
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:30,361
-You're not the defendant, so?
-Be confident.

449
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,364
But you're a defender, so?

450
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:37,234
-Be modest in the trial.
-Yes, good.

451
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,971
They can be such losers.

452
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,774
Ms. Jjang!

453
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:50,181
-Why?
-Your trial is in the afternoon.

454
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,849
You have time in the morning, right?

455
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,752
-Yes.
-Then come watch my trial.

456
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:57,021
-Why?
-I'll show you.

457
00:40:57,254 --> 00:41:00,191
How powerful a lawyer can be
when he's armed with conviction.

458
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,129
-Ms. Jjang...
-No.

459
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,698
-I'll go in.
-Go Guan-woo!

460
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,666
-Go Guan-woo!
-Good.

461
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,205
COURTHOUSE

462
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:20,678
You are currently living
with your 80-year-old mother, right?

463
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,279
Yes.

464
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:27,918
You gather paper and do public work
to pay her medical bills.

465
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,554
You have tried everything.

466
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:35,893
That's right, but I wasn't even close to
paying it all.

467
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,731
That's why I had no choice
but to steal the donation.

468
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:45,236
It was because I wanted to live with
my mother.

469
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:46,937
Objection.

470
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:51,809
It says the defendant's mother passed away
seven years ago.

471
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,645
That can't be true.

472
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,049
Has your mother passed away?

473
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,652
That's right.

474
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:07,825
But my mother is still alive
inside my heart.

475
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,226
Inside your heart?

476
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:18,035
You used the knife
because the police sexually harassed you.

477
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,872
I am ashamed, but it just happened.

478
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,374
Objection.

479
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,211
The police officers
who arrested the defendant

480
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,046
were all female.

481
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,620
Were the police officers all female?

482
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:40,257
Yes, that's right. They were women,

483
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,861
but they were just as strong as men.

484
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,912
Thank you for letting me
watch your trial, Mr. Cha.

485
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,649
I learned a lot today.

486
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,353
I learned how dangerous it is
to trust your defendant blindly.

487
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:14,992
And I also realized how incompetent
a lawyer can be without expertise.

488
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:16,594
Thank you.

489
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,969
Don't you think
she has a strange personality?

490
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,539
It's as if she is determined
to make people hate her!

491
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,375
-She has the wrong kind of face.
-Right?

492
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:35,145
By the way, I feel so bad
for Jo Yeong-sook.

493
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:39,016
She lives in a semi-basement studio,
but it got flooded by the rain.

494
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:42,019
She now lives in a tin shack.
Why would she ever lie?

495
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,827
Do you think all poor people are good?

496
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,596
Do you think all poor people are wronged?

497
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,899
-What?
-Okay, so she is poor.

498
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:59,370
What if someone
who isn't wronged comes to you?

499
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:01,772
Well...

500
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:08,479
People come to us because either
they took money or someone's life.

501
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:12,483
Most of them are criminals
who aren't worth defending.

502
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:15,252
But it's not
as if we can choose not to defend them.

503
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,755
If that happens to you,
how will you defend them?

504
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,294
-Well?
-I'm not sure.

505
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:48,552
Ko Seong-bin, this is Su-ha.
Are you on your way to the court?

506
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:49,753
Yes.

507
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,656
Just come straight here.
I'll go inside with you.

508
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:53,957
Thank you.

509
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,200
Are you really Ko Seong-bin?

510
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:09,740
Yes. I'm going to try not to swear.

511
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:13,110
Let's go in.

512
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:19,550
ESTABLISHING PUBLIC ORDER

513
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:28,058
-Are you going to the trial?
-Yes.

514
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,035
ELEVATOR TO TRIAL COURT

515
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:43,874
I'm about to begin a trial.
Do you have anything to tell me?

516
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,147
Of course you don't.

517
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,730
Isn't it normal for the last person
to get on to get off in this case?

518
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,338
Mr. Shin!

519
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,991
What are you doing here, Hye-seong?

520
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,294
What about you?

521
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,565
Are you a prosecutor?

522
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,602
I heard from Yeon-jin
that you had become a lawyer.

523
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:47,871
I didn't realize we would meet like this.

524
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,774
Did you start a business?
Or are you with a law firm?

525
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:56,113
No, I'm not a private lawyer.
I'm a public defender.

526
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,216
You're a public defender.

527
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:03,420
We may meet in court.

528
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:07,858
I guess so. I hope we meet.

529
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,429
COURT OF KOREA

530
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,931
Ms. Jang!

531
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:17,234
I'm not late, right?

532
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,841
You were here, too, Ms. Seo.

533
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,411
Are you Ko Seong-bin's lawyer?

534
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:33,417
Are you the prosecutor for this trial?

535
00:47:58,442 --> 00:47:59,576
SEO DO-YEON

536
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:05,349
Seo Do-yeon. Why didn't I see that?

537
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:09,853
I saw it, too.

538
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,055
I saw Hye-seong
pointing the firework at me.

539
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,324
Hey!

540
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:19,029
How can you take it?
Aren't you mad? I got expelled today.

541
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,666
I got kicked out
even though I didn't do anything.

542
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,102
No, I didn't see it.

543
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,838
You kept lying,
so I lied to make you confess.

544
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,007
Then prove it.

545
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:32,843
I'll admit it if you go
and testify in court.

546
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,045
I'll admit that you're not a liar.

547
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,397
Seong-bin. Let's talk.

548
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:02,773
-Why is this guy following you?
-He is my friend.

549
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:08,178
Hey, I really need to focus.
So please stay here. Alright?

550
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:19,256
Okay, take a look at this.
It's what I'm going to ask you.

551
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:20,991
Read it.

552
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:26,797
No, don't read it.
Just say, "Yes," when I question you.

553
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,432
Just "Yes." Got it?

554
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,635
No, I didn't push her.
I'm going to tell the truth.

555
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,671
No, you can't do that.
You saw the prosecutor, right?

556
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,808
If she finds fault in us,
you and I are both doomed.

557
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:41,144
You could make things worse
by offending her.

558
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:42,813
And I'll be embarrassed.

559
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:47,317
I can't let that happen.
So say you're guilty and sorry.

560
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:51,788
And ask for mercy.
That's the best way, okay?

561
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,560
What are you doing?

562
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,997
Seong-bin, go ahead. We need to talk.

563
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,632
Let me go! Let go!

564
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,070
Hey! Put me down! Hey!

565
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:12,075
Hey! Who are you? Put me down!

566
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,016
Let go of me! You just took me by force.

567
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:22,853
There are security cameras.
You'll be punished for this!

568
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:31,862
Let me go. Calm down. Let's be rational.

569
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,096
Seong-bin is innocent.

570
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,299
-What?
-So you should prove it.

571
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,404
Who are you? Why are you being so rude?

572
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:45,509
I'm Seong-bin's classmate.

573
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:51,381
Do you know anything about the case?
Were you at the scene?

574
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,351
Seong-bin tried to kill herself yesterday
after meeting you.

575
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,326
So what? Do you think that's evidence?

576
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:04,795
You're the worst.

577
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,564
Are you really a lawyer?

578
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:11,568
Who are you trying to preach to?

579
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,438
You just kidnapped me,
and now you're trying to preach me?

580
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:15,906
Where did you learn your manners?

581
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,742
-Behave yourself.
-You should behave yourself.

582
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,278
Shouldn't a lawyer listen to her client?

583
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:25,048
How are you different
from a prosecutor if you don't?

584
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:26,883
There is no evidence.

585
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,753
There's only evidence proving her guilt.

586
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,189
Bring me evidence if you want to fight me.

587
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,524
-I have evidence.
-What is it?

588
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,864
Why are you looking at me like that?

589
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:45,735
-If you stare--
-"If you stare, will proof appear?"

590
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:52,375
-What is this? How did you do that?
-"What is this? How did you do that?"

591
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,847
-Do you know what I'll say?
-"Do you know what I'll say?"

592
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:06,756
No way.

593
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:16,766
I can read other people's minds.
That's my evidence.

594
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,526
ATTEMPTED MURDER

595
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,133
ARTICLE 250 OF THE CONSTITUTION
ATTEMPTED MURDER...

596
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:55,539
Are you just going to stand there?
You have to go help Seong-bin.

597
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:57,908
Don't come near me.

598
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,379
How is this possible?

599
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,416
Don't look at me as if I were a monster.

600
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:11,087
Some people have an IQ of 200
and some run 100 meters in nine seconds.

601
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,524
Being special doesn't
mean that we're monsters.

602
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:18,662
You're so childish.
I'm not an alien. I was born here.

603
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,730
Did you read my mind again?

604
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,100
Don't read it! It feels really creepy.

605
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,969
I don't want to know either.

606
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,004
But I hear your thoughts
when I look into your eyes.

607
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:33,810
Shoot. Should I report this?
This is an invasion of my privacy.

608
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:38,348
Concentrate on Seong-bin.
How will you prove her innocence?

609
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,752
Lips can lie, but hearts cannot lie.

610
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,923
She is innocent. I heard it.
So you have to prove it.

611
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,593
I can't do it.

612
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:53,196
-You won't have her plead not guilty?
-No, I just can't do it.

613
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:54,598
There is no evidence.

614
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:59,302
I said I'm the evidence. I heard her.

615
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,105
Will you go on the stand, then?

616
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:05,575
Will you testify that you read her mind
and that she is innocent?

617
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:10,080
Do you think the judge
and prosecutor will be impressed

618
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:13,550
by your mind-reading skills, believe it,
and accept it as evidence?

619
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,685
You and I will be kicked out
for being crazy.

620
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:28,498
See? He is lying that
he can read people's minds.

621
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:35,171
And let's pretend that
they did accept it as evidence.

622
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,207
What if you're lying?

623
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:40,010
-I don't lie.
-How would we know that?

624
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:44,614
Other people can't read minds.
How will you prove it in court?

625
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:48,351
That's why you won't
be admitted as evidence.

626
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:52,289
Your ability is amazing,
but it won't help us now.

627
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:56,259
Knowing the truth is not what's important
at trial.

628
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:59,329
What's important is
whether there is evidence.

629
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,567
What about the truth?

630
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:12,342
Doesn't the truth win in court?

631
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,745
Of course not. It's the other way around.

632
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:20,717
Truth doesn't win in court.
Whatever wins in court is the truth.

633
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:57,954
I will protect you.

634
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:22,879
I will protect you.

635
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,468
How does he read minds?

636
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:47,937
That's amazing.

637
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,640
Never mind. Forget it.

638
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,544
Just think about Seo Do-yeon.

639
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,981
Why are you thinking about me?

640
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,354
I was so surprised
that I didn't even say hello.

641
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:08,291
-How long has it been?
-Ten years?

642
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,928
I think I last saw you in court.

643
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:16,533
Do you remember?
You ran away and never came.

644
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,767
Did I?

645
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,907
I thought I would have a lot
to tell you if I met you.

646
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,176
But I can't remember.

647
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,946
I didn't know we would run
into each other like this.

648
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:34,818
I know. A prosecutor and a lawyer.

649
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:38,855
The world is so small and funny, isn't it?

650
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:50,133
How will your client plead?

651
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,135
Not guilty?

652
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:03,012
No, you wrote one bloody arraignment.

653
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:07,016
There's no way out of it.
Who would plead not guilty?

654
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,954
Why? You should at least try.
I think there might be a chance.

655
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:16,860
No, I don't want to be embarrassed
in front of an old classmate.

656
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:23,700
You're so much alike.

657
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:28,037
-With whom?
-Nothing. See you later.

658
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,806
Okay.

659
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,346
Are you reading my mind again?

660
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:40,817
-Who is that?
-None of your business.

661
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,353
Let's stay away from each other, okay?

662
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:46,789
What is the firework incident?

663
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,326
How do you know about it?

664
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:52,228
I read her mind.

665
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:59,068
Tell me more about what she was thinking.

666
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,043
YEONJU DISTRICT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

667
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:13,016
She said Seong-bin is very much like you.

668
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,019
How you were ten years ago
when the firework incident happened.

669
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:17,787
You're so much alike.

670
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:30,700
Isn't that the new public defender?

671
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:34,571
-Wasn't she in the news?
-What? Yes.

672
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:39,442
Isn't she the one who got hired
because of her story?

673
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,210
You said she seems like a good lawyer.

674
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:54,657
Shoot.

675
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,597
She looked nice back then.

676
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:03,933
Shoot.

677
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,568
IN SESSION

678
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:13,676
ATTORNEY'S SEAT, DEFENDANT'S SEAT

679
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,450
Make your statement.

680
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:25,154
Ko Seong-bin was a classmate
of Mun Dong-hui.

681
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,057
She always bullied
and harassed the victim.

682
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:34,397
She was jealous the victim got picked up
by an agency.

683
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:38,234
And she pushed the victim
when she was sitting by the window.

684
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:44,374
The victim has multiple injuries
all over her body.

685
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:47,210
She is currently lying unconscious
in the hospital.

686
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:51,114
Based on Articles 250 and 254

687
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:56,252
of the Penal Code, Ko Seong-bin is
hereby charged with attempted murder.

688
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:20,576
Are you sure that she is innocent?

689
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:27,817
Can I believe you?

690
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:36,426
It's your turn, Counsel.

691
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,128
Counsel!

692
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,265
-Yes?
-Do you agree with the indictment?

693
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,488
I do not agree with the indictment at all.

694
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,596
The defendant is pleading not guilty.

695
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,780
