1
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,900
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

2
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,970
Even if you hate me so much,

3
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,473
couldn't you stay?

4
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,177
Let me go.

5
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,613
I feel like all my connections
in this world have been cut off.

6
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,632
I know this doesn't make sense.

7
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,870
I can't believe it either.

8
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,676
But I keep thinking about him.

9
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,253
I can't believe this.

10
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,324
I know this doesn't make sense.

11
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,861
I think I like him.

12
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,029
What should I do with you?

13
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:17,203
So I'm going to end it. I have to end it.

14
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,741
I can do it.

15
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,486
Hey.

16
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,029
Didn't you say I didn't like you
because you're messy?

17
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,632
Yes.

18
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,635
You nagged me so much
that I started to clean.

19
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:53,706
I don't remember,
but it feels more familiar than my house.

20
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,842
It's only until you get your memory back.

21
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,012
Once you get it back,
you cannot come back here.

22
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,847
Or come looking for me.

23
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,154
Answer me.

24
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,191
Okay.

25
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,330
You'll have to go
through an appeal trial soon.

26
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,599
I can't defend you this time.

27
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,236
The appellate hearing will be
in the Seoul High Court, not Yeonju.

28
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,306
So I can't be sure
if you'll be found not guilty.

29
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,074
I see.

30
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:32,011
So you should do your best
to recover your memories.

31
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,415
Try to recall what you do remember
and piece it together like a puzzle.

32
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,883
Yes, I'll do that.

33
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,690
Why are your eyes so red?

34
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:50,163
I haven't been sleeping since the trial.
It must be insomnia.

35
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,800
Really? You used to sleep so well.

36
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:57,403
Why can't you sleep?
Are you under any stress?

37
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,210
Hey. Are you sleeping?

38
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,815
You said you had insomnia.

39
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,021
Hey. Go sleep in your room.

40
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,063
Who is going to be his lawyer
for the appellate hearing?

41
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,868
It would be best if Mr. Cha could do it.

42
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,170
Shall I ask him?

43
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,343
I must be crazy.
How can I be so shameless?

44
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,745
Jang Hye-seong, you're a shithead.
How could you do that?

45
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,648
Ouch. That hurts.

46
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,687
Should I still ask him?

47
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,981
How long did I sleep?

48
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,260
There's curry in the fridge. Eat it.

49
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,807
So you should do your best
to recover your memories.

50
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,077
Try to recall what you do remember
and piece it together like a puzzle.

51
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,235
Min Jun-guk and the fishing place.

52
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,380
Accident on the causeway.

53
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,820
Aquarium with Ms. Jang.

54
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,327
KO SEONG-BIN'S TRIAL

55
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,649
AQUARIUM WITH MS. JANG

56
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,952
LAW OFFICE OF CHA GUAN-WOO

57
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:11,591
No, this is too shameless.

58
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,701
But I would feel most secure with Mr. Cha.

59
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,276
No, I can't do this to him.

60
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,984
But what if Su-ha gets a bad lawyer?

61
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:42,889
CHA GUAN-WOO

62
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,426
-What are you doing?
-Gosh!

63
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,134
Mr. Cha.

64
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,703
Did you come to talk to me?

65
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,441
No, I didn't.

66
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,045
Tell me.

67
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,849
No, I can't.

68
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,552
You wanted to ask me
to defend Park Su-ha, right?

69
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,623
I must be right.

70
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,695
No. I did think of it briefly.

71
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,198
But I gave it up. I'm not that shameless.

72
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:30,269
I couldn't ask that of you. I won't.

73
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,039
I'll defend Park Su-ha.

74
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,443
-What?
-I'll defend him.

75
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,980
So I can make you feel bad.

76
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,848
I'll make you feel uncomfortable.

77
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,720
Then it will be easier for you
to put aside those ridiculous feelings.

78
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:48,788
Right?

79
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,293
Well, Mr. Cha, I...

80
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:58,764
I'm going to do my best to defend him,
so you feel really uncomfortable.

81
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,769
It's my case now, so lay off if it, okay?

82
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:04,937
What?

83
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:07,873
Okay.

84
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,511
Okay, let's do this!

85
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,133
I want to die.

86
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,646
SEOUL DISTRICT COURT
TRIAL RECORD

87
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,416
DEFENDANT: MIN JUN-GUK
APPLIED LAW: ARTICLE 250, SECTION 1

88
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,456
DEFENDANT LEAPED UP FROM HIS SEAT.
"I SAID I WOULD KILL YOU IF YOU SPOKE!"

89
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,327
"I TOOK A PHOTO OF HIM HITTING A MAN
WITH A PIPE."

90
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,937
See? He is even lying
that he can read people's minds.

91
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:18,177
Can we consider his testimony
to be consistent and concrete?

92
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,748
Are there any witnesses?

93
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,627
What is it?

94
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:39,799
I am a witness to this murder case.

95
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,334
I am Jang Hye-seong.

96
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,502
Will I be able to win...

97
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:18,604
this fight?

98
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,618
YEONJU DETENTION CENTER

99
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,629
Thank you.

100
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:48,134
I would have had no one to come sign
for me, if it weren't for you.

101
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,837
I brought my car.
I'll take you home. Let's go.

102
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,005
Okay.

103
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,451
Your car is a bit of a doohickey.

104
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,988
I know you must be thinking
that a sports car doesn't suit me.

105
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,856
You need to do away with your stereotypes.

106
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,591
It's not that.

107
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,995
Does it even start?

108
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:20,432
Of course.
I haven't had an accident in 16 years.

109
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,334
Get in.

110
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,592
The world has changed a lot.

111
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,131
Don't you worry.
You'll catch up very soon.

112
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,632
I guess we'll see.

113
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,837
I'm not sure I'll have time to catch up.

114
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:05,110
I wish I could see my daughter
before I die.

115
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,882
What is that?

116
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,588
It was in my bag
when I was arrested 26 years ago.

117
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,424
It was a present for Ga-yeon.

118
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,863
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

119
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,565
For everything.

120
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,768
What do you mean? I'm just grateful.

121
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:36,208
You're the only person who believed in me.

122
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,019
Is Ms. Seo in?

123
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,655
No, she's gone to Gapyeong to investigate.

124
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,790
"Investigate"? Investigate what?

125
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,225
Something about Min Jun-guk.

126
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,493
"Min Jun-guk"?

127
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,497
Why is she investigating about a dead man?

128
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:02,368
I know. I think she thinks he's not dead.

129
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:03,369
What?

130
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,271
MIN'S FARM

131
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,142
I said I don't see him.
I don't see him among them.

132
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,210
Really?

133
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,447
Then what about these?

134
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,951
He's not here, Ms. Prosecutor!
How long will you keep this up?

135
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,586
Until we find him.

136
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,423
There must be a reason
why he didn't report Park Su-ha himself.

137
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,928
About that man. What were his hands like?

138
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,129
What?

139
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,665
His hands. What were they like?

140
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,869
Well, they were intact.

141
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,104
"Intact"?

142
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:43,275
Yes, they were intact. What else?

143
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,056
You're late. Did you eat dinner?

144
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,691
-Do you want to eat--
-I ate.

145
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:03,062
You should meet Mr. Cha tomorrow.
He is going to defend you.

146
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,832
This is his number.

147
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,171
Don't worry about money.
He's doing it for free.

148
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,575
Did you ask him to take my case?

149
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,447
Is that important?

150
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,515
Yes, it's important.

151
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,151
Yes, I asked him.

152
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:30,456
You saw him.
Do you think there's anyone better?

153
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,460
I feel bad and uncomfortable, too.

154
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,929
But I have to stay off the case now.

155
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,765
There's no alternative but him. Okay?

156
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,901
Okay. I'll meet him tomorrow.

157
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,404
Go talk to him. And be polite.

158
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,047
LAW OFFICE OF CHA GUAN-WOO

159
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:10,229
I can't stop thinking about him.
What's wrong with me?

160
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,767
I'm hungry, too.

161
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,523
Over here.

162
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,261
What would you like to drink?

163
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,630
I'll buy my own.

164
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,234
Okay.

165
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,040
Have you remembered anything new?

166
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,545
Yes, I do remember meeting Min Jun-guk
at the fishing place.

167
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,915
But I don't remember what we said
or what we did there.

168
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,750
Did you two fight?

169
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,086
No, I don't remember.

170
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,191
I don't think that will help.
Is there anything else?

171
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,828
I think I was in a traffic accident
after I met with Min Jun-guk.

172
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,264
It seemed to be on a causeway.

173
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,566
I think I was hit by a blue truck.

174
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,669
"A blue truck"? A one-ton truck?

175
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,504
Yes, I think so.

176
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,874
I should look into that.

177
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,710
Do you remember the license number?

178
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,550
I'll search the police reports
and hospital records.

179
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,923
Thank you for taking my case.

180
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,159
Don't thank me.
I took it because of Ms. Jjang.

181
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,564
How much is your fee?

182
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,800
You're not a public defender,
so I need to pay you, right?

183
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,305
Hey, I worked for free
when I was a public defender.

184
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,407
But I used to be a highly paid lawyer.

185
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,742
Just accept it when I say it's for free.

186
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,644
And focus on getting your memory back.

187
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,413
Please don't treat me like a child.

188
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,283
I'll pay you, so do it as a job.
Leave Ms. Jang out of this.

189
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,453
I have a house and insurance money
that my father left me.

190
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,955
I will pay you.

191
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:27,326
So don't make Ms. Jang uncomfortable
about this.

192
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,033
You're the one
who's making Ms. Jjang uncomfortable.

193
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:40,572
Su-ha, don't pretend to be an adult.
Try acting like a real adult.

194
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,542
Putting on a suit
doesn't make you an adult, does it?

195
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,946
You dropped out of high school,
were wanted for murder,

196
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,648
and have no memory or future.

197
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,683
That's why Ms. Jjang took you in.

198
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,486
Don't mistake it for something else.

199
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,591
A year ago, I let things slide
because you were young, but not anymore.

200
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,027
Once you get back your memory
and a verdict of not guilty,

201
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,962
don't burden Ms. Jang anymore
and leave that house.

202
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,366
As you said, you're no longer a child.

203
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,509
I can't believe myself.

204
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,881
Because I'm anxious,
the worst is coming out of me.

205
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,825
Mr. Shin, about this case.

206
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:37,296
She stabbed her husband
because he assaulted her.

207
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,165
Do you think I could argue self-defense?

208
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,038
Mr. Shin? Are you sleeping?

209
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,542
Let it slide.
He's been like that for days.

210
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,211
Why? He should be way past menopause.

211
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,447
I can hear you.

212
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:01,553
Then answer my question.
Can I get her off with self-defense?

213
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,954
In that situation,

214
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:08,560
it's almost impossible to get off
with self-defense.

215
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,697
It's better to just admit to the charges

216
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:16,201
and get a reduced sentence instead.

217
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,104
But the defendant said
she'll take full responsibility,

218
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,839
so get a verdict of not guilty,
no matter what.

219
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,509
Then persuade her.
That's what a lawyer does.

220
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,181
Okay.

221
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,285
STATEMENT OF A REASONS FOR APPEAL

222
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:39,157
About that man. What were his hands like?

223
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,492
What?

224
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,160
His hands.

225
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,629
Well, they were intact.

226
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,965
"Intact"?

227
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,936
They were intact.

228
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,273
They were intact?

229
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:09,287
I have a question, Mr. Yang.
What are Bo-hee's hands like?

230
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,089
"Hands"?

231
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,694
They're pale and pretty. Why?

232
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,430
What do you think
Mr. Yang's hands are like?

233
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:22,067
They're on the thick and rough side.

234
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,406
Ms. Seo,
have you finished the appellate brief?

235
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,643
Mr. Jo. What do you think of my hands?

236
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,279
Your hands? I don't know.

237
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,482
I think you have long and lean fingers.

238
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,154
That's right.
When asked what someone's hands are like,

239
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,725
we usually say they are
pale, pretty, rough, or coarse.

240
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,593
That's how we answer, right?

241
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:53,965
But answering
that they're "intact" is strange, right?

242
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:57,836
"Intact"? Did someone say that?

243
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:02,374
Yes, the person who reported Park Su-ha,
Mun Sung-nam.

244
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,411
I asked her about the hands of the person
who told her about the reward.

245
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,347
And she answered that they were "intact."

246
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,216
Isn't that strange?

247
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,919
Could it be Min Jun-guk?

248
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:18,356
If, as Park Su-ha's side argued,
Min Jun-guk's left hand is missing...

249
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,693
And the person who reported him
is trying to hide Min Jun-guk...

250
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,695
Then she would say
his hands were "intact."

251
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,965
Amazing. But it can't be true.

252
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,135
If he were alive this whole time,
we would have found some trace of him.

253
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,137
But we haven't been looking for him.

254
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,906
We should start looking
for him in earnest.

255
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:39,411
Mr. Yang, please summon Mun Sung-nam
to testify as a witness.

256
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,345
Okay.

257
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,552
Come on. Don't be like this.

258
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:52,023
Just look at the reports for me.
I covered so many shifts for you.

259
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,358
Come on.

260
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,228
Enough with the nasal whining.

261
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:59,264
What is it that you want to know so badly?

262
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,933
On July 21st and 23rd of last year,

263
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,136
were there any traffic accidents reported
in your area?

264
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,472
Search for both material damage
and human injury cases.

265
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,408
Last year, on July 21st and 23rd.

266
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,212
There were two human injury cases
and three material damage cases.

267
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,250
Is there one that involved
a blue, one-ton truck?

268
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,652
Yes, there is.
It's a material damage accident.

269
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,555
The truck ran into a tree on a causeway.

270
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,391
Who is the owner of that truck?

271
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:27,792
SUSPECT: KIM GI-HO

272
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,929
-It says Kim Gi-ho.
-Kim Gi-ho?

273
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,765
-His address is...
-Ganghwa Island?

274
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,902
You're right. How did you know that?

275
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,372
Thanks. If you need help on a lawsuit,
come see me anytime.

276
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,974
I'll give you a consultation for free.

277
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,847
Kim Gi-ho.

278
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,620
CULTIVATING KOREA'S SOARING HUMAN TALENT
2014, RECRUITING NEW POLICE UNIV. STUDENTS

279
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,463
Su-ha!

280
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,567
You should go more slowly.

281
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,471
In the future, don't call him
when you call me. It upsets me.

282
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,041
It upsets me, too. A lot.

283
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:21,246
Why did you call us today?
Did you remember something?

284
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,516
No. So I want to get some help.

285
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,850
How can we help?

286
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,354
Tell me everything you know
about me and Ms. Jang.

287
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:38,196
What is that?
You're interested in the police academy?

288
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,832
No, I'm just looking.

289
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,268
Don't even look at it.

290
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,571
It's freaking hard to get in.
Besides, your trial isn't over.

291
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,708
If you're found guilty,
you can't get in anyway--

292
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,410
I guess so.

293
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,915
No, you can do it.
You had really good grades in high school.

294
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,750
Really? That's a surprise.

295
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,491
It would be so cool if you did.
I really like men in uniform.

296
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,095
We wear uniforms
at our car repair center too.

297
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,140
It's uncomfortable eating dinner
with Su-ha.

298
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,511
Shall I go eat alone?

299
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,090
That's my thing.

300
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,633
-What are you doing?
-Hello.

301
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,469
-Goodness.
-Oh my.

302
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,441
Why on earth do you do that?

303
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,144
It just makes me dizzy and I can't think.

304
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:03,114
Really? I think better when I'm in there.

305
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,483
I shouldn't do it when I get older.

306
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,819
Why are you mentioning age here?

307
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:11,756
Do you have worries?
You're acting like an adolescent.

308
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,793
Are adolescents the only ones
who have worries?

309
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:21,633
There's a new food stall. What a surprise.

310
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,237
-Are you going there?
-Yes.

311
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:30,575
-Hey.
-I thought you only drink wine.

312
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:37,115
Just keep going your way.
And please shut your trap!

313
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,753
Wait for me!

314
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,892
-Gosh.
-Hey.

315
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,262
This must be a day for drinking.

316
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:55,066
I bumped into Ms. Seo,
so I brought her here.

317
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,970
And now Mr. Shin
and Ms. Jjang are here, too.

318
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,373
-Please sit here.
-Sure, thanks.

319
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,310
Come sit here.

320
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,718
Ms. Seo is a really good drinker.

321
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,788
She's had two and a half bottles of soju,
but she's fine.

322
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,861
Excuse me. Three bottles of soju, please.

323
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:27,165
-Yes.
-What? Three? All for yourself?

324
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,368
I can drink. You know that.

325
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,872
You can drink?

326
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:45,049
See? I'm intact.

327
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,461
Yes, you're intact.

328
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,633
Are you okay, Ms. Seo?

329
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,135
Yes, I'm fine.

330
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,939
I'm just a little hot.

331
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,876
A perilla leaf and now a lettuce leaf.
How funny.

332
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:18,383
Ms. Jjang, there's something
that I've been meaning to ask you.

333
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,451
Ask away.

334
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:24,956
Remember when you were interviewed
to be a public defender?

335
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:29,227
You said you regretted having testified
in court.

336
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,630
Yes, I regret it.

337
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,234
Why did you say you regretted it?

338
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,005
To be honest, I testified that day

339
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:47,612
to show that bratty girl
and her father something.

340
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,316
That I was right and that she was wrong.

341
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,220
-One.
-Two.

342
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,655
-Three.
-Three.

343
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,091
That's why I opened that door and went in.

344
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,895
But I got nothing out of it.

345
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,964
Why do you think so?

346
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,366
You testified to catch the murderer,

347
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,735
and you realized
there is justice in this world.

348
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,372
"Justice"? What a joke.

349
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,775
-That stupid cell phone!
-"Cell phone"?

350
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,247
Park Su-ha has already lost credibility.

351
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:25,850
Didn't you hear him lie
that he reads people's minds?

352
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,520
He is trying to frame the suspect
by lying.

353
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,523
It will be hard to have her as a witness.

354
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,668
I have a photo here.

355
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,973
I took a photo of him hitting the man
with a pipe.

356
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,576
Can't this be used as evidence?

357
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:57,715
But it's that cell phone
that ruined everything.

358
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:02,053
It ruined everything? Why?

359
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:18,269
You must have been scared.
You did well with the testimony.

360
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,406
If it weren't for you,

361
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:25,276
this case would've been ruled
as an accident.

362
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,614
Did you see the photo?

363
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:34,052
I did. Nothing was taken.

364
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:45,830
I lied. Is that okay?

365
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,633
Of course. You did well.

366
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:54,138
We can't just let the murderer get away
like this.

367
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:58,676
We should even shoot a blank to catch him.

368
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,350
"A blank"?

369
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,353
Good job today.

370
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,889
I'll let you know
when the ruling comes out.

371
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:17,295
Do you know something?
There was another witness.

372
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,367
Who is that?

373
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,969
Do-yeon.

374
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,437
What?

375
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,473
Do-yeon?

376
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:31,943
She was with me
on the day of the accident.

377
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,612
So we were supposed
to come here together today.

378
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,249
But she ran away.

379
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,085
Do-yeon is a liar.

380
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:45,656
She lied today.
And about my lighting the firework.

381
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:53,164
I know. I know she lied.

382
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:59,771
But thanks to her,
we were able to find out that you did it.

383
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,840
-But that was--
-You know what?

384
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,310
I don't think of that as a lie.

385
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:10,615
What Do-yeon did. What you did just now.

386
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,451
If it's not a lie, then what is it?

387
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,787
Blanks.

388
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,892
Blanks to catch the criminal.

389
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,474
I felt so wronged.

390
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:43,047
I wanted to uphold my cause.
I wanted to prove I was right.

391
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,883
So I risked my life to testify.

392
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,853
But I got nothing out of it.

393
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,389
I just...

394
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:58,029
Added a really bad enemy to my life.

395
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,102
What do you think? Regrettable, isn't it?

396
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:06,804
"Regret"?

397
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,807
Did you regret it more than I did?

398
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,580
I also regret it.

399
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:20,384
For 11 years,
I regretted not opening that door.

400
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:24,355
So are you the brat...

401
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:25,823
You're that girl?

402
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,830
Do you know why I hate you so much?

403
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,305
-One.
-Two.

404
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,574
-Three.
-Three.

405
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:53,684
You're the one who witnessed
the most cowardly moment of my life.

406
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:59,090
So every time I see you,
I'm reminded of that moment.

407
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:25,850
Do you know how much I regret that moment?

408
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,387
I should have gone back to testify.

409
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:34,525
I still regret it. All the time, even now.

410
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,366
I wanted to make excuses for it.

411
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,669
In any way possible.

412
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:52,176
I gave up art from that day on.

413
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,911
I cut off ties with all my friends.

414
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,714
And I studied hard to become a prosecutor.

415
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,651
I wanted to show you and my father...

416
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:06,424
that I wasn't myself at that moment.
It was a mistake.

417
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:13,831
I've been making excuses
for 11 years with all my might.

418
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,935
Did you know that? For 11 years.

419
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:28,512
I should get going.

420
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,581
-Ms. Seo.
-Ms. Seo.

421
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,150
Ms. Seo. You can't just go.

422
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,657
I should go, too.

423
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,130
-I should get going.
-Ms. Jjang. How could you--

424
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,065
Ms. Jjang.

425
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,836
You drank the most.
How can you just leave?

426
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,171
What about the bill?

427
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,709
I get curious whenever I meet you here.

428
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,812
You became a big shot prosecutor.

429
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:06,017
Why did I have to meet you
as a public defender?

430
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:11,055
Why did God put us in such a setting?

431
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,130
They're very interesting friends.

432
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,767
-Those two.
-I know.

433
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,638
I didn't know they had such a history.

434
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,675
But they met here
as public defender and prosecutor.

435
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:34,545
I know. What an incredible coincidence.

436
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,047
Right?

437
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:40,851
They say coincidence is God's will.

438
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,497
If God had them meet up again,

439
00:38:56,901 --> 00:39:03,808
there must have been a reason
why they needed to meet again.

440
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,115
ARREST

441
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,083
AMNESIA

442
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:25,830
AQUARIUM WITH MS. JANG

443
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,531
MIN JUN-GUK AND THE FISHING PLACE

444
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,100
SELF-DEFENSE
AMNESIA

445
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,407
You dropped out of high school,
were wanted for murder,

446
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:37,775
and have no memory or future.

447
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,977
That's why Ms. Jjang took you in.

448
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,847
Don't mistake it for something else.

449
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,206
Why are these here?

450
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,213
Aren't these Ms. Jang's clothes?

451
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,582
You're the one who's
making Ms. Jjang uncomfortable.

452
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,835
Seo Do-yeon, you piece of crap.

453
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,903
What is this scar?

454
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,341
You drank a lot yesterday.
Are you feeling okay?

455
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,210
Yes, I'm okay.

456
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,681
Do you have to drink?
You can't take it well.

457
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,050
I'm famous for holding my liquor well.

458
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,053
I always make my way back home.

459
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,290
And I never caused trouble.
So you don't need to worry.

460
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:45,262
Aren't you going to eat?
I made bean-sprout soup.

461
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,665
Yes, I have an interview,
so I have to go early.

462
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:52,803
Aren't you avoiding me?

463
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,539
No, it's not like that.

464
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,155
What are you doing?

465
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:12,890
I need to ask you something.

466
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:14,792
What is it?

467
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:18,028
You had a scar on your waist. What is it?

468
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,931
If he knows, he'll have a hard time.

469
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,136
When did you see that?
It's from an appendix surgery.

470
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:28,172
"Appendix surgery"?

471
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:30,307
Yes, appendix surgery. Okay?

472
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:32,977
One more thing.

473
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,748
My verdict of not guilty will be upheld
in the appellate court.

474
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:41,885
Once I do, I'll go to college,
make friends, get a job, and live busily.

475
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:45,823
I will try hard so you don't have to worry
about me or feel burdened.

476
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,194
Really? That's good to hear.

477
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:54,531
I won't nag, preach,
or act disrespectfully.

478
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:55,633
That's good to hear, too.

479
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,469
So don't avoid me.

480
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:02,973
Don't come late or skip meals to avoid me.

481
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:06,777
And don't hate me.

482
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,341
Shoot. Why do we have the same bag?

483
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:24,888
Justice? What a joke. That cell phone!

484
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,592
Oh no. Shoot!

485
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,465
I also regret it.

486
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:39,536
For 11 years,
I regretted not opening that door.

487
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,573
Shoot.

488
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,352
Do you remember last night?

489
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,021
Not at all. What about you?

490
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:00,524
I don't remember at all either.

491
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,299
That prosecutor has summoned me
as a witness.

492
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,269
She is so persistent.

493
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:18,509
Don't worry. I won't say a word about you.

494
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,812
-When do they want you?
-Tomorrow.

495
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,915
I won't be able
to open the store for a day.

496
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:33,223
I put some peaches aside for you,
so take them.

497
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,460
Thank you.

498
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,064
What is this?

499
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:44,401
I saw from your resume
that it's your birthday today.

500
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,372
So I packed some seaweed soup
and side dishes for you.

501
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,274
Take care of yourself and eat it at home.

502
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,944
You know what I'm going to do next.

503
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:55,546
Aren't you scared?

504
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,115
I'm not scared.

505
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:04,421
I just feel bad for you
and think you're pathetic.

506
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,458
You lived your whole life hating someone.

507
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,496
How hellish that life must have been.

508
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,803
-What are you thinking?
-Nothing.

509
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,073
I'm thinking of what to do.

510
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:28,111
Shall I stop here
or keep going to the end?

511
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,814
Are you on a journey?

512
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:33,851
"Journey"?

513
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,688
Yes. I'm on a journey.

514
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,491
But now that I'm here,
this feels like a good place.

515
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:47,865
I'm thinking about
whether I should stop and stay here.

516
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,501
If you're on a journey,
shouldn't you go all the way?

517
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:55,639
Really? Is that what you think, too?

518
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:59,109
Yes, you should go all the way.

519
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:02,679
You're right.

520
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,816
I should go all the way.

521
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:12,055
I agree with you.

522
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,344
Truck.

523
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,718
Blue truck.

524
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:00,671
I think I was in a traffic accident
after I met with Min Jun-guk.

525
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:05,275
It was a causeway.
I think I was hit by a blue truck.

526
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,083
Who are you?

527
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,656
Yes, I've come to ask you something.

528
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:27,731
This is really sweet and good.

529
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,767
What do you want to ask?

530
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,371
Do you know Park Su-ha?

531
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,375
No, you must know him as Lee Soon-wook.

532
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,043
Why is this coming up again?

533
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:45,582
The police and prosecution already came
to investigate for the trial.

534
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,486
Something new came up.

535
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,855
What is that?

536
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,126
Did you by any chance hit Park Su-ha?

537
00:49:56,193 --> 00:50:00,263
No, Lee Soon-wook with that truck?

538
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,433
Who said so? Soon-wook?

539
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,303
Does he remember?

540
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:11,908
Yes, he remembered.
So you have to tell me the truth.

541
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,411
Why did you hide
that there was an accident?

542
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:19,516
You made a false report
that it was a material damage accident.

543
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:24,254
I was going to report it
and pay for what I did.

544
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,455
It's true.

545
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,826
But that person asked me not to.

546
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:34,031
He said the kid has no memory,
so I should just hide it.

547
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,567
That person? Who?

548
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,017
-Hello?
-Ms. Seo, we're in trouble.

549
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,853
It's about Mun Sung-nam,
the store owner we summoned to testify.

550
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,955
-Yes?
-Last night,

551
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:00,424
she died in an accident!

552
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,225
What?

553
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,975
-What happened?
-They say it's a DUI.

554
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:22,746
She came from there and died immediately
when she fell off the bridge.

555
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,181
"DUI"?

556
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:28,251
Yes, her blood alcohol level was 0.19%.

557
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,556
-Did you check that security camera?
-Yes.

558
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:36,493
But it went out of order an hour
before the accident.

559
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:44,034
Death by DUI
as soon as she was summoned to testify.

560
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:47,938
And the security camera went out of order
right before the accident.

561
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:50,073
Could it all be a coincidence?

562
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,375
Of course not. Never.

563
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,747
From now on,
we consider Min Jun-guk to be alive.

564
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:00,450
-Put Min Jun-guk on the most wanted list.
-Yes.

565
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:09,793
What is this scar?

566
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,596
This is similar to that scar.

567
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:41,124
What is this? This can't be. Why?

568
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,562
Why? Why did you do that?

569
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:48,565
You fool.

570
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,001
I told you.

571
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:57,607
If you kill him,
you're no longer a victim, but a murderer.

572
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,846
Don't tell anyone. Never.

573
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,182
You didn't stab me.

574
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:10,854
If you don't do as I say,
I will never see you again.

575
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:34,077
I am a witness to this murder case.

576
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,146
I am Jang Hye-seong.

577
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:43,587
I will protect you.

578
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,491
Uncle! Over here!

579
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,131
It hurts!

580
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,781
I can read other people's minds.

581
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,100
Just like me!

582
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:33,303
Stop.

583
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,240
You must think
your father was a good person.

584
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:15,412
Just like how I killed your father,

585
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:20,784
your father killed my wife.

586
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,689
No, that can't be right.

587
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,626
No, that can't be right.

588
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:35,265
You must think
your father was a good person.

589
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:38,335
Shut it! Don't lie to me!

590
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:43,173
You must know
that I'm not lying right now.

591
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,810
Stop. Please.

592
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:54,451
Your father killed my wife
with his cunning tongue.

593
00:55:55,919 --> 00:56:00,190
I'm not the one who started all of this!

594
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:05,795
-It was your father!
-Shut it! Shut up!

595
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:16,172
You must want to kill me right now.

596
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:18,174
Kill me.

597
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:26,549
How are you different
from me 11 years ago?

598
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:38,762
I won't do what you're worried about.

599
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,432
I will keep that promise.

600
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:45,468
Please believe me.

601
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:04,788
I'm different.

602
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:11,561
I won't live like an animal like you.

603
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:13,329
Never.

604
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,874
Stop right there! Park Su-ha! Stop!

605
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:35,285
Father, please tell me it's not true.

606
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,689
Father.

607
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:51,034
Hey, watch where you're going!

608
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:56,072
I'm on the pavement,
so I have to act tough.

609
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:02,579
Do you have a death wish?
Shall we go to the police?

610
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,587
What's going on?
I think the motorcycle's at fault.

611
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,322
This is the pavement.
He's the one who's wrong.

612
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:13,289
What's wrong with him?

613
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,724
Shall I report it to the police?

614
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,960
-He is so handsome.
-I don't want to get caught up.

615
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,995
-Why are people gathered here?
-Should I take a picture?

616
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:54,097
Ms. Jjang. Min Jun-guk is alive.

617
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,432
Yes, I just heard.

618
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,104
What are you doing here, Ms. Seo?

619
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:04,173
I also found out
that Min Jun-guk is alive.

620
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:06,609
How did you find out?

621
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,811
The old man who took care of Park Su-ha

622
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:12,348
had hit Su-ha with his truck
when he was drunk.

623
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,517
Is that why he took care of him?

624
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,553
To hide his DUI accident?

625
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:19,389
He wanted to come forward,
but someone stopped him.

626
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,724
To just let it pass,
since Park Su-ha doesn't remember.

627
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,227
-Was that...
-Min Jun-guk.

628
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,063
He already didn't have a left hand then.

629
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:32,969
My gosh,
so Min Jun-guk really did set this all up.

630
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:36,773
Where is Min Jun-guk?

631
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,343
We don't know yet.
He is on the wanted list for now.

632
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:44,881
I told the police station
to increase patrols for you.

633
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:48,585
I'm also looking into programs
to prevent retaliatory crimes.

634
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,488
What about Su-ha? What about the appeal?

635
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:53,790
What?

636
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:57,727
Since Min Jun-guk is alive,
shouldn't Su-ha's case be dropped?

637
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:01,397
-Does that come first for you?
-Yes, it does.

638
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:03,866
Are you going to drop the appeal?

639
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:07,003
Yes, I will.

640
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:09,238
Thank you.

641
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,407
I need to go out.

642
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,244
-Where are you going?
-To let Su-ha know.

643
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:35,932
I'm not the one who started all of this!

644
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,035
It was your father!

645
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,708
So that was what I wanted to erase.

646
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:49,746
But erasing it won't make it go away.

647
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:06,496
What will I do with you?

648
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,733
She'll resent me more
if she finds out about this.

649
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:16,239
She'll be so afraid
if she finds out Min Jun-guk is alive.

650
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,877
Min Jun-guk was alive.
Su-ha didn't kill him.

651
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,546
He kept the promise he made.

652
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:32,989
Hello?

653
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:35,825
Where are you? Are you at home?

654
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:40,430
No. I'm outside.

655
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,866
Min Jun-guk is alive.
Seo Do-yeon and Mr. Cha found out.

656
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,368
I see.

657
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:48,805
What's with that response?
Min Jun-guk is alive.

658
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:51,641
You're innocent.
You don't have to go to trial.

659
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:56,879
If he's alive,
that means you're in danger.

660
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,682
You fool. We can worry about that later.

661
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:02,919
Seo Do-yeon won't appeal again.
She told me so.

662
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,254
So you're no longer a defendant--

663
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:08,024
Hey, you...

664
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,494
You're the fool.

665
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:15,565
Your life is in danger again.

666
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,634
How can my innocence come first?

667
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,237
How can you be like that?

668
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:38,588
Thank you for having kept your promise.

669
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:50,299
