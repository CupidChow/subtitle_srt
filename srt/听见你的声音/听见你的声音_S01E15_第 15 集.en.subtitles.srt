1
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,494
I'm sorry, Do-yeon.

2
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:33,266
How can you say that?

3
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,902
Are you suffering from heat stroke?
Are you out of your mind?

4
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,171
Previously,

5
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,206
you asked why your father
and the chief are so sensitive

6
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:43,209
about you being involved
with Hwang Dal-jung.

7
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,812
It's because
Hwang Dal-jung is your father.

8
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,349
I can't listen to this. Get out.

9
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,384
No. Hear me out.

10
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,857
Seo Do-yeon. This is about your father.

11
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,461
My only father is Seo Dae-seok.

12
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,329
Hwang Dal-jung is your birth father.

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,198
The man whom you believe is your father

14
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,700
had your innocent birth father locked up
for 26 years.

15
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,536
Jang Hye-seong.

16
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,371
This isn't funny anymore.

17
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,073
You've gone too far.

18
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:17,043
I'm really sorry, Do-yeon. But...

19
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,712
We need you.

20
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,448
Get out right now!

21
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,055
Hey. Have you ever seen stars right
before your eyes?

22
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,356
I have.

23
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:35,095
Do-yeon hit me with her bony hand
and I saw stars before my eyes.

24
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,166
Did you hit her back?

25
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,136
If I hit her back,
then I would be just like her.

26
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,840
I thought about bringing assault charges
against her, for the tiniest moment.

27
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,976
But I considered her current situation
and managed to restrain myself.

28
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,579
It hurts. I'll hold it.

29
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,080
Hold still.

30
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,918
-I think it might bruise.
-Really?

31
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,387
I have a lot of trials tomorrow,
I can't have that.

32
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,357
Where does she live?

33
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,192
Why? Will you go persuade her?

34
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,594
No, I want to tell her off.

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,662
Take me
with you the next time you see her.

36
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,464
No.

37
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,169
You sounded like my mother just now.

38
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,404
-Me?
-Yes.

39
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,740
If I came home beaten up,

40
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,710
she would ask where these kids lived
while holding a broom in her hand.

41
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,912
What was your mother like?

42
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,449
My mother?

43
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,517
Yes.

44
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,353
You never talk about your mother.

45
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,590
Is it rude to ask?

46
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,593
Yes, it is.

47
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,596
Okay. I won't ask.

48
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,912
It's time for you to take over.

49
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,346
What?

50
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,884
When will this be over?

51
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,153
I think my body is rotting.

52
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,890
I think we're going to die

53
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,459
trying to catch Min Jun-guk.

54
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,728
I'm going to sleep now.

55
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,733
If he's going to come out anyway,

56
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,735
why doesn't he just come out sooner?

57
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,605
I can't tell what he's up to.

58
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,924
IS KOREA'S WELFARE SYSTEM ANY GOOD?
ELDERLY WOMAN WITH DEMENTIA DIED ALONE

59
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:09,082
Don't avoid it. Answer me.
Why can't I take on that case?

60
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,683
I said I never asked him.

61
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:12,952
Previously,

62
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,954
you asked why your father
and the chief are so sensitive

63
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,024
about you being involved
with Hwang Dal-jung.

64
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,927
It's because
Hwang Dal-jung is your father.

65
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,299
Do you really believe Hye-seong?

66
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,049
The maid's daughter returned

67
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,953
after ten years as a public defender.

68
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,322
And you had to drop the indictment.

69
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,468
Hye-seong came to see me yesterday.

70
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:06,806
Really?

71
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,709
She said something that didn't make sense.

72
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,846
She has to find Hwang Dal-jung's daughter
to do a DNA test.

73
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,049
And she asked me to do it.

74
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,187
-What?
-She said I'm his daughter.

75
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,592
So, what did you say?

76
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,531
Did you agree to take the test?

77
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,405
-Father.
-Did you agree to it?

78
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,744
I thought that if you heard this,

79
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,514
you would say it was nonsense
and ask me to bring Hye-seong

80
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,784
to scold her.

81
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,223
That's what most fathers would do.

82
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,792
Do-yeon.

83
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:27,120
Do-yeon, I'll give you a facial.
Go wash your face.

84
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,994
What's up with you?

85
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,296
Go and wash your face.

86
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,831
Mom.

87
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,135
Please stay still like this for a while.

88
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,505
What's up with you?

89
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,340
Mom.

90
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,375
Did something happen?

91
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:52,945
No.

92
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,458
Aren't you going
to meet Seo Do-yeon again?

93
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,427
Why?

94
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,028
Will you really come with me?

95
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,166
I can meet her alone.

96
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,638
Don't worry. I won't do anything stupid.

97
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:22,809
You never know. Maybe I'll be able
to persuade her from reading her mind.

98
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,044
Really?

99
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:29,549
If I can't persuade Do-yeon,

100
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,084
should I ask her to recuse herself
from this trial?

101
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,121
It's too cruel being the prosecutor
in her birth father's trial.

102
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,622
What about the DNA test?

103
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,758
Isn't that what you need most?

104
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,961
Yes. I need that to start everything.

105
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,229
And file for a retrial.

106
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,130
TO: PARK SU-HA

107
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,364
What's a retrial?

108
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,868
If the old verdict was wrong,
we have to rectify things.

109
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,002
That's a retrial.

111

If Do-yeon helps,

112
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,041
Hwang Dal-jung could try for a retrial.

REPORTER PARK JU-HYEOK

114
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,010
He served time for killing someone
26 years ago,

115
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,346
but that victim is very much alive.

116
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,886
What is it?

117
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,721
What?

118
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,791
It's nothing.

119
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,894
It doesn't seem like nothing.

120
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,464
Really, it's nothing. Let's go.

121
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,717
Did you meet the daughter?

122
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,920
I did, but she doesn't believe me.

123
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,556
And even if she did,
she's not the type to come forward.

124
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,592
She's living well with a good family.

125
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,594
I guess she doesn't want to lose them.

126
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,897
Who is the daughter?

127
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,832
You don't need to know.

128
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:56,402
Shall I go and try to persuade her?

129
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,604
I don't think persuading will work.

130
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,806
I wouldn't come forward, either.

131
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,377
Why don't you try looking
for Hwang Dal-jung's friends?

132
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,145
We're already doing that.

133
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,614
If the daughter doesn't come forward,

134
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,683
we'll use the friends to prove

135
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,520
that Jeon Young-ja is Son Chae-ok.

136
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,323
That wouldn't be completely accepted.

137
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:21,961
The prosecution will say
that his friends can't be trusted.

138
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,997
You need evidence that is more concrete.

139
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,600
Hey! Who's side are you on anyway?

140
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,137
I knew you would get told off.

143
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,384
Is this my mail?

144
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,920
Yes. Why?

145
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,890
It's an article from more
than ten years ago.

146
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,858
Why did someone send me this?

147
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,660
"Reporter Park Ju-hyeok"?

148
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:56,862
I think it's not for me.

149
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,733
At any rate, we have to find a way

150
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,102
to stop Hwang Dal-jung from serving time.

151
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:06,405
He already served 26 years
for a crime he didn't commit.

152
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:10,676
It's too cruel to have him spend
the little time he has left in prison.

153
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,612
It's a jury trial,

154
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,615
so sympathy will work better
than legal principles.

156

What is this?

157
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,566
I think Min Jun-guk sent it.
Find out where it was postmarked.

158
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,334
There's no return address on it.

159
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:39,505
So how do you know Min Jun-guk sent it?

160
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:43,175
It's a hunch.
Don't ask questions. Just do it.

161
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:48,681
There's nothing inside. Did it come empty?

162
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,450
Stop asking questions
and find out where it was postmarked.

163
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,619
And search the security footage
of the mailboxes, too.

00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,254
I know how to investigate.

165
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,957
But I need some grounds to do so.

166
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,793
Please.

167
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,696
Hey. Stop that.

168
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,132
I'll keep going until you say yes.

169
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,235
Please find out.

170
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,571
Stop it. It's disgusting. I'll do it.

171
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,140
Thank you.

172
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,376
So did you check
if you passed the GED test?

173
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,679
Yes, I checked on the internet.

174
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,614
What was your average score?

175
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,983
-98 points.
-98 points?

176
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,385
Wow.

177
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,387
Wow, Su-ha.

178
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,989
It was nothing.

179
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,192
That's right. You took it, too.

180
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,627
What was your score?

181
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,098
Oh, 84 points.

182
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,269
The GED test was really hard back
when we took it.

183
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,938
And each educational office
has different scoring criteria.

184
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,274
And they graded us very strictly.

185
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,443
I'm going.

186
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,512
Call me when you're done.

187
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,847
Whatever.

188
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,554
Long time no see, Park Su-ha.

189
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,057
What are you doing here?

190
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,093
Do I have to tell you that?

191
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:19,138
Yu-chang, what time did you say
Kim Min-hee's...

192
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,209
interview is?

193
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,244
Seo Do-yeon.

194
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,013
I need to talk to you.

195
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,550
Let's talk alone.

196
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,620
Sure, let's talk.

197
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,821
Come with me.

198
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,600
Why are things so icy between them?

199
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,472
You should go outside.

200
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,774
Why?

201
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,543
Am I the only one curious
about their conversation?

202
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,812
Why are you letting him stay?

203
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,580
Su-ha, you should go outside as well.

204
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,817
I already know what they're talking about.

205
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,319
Okay. Yu-chang, let's go.

206
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,955
Why are you leaving me out of this?

207
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,825
I'm not leaving.
I want to know what it's about.

208
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,660
You don't have to know.

209
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,935
Where did you hear

210
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,437
that absurd story?

211
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,540
Tell me the source.

212
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,577
There's a witness.

213
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,814
But I can't tell you who it is yet.

214
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,285
You must be asking me for a reason.

215
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,420
Isn't that why you came?

216
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:43,889
It's not like that.

217
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,525
I came to say something.

218
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,261
Go ahead.

219
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:55,901
What you said before is so absurd
and makes no sense.

220
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:57,970
But if...

221
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,440
On the off chance

222
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,944
that what you said is true,

223
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,413
my father didn't do anything wrong.

224
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,881
Your father?

225
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,217
Which father?

226
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,752
I only have one father.

227
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,621
That's how it's been.

228
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,257
And how it will continue to be.

229
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,163
Hwang Dal-jung wants an apology
from your father.

230
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,198
You should persuade him then.

231
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,300
If that was a mistrial,

232
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,436
it's not the judge's fault,

233
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,938
but the fault of the prosecution
who didn't confirm the facts properly

234
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,274
and the lawyer who didn't defend properly.

235
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,452
I didn't say that it was a mistrial.

236
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:52,291
I meant that what your father did
after the trial was wrong.

237
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,660
After the trial?

238
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,896
This may be hard for you,
but please hear me out.

239
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,966
Saying this is hard for me, too.

240
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,203
But it's the truth,
so I thought you should--

241
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,005
Stop acting as if you care about me.

242
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,740
It's obnoxious.

243
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,376
Stop with the platitudes.

244
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,244
Just tell me what it is.

245
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,682
After the trial was over,

246
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,452
Jeon Young-ja went to meet your father.

247
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,354
What?

248
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,423
He must have been shocked.

249
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,192
Seeing a person who was supposedly dead
coming to find him,

250
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,461
he must have been astounded.

251
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,798
I came because I have a favor to ask.

252
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,968
If you agree to do as I ask,

253
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:40,873
I will make sure
that I do not cause trouble for you.

254
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,508
How can you say that?

255
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,043
Why can't I?

256
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,046
If that man is in prison as he is now,

257
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,847
everyone will be at peace.

258
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,449
You...

259
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,118
You don't have children, do you?

260
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,922
And you're looking to adopt.

261
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,993
Please take my daughter in.

262
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,697
That is what I came to ask you.

263
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,169
Your father accepted that offer.

264
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,738
And you're that daughter.

265
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,176
You must be crazy.

266
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,345
You're making all of this up.

267
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,515
Why do you think Mr. Seo adopted you?

268
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,052
You're not related to him.
You're the daughter of a defendant.

269
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,555
-Do you think it was kindness?
-That's enough.

270
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:33,592
You know how authoritative your father is.

271
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,595
He probably didn't want to admit
that he was wrong.

272
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,165
The "Left-Hand Murder Case" got a lot
of attention.

273
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,434
And it was his first case
as the chief judge.

274
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,805
It could've been really hard
for him to reverse the verdict.

275
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,341
-That's why he accepted--
-I told you to stop!

276
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,616
What are you doing?

277
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,219
-Let go.
-Apologize at once.

278
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,621
Let go! Let go of me!

279
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:04,990
Father.

280
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,692
Father.

281
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,629
Please tell me it's not true,

282
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,064
Father...

283
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,735
Father,

284
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,837
please tell me it's not true.

285
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,049
Do-yeon!

286
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,451
Hey, go get her.

287
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,520
Let her go.

288
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,055
I have to talk to her.

289
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,924
I have to get Seo Dae-seok
to apologize to Hwang Dal-jung.

290
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,559
I have to persuade her.

291
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,263
Go easy on her.

292
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:45,998
Su-ha.

293
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,400
It must feel
as if her world has collapsed.

294
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,570
She just learned about the wicked act
of her father she trusted for so long.

295
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,972
How can she accept it so quickly?

296
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,444
Give her some time to think
about this slowly.

297
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,745
There is no time.

298
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,014
Hwang Dal-jung doesn't have much time.

299
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,385
What's wrong with you, Su-ha?

300
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,054
Why are you taking her side
all of a sudden?

301
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,557
Why do you keep telling me
to cover up the truth?

302
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,792
I'm not telling you to cover up the truth.

303
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,527
I want you...

304
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,065
I want you to consider the person first.

305
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,743
Jang Hye-seong, you jerk.

306
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,646
You are such a jerk.

307
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,120
You lost your daughter

308
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,188
when you were imprisoned 25 years ago.

309
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,058
What?

310
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,328
Don't you want to be released quickly
and find her?

311
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,397
Can I really get out soon?

312
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,808
Let's talk, Su-ha.

313
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,010
Okay.

314
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,319
Talk from there.

315
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,757
I'm thinking a lot of bad thoughts,
so it's better if you don't see me.

316
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,163
Okay. Talk.

317
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,434
Do you really think Do-yeon is right?

318
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,636
What did she do wrong?

319
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:06,972
Look at you.

320
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,941
Are you taking her side?

321
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,816
It's her father who's wrong.

322
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,219
And she just can't believe it.

323
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,154
She would be the same even if she did.

324
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:26,291
I'm 100 percent convinced Seo Do-yeon
will take her father's side later.

325
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,460
She's his daughter.

326
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,097
How could a child deny their father?

327
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:36,301
That makes Do-yeon exactly the same
as her father.

328
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,271
What?

329
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,741
Keeping silent about his act
means she agrees with it.

330
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,743
I think they're the same.

331
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,750
I cannot understand Do-yeon.

332
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,452
This isn't about the two
of us being different.

333
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,354
She is just wrong in this case.

334
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,556
Are you listening?

335
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,799
What is this? Why didn't he hear me out?

336
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,914
Just like how I killed your father,

337
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,050
your father

338
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,687
killed my wife.

339
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:34,693
Keeping silent about his act
means she agrees with it.

340
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,362
I think they're the same.

REPORTER PARK JU-HYEOK

345
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,692
What is that thing?
Is it to avoid my eyes?

346
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,893
Yes.

347
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,998
It doesn't go with your outfit at all.

348
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,000
I don't care.

349
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,876
Where is my wallet?

350
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,210
I can't see.

351
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,947
Ma'am, take that strange mask off
and find it.

352
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,716
No wonder you can't see.

353
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,352
Two people, please.

354
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,033
Go on in. Call me when you're done.

355
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,501
Okay.

356
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,804
Ms. Jjang!

357
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,475
Do you have a trial this morning, too?

358
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:05,777
Yes.

359
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,846
What is that thing?

360
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,415
You look like that Star Wars character...

361
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,250
Darth Vader!

362
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,353
I was getting too many freckles lately.
Let's go in.

363
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,657
Go on without me. I need to talk to Su-ha.

364
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,994
-To Su-ha?
-Yes.

365
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,399
What is this?

366
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,537
This is--

367
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,474
A letter without a sender came
to me and Ms. Jjang.

368
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,678
So I asked the police to find out
where they were sent from.

369
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,114
They searched all the security footage
in that post office area.

370
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,516
That's what they found.

371
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,886
But he has changed his disguise a lot.

372
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,654
I thought you should know.

373
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,557
Min Jun-guk sent this letter
to Ms. Jjang, too?

374
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,126
-Did he send you one, too?
-Yes.

375
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:58,096
Did Ms. Jjang see the letter, too?

376
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,699
Yes, but she didn't seem to know
what it was about.

377
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,435
And I've been hiding the letters
that have come after that.

378
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,771
So don't worry.
She won't find out about it.

379
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:08,874
Thank you.

380
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,443
Sure. You should go now.

381
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,282
Why are you doing this to me?

382
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:18,884
What?

383
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,994
You like Ms. Jjang, too.
So why do you keep helping me?

384
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,531
Are you showing off in front of me?

385
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,232
You have a good personality, a job,

386
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,668
and parents, and you're an adult,
so you have everything, right?

387
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,436
So I'm not even your competition.

388
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,405
Is that what you're trying to say?

389
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,611
Get a hold of yourself, Park Su-ha.

390
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,382
If you act like this,
you'll just make me more miserable.

391
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,952
Ms. Jjang chose you
and didn't even give me a chance.

392
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:57,923
So don't be so anxious
and show me why she chose you.

393
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:03,061
Looking at you now,
I can't understand why she chose you.

394
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,083
I'll take

395
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,552
the DNA test.

396
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,289
What? Really?

397
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,724
But,

398
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,193
I have a condition.

399
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,828
A condition?

400
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,763
What condition?

401
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,235
What is it?

402
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,551

You've found my daughter?

404
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,692
Ga-yeon?

405
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:13,031
She said she would take the DNA test
for you.

406
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,368
How did she grow up? What is she like?

407
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,737
Is she kind? Is she pretty?

408
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,940
Yes, she's very smart and pretty.

409
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,443
-Her family is good, too.
-When can I see her?

410
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,579
Can she come see me?

411
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,455
That won't be easy.

412
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,891
She doesn't want to meet me?

413
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,694
It's not exactly like that.

414
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:48,199
It seems that it's hard
for her to accept everything.

415
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,539
I guess it could be.

416
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,542
I thought she would want to see me

417
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:01,646
as much as I want to see her.

418
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,750
I guess I only thought about myself.

419
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,252
In any case,

420
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:13,425
the DNA test will prove
that the victim is your wife.

421
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:16,461
Then you can file for a retrial.

422
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,699
And the trial should go in our favor, too.

423
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:26,938
Please thank her on my behalf.

424
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:30,275
Sure, I will.

425
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,913
Once the DNA test result comes out,
you should file for a retrial.

426
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:39,417
I heard it's very hard to get a retrial.

427
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:40,552
Yes.

428
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,222
I don't have much time.

429
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,623
You know that.

430
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,696
You should still try anyway.

431
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,332
It could happen faster than you think.

Yes, this is me.

453
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,183
You already have the test results?

454
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,152
What were the results?

455
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,424
Yes.

456
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,295

It must feel
as if her world has collapsed.

460
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,405
She just learned about the wicked act
of her father she trusted for so long.

461
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,941
How can she accept it so quickly?

462
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:27,445
Give her some time to think
about this slowly.

463
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,982
I'm not telling you to cover up the truth.

464
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:32,951
I want you...

465
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,254
I want you to consider the person first.

466
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,798
Mr. Seo.

467
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,833
I have something to tell you.

468
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:54,105
Should I say it out loud right here?

469
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,440
It's about Do-yeon.

470
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:01,980
Please go ahead.

471
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,388
Make it short. I have a meeting.

472
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:15,293
To be honest, I was thinking
of bringing you in as a witness.

473
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,295
And if you didn't come,

474
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,331
I was going to subpoena you until you did.

475
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,133
I was going to take this all the way.

476
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,135
I was going to tell the whole world

477
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,871
what you did 26 years ago,

478
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,673
and how you ruined one man's life.

479
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,341
Are we still talking about this?

480
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,312
I made a decision as a judge
based on the evidence.

481
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,748
If that decision was wrong,

482
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,516
then I am not the one at fault.

483
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,152
It's the prosecutor and lawyer.

484
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,623
How can you say exactly the same thing
as what Do-yeon said?

485
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,726
Do-yeon took the DNA test.

486
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,828
And the results came out today.

487
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,097
I guess you didn't know.

488
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:57,201
Do-yeon said she had one condition
for taking the test.

489
00:33:57,268 --> 00:34:00,938
I came because I thought you should know
what that condition was.

490
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:02,774
A condition?

491
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,509
Yes.

492
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,612
What is the condition?

493
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,917
You cannot ruin my father with this trial.

494
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:18,156
So, don't even mention my father's name
at trial.

495
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:23,761
I'm not taking this test
for Hwang Dal-jung.

496
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,465
It's for my father.

497
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,035
I want this to be very clear.

498
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:35,540
However, for as long
as I've known Do-yeon,

499
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,076
this was the first time
that I ever felt sorry for her.

500
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,412
If I were her, I think I would resent

501
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,848
a father like you a lot.

502
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,853
I won't summon you as a witness.

503
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,822
I promised Do-yeon.

504
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,858
Are you done now?

505
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:55,927
Yes.

506
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,167
I have nothing to testify.

507
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,717
Ms. Jjang chose you
and didn't even give me a chance.

508
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,452
So don't be so anxious

509
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,088
and show me why she chose you.

510
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,700
I'm done. Let's go.

511
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,636
Take it off. It's dangerous at night.

512
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,937
It's okay.

513
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,273
And I'm still mad at you.

514
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:47,545
Then tell me. Don't hide.
I don't get hurt that easily.

515
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,448
I understood even
when my uncle abandoned me.

516
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,384
And when you called me a stalker

517
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,187
and said it was my fault
that your mother died,

518
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:59,290
I just accepted it.
And I will do so again.

519
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,894
I have already accepted most
of the thoughts you had.

520
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,997
And I accepted the filthy side
that you were able to show.

521
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,799
Whatever you show me
or think in front of me,

522
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:11,135
I won't be disappointed.

523
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,603
So...

524
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,872
Don't hide your face with this.

525
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,340
No, don't look.

526
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,510
I told you.

527
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,847
I won't be hurt by what you think.

528
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,782
What should I do?

529
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,384
My heart is pounding.

530
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:36,127
Let go. No woman wants a man to see this.

531
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,669
Don't look. I'll kill you if you do.

532
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:59,850
Look at you. How dare you?

533
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:07,725
Do you remember what I said?
I will never be disappointed.

534
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:11,596
Okay, fine. I understood perfectly.

535
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,167
So no matter what I say,

536
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,369
or what kind of person I am,

537
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,471
don't be disappointed with me.

538
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,109
Answer me. Okay?

539
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,813
Okay.

540
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:34,652
Let's go.

541
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,133
Could I meet Dr. Woo Seong-sik?

542
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,669
Dr. Woo Seong-sik? One moment, please.

543
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,237
Which department is he?

544
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:56,173
He used to be the head
of the cardiovascular center.

545
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,644
Why are you asking for Dr. Woo Seong-sik?

546
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,545
I want to ask him something.

547
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:04,081
He passed away a long time ago.

548
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:05,883
I see.

549
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,387
Could you tell me how he passed away?

550
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,422
It was a traffic accident.

551
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,792
I think he dozed off
while driving or was driving drunk.

552
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,895
Has it been about 11 years
since he passed away?

553
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,932
Yes, I was an intern then.
It should've been around that time.

554
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,370
What is this? Did you come looking for him
already knowing he had passed away?

555
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,806
No, I didn't.

556
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,844
Hey, you.

557
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,546
What are you doing here?

558
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,048
What about you?

559
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,184
Did you look up articles?

560
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:46,490
So you only know
your father killed Min Jun-guk's wife.

561
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,359
But you don't know how, right?

562
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,460
Yes.

563
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,896
I suspect it was because
of the articles my father wrote,

564
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,197
but I'm not sure yet.

565
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,767
What did Min Jun-guk say when he met you?

566
00:38:56,867 --> 00:39:00,871
He said that no one listened to his story.

567
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,940
Not even the police were on his side.

568
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,943
He said no one was on his side.

569
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,179
And that's why he started all of this.

570
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:13,351
Do you think Min Jun-guk killed
Dr. Woo Seong-sik 11 years ago?

571
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:16,454
Well... I'll need to find out more,

572
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,389
but I have a bad feeling.

573
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,260
We'll have to see
what letters he sends us in the future.

574
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:25,963
You were scared just before.

575
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,998
Now you're looking into this yourself?

576
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,166
Yes.

577
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:35,373
I have to know Min Jun-guk's plan
to protect her properly.

578
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:38,642
I should get going.

579
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,211
Sure.

580
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:48,753
That squirt.
So he took my advice after all.

581
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,628
What time does the trial begin?

582
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:01,165
The trial starts at 11 a.m.
and we choose the jury at 9 a.m.

583
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,435
Then I should go to court by 11 a.m.
after cram school.

584
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:08,472
So I should read both the judge's
and jury's mind and tell you?

585
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,208
Yes.

586
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,212
Su-ha.

587
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,181
You don't have to come today.

588
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,818
-Why?
-I can't keep depending on you.

589
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:24,889
If I get used to it,
I won't be able to work on my own.

590
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:32,296
I can't keep relying on you
to win my trials.

591
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,064
I am a lawyer after all.

592
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,334
I'm going to try it on my own today.

593
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,470
Sure.

594
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,606
Don't worry. I can do it.

595
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,243
Didn't you see my last trial?
I did so well without your eyes.

596
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,580
My eyes aren't so bad after all. Let's go.

597
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:50,981
Okay.

598
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,989
The more I want you,

599
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,091
more than your spiteful words

600
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,160
and harsh words,

601
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,596
what you just said hurts me more.

602
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,567
Because it assumes I won't be
with you one day.

603
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,604
Why do you keep making such assumptions?

604
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,508
Aren't you coming?

605
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,178
I'm coming.

606
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,987
ELEVATOR TO THE COURTROOMS

607
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,507
So today is the day.

608
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,879
Will you be okay?

609
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,781
Yes. I'm fine.

610
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,187
Your eyes look swollen.

611
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,924
Yes.

612
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,595
I was up all night writing up the charges.

613
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,900
Are you really going to take part today
as a prosecutor?

614
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,468
Yes.

615
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,272
Whatever the case may be,

616
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,508
Hwang Dal-jung is still your birth father.

617
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:27,511
Stop it. You keep pointing that out.

618
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,914
Whatever you say,

619
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,050
to me, he's just a man
who attempted murder.

620
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:36,020
I never met him
and I have no memory of him.

621
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,454
Don't say he's my father

622
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,457
just because of one DNA test.

623
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,565
She's so spiteful.

624
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:49,033
She's worse than I am.

625
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,436
And that's not easy.

626
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,246
I can do this.

627
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:10,888
GEL ART

628
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,156
Hello--

629
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,893
What are you doing here?

630
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,661
I'm here as a customer.

631
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,898
"Basic care"?

632
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:23,167
You? Really?

633
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,369
Since I started working as a mechanic,

634
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,472
my hands are a mess.

635
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,142
I'm a customer, so don't be mean to me.

636
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,956
If someone tried to kill someone
he had killed 26 years ago,

637
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,992
would that be attempted murder or not?

638
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:51,128
The "Attempted Murder of a Ghost" trial...

639
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:54,565
-He tried killing a ghost?
-A ghost?

640
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,804
On July 3rd, 58-year-old
Mr. Hwang was at a hospital in Yeonju,

641
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:04,908
where he stabbed 54-year-old Ms. Son
and is now charged with attempted murder.

642
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,213
At the time of the incident, Mr. Hwang
was serving a 26-year prison sentence

643
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:12,616
but was released on parole
because of a brain tumor.

644
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,953
Mr. Hwang's attorneys are claiming
that Ms. Son

645
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,023
-is the same person that Mr. Hwang...
-You'll make my face look big like that!

646
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,458
had allegedly killed 26 years ago.

647
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:26,296
They are arguing he cannot be tried again
for the same crime.

648
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,933
The prosecution is contending
the defense's claims are baseless,

649
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:35,572
and that Mr. Hwang is clearly guilty
since his crime was caught on camera.

650
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,242
If it is found that Ms. Son
is, in fact, Ms. Jeon,

651
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:42,613
the same person from 26 years ago
as the defense asserts,

652
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:46,417
then this case is about attempting
to murder a legally dead person.

653
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,220
Thus, the outcome
of this case will be watched closely.

654
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:56,660
He served 26 years for killing his wife,
but she was still alive?

655
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,829
He wasted his life for nothing then.

656
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,298
So that's why he stabbed his wife?

657
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:06,136
I can't believe this.

658
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,706
But does it make sense?

659
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:11,141
He was already punished
for killing a person.

660
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,845
How can he be punished again
for stabbing that same person?

661
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,214
But those are different cases.

662
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,150
He stabbed a person who was alive.

663
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:24,021
No, he stabbed someone
who was already dead.

664
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:29,226
Oh... So that's why it's called
the "Attempted Murder of a Ghost" case.

665
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:32,162
He didn't stab a living person,
but a dead one.

666
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,931
JURY TRIAL
DEFENDANT: HWANG DAL-JUNG

667
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,866
Twenty-six years ago,

668
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,836
after the defendant killed his wife
and dismembered and concealed her body,

669
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,573
he was sentenced to life imprisonment
and was serving that sentence.

670
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,043
But because of a malignant brain tumor,
he was released on parole.

671
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,046
As soon as he got out,
he attempted to murder someone.

672
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:54,284
The day after he was released on parole,

673
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:59,623
around 11:40 p.m. on July 3rd, 2013,

674
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,627
the defendant saw the victim,
who had no left hand, at Sepung Hospital.

675
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,103
In that moment when he saw the wife

676
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:19,276
that he had supposedly killed 26 years ago
was still alive,

677
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:22,613
he stabbed Son Chae-ok's neck
with a piece of a broken vase.

678
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,749
And he damaged her throat and airway.

679
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:33,023
Accordingly, pursuant to Article 250,
section 1,

680
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,526
and Article 254 of the Penal Code,

681
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:39,196
we are charging the defendant
with attempted murder.

682
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,398
DEFENDANT

683
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,404
Defendant.

684
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,474
Did you hear the charges?

685
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,075
Yes.

686
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:55,579
Do you admit to the charges?

687
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,616
I admit that I stabbed that person.

688
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,422
But I'm innocent.

689
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,592
JURY

690
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:14,665
I understand.

691
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,501
Counsel, your opening statement.

692
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,209
I defended the defendant 26 years ago

693
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:29,947
in the "Left-Hand Murder Case."

694
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:36,119
Twenty-six years ago,
the defendant was found guilty

695
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:39,756
for murdering his wife
and hiding the body,

696
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:42,826
and he had been serving a prison sentence
until very recently.

697
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:47,698
And through this case today,

698
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:50,534
he learned the verdict
from 26 years ago was wrong!

699
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:56,940
Mr. Hwang learned he had served 26 years
in jail for no reason.

700
00:47:57,007 --> 00:48:03,413
The defendant already served 26 years
for something he didn't do.

701
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:10,487
And he is here for stabbing the person
he presumed had been dead.

702
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:13,924
The prosecution is arguing

703
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:18,128
that the wife from 26 years ago,
Jeon Young-ja,

704
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:21,298
is not the same person

705
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:24,468
as the victim Son Chae-ok.

706
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:30,941
But through a variety of evidence,
we will prove they are the same person.

707
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:36,280
Also, as he has already served
the sentence for murder,

708
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:39,149
punishing him again
when he's already served

709
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:42,119
would be double jeopardy,
so the case should be dismissed.

710
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:45,622
This means,
because the defendant is being tried again

711
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,292
for the same crime
of which he was already convicted,

712
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:52,195
we assert that the defendant
cannot be punished again.

713
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,837
But, how did he know the wife
who had died 26 years ago,

714
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:04,074
and the one he stabbed
were the same person?

715
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,376
Of course he knew.

716
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,879
Though 26 years have passed,
would he not recognize his own wife?

717
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:10,881
But both of them have no left hands.

718
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,250
But is that enough to say
they're the same person?

719
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,185
We cannot say that it is enough.

720
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:19,222
The defense is arguing
that the victim has no left hand.

721
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:23,427
And they have DNA test results
for the defendant, victim, and daughter.

722
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,662
But the mere fact
that they both lack left hands

723
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:29,733
does not prove the victim is the wife.

724
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,868
And the daughter's DNA,

725
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,204
in the absence of clearly identifying
who she is,

726
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,940
cannot be accepted as evidence.

727
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,746
You're dead, Grass Hair.

728
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:51,488
Their daughter didn't know she was adopted
and lived a peaceful life.

729
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,525
For the sake of convenience,
we'll call the daughter, "Shim-cheong."

730
00:49:56,259 --> 00:50:02,032
Shim-cheong asked that her identity
not be revealed at this trial.

731
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,602
So that is
why we cannot reveal her identity.

732
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:09,673
Please take a look at the screen.

733
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,948
If you look at the test result,

734
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,384
Shim-cheong and Hwang Dal-jung

735
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:24,187
are a 99.99999997% match.

736
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:28,658
And, with the victim, Son Chae-ok,

737
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:32,963
it's also a 99.99999997% match,

738
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:36,266
thus confirming a blood relationship.

739
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,737
This means,
that the defendant, Hwang Dal-jung,

740
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:43,440
and the victim, Son Chae-ok, were married.

741
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,209
And this is evidence of that.

742
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,822
Okay, I'll admit that.
Let's say they were married.

743
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:02,092
What's that got to do with this?
In any case, he stabbed a person.

744
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,330
Hey! Why did you hit me?

745
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,934
This is for telling the police
about Su-ha's locker a year ago.

746
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,903
You already hit me for that.

747
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:16,173
See? You get mad when you're hit again.

748
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,741
It's the same for him.

749
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,844
He's already served his time,
but he's going to be punished again.

750
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,047
How can this be the same as that?

751
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,349
It can't be the same.

752
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,486
There is a law
against double jeopardy in Korea.

753
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,555
If a person has already been convicted
for a crime,

754
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:34,958
then he cannot be prosecuted twice
under this legal principle.

755
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:41,765
But this case and the one
from 26 years ago are not the same case.

756
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,836
The times, places, and charges differ
in each case.

757
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,573
The methods he used were different
and the result is also

758
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,374
different.

759
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:57,647
The only things that are the same are
the defendant and victim.

760
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:01,985
It's hard to say that it is the same case
because of that.

761
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:15,932
Twenty-six years ago,
the court sentenced the defendant

762
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:21,204
to life imprisonment for murder,
corpse mutilation, and concealment.

763
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:29,946
With that verdict, Son Chae-ok
was declared legally deceased.

764
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:36,086
In other words, the defendant
stabbed a dead person, a ghost.

765
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,689
Must he be charged

766
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:44,294
with attempted murder
for stabbing a ghost?

767
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,970
The victim he thought was dead
was actually alive.

768
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:56,706
And it is regrettable

769
00:52:56,907 --> 00:53:00,143
that he had to serve a sentence
for something he did not do.

770
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:06,416
But his innocence should be proven
through a retrial.

771
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:10,687
This attempted murder case, though it has
the same victim, is totally separate.

772
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:14,324
So defense counsel cannot argue
for dismissal.

773
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:24,901
It's too late to prove his innocence
through a retrial.

774
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:30,006
Unfortunately,
the defendant has a terminal brain tumor

775
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,242
and does not have much longer to live.

776
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:37,714
A month to us

777
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,351
would feel like
a year or ten years to him.

778
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:46,056
Not only is a retrial difficult to file
for in Korea,

779
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:50,393
but it also takes a very long time
to reopen a case even if we do file.

780
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,896
The defendant

781
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,968
might have to spend the rest of his life
waiting for it.

782
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:08,411
Next will be
the questioning of the defendant.

783
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:20,624
WITNESS

784
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,794
Your Honor,

785
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:27,864
I would like to say something
before the questioning begins.

786
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,367
Will it take long?

787
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,801
No.

788
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:34,504
It won't take long.

789
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:38,975
Will everything I say be on the record?

790
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:42,345
Yes, it will.
It is being voice recorded, too.

791
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:49,619
It's about my daughter, Shim-cheong,
who took the DNA test for me.

792
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,457
I would like to thank Shim-cheong.

793
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,160
I don't know who she is,

794
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,996
or where she lives,

795
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,232
but I hope

796
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,935
she continues to live a happy life.

797
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:09,339
I just wanted to say that.

798
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,842
That's all.

799
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,183
Okay.

800
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,485
Please proceed, Prosecutor.

801
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:23,953
Yes.

802
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,428
Defendant.

803
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,364
Defendant, last July 3rd,

804
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:37,701
you happened to run into Son Chae-ok
at Sepung Hospital, correct?

805
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,336
Yes.

806
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:43,640
Did you attack Son Chae-ok

807
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:46,009
with the intention to kill her?

808
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,878
No.

809
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,716
THEN WHY DID YOU STAB HER
IN THE VITAL AREAS?

810
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,187
YOU HATED YOUR WIFE WHO CHEATED
ON YOU 26 YEARS AGO.

811
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:10,900
The victim is currently unconscious.

812
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,802
You do know

813
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:16,272
that you'll be charged with murder
if the victim dies, right?

814
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,175
-Objection! The victim is still alive!
-Objection! The victim is still alive!

815
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:26,916
Prosecution,
please restrain from speculation.

816
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,385
Yes.

817
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:34,257
No further questions.

818
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:39,662
Is that everything?

819
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,432
Yes.

820
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,382
Why did you skip all the questions?

821
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,153
Because they would all be objected to
like just now.

822
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:14,364
What did the victim, Son Chae-ok, no--
Jeon Young-ja say to you at the hospital?

823
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:19,335
She made excuses for making me
into a murderer 26 years ago.

824
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:21,304
What was her reason?

825
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,540
She said hated me.

826
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,475
And my debt.

827
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:29,312
She wanted to live as someone else's wife.

828
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,247
And she didn't want

829
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,287
to raise my daughter with a pile of debt.

830
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:43,893
That's why she cut off her own hand

831
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,963
and sent me off to prison.

832
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:52,936
And, she said it was better
that I go to jail than flee from debt.

833
00:57:56,306 --> 00:58:00,677
So you picked up the broken vase

834
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,813
because her words agitated you.

835
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,014
Yes.

836
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,153
Okay.

837
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:18,094
Is this the piece of broken vase
that you used to attack the victim?

838
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:20,363
Yes.

839
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:24,567
There must have been bigger pieces
of the vase.

840
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:27,170
So why did you choose such a small piece?

841
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:29,939
I just picked up whatever was around me.

842
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:31,708
PROSECUTOR

843
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:36,980
As you just heard, the defendant had
no intention of killing the victim.

844
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:39,249
This was an accident.

845
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,018
No further questions.

846
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:51,794
Members of the jury,
you must be tired from the long trial.

847
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:56,866
We will take a brief recess
and reconvene at 4:00 p.m.

848
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:14,617
Father. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

849
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:25,595
Hey, did you see the jury?
How many are on our side?

850
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:28,364
What? I thought you didn't need me.

851
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:31,467
That's still true.

852
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,703
But now that you're here,
tell me the vote.

853
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,306
That's not important. About Seo Do-yeon...

854
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,309
Don't even mention her.

855
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,312
You asked me to let her off so I did,
but she's a robot.

856
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:44,814
She didn't even blink
when she attacks her father...

857
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,316
I don't think it's like that.

858
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,251
What?

859
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,688
I think Hwang Dal-jung knows
that Seo Do-yeon is his daughter.

860
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:55,091
Really? How did he know?

861
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:10,940
Seo Dae-seok's daughter is the prosecutor
in my trial.

862
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:14,010
I have such a tenacious relationship

863
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:16,312
with your family.

864
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:17,647
So tenacious...

865
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,516
Why did you come to see me?

866
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:27,156
My father will never apologize
for the trial from 26 years ago.

867
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:31,260
If that's what you want,
you should give up on that.

868
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:33,062
Did you come to tell me that?

869
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:36,065
Then I don't want to hear you out.

870
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,234
I'm sorry.

871
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:41,237
I am very sorry.

872
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:44,841
I'll apologize on his behalf.

873
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,409
Why are you apologizing?

874
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:51,014
I'm sure my father regrets
that verdict, too.

875
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:53,650
That's probably why with me...

876
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:55,718
"With me"?

877
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:04,060
My father is too obstinate
to admit he's wrong.

878
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:07,730
That's how he's lived his life.

879
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,433
So, I'll apologize instead.

880
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,136
Please forgive him.

881
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,975
I'll see you in court tomorrow.

882
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:24,213
In court, I will not be
Judge Seo Dae-seok's daughter.

883
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,150
I'll be a prosecutor.

884
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:29,952
You...

885
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:33,389
How old are you?

886
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,293
Twenty-nine years old.

887
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:40,830
By chance...

888
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:44,200
Are you Ga-yeon?

889
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,606
No.

890
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:53,242
I'm Seo Do-yeon.

891
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,497
Seo Do-yeon. What's wrong?

892
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,233
Hye-seong.

893
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:52,769
I...

894
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:54,604
I feel as if I'm going to die.

895
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:00,843
Help me.

896
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:05,248
Please save my dad.

897
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,326
