1
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,334
Fortunately, her organs were not
damaged too much.

2
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,805
But there was a lot of bleeding,
so she should stay hospitalized.

3
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:40,940
Yes, I understand.

4
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,910
Shouldn't you report this to the police?

5
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,846
It looks like a stab wound.

6
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,283
I will take care of that.

7
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,275
Are you awake? Are you okay?

8
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:20,346
What happened to me?

9
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,883
The surgery was successful
and you are doing okay now.

10
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,252
I see.

11
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,128
What about Su-ha? Where is Su-ha?

12
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,530
Stay still. You shouldn't move.

13
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,365
Where's Su-ha?

14
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,602
Stay still. You shouldn't move.

15
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:46,406
Ms. Jjang. Please.

16
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,110
I don't know if I could've stopped it.

17
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,681
If I had known what Su-ha was thinking.

18
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,984
If I had known
about the hints that were there.

19
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,620
This wouldn't have happened.

20
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,492
Su-ha always listened to my voice.

21
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:10,363
But I couldn't hear his voice
when it was needed.

22
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:23,910
THREE DAYS AGO

23
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,579
-You can see.
-I can't.

24
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:30,450
If you lie in court,
you'll get additional punishment.

25
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,254
I'm not lying.
I lost my sight in an accident.

26
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:39,192
Is that why you harassed women on the bus?

27
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,960
And you chose the underage girls, too.

28
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,263
They're lying to get compensation from me.

29
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,232
It's bad enough that I'm blind,
but they're treating me like a pervert.

30
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,701
How can they do this to me?

31
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,704
You say you're blind.

32
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,841
But you texted with your phone
and got caught speeding, too.

33
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,509
You even washed your car.

34
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,178
It must've been someone else.

35
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,184
Are you going to keep lying to me?

36
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,188
Hey, are you a prosecutor?
You're a public defender!

37
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,890
A public defender should be on my side
no matter what!

38
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,625
Why should I side with a sexual offender?

39
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,663
What? "Sexual offender"?
I know the law well enough.

40
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,932
I'm innocent until proven guilty.

41
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,200
Don't you call me a criminal!

42
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,602
You must be referring
to the presumption of innocence.

43
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,306
That is what makes this
such a lawless world!

44
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,446
Is she saying that for Mr. Cha to hear?

45
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,647
Hey!

46
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,654
Don't mind it too much.
You only did your job.

47
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,025
Tomorrow is Min Jun-guk's sentencing,
right?

48
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,061
Yes.

49
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,969
Hey, hey. Are you crazy?

50
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,370
Do you want to die?

51
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:00,073
Hold me like that. I think I can see it.

52
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,211
What do you see?

53
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,550
-Can you see that?
-Yes. A little more.

54
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,922
"If I were...

55
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,960
to disappear"...

56
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,698
What does he mean? "Disappear"?

57
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,810
Why do you have your bag?
Are you skipping classes again?

58
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:38,945
Yes.

59
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,616
It doesn't concern you.

60
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,385
Of course it does.

61
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,453
You're ruining the class mood.

62
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,589
Then you can go tell the teacher.

63
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,727
I was going to.

64
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,933
What? You told me to tell him.

65
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,139
This might be the last time,
so let me give you some advice.

66
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,576
If you like Seong-bin,
you should tell her yourself.

67
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,712
And stop picking fights with me.

68
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,051
What are you talking about?
I don't like her!

69
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,919
I have really high standards!

70
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,056
He must be really crazy.

71
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,059
Hey, Su-ha must be crazy.

72
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,097
Hey. What did Su-ha say to you?

73
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,767
He said you're really fat and ugly.

74
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:38,805
He said a tiger could live off you
for 100 days. Satisfied?

75
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,157
What?

76
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,228
I wondered who was following me.
Was it you?

77
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,629
How did you know?

78
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,532
I was with the police. This is nothing.

79
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,336
Are you a good fighter?

80
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,340
Why do you ask?

81
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,310
He said that he is
a certified taekwondo senior.

82
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,947
He said he doesn't like me. Could he...

83
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:00,953
I don't want to fight you.
I have a favor to ask of you.

84
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,625
A favor? What favor?

85
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,232
Is this your last night in here?

86
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:19,238
I have to wait for the verdict.
How can I know what will happen?

87
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,410
If the judge believes I'm innocent,
I'll be released.

88
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,447
They said you'll be found innocent
because you got a good lawyer.

89
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,015
All the guards said so.

90
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,485
Yes, I was lucky.

91
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,730
Anyway, kid.
How are you going to welcome me?

92
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:20,199
ATTORNEYS SELECTED
FOR YEONJU PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

93
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,375
Su-ha!

94
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,277
What are you doing here?

95
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,279
I came to go to school with you.

96
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,481
Why aren't you in your uniform?

97
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,185
I'm not going to school.
You should go alone.

98
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,989
-Where are you going?
-You don't need to know.

99
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,294
Ko Seong-bin!

100
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,131
What are you doing? Give it back.

101
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,500
No, let's go to school together.

102
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,307
What is this? It feels like a knife.

103
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,343
Give it back.

104
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,713
What is that in your bag?

105
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,049
It's nothing.

106
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:13,486
Don't make assumptions
and don't tell anyone.

107
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,590
I don't know enough to tell anyone.

108
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,893
Where are you going?
What are you going to do?

109
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:45,117
I would like to tell you
this was a very hard decision to make.

110
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,588
Will the defendant please rise.

111
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:58,264
Min Jun-guk was indicted for

112
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:02,034
hitting the victim, Ms. Eo Chun-sim,
in the head to make her pass out

113
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:05,605
and covered it up as an accidental fire

114
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:09,642
on June 9, 2012, at her chicken shop
in Seongmu City, Myeongwol-dong.

115
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:15,047
The victim was the mother of a witness
who testified against him.

116
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,750
And right
before the security camera was broken,

117
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,987
the defendant was seen
near the crime scene.

118
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,123
It is true there's suspicion he did it.

119
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:29,428
However, if the defendant had planned
to hurt the victim,

120
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:35,668
it's hard to understand
why he got along so well with her.

121
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,404
And the fractures of the victim's skull

122
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:44,710
could have been caused
when she collapsed from arrhythmia.

123
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:51,250
The defendant was hurt
while trying to save the victim.

124
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,853
If he had started the fire
with the intent to kill,

125
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,423
he wouldn't have risked becoming a suspect

126
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,293
and would not have taken such actions.

127
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,631
There is no room for rational suspicion.

128
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:10,503
It's hard to be sure the defendant
committed such a crime.

129
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:18,144
When in doubt, it's the principle
to rule in favor of the defendant.

130
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,948
Thus, according to Article 325
of the Penal Code,

131
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,753
the defendant is found not guilty.

132
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,608
Thank you. You saved me.

133
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,412
It was nothing.
You will be released from jail soon.

134
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,714
Thank you.

135
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,950
Thank you so much.

136
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,132
Ms. Jjang. Ms. Jjang.

137
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,203
Please talk to me.
I know it's hard for you.

138
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,605
I know you must resent me.

139
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,074
But I don't want to lose you like this.

140
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,044
What should I do?
What can I do to make this right?

141
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,378
I'll do anything!

142
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,715
Don't do anything.

143
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,753
I need someone to resent right now.

144
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,255
If not, I will resent myself.

145
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:44,463
So don't do anything
so I can keep hating you.

146
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,166
Don't do anything.

147
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,334
Mom.

148
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,740
Mom.

149
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:44,483
Pastor.

150
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,685
-Let's get going.
-Yes.

151
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,108
I'm sorry.

152
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,046
I don't know what to say.

153
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,849
If you're sorry,
don't ever be used like that again.

154
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,387
-Did Ms. Seo contact you again?
-Yes.

155
00:15:56,155 --> 00:16:00,726
She asked if I can testify
when she appeals.

156
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,728
Don't do it.

157
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:06,332
Even if you do, it will only hurt you.

158
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,802
But I feel really bad.

159
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,838
Ms. Seo is Seo Dae-seok's daughter.

160
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,542
Who?

161
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:21,146
The judge who put you
behind bars 25 years ago.

162
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,353
So don't ever get involved
with them again.

163
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:40,799
Does that mean the murderer was acquitted?

164
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,701
-Because of lack of evidence?
-Yes.

165
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,873
But I'm going to appeal.
I won't let him get away.

166
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,143
Why did the witness change his testimony?

167
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,246
He shut down because he was scared
by the public defender.

168
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,117
-But if I talk to him again--
-Stop it.

169
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,220
That witness
has already been contaminated.

170
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,755
I still want to try again.

171
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,258
If not Hwang Dal-jung,
I'll find another inmate.

172
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,898
-Who?
-What?

173
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,300
Hwang Dal-jung.

174
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:20,773
Was Min Jun-guk's cellmate Hwang Dal-jung?

175
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,710
Hwang Dal-jung?
I've heard that name before.

176
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,178
Who was it?

177
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,715
Back off from that case.
The sentence has been given.

178
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,950
It's left your hands now.

179
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:35,754
-But it's Hye-seong's--
-Do as you are told.

180
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,517
What is this?

181
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,754
I don't know.
It was something you asked for.

182
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,189
It came by delivery.

183
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,491
Information I asked for?

184
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,595
SEOUL DISTRICT COURT

185
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,197
It came too late.

186
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,566
What is it?

187
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,703
It's the case of Park Ju-hyeok
from ten years ago.

188
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,074
The first case that
Min Jun-guk was tried for?

189
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,443
Yes.

190
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,314
You should go. I need to read this.

191
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:36,949
Sure.

192
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,862
I took a photo of him
hitting the man with the pipe.

193
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,064
Can't this be used as evidence?

194
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,339
I said I would kill you if you spoke!

195
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:04,676
I said I would kill you
and those you talked to!

196
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,748
I'm going to keep my promise!

197
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,684
I'm going to kill you!

198
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:17,189
Don't think this is the end.
This is only the beginning!

199
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,399
I have a favor to ask of you.

200
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,867
What favor?

201
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,671
If Min Jun-guk is found innocent,
please protect Ms. Jjang.

202
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,239
What?

203
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,709
Ms. Jjang will be the first person
he will target when he gets out.

204
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:43,949
I don't believe Min Jun-guk would do
something like that.

205
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,989
What if he really does go after her?

206
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,426
You're not 100 percent sure, right?

207
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,963
You think that I could be right.

208
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,186
Use a cup.

209
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,672
Put them on a lower shelf.
You have short arms.

210
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,574
This is nice.

211
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,478
I was getting tired of his nagging.

212
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,949
Good riddance.

213
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,525
What a jerk.

214
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,795
Why did he have to leave now?

215
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,100
What is that?

216
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,218
Hello? Is this the police?

217
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:13,665
Ms. Jjang.

218
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:21,973
Ms. Jjang.

219
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,878
Are you okay? What happened here?

220
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,880
What are you doing here?

221
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,849
Who is this man?

222
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,752
He's a public defender
who works at the same office as me.

223
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,492
It's a smoke bomb used
to kill cockroaches.

224
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:43,128
"Smoke bomb"? Anything else?

225
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,030
We'll have to wait
for the smoke to get out.

226
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,333
Did you see who did this, Ms. Jang?

227
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,737
No, not at all.

228
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,441
Maybe Min Jun-guk did it,
just like Park Su-ha said.

229
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,612
Did you meet Park Su-ha yesterday?

230
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:01,947
Yes.

231
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:05,517
Yes, he came
by our police station yesterday.

232
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,652
He asked us to make more rounds

233
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:11,289
because Min Jun-guk might try to hurt her
when he gets out.

234
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,526
We'll need to find out
where Min Jun-guk is first.

235
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,030
I'll stay here with her.
Please check the security videos.

236
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,232
Witnesses, too.

237
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:24,202
And see if he left anything
in the garbage.

238
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,773
If Min Jun-guk did this,
he could come back again.

239
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,641
So please increase patrols.

240
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,610
-Yes.
-Yes.

241
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,483
Let's get out of here.

242
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,252
Let's go to the office.

243
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,387
Okay.

244
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,195
Hold on. Who was that guy?

245
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,731
-Why is he acting like the police?
-I don't know.

246
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,368
We need to find Min Jun-guk
before something else happens.

247
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,936
Please get in.

248
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:23,228
Hello, kid. I was about to call you.

249
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:29,334
If I read your mind correctly,
I was supposed to call you.

250
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:31,870
Where are you?

251
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,497
The number you have dialed...

252
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,969
Why isn't he answering his phone?

253
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,305
Did you meet him?

254
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:12,010
Yes, he came to see me.
He wanted to ask a favor.

255
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:14,713
What favor?

256
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:18,483
He said Min Jun-guk might do something
if he gets out.

257
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,952
He asked me to protect you.

258
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,827
What is he thinking?

259
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,764
KO SEONG-BIN

260
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,435
Seong-bin? Did you meet Su-ha today?

261
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,937
Briefly in the morning.

262
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,439
You don't know where he is either?

263
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,009
No.

264
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:48,513
-I'm scared.
-Of what?

265
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:53,385
Su-ha didn't come to school
and said he had to go somewhere.

266
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,187
So I took his bag to stop him from going,

267
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,058
but there was something strange
in his bag.

268
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,695
What was it?

269
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:06,865
A knife.

270
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,001
Not for sharpening pencils.
It was a big one.

271
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,371
I don't know what he's going to do
with it.

272
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:21,279
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?

273
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,115
I'll find Su-ha. So don't worry.

274
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,253
I'll call you later. Bye.

275
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,090
So...

276
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:38,129
Don't even think about seeking vengeance
on Min Jun-guk.

277
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,698
Okay?

278
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,671
What are you doing? Answer me quickly.

279
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,411
What if Min Jun-guk tries to hurt you?

280
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,584
-Where are you going?
-I have to find Su-ha.

281
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:06,758
Ms. Jjang! Do you know where he is?

282
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,260
No, but I have to find him quickly.

283
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,029
-If not--
-Let's call the police first.

284
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,565
-We'll tell them to look for Su-ha--
-No!

285
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,600
Not the police.

286
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,169
What are you thinking?

287
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,038
Why can't we call the police?

288
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,108
Give me your phone.

289
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,176
I'm downloading a location-finder app.

290
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:26,745
What is that?

291
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,949
If we both have this,
we can tell where the other is.

292
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,017
Really?

293
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,691
LOCATION FINDER
SU-HA

294
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,454
Min Jun-guk! Come out.

295
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,057
Is that you?

296
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,062
You came alone.

297
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,065
You've become very brave, kid.

298
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,801
What's the girl doing?

299
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:26,204
She's with the police
so don't even think about it.

300
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,040
This is the end for you.

301
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,443
Don't be too sure of yourself.

302
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,179
I could survive.

303
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,548
I don't care.

304
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:42,253
If you're the one who survives,
that means you're a murderer.

305
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,623
You won't be able to get out of this one.

306
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,359
I feel the same way.

307
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,596
If you die, she will be in pain.

308
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,133
And if I die, you'll be a murderer.

309
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,736
And that would be just as painful for her.

310
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,238
I don't care which case it is.

311
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,774
Stop talking and come out!

312
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,978
I thought about it.

313
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,181
I wouldn't be able to win
if we fought fairly.

314
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:13,451
There's no way I can beat your talent.

315
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:19,791
To make things fair,
shouldn't I have an advantage, too?

316
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,680
I kept my eyes closed until now.

317
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:47,986
So I'm used to the dark
and I can see you very well.

318
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,990
But you probably can't see me.

319
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,918
-Is this it?
-Yes.

320
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,526
I can't tell which floor he's on.

321
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,197
-I'll go this way.
-It's dangerous on your own.

322
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,865
Finding Su-ha is more urgent.

323
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,735
You jerk!

324
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:15,366
Are you really going to kill me?

325
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,038
Then you'll become a murderer.

326
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,073
I don't care.

327
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:27,145
You have to die, for her to live.

328
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,181
Yes.

329
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:37,388
Come. This is interesting.

330
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,358
You should become a murderer, too.

331
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,127
And live a life at the bottom.

332
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,130
Just like me!

333
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,862
You fool.

334
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,298
I told you.

335
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:26,838
If you kill him,
you're no longer a victim, but a murderer.

336
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,042
You never listen to me.

337
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:50,428
Why? Why did you do that?

338
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,432
Su-ha!

339
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,192
Die! You should die.

340
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,875
Stop it, Su-ha!

341
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,633
Ms. Jjang. Where are you?

342
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,471
Ms. Jjang! Park Su-ha!

343
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:08,673
Answer me!

344
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,580
Don't tell anyone. Never.

345
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:21,285
You didn't stab me. Min Jun-guk did. Okay?

346
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:27,625
If you don't do as I say,
I will never see you again.

347
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,363
No.

348
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,634
Please get up.

349
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:44,809
Park Su-ha!

350
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,378
Su-ha!

351
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,404
Ms. Jjang.

352
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:18,042
Where are you, Ms. Jjang?
Answer me, Jang Hye-seong!

353
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,143
Ms. Jjang!

354
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,014
Ms. Jjang! Answer me!

355
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,155
Help us. Please.

356
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,595
Ms. Jjang.

357
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,232
Ms. Jjang. Please get up, please.

358
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,634
Ms. Jjang.

359
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:48,973
The squad is getting to the crime scene.

360
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,382
IN SURGERY

361
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,872
Fortunately, her organs were not
damaged too much.

362
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:05,910
But there was a lot of bleeding,
so she should stay hospitalized.

363
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,678
Yes, I understand.

364
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,748
Shouldn't you report this to the police?

365
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,484
It looks like a stab wound.

366
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,887
I will take care of that.

367
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,236
Are you awake? Are you okay?

368
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,472
What happened to me?

369
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:38,309
The surgery was successful
and you are doing okay now.

370
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,678
I see.

371
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,653
What about Su-ha? Where is Su-ha?

372
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,156
Stay still. You shouldn't move.

373
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,724
Where's Su-ha?

374
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,994
Stay still. You shouldn't move.

375
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,798
Ms. Jjang. Please.

376
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,970
Su-ha disappeared after that.

377
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:11,208
Yes, I can't get in contact with Su-ha.

378
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,344
I don't know where he is either.

379
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,647
You should come to Korea and--

380
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,953
I know you're busy.
But you're his guardian.

381
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:28,426
Aren't you the one
who took Su-ha's father's insurance money?

382
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,195
You call yourself a guardian
just because you send him pocket money?

383
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,731
How can he be like this?

384
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,568
I was finally able to reach Su-ha's uncle.

385
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,338
But he was less interested
in how Su-has was doing than others were.

386
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,944
Su-ha did not have any proper family.

387
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:55,386
Nor did he have many proper friends.

388
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,928
WANTED

389
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,766
Min Jun-guk was wanted
for attempted murder

390
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,534
and retaliatory crime.

391
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,508
And to prepare
for any retaliation he might perform,

392
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:18,909
they added patrols around my house.

393
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,047
Mr. Cha quit being a public defender.

394
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,382
I'll come to get my other stuff later.

395
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,285
Is this because of the Min Jun-guk case?

396
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,788
-That's not a reason.
-Of course it is.

397
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:35,793
I hurt Ms. Jjang with my words.

398
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,195
What more reason do you need?

399
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:42,233
So you're taking responsibility
by running away?

400
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,169
I'm sorry.

401
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,573
That's the kind of person I am.

402
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,376
What are you going to do for a living?

403
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,813
You're a little too old to start over.

404
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,850
I'll help with my father's business.

405
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:05,589
And I'll take my time looking
for something I can do.

406
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,293
I'll come visit here and there.

407
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:29,547
And we heard about Su-ha
and Min Jun-guk unexpectedly.

408
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,259
What?

409
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,965
It's a human hand!

410
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,638
This door is a little too stiff.

411
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:57,007
They're all stiff in the beginning, ma'am.

412
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,677
So you should install one
that isn't stiff.

413
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,579
And I'm not a "ma'am."

414
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,814
Okay.

415
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:07,484
Around 9:00 p.m. yesterday,
at an indoor fishing area in Yeonju,

416
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:12,089
a left hand that seemed to be part
of a chopped up body was found.

417
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,859
The fingerprints on the hand were tested

418
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:20,230
and the victim is Mr. Min,
who is wanted for attempted murder.

419
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:26,604
The police believe his body is very
decomposed and are searching for it.

420
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,007
The knife, which is the murder weapon,
the suspect's phone,

421
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:33,277
and some hair strands have been sent
for analysis.

422
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,512
On to our next news.

423
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,157
YEONJU POLICE STATION

424
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,427
I know! I do!

425
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,597
I know it's hard
to find Min Jun-guk's body.

426
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,134
Search the whole reservoir if you have to!

427
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:02,506
Who are you?

428
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,942
I'm Public Defender Jang Hye-seong.

429
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:08,178
I was also Park Su-ha's guardian before.

430
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:09,713
Park Su...

431
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:14,084
You should've been a better guardian then.
He killed a man, you know?

432
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,586
Do you have proof?

433
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,756
Do you have it on video?
Why do you think he did it?

434
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,324
It could be someone else.

435
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,828
You talk really fast. Please sit down.

436
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:31,335
Here. Look at this.

437
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,105
Who could say someone else did it?

438
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:39,643
Park Su-ha has reason to hate him
and he has the motivation to do it.

439
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,579
And he's the last person
to talk to Min Jun-guk.

440
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:47,051
And the fingerprints all over the scene
and on the knife are his, too.

441
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:52,923
Isn't that enough to think
that Park Su-ha killed Min Jun-guk?

442
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,428
Are you looking for Su-ha?

443
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,363
We'll put him on the wanted list.

444
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,934
If he contacts you,
tell him to give himself up.

445
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,715
It wasn't a dream.

446
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,685
It wasn't a dream.

447
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:28,225
I won't do what you're worried about.

448
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,829
I will keep that promise.

449
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,765
Please believe me.

450
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,504
Yes, it wasn't a dream.

451
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,910
And Su-ha will keep that promise.

452
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,954
This is his class.

453
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,495
Do you know which locker is Park Su-ha's?

454
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,630
Su-ha? His is--

455
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,633
He doesn't have one.
He doesn't use a locker.

456
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,638
It's the one on the right end.

457
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,544
It just says his name. It's not his.

458
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,515
What? It's empty.

459
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:26,550
What a relief.

460
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:29,586
That mother...

461
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,190
Hey, Kim Chung-gi!

462
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:40,731
How can you snitch
on your friend to the police?

463
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,134
-What?
-You're dead.

464
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:48,372
-Here. Hold still.
-Stop!

465
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,109
You! Come here.

466
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,719
Why is the office so empty?

467
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:06,290
Mr. Shin has a trial.

468
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,059
And Yu-chang has gone to make copies.

469
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:14,932
-Has Su-ha contacted you?
-No, he hasn't.

470
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,704
Half of me wants to find him
so I can see him.

471
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:24,007
But half of me wants him
to be hiding forever.

472
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,978
Don't you miss him? You said you like him.

473
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,849
I do like him and I miss him, too.

474
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,352
But he'll go to jail if he gets caught.

475
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,356
Do you think Su-ha is a murderer?

476
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,460
What about you?

477
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,163
I don't think so.

478
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:50,968
No, it's not that I don't think so.

479
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,939
He is not a murderer.
I'm sure of it, 100%.

480
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:00,544
You're much smarter than me,
so you must be right.

481
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,350
It's done. Don't type yet.

482
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:07,818
Okay.

483
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,298
I have something to give you.

484
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:29,406
This.

485
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:32,910
What is this?

486
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,146
I think Su-ha wanted to give it to you,
but didn't get a chance to.

487
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,881
A doll, for me?

488
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,818
It doesn't suit me.
Are you sure it's for me?

489
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:47,391
It's for you. I'm sure of it, 100 percent.

490
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,277
Ms. Jjang. Good job.

491
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:09,947
What is this sound?

492
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,182
It's Su-ha's voice.

493
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:18,088
What is this? It's a doll that talks.

494
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,992
Ms. Jjang. Good job.

495
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,161
What did I do well?

496
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,533
So do you regret working
with her to prove them guilty?

497
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:36,473
No, but it feels really bad somehow.

498
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,808
It's as if...

499
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:40,877
I wiped my rear with a dirty paper towel.

500
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,583
Did you have to say that when I'm eating?

501
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,322
Please tell me that I was right ten times.

502
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:54,791
You're being childish.

503
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:06,336
Ms. Jjang. Good job.

504
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,440
Ms. Jjang. Good job.

505
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,412
Jerk. You never watch your tone.

506
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,452
Ms. Jjang. Good job.

507
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,625
Ms. Jjang. Good job.

508
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:45,042
ONE YEAR LATER

509
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:59,216
So if your license gets revoked,
you won't be able to make a living.

510
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,552
That's why you want to go to trial, right?

511
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,824
I really didn't do anything
to get any penalty points.

512
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:12,896
-But to go to trial...
-I can't afford a lawyer.

513
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:16,166
Don't you worry. There are free lawyers.

514
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,136
-Free lawyers?
-Yes.

515
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,706
There are public defenders
who help people like you.

516
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,941
It's provided by the government,
so it doesn't cost anything.

517
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:30,013
Just ask the judge
to get you a public defender at trial.

518
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:31,414
Is it really for free?

519
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:36,586
You know what they say about free laywers.

520
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:41,925
What do you mean? Look at me.
I used to be a public defender.

521
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,660
Do I seem like that kind of guy?

522
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:47,330
-Can I have a grain drink?
-Got it!

523
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:48,698
Please excuse me.

524
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,872
He does seem like that kind of guy.

525
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,507
One moment, please.

526
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,080
Yu-chang, it's you.

527
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:05,882
I came because I was feeling tired.

528
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,422
Mr. Cha... No.

529
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:16,393
You look really good, Guan-woo.

530
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,195
Yes, I'm good.

531
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,931
How is Mr. Shin?

532
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,766
He's having a hard time.

533
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,268
The two of them are doing
a three-person job.

534
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:29,039
And he and Ms. Jang
haven't talked in a year.

535
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,843
Why aren't you asking about Ms. Jang?

536
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:37,147
Is she doing well?

537
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:40,317
She's back to her old self.
She's back to like how it was a year ago.

538
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,385
Back to like it was a year ago?

539
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:46,756
Does she look younger?

540
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:52,128
What? How can you be so foolish?
Why haven't you changed at all?

541
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:55,031
-I can't believe this.
-You're so filthy!

542
00:53:55,565 --> 00:54:01,304
You're single
and looking after your sick wife, right?

543
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,106
What?

544
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,842
You must mean that he's married.

545
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:13,516
You're married and looking after your wife
who hurt her leg, right?

546
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,118
Yes.

547
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:19,322
You were trying to pay
for your wife's medicine--

548
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:24,160
Counsel, the defendant is a woman.
How could she have a wife?

549
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:30,467
You were trying to pay
for your husband's medicine...

550
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,736
and were barely making ends meet.

551
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:37,474
Dang it!

552
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,377
Did any of Ms. Jjang's defenses
go over 30 seconds?

553
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:43,413
-No.
-She doesn't try at all.

554
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,815
How is she going
to manage all of complaints?

555
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:48,852
Could she be protesting in front of you?

556
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,655
-Because of Min Jun-guk.
-Why are you mentioning that?

557
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,791
I can't help thinking about it.
That ruling was--

558
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:55,892
Stop it!

559
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,015
Aren't you getting on?

560
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:29,292
Make some time for me.
I'll buy you dinner.

561
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,362
I have no reason
to let you pay for my food.

562
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:33,797
Why not?

563
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:39,569
You let me win every single case
that I indicted for a year.

564
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,405
I owe it to you. Thank you.

565
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:46,109
Yes, it's all thanks to me.

566
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,511
So, are you happy?

567
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,948
Does it feel good to defeat
a dog that has no teeth?

568
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,754
It's no fun. And you're pathetic.

569
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:02,826
So get a hold of yourself
and fight me fair and square.

570
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:30,653
Mom, this was a terrible day.

571
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:34,724
All the defendants kept lying to me.

572
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,560
And Do-yeon told me off.

573
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:42,399
Mom, I think I'm becoming slack again.

574
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,069
Should I keep doing this?

575
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:53,943
Mom, the drama you watched
all the time finally ended.

576
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:56,713
The daughter met her birth mother.

577
00:56:57,514 --> 00:57:00,450
The birth mother and daughter hugged
and cried in the end.

578
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:05,755
Mom.

579
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,292
What should I eat when I have no appetite?

580
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:12,128
I want to eat your water kimchi.

581
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,565
There was so much I wanted to do for you.

582
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:20,904
I wanted to take you to Japan.
I'm so upset. I lost my wallet.

583
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,308
I caught a cold and
my nose won't stop running.

584
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,610
I blew my nose all day.

585
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:32,048
It's mother's day.
I left freesias at your grave.

586
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,184
You liked those flowers.

587
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,962
Please stop the bus. Hurry!

588
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,473
Su-ha! Park Su-ha!

589
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:03,813
Who are you?

590
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:11,321
Why were you wearing headphones?

591
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:13,923
You should have said that you're not him!

592
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:24,634
Shoot. That hurts.

593
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,854
Ms. Jjang. Good job.

594
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,157
I didn't do a good job, you fool.

595
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:16,719
Excuse me.

596
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,088
Does Park Su-ha live here?

597
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:22,458
What? Park Su-ha?

598
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:29,465
Doesn't he live here?

599
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,136
SUSPECT ON THE RUN

600
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:48,151
-Hey, Soon-wook.
-Yes, I'm almost done.

601
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:53,289
These men came to see you
because they got a report.

602
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,998
What is this about?

603
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:03,700
Are you Park Su-ha?

604
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:23,186
Hello?

605
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:26,990
Yes, I remember.

606
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:30,994
Why are you calling so early?

607
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,367
What? You found Su-ha?

608
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:41,671
He had been hiding in the countryside.

609
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:44,173
He changed his name to Lee Soon-wook.

610
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:46,676
He totally changed his identity.

611
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,447
-You're here.
-Where is Su-ha?

612
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:53,082
He's being questioned.

613
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,785
Is he okay? Is he not hurt?

614
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:56,886
He's fine.

615
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:02,759
But he's either really smart
or really dumb.

616
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:04,894
I can't tell which it is.

617
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:06,529
What do you mean?

618
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,098
I'll tell you when they're done.

619
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:15,238
They're questioning him!

620
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:31,854
Su-ha?

621
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,866
Su-ha. Park Su-ha.

622
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:49,072
You fool. Where have you been?

623
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:52,308
You should have called.
Why didn't you? I was worried.

624
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,545
Are you okay? Are you not hurt?

625
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,482
Why did they handcuff you?

626
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,855
Is my name Park Su-ha?

627
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:14,163
That's what they all call me
by the name here.

628
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:21,537
Do you know me?

629
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:40,656
