1
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,360
What if you were wrong...

2
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,929
and she was right?

3
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:35,935
What do you mean?

4
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,106
You're wrong. The prosecutor is right.

5
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,376
What?

6
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,848
YEONJU TUNNEL

7
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,264
What do you mean?

8
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:09,069
I'm wrong and Do-yeon is right?

9
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,877
The twins planned
to kill that man together.

10
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,913
They're co-principals.

11
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,426
They're co-principals?

12
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,330
You're lying, right?

13
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:40,834
Tell me it's a lie!

14
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,282
You know I'm not lying.

15
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,818
The twins are both in on this.

16
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,155
I don't know. I can't hear you.

17
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,091
The prosecutor was right
and you were wrong.

18
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,995
So what? The judge already decided
they weren't co-principals.

19
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,299
Should I go tell him, "Sorry. I was wrong
and Do-yeon was right"?

20
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,101
No! I can't do that!

21
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,975
Let go! Let go before I get mad.

22
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:27,480
I'm counting to three. One, two, three...

23
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:30,917
Three...

24
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,920
You should leave the world of law.

25
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,157
-What?
-That's what you said ten minutes ago.

26
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,394
Do you know
who should leave the world of law?

27
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,330
A lawyer who always loses?

28
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,633
A judge who always makes wrong judgments?

29
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,803
Or a prosecutor
who always makes the wrong indictments?

30
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,238
Shut it.

31
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,774
It's none of the above.

32
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,711
The problem is people like you
who won't admit they're wrong.

33
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,916
-But that was--
-Am I wrong?

34
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:10,590
This stalker kid.
I thought he was my hope.

35
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,892
But he's just tying me down.

36
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,509
How can he say I'm the same?
We're not even remotely similar!

37
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,478
What's wrong with her now?

38
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,010
Anyone home?

39
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,446
Yes, who is it?

40
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,217
Do you know this kid?

41
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:56,329
This kid is tying us down.

42
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,316
I hurt my hand.

43
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,418
What?

44
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,586
I hurt my hand!

45
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,855
It hurts!

46
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,316
Take back what you said.

47
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,655
Take back that I'm just like Do-yeon.

48
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,458
No.

49
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:03,830
I'm going to do everything I can
to find the truth.

50
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:08,134
I'm going to prove
in court the twins are co-principals.

51
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,670
-Do you understand?
-I'm not sure.

52
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,608
I'm going to admit I was wrong, you fool!

53
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,747
Are you laughing? Did you just laugh?

54
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,183
Is this funny? Does this look easy?

55
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,519
Hey, this is very difficult.

56
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,421
Admitting I was wrong,

57
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,758
and doing it in front of a foe,
isn't something anyone cannot do.

58
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,026
But I'm going to do it. Why?

59
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,130
Because I'm not just "anyone."

60
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,633
So take back what you said.

61
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,136
I'm mistaken from Do-yeon.

62
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,705
It's "different," not "mistaken" from her.

63
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,674
-What?
-"Mistaken" means you're not right.

64
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,710
"Different" means you're not the same.

65
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,346
So it's "different," not "wrong."

66
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,650
You have such a poor vocabulary.

67
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,587
-I'm not in the mood to--
-You're different from her.

68
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,424
Very different.

69
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,759
-Okay?
-What?

70
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,762
Yes.

71
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:12,865
Okay, then.

72
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,368
Come with me. We have a lot to buy.

73
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,172
Why do I have to come?

74
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,985
It would take too long to wash
and chop these all up.

75
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,456
I would have to spend 30 minutes,
on what could take 3 minutes...

76
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,310
YEONJU DETENTION CENTER

77
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,214
What should we do now?

78
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,217
Do we have to gather more evidence
that I didn't do it?

79
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,354
Or should I get petitions from my friends?

80
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,889
Before that happens,

81
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:17,363
are you sure you didn't lie,
not even one percent?

82
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,466
I didn't.

83
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:26,973
A one-percent lie could make
the other ninety-nine percent a lie, too.

84
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:32,044
I know. Why are you asking?

85
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,047
I'm asking just to be sure.

86
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:40,820
Did you and your brother plan
to kill Ham Ki-su together?

87
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,255
No, absolutely not!

88
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,792
Why? Did my brother say something?

89
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,997
If your brother says something,

90
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,969
then will the fact that you both planned
to kill him be revealed?

91
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,290
That's not what I mean.

92
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,260
But in case you did hear something...

93
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,000
It's a secret.

94
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,070
A lawyer shouldn't talk about it.

95
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,839
Attorney Code of Conduct, Article 23.

96
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,643
"An attorney may not reveal
confidential communications

97
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,046
of the client learned
during one's employ."

98
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,481
You know that, right?

99
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,084
Are you threatening me?

100
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,956
No.

101
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:55,261
I just wanted you to know
that I'm smarter than I look.

102
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:03,035
So you just have to trust me
and do as I say.

103
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,471
Just as you have until now.

104
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:10,076
I studied some law.

105
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:16,415
The law is not something to abide by,
but to use well.

106
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,694
What a jerk. How do I get him?

107
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,765
Shall I just say everything,
despite attorney-client privilege?

108
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:36,602
No, I'm an attorney.
It's how I make a living.

109
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,638
Damn it.

110
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,810
-Ms. Jjang.
-Mr. Cha.

111
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:48,114
-I'm glad we met. Let's talk.
-But I have to go to court!

112
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,451
I just met with Jeong Pil-seung.

113
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,722
We can't talk about that.
I'm Jeong Pil-jae's attorney.

114
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,992
-You have to hear this. The two of them--
-I can't hear you.

115
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,962
-Hear me out!
-I can't hear you.

116
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,630
I think they planned it.

117
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,499
Don't hang onto me...

118
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,768
They're exploiting the fact
they're twins to get out of this.

119
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,803
We're both being used by them!

120
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,871
Stop it.

121
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,341
I'm sorry, but I won't listen to you.

122
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,743
I'm only going to listen
to my client, Jeong Pil-jae.

123
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,454
What a fool. I'm surrounded by fools.

124
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,260
What if it's true?

125
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,029
"They planned it"?

126
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,934
Get a hold of yourself!
You're Jeong Pil-jae's attorney.

127
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,137
I have to fight Ms. Jjang.
She's the enemy.

128
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,872
Let's not be affected!

129
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,109
What?

130
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,248
What's wrong?

131
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,654
It's Ms. Jjang.

132
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,926
I have never seen such a fool like him.

133
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,629
He covered his ears and shouted like this.

134
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,264
What's wrong with him?

135
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,767
He did look a little uptight.

136
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,604
Right? You agree, right?

137
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,106
What are you doing about the trial?

138
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:23,976
I don't know.

139
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:28,881
All the evidence is weak.
There's nothing concrete.

140
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,218
With this,
both of them could be found not guilty.

141
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,987
How could Do-yeon indict
with this evidence?

142
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,255
There's one thing.

143
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,424
What is it?

144
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,727
I read the prosecutor's mind
when you two were talking.

145
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,697
What did she say?
She talked bad about me, right?

146
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,367
-No. She asked for help.
-What?

147
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:54,573
You do?
Both of them could be found innocent.

148
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:59,211
But if I didn't do anything,
both of them could have gone to prison.

149
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,384
Shall I ask for help?
With her, I could get both of them.

150
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,654
What was her plan?

151
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,056
I don't know. I couldn't read that far.

152
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,126
Shall I help her?

153
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:19,331
Forget it. But maybe I should meet her.

154
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,201
Do-yeon did say
that she had something crucial.

155
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,005
Are you crazy? Rely on Seo Do-yeon? No.

156
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,178
What are you doing with my cell phone?

157
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,146
I'm texting Seo Do-yeon.

158
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,184
What? Are you crazy? Text her?
Give it to me. Hey!

159
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,986
I'm almost done.

160
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,356
Give it back to me. Hey!

161
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,671
Did you really send this?

162
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,673
Yes.

163
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,278
JANG HYE-SEONG

164
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:10,983
Can we meet tomorrow?
I think it would be a win-win.

165
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,390
TO: YEONJU DISTRICT COURT
REQUEST FOR CHANGE OF INDICTMENT

166
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,234
With her, it's not a win-win,
but a lose-lose situation.

167
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:34,773
Oh no. I seem like a loser.
Not just a loser, but a pathetic one!

168
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,279
At the crime scene. 7:30 a.m.

169
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,449
"7:30 a.m."?

170
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,518
Who told her to set the time and place?
I'm not going.

171
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,725
You said you would admit you're wrong.
Go tell her and hear her out.

172
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,195
My gosh.
I want to zip up that mouth of yours.

173
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,506
The victim had three kids in total.

174
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,744
The first one started school this year,
and the second is autistic.

175
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,947
The third child just turned one.

176
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:19,051
The father was murdered
the day before his first birthday.

177
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,420
Why did you want to meet me here?

178
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,823
Do you want me to feel guilty
by seeing the victim's family?

179
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,226
You said your defendant is innocent.

180
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,129
Why would you feel guilty?

181
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,568
You found out they're co-principals,
right?

182
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,807
No comment. You're the prosecutor,
and I'm the public defender.

183
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,045
I'm sticking to the indictment.

184
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,914
I'm not being stubborn or persistent.

185
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,951
I'm sure that they're co-principals.

186
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,988
Then you should offer hard evidence,
not just hunches.

187
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,990
All your evidence is weak.

188
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,593
I might not have the evidence,
but I have a plan to get them.

189
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,230
What kind of "plan"?

190
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,634
If I tell you, will you help?

191
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,705
Shall I tell you or not?

192
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,976
If you do, do it right.

193
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:21,313
Don't beat around the bush
as you did before.

194
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,918
Here's my strategy.

195
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,165
Why are they together?

196
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,003
Ms. Jang was meeting with Ms. Seo?

197
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,704
At the crime scene?

198
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,210
What would a prosecutor
and public defender have to talk about?

199
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:57,049
Do you think they're going
to work together to attack you?

200
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:01,553
That would be so wrong.
How could an attorney do that?

201
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,423
Ms. Jang could do that. Don't you agree?

202
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,525
Mr. Cha.

203
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,896
I was really moved.

204
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:12,731
By what?

205
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,333
It was 7:30 a.m.

206
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,836
That shows how passionate
she is about this case.

207
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,940
I know I would do it,
but I didn't expect her to.

208
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,810
Don't you think she's quite devoted?

209
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:29,314
"Devoted"? How can your conclusion be
that she's "devoted"?

210
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,949
What else could there be?

211
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,088
He's so positive. Way too positive.

212
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,223
Sweet.

213
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,094
NOT GUILTY PLEA SUMMARY
GUILTY PLEA SUMMARY

214
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,096
Choose.

215
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,331
This is for confessing to the crime...

216
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,601
And this is for not confessing
to the crime.

217
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,104
Of course I won't confess.

218
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:57,042
Even if you could be found not guilty
if you confessed?

219
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,781
What are you trying to trick me into?

220
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,552
Let me explain.

221
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,656
First, the plan is
to make all evidence inadmissible.

222
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:15,694
Not just yours,
but even Jeong Pil-jae's evidence, too.

223
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,397
Not just mine, but my brother's, too?

224
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:19,765
Yes.

225
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,300
Once all the evidence

226
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,603
that you two had committed homicide
by robbery is dismissed,

227
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,073
then you're going to confess.

228
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,444
Are you kidding?
How can I be found innocent then?

229
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,314
Article 310
of the Criminal Procedure Code.

230
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,616
"The corroboration of a confession.

231
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,420
When the defendant's
confession is the only evidence,

232
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,056
that defendant cannot be found guilty."

233
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,228
Even if you confess, there is no
other evidence, so you're innocent.

234
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:54,166
But your brother, who did not confess,
will be found guilty.

235
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:55,767
What?

236
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,905
There's no evidence against him either,
so how will he be found guilty?

237
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,742
There is evidence. It's you.

238
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:08,180
Your confession will be
corroborating evidence for him.

239
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:14,520
So even if he denies it,
your confession will become new evidence.

240
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,890
In this case,
your brother will be found guilty.

241
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,525
Isn't it amazing?

242
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,495
Innocent if you confess
and guilty if you don't.

243
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,531
Why should I confess
if there is no evidence?

244
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,133
If I don't confess,
we'll both be found innocent.

245
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,204
What if the prosecutor
is holding back evidence on purpose?

246
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,707
-What do you mean?
-I looked at the evidence list.

247
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,410
She submitted
only one of the security videos.

248
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,112
There are actually two.

249
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:45,350
And she purposefully submitted the footage
that wasn't as clear.

250
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,919
What could that mean?

251
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,623
I think the prosecutor
has set up this situation.

252
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,594
She's opening the door,
but only one person can get out.

253
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,463
And she's going to nab the one
who doesn't go through that door.

254
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,165
Or something like that.

255
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,304
So you should get out
while the door is open.

256
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,506
Don't get caught by staying behind.

257
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,577
NOT GUILTY PLEA SUMMARY

258
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:18,383
"The law is not something
to abide by, but to use well," right?

259
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,692
How can there be a law like that?
Innocent by confession?

260
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:30,829
The police or prosecution
could coerce confessions.

261
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,764
This law was made to stop that.

262
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:38,437
But it gets applied strangely
when it comes to co-defendants.

263
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,138
That's interesting.

264
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,840
The one who confesses is innocent.

265
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,410
And the other one is guilty
because of the confession.

266
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,146
Are you only getting one of them?

267
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,184
No, we can't do that.
I'm going to get them both.

268
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,354
Oh, so you have another strategy.

269
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,231
Was it this lady
who just got money from the bank?

270
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,570
Guy with the blue hat, your fly is open!

271
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,143
Oh, I'm sorry. I think I was mistaken.

272
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,549
What an ass.

273
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,921
-What was that?
-He was a pickpocket.

274
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,291
Then you should have caught him.

275
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,793
I stopped him. That's good enough.

276
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,563
No, it isn't. He'll go steal again.

277
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,606
Hye-seong. When do you get paid?

278
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,908
When can I start the foreclosure?

279
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,815
The Friday after next!

280
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,951
Gosh, she's being such a grumpy old woman.

281
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:04,990
-Gil-dong.
-Yes?

282
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,859
Could you mark a date on the calendar?

283
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:11,096
The Friday two weeks
from now is my daughter's payday.

284
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,933
"Friday two weeks from now"...

285
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,538
"Daughter's payday."

286
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,291
What are you looking at?

287
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:41,960
Your photos.

288
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,764
You and your daughter look happy.

289
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:51,203
She's only smiling for the camera.
Usually she doesn't even smile.

290
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:56,308
You look happy. The both of you.

291
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,879
Where is your family?

292
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,814
They died.

293
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,017
A long time ago.

294
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:26,238
So you should get out
while the door is open.

295
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,573
Don't get caught by staying behind.

296
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,370
Good luck!

297
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:06,812
At the last court date, I had asked you
to decide on changing the indictment.

298
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:11,049
-But you didn't change it.
-Yes, I'm not changing the charge.

299
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:17,189
And both counsel have denied all
of the evidence.

300
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,523
-Yes.
-Yes.

301
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,693
This is going to be a long trial.

302
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,028
Agreed.

303
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,968
Tomorrow, I'm going to
deny all of the evidence.

304
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:34,773
Not just your evidence,
but your brother's as well.

305
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:41,913
You said you witnessed those two men
running out of the store, right?

306
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,615
Yes.

307
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,551
Are those two people present here?

308
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:50,155
Yes, they are sitting right over there.

309
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,092
How far away were you from the store?

310
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:57,696
I think it was about 15 meters.

311
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:03,068
Could you tell me who is in this photo?

312
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,240
I think it's a photo of my mother.

313
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,245
TESTIMONY OF A WITNESS: DISAGREE

314
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,546
The polygraph test results also

315
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:19,284
indicate they conspired
to kill the victim, Ham Ki-su.

316
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:23,855
Polygraph test results aren't reliable
as they're taken under tense conditions.

317
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,224
And when looking at precedent,
not a single case shows

318
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,427
that polygraph results were admissible
as evidence.

319
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,597
LIST OF EVIDENCE - POLYGRAPH RESULTS

00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,666
DEFENDANT INTERROGATION DOSSIER

CRIMINAL RECORD

323
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,805
I misunderstood Ms. Jang.

324
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,974
Ms. Jang is not working
with the prosecutor,

325
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,577
but with Mr. Cha and hanging her to dry.

326
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,647
The prosecutor is losing too easily.

327
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,150
-As if this was planned.
-No way.

328
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,457
Is this the surveillance video
of the incident?

329
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:00,492
Yes.

330
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:05,630
-Is there anything clearer?
-No, there isn't.

331
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,633
What do you mean?

332
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,303
I looked at the evidence list.

333
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,105
She submitted
only one of the security videos.

334
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,574
There are actually two.

335
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:20,211
And she purposefully submitted the footage
that wasn't as clear.

336
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,513
What could that mean?

337
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,917
I think that the prosecutor
has set up this situation.

338
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,487
She's opening the door
but only one person can get out.

339
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,324
And she's going to nab the one
who doesn't go through that door.

340
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,092
Or something like that.

341
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,964
So you should get out
when the door is open.

342
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,566
Don't get caught by staying behind.

343
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,504
If the surveillance video
also doesn't get admitted...

344
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,306
LIST OF EVIDENCE

345
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:53,011
Wow. Then the two lawyers
have disqualified all of the evidence.

346
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,716
If all the evidence is denied,
and only one of the two confesses...

347
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,517
Because of the corroboration
of a confession,

348
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,887
then one will be found innocent
and the other guilty.

349
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,157
Could that be Ms. Jang's plan?

350
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,726
She is using the prisoner's dilemma.

351
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,161
PRISONER'S DILEMMA: SITUATION
WHEREBY ONE INDIVIDUAL BETRAYS

352
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,530
THE OTHER FROM SELF-INTEREST,
RESULTING IN A BAD OUTCOME FOR BOTH.

353
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,366
Here's my strategy.

354
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,036
The prisoner's dilemma.

355
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,773
Listen. That can only be used
when you suspect

356
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,475
they'll turn on each other.

357
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,144
But these twins planned this very well.

358
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,348
Well...
If one side is considered innocent,

359
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,052
and the other has to rot in prison
for 15 years as the guilty party,

360
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,655
wouldn't they consider
backstabbing one another?

361
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,226
So I'm going to make them
betray each other...

362
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,694
And get them both?

363
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:48,967
All right.
This is difficult to admit as evidence.

364
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,136
I will use it as reference material.

365
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:52,504
LIST OF EVIDENCE - SURVEILLANCE VIDEO

366
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,809
Once all the evidence

367
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,146
that you two had committed homicide
by robbery is dismissed,

368
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,482
then you're going to confess.

369
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,225
The two of us planned it.

370
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,728
And we killed him.

371
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,132
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

372
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:25,403
Jeong Pil-seung, you have the right
to refuse to make a statement.

373
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:30,608
Are you admitting
to the charges that were made?

374
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,811
Yes. I admit the charges.

375
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,346
I'm confessing right now.

376
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,618
Jeong Pil-jae, do you
admit to the charges, too?

377
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,353
No! I don't!

378
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,790
I didn't do anything.
He did everything on his own!

379
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,661
Jeong Pil-jae.

380
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:53,565
Now that there is evidence,
you could be found guilty.

381
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,004
Your Honor, please give me some time
to speak with my client.

382
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,206
Hold on!

383
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,575
The judge is talking rubbish.

384
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:06,244
-Stop it, Jeong Pil-jae!
-Where is the evidence?

385
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,781
The lawyer just told you
that there is no evidence!

386
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:15,086
Jeong Pil-seung's confession will act
as evidence against you.

387
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,321
What?

388
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,524
So he just...

389
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,794
Where there is no evidence
but only a confession...

390
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,263
he cannot be found guilty by law.

391
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:30,268
Since Jeong Pil-seung just confessed
when there is no other evidence,

392
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,003
he could be found not guilty.

393
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,550
Even though he confessed,
he's not guilty...

394
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,852
But I'm guilty?

395
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,926
Does that mean this jerk just sold me out
to get away with this?

396
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:58,263
I'm not sure of his intention,
but that's the result.

397
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,869
Counsel, would you like to continue later?

398
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:09,207
-Yes.
-What if I confess, too?

399
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,378
What? What did you say?

400
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,782
If I confess, too,
then there will be evidence against him.

401
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,121
Then he'll be guilty, too. Right?

402
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:27,725
-Shoot.
-Yes, I will. I'll confess.

403
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:32,497
Don't get worked up.
Let's discuss this first and then--

404
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:36,067
He told me to deny it at all costs.

405
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,570
He said then we would both get released.

406
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,272
That's why we killed him together.

407
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:46,010
He planned and I stabbed.

408
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,413
Isn't that right, Pil-seung?

409
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,251
Shut up. Shut your mouth!

410
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,753
-Stop it!
-You ruined everything!

411
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,789
Shut it!

412
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,991
It's all because of you!

413
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,693
You should've shut your mouth!

414
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,367
-Please calm down!
-You bastard!

415
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,302
Let me go!

416
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,018
Why are you so happy?

417
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,489
Mr. Shin? What's with the formal tone?

418
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,626
Are you that happy
about proving them guilty?

419
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,261
Of course.

420
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:42,734
At today's trial, you seemed
like a prosecutor, not a lawyer.

421
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:48,606
You told me I have a knack for knowing
if someone is guilty or not.

422
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,776
With that knack I knew
that they were guilty and proved it, too.

423
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,077
So what's the problem?

424
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,648
So with that knack, you weren't curious
about why they had gone to that mart,

425
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:01,219
or took off their masks
when they killed him?

426
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:05,790
Couldn't you see the woman
who was crying in the gallery?

427
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:10,328
No, I couldn't. Why should I have?

428
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:14,699
Taking off their masks means they wanted
him to see their faces on purpose!

429
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,035
They killed him to get revenge.

430
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,837
And with revenge, there's a reason.

431
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:24,042
A woman crying for them means
she can petition on their behalf.

432
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,844
As a lawyer, you should've seen that
from the start.

433
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:29,914
-But--
-If you ever

434
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,217
defend like that again,

435
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,054
I'm filing a complaint
to the association...

436
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:40,558
that Jang Hye-seong is unfit
to be a public defender!

437
00:32:54,973 --> 00:33:00,278
At today's trial, you seemed
like a prosecutor, not a lawyer.

438
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,547
You're not a prosecutor.

439
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,883
What do you mean?

440
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,286
And with revenge, there's a reason.

441
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,557
A woman crying for them means
she can petition on their behalf.

442
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,093
As a lawyer, you should've seen that
from the start.

443
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,864
You knew Seong-bin was innocent
and that Dong-hui could prove it.

444
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,167
But you stopped her
from making that statement.

445
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,504
You tried to stop her
from proving Seong-bin's innocence.

446
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,673
You, the prosecutor.

447
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:49,127
So you feel as though you're just
like the prosecutor, right?

448
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:50,595
Yes.

449
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,899
So do you regret working with her
to prove them guilty?

450
00:33:56,968 --> 00:34:01,906
No, but it feels really bad somehow.

451
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,408
It's as if

452
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:07,011
I wiped my rear with a dirty paper towel.

453
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:12,216
Geez! Did you have to say that
when I'm eating?

454
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,889
Please tell me that I was right ten times.

455
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,291
You're being childish.

456
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,763
HYE-SEONG CHICKEN

457
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:28,466
Let's go to the sauna.

458
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,936
Okay. Give me a moment.

459
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:33,838
Why?

460
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,373
-Gil-dong.
-Yes?

461
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,775
-Take this.
-What is this?

462
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:41,312
I saw from your resume
that it's your birthday today.

463
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,316
So I packed some seaweed soup
and side dishes for you.

464
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,385
Take care of yourself and eat it at home.

465
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,087
Ms. Eo.

466
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,291
You never give me even a piece of chicken.

467
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,493
You're being so generous to Gil-dong.

468
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,730
I'm being generous to him
because he is good to me.

469
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:05,269
Gil-dong does his very best in everything
when it comes to work, understand?

470
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,806
I also did my best when I helped you out
and chopped turnips for you.

471
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,708
You should do this for me, too.

472
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,643
Shut it. Let's go.

473
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:17,482
Gil-dong, wrap up here and hurry home
before the buses stop running, you hear?

474
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:18,683
Yes, ma'am.

475
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:23,788
Let's go! Stop being such a fool.

476
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:45,476
-Did you see that show?
-What? Voice of a Muderer?

477
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,160
Su-ha, help me with this problem.

478
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,930
What does "an integral
of 'sin' and 'cos'" mean?

479
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,667
What if he avoids me
because I confess I like him?

480
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,136
What if he refuses?

481
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:18,476
You dolt. It's not "sin," but "sine."
And not "cos," but "cosine."

482
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,111
Don't you know trigonometric functions?

483
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,947
How embarrassing. What should I do?

484
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,918
Of course I do! I was making a joke.

485
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:33,824
The integral of sine is minus cosine
and cosine becomes sine.

486
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,794
I told you that I liked you before.

487
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,463
Just forget it. I didn't really mean it.

488
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,599
Think of it as my mouth passing gas.
Toot, toot!

489
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,634
This way he won't refuse, right?

490
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:47,205
He won't.
He'll keep treating me as a friend.

491
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,210
Toot, toot.

492
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,744
"Toot, toot"?

493
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,280
Toot, toot. Toot, toot, toot.

494
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,316
Toot, toot, toot. Toot, toot.

495
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,985
Toot, toot. Toot.

496
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:06,357
-Thanks, Su-ha.
-For what?

497
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,799
MIN JUN-GUK

498
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,069
Why aren't you answering that?

499
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,944
RECORD

500
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,249
Hello?

501
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,883
It's been a long time, Su-ha.

502
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:34,785
How have you been?

503
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:37,054
Who is it?

504
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,124
Why don't you reply? Are you listening?

505
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:42,727
Keep talking.

506
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,877
What is it now?

507
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,779
Min Jun-guk called me.

508
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,615
He did? Why all of a sudden?

509
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,421
-You heard I had moved, right?
-Where are you?

510
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:15,226
-Where are you right now?
-Forget about me and live your life.

511
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:19,196
I won't forget either of you
and will live my life to the fullest.

512
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,365
I called to tell you that.

513
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,467
This is a threat, isn't it?

514
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,103
Think what you want.

515
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,640
So what? He just called to say hi.

516
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,210
Does it sound like that to you?
He said he wouldn't forget us.

517
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,912
Of course he shouldn't.

518
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,149
With an atoning heart, he said he would
live his life to the best and not forget.

519
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,118
It sounds like a threat to me.

520
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,524
Where did he move to?
You must know where he is.

521
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,559
What? Well...

522
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,962
We should've asked where he was going.

523
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,300
You really don't know?

524
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:59,904
Why do you want to know?
So you can beat him up again?

525
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:09,046
If you don't do anything,
I might go and kill him.

526
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:10,414
What?

527
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,885
Su-ha, I'll be keeping an eye on you.
I've warned you!

528
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,564
Where is Mr. Cha?

529
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:30,468
He went early to meet the twin client.
He should be back soon.

530
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,204
It's already past noon.

531
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:37,041
-Shall we all go eat?
-Let's wait for Mr. Cha.

532
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:42,346
I have plans with a friend,
so please excuse me.

533
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:46,283
"A friend"? Do you have any friends?

534
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:51,756
Mr. Shin, why are you suddenly so cold
to Ms. Jang?

535
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:58,696
To me, Ms. Jjang is not a lawyer.

536
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:06,504
Ms. Jang, you said you have plans, right?

537
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,205
Yes, I do.

538
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,741
And I have a lot of friends.

539
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:14,979
I have friends lined up
to have lunch with me.

540
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,327
Can I have some more kimchi, please?

541
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,168
Why did they have to come here?

542
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,607
Three beef bone broth soups, please.

543
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,843
Why didn't Ms. Jjang come out?

544
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,946
She left, saying she has plans
with a friend.

545
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,649
She's probably eating alone somewhere.

546
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,885
How was your meeting with the twin client?

547
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,454
Did he tell you why they killed him?

548
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:00,124
Yes. It was revenge.

549
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:05,930
The mart owner raped
the younger twin's girlfriend.

550
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,167
And he even threatened to send photos
of it to her workplace if she reported it.

551
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:14,572
That's why the boyfriend planned
and killed the man with his brother.

552
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:18,142
There's robbery, murder, conspiracy,
and lack of remorse.

553
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,645
He denied the charges
and caused a scene in court.

554
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,315
He's probably getting a heavy sentence.

555
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:29,687
If I were his counsel,
I would've persuaded him to confess.

556
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,523
I would've made him admit it
and show remorse,

557
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,825
and gotten the sentence reduced
by three or four years.

558
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,463
I'm not being cocky.
That's what a lawyer should do.

559
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:44,168
I'm sorry. This trial is already over.

560
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:49,006
But I hope they meet someone like you
in the court of appeals.

561
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:54,745
Is it true that Ms. Jang worked
with the prosecutor on this?

562
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,146
To prove them guilty?

563
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,650
You knew, right?

564
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,853
A surveillance video was missing
from the evidence list.

565
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,523
So I knew what was going on
in a general sense.

566
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:11,428
Aren't you mad?
She did what a lawyer shouldn't do.

567
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,767
She revealed the truth in her own way.

568
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,706
I think Ms. Jjang is wrong.

569
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,177
I don't think she's wrong.

570
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,048
I just think she's different from me.

571
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,853
You're positive. Way too positive.

572
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,988
Here's your kimchi.

573
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,025
What are you doing down there?

574
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:52,169
Ms. Jang? You were here?

575
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,038
Yes.

576
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,908
There was some money on the floor.

577
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,578
What happened to your friend?
Why are you alone?

578
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,114
She left first.

579
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,251
How much is this?

580
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:14,091
Do you think she heard what we said?

581
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:15,359
Whatever.

582
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:22,766
Did you hear everything?

583
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,071
I don't feel sorry to you at all.

584
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:29,073
And I don't think I was wrong.

585
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,775
I know. I don't think so either.

586
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:34,979
Okay then.

587
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,684
What are you doing tonight?

588
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,754
-What?
-There's a movie I want to watch.

589
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,558
-Is this--
-It's not a date.

590
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,427
I just can't go to the movies alone.

591
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:52,796
So I go to the movies
with just about anyone.

592
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,099
It's not a date,
so don't take it the wrong way.

593
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,266
Okay.

594
00:43:56,767 --> 00:44:00,404
Then... See you later at Phillip Cinema
at 6:30 p.m.

595
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,372
Okay.

596
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:06,210
And glasses, parted hair, and white socks
with black shoes are prohibited.

597
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,244
Okay...

598
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,280
This is my style.

599
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:13,984
Understood.

600
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:19,289
Four thousand won!
A talking doll for four thousand won.

601
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,891
LET YOUR LOVERS
AND FRIENDS HEAR YOUR VOICE

602
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,428
How do you record this?

603
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:27,731
To record, press the foot.

604
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,834
You can record, "I love you, I love you."

605
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:34,538
And when you press the belly,
the recording plays. Test for yourself.

606
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:45,582
How much is this?

607
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,588
Get that man!

608
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,226
Stop right there!

609
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,697
Hey, you!

610
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,002
Get out of the way!

611
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,005
Come on, buddy, drop the knife!

612
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,458
Let me go!

613
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,728
Let go!

614
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:38,168
Hey! Go over there.
We'll take care of this.

615
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,910
I think I would do a better job than you.

616
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:52,649
Let go!

617
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,390
Don't move!

618
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:10,267
-Let go!
-Thank you so much, Su-ha.

619
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:14,071
We'll make sure
to give you a commendation.

620
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,406
-I don't need one.
-Gosh.

621
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:21,411
Don't worry about Min Jun-guk.
We're keeping an eye on him.

622
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,315
Lies. I can't believe in you all anymore.

623
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:46,904
Where are you going?

624
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,606
Well...

625
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,744
He'll scoff if I say I have a date
with Mr. Cha.

626
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:55,746
A date with Mr. Cha?

627
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,550
It's not a date.

628
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:02,953
I'm just taking him
to the movies as a reward.

629
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:04,588
A "reward"?

630
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:10,527
You know I betrayed Mr. Cha
in the trial, right?

631
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,430
I thought he would be mad
but he acknowledged me instead.

632
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,265
He saw what I did.

633
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,335
So I'm accompanying him
to a movie as a reward.

634
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,005
Mr. Cha said what I really wanted to hear.

635
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:25,108
He said I wasn't wrong
and that I did the right thing.

636
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,078
Did he?

637
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:32,482
I'm going to be late.

638
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:36,453
There's food in the fridge
that my mother sent, so eat that.

639
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,721
Okay.

640
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,107
Ms. Jjang. Good job.

641
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,647
Ms. Jjang. Good job.

642
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,917
Ms. Jjang. Good job.

643
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,341
I took off my glasses and styled my hair.

644
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,610
And I'm wearing black socks.

645
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,046
Everything is perfect.

646
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,482
Ms. Jjang. Hello...

647
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:44,688
Ms. Jjang. Hi.

648
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,564
AN EXCITING FIRST DATE IS
INCOMPLETE WITHOUT ROYCE CHOCOLATE

649
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:06,443
-How much time before your date?
-Why?

650
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:11,515
Our chocolate is more delicious when cold,
so we pack it with ice.

651
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:15,152
It won't be that long. About 20 minutes?

652
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,621
Then I'll put enough in for an hour.

653
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:18,822
Thank you.

654
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:22,759
Look at the weather.

655
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:31,435
What have you been doing since before?
Did you drop some money on the floor?

656
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:36,840
I'm in trouble. I think I lost my gun.

657
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,709
-What?
-Be quiet.

658
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:42,379
-When?
-I'm not sure.

659
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:53,056
Hey! Go over there.
We'll take care of this.

660
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,365
If you don't do anything,
I might go and kill him.

661
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,867
Could he have taken it?

662
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:23,286
No, that is too sexy for Mr. Cha.

663
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,428
Ms. Jjang!

664
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:41,071
With his hair like that,
Mr. Cha is not too bad to look at.

665
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,445
Shall I give him something to see, too?

666
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,551
Hello?

667
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:57,954
Ms. Jang? Are you with Su-ha?

668
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,590
No. Why?

669
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,993
I think I lost my gun.

670
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,328
And?

671
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,564
I think Su-ha stole it.

672
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:08,832
What?

673
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,802
He said he would find Min Jun-guk
and kill him.

674
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,539
Where is he right now? Is he at home?

675
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,883
Taxi!

676
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,156
Ms. Jjang! Where are you going? Ms. Jjang!

677
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,472
Answer your phone, come on.

678
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,545
JJANG OF ARC

679
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,300
Su-ha! Park Su-ha!

680
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:24,107
Why are you here? What about your date?

681
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:25,542
Did you, by any chance...

682
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:28,411
Ms. Jang!

683
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,081
-Are you inside?
-Yes, one moment!

684
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,152
-They're already here to catch him.
-What do you mean, "catch" me?

685
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:39,789
Ms. Jang.

686
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,595
Don't move from here.
And don't make a sound.

687
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,804
Ms. Jang, I'm the detective
who called you just now.

688
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:57,073
Hold on. I'll be right out.

689
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:04,648
Sorry it took so long.
I'm sorry, I was washing my hair.

690
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,016
So you can't come in.

691
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:10,353
Su-ha isn't at home.
But I keep an eye on him every day.

692
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,455
He won't do anything bad,
so you don't have to worry.

693
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,825
That's not it. I just found the gun.

694
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,061
It was under the seat of the police car.

695
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,497
I came to tell you that.

696
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:26,069
-What a relief.
-Are you okay?

697
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:29,506
No, I'm not okay!

698
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:31,741
Ms. Jang?

699
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:34,110
How could you scare me like that?

700
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,346
Do you know what I was thinking
while I ran back home?

701
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,548
You said you were washing your hair.

702
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:42,252
I meant, do you know what I was thinking
while I washed my hair?

703
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,489
Su-ha isn't someone
who would do such a thing.

704
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,558
He would never do anything like that.

705
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,962
I was so offended and worried as well.

706
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,731
Don't you ever make
such unfounded accusations again.

707
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:55,732
I'm sorry.

708
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:18,722
Did you hear everything?

709
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,926
Did you think I could have stolen the gun?

710
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:26,096
Yes.

711
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:31,668
Is he mad that I suspected him?
What is he thinking?

712
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,370
Nothing much.

713
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:38,408
I'm thinking you must be embarrassed
about how you look.

714
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,512
No, I'm not embarrassed.

715
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:52,522
And I thought, "I have someone
who worries about me now."

716
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:07,937
Who are you?

717
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:15,945
CHA GUAN-WOO

718
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:17,647
Oh no!

719
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:21,184
Hello?

720
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,820
It's me. What happened?

721
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:27,724
Oh, hi. It was nothing.

722
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:31,094
I thought a friend had gotten
into trouble, so I rushed over.

723
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,197
-But it's been solved.
-That's a relief.

724
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:37,667
You didn't answer your phone,
so I thought something happened.

725
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:40,870
I'm sorry. I was distracted.

726
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:43,940
-Did you get home okay?
-What?

727
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:49,112
Yes, of course. I just got home.

728
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:53,149
I'm really sorry.
We'll see a movie next time.

729
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:58,088
Okay. See you tomorrow at the office.

730
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:15,271
It must have all melted.
I should have asked for three hours.

731
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:25,849
Isn't that...

732
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,586
I'll take Ms. Jang home.

733
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:37,627
What?

734
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:42,532
What are you looking at?

735
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:45,635
Is something there?

736
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,610
I'll bring the laundry in. Go on in.

737
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,779
-Really?
-Yes.

738
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:19,469
-Did you talk to Mr. Cha?
-Yes, he's already at his place.

739
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:22,071
Really?

740
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:25,375
I thought you were empty-headed,
but you're not.

741
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,510
You have better grades than expected.

742
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:28,578
REPORT CARD

743
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:30,547
You're in the top tier.

744
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,149
What? Did you go through my bag?

745
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:37,220
Do you cheat when you take tests?

746
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:39,589
Do you look into the teacher's minds?

747
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,830
They have to be thinking
about the questions for that to work.

748
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:48,231
It's not like that.

749
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,567
So you were born smart?

750
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:56,206
I just tend to understand things better
than others in class.

751
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,876
I can read the teachers' minds,
so it works automatically.

752
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,847
Actually, I'm quite offended.

753
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,282
I'm smarter than I look?

754
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,318
How do I look to you?

755
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:10,553
You look like a total punk.

756
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,889
And when you frown, you're quite scary.

757
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,693
So I guess you thought
I could have stolen the gun.

758
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,864
Were you so scared
that you canceled your date?

759
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:25,468
I wasn't scared. I was worried.

760
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:30,640
Jeong Pil-seung and Jeong Pil-jae,
those two, killed a man to get revenge.

761
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:32,141
Really?

762
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:35,044
They killed the man
who had raped the girlfriend.

763
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:39,215
They themselves killed the man
that they wanted gone from this world.

764
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:41,684
Because they couldn't trust the law.

765
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,189
You and I are like that, too.

766
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:53,129
Even if you hate him enough
to kill him, don't.

767
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,398
Then all the reasons will disappear.

768
00:58:55,999 --> 00:59:01,337
How bad a person Min Jun-guk is...
Why we hate him so much...

769
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,339
It will all disappear.

770
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:08,878
The moment we kill him,
we won't be victims, but common murderers.

771
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,849
So...

772
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:18,454
Don't even think about seeking vengeance
on Min Jun-guk.

773
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:20,089
Okay?

774
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:27,063
What are you doing? Answer me quickly.

775
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:33,836
What if Min Jun-guk tries to hurt you?

776
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:44,314
Don't do it even then.
I will protect myself.

777
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:50,186
Don't ever say you'll kill Min Jun-guk
and forget about it.

778
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,896
Your grades are too good
for you to become a murderer.

779
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:04,334
You're lucky.
You can have your pick of universities.

780
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:14,510
Will you keep my secret?

781
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:18,181
If the fact that I lost
my gun gets out, I will...

782
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:23,152
Why did you suspect
Park Su-ha might have taken it?

783
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:28,191
It's because I saw his eyes
when he looked at the gun.

784
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:30,593
Why? What was in those eyes?

785
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:38,067
MYEONG IL SA
CELL PHONE LOCATION TRACKING

786
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:41,404
It seemed as if he would do something
with that gun.

787
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,741
His eyes were scary, but also unstable.

788
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:48,244
MYEONG IL SA

789
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:54,417
