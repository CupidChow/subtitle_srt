1
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,394
Answer your phone!

2
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,074
Just move. Let's talk later!

3
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,156
Who...

4
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:33,693
Who's there?

5
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,503
Who is it? Come out at once!

6
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,672
I just called the police!

7
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,313
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,182
I'm scared. There's someone in the room.

9
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,020
Go outside.

10
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,803
You called us because of this phone?

11
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,639
Yes.

12
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,742
Who broke down the door?

13
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,210
Him.

14
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,981
Did he get hurt
while fighting the intruder?

15
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,784
No, that's not it.

16
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,653
Then why did you call us?

17
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,023
Because of that mobile phone.

18
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,259
I kept getting texts from it.

19
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,995
And it was in my room.

20
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:21,568
So the culprit didn't break down the door
or hit him?

21
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,437
-That's correct.
-Seriously, why did you call us?

22
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,474
Look, someone I don't even know

23
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,611
put a mobile phone in my house
without my knowledge.

24
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,279
This is breaking and entering.

25
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,215
According to
Article 319 of the Criminal Code,

26
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,484
this sentence carries a maximum
of three years or a five-million-won fine.

27
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,353
You have to find the person
and punish him!

28
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:44,290
She is totally crazy.
This is going to be a pain.

29
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,094
I will find out who the owner
of this phone is and let you know.

30
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,097
Are you just leaving?

31
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,067
Isn't someone going to stake out my place?

32
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:58,004
A police car patrols this area frequently,
so don't worry.

33
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,239
Good night.

34
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,545
What? Are they just leaving?

35
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,251
Excuse me. What happened?
Was there a burglary?

36
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,219
No, it was nothing.

37
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,292
What is it now?

38
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,227
I need to tell you something.

39
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,897
Shouldn't you see a doctor first?

40
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,701
I think I know
who the owner of the phone is.

41
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,069
What?

42
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,608
Why won't it close?

43
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,613
Come on!

44
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,985
You'll have to kick it harder to break.

45
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,488
Why are you picking a fight?

46
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:02,402
Don't be alone here tonight.
What if the guy comes back?

47
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,004
You should be more worried about yourself.

48
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,141
Why did you come here?
What happened to your face?

49
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,376
It's nothing.

50
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,112
Anyway, go stay with a friend for a while.

51
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,614
Don't stay here.

52
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,418
What are you doing? Hey, stop!

53
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,887
Hey! Oh my gosh.

54
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,723
Wake up, Stalker!

55
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,728
Where is my phone?

56
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,699
I can't believe this. 911...

57
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,943
Are you asleep?

58
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,576
Su-ha, you're going to live
with your aunt and me.

59
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,778
Is that okay?

60
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,818
You can share a room
with Jin-young and Jin-seong.

61
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,257
Why didn't he take his son with him?

62
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,060
Why is he giving me a hard time,
leaving this kid behind?

63
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,965
I already have three.
How can I raise four?

64
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,147
Uncle! Uncle!

65
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,784
Over here! Uncle!

66
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,221
Please just disappear.

67
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,858
I can't emigrate with you.

68
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,495
Is he seriously sick?

69
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,443
Stay. You have a fever.

70
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:17,797
Should I contact his parents?
They must be worried.

71
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,435
Why did he come here?
And what happened to his face?

72
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,738
Is he a bully?

73
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,542
I don't have parents to worry about me.

74
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:35,047
I came to ask something
and I fell on my way here.

75
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,749
I'm not a bully.

76
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,553
Stalker, do you always look
into other people's minds?

77
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,592
It's too late,
so you should sleep here tonight.

78
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,661
Go see a doctor first thing
in the morning.

79
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:49,962
I don't need to.

80
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,199
And what did you want to ask?

81
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,602
-What?
-You came to ask something.

82
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,038
Does she remember me?

83
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,042
Do you know my name?

84
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,777
Your name?

85
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,214
I don't know.

86
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,551
I don't need to.
We won't see each other again.

87
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,557
I'm Su-ha. Park Su-ha.

88
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,233
Park Su-ha?

89
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,475
Your name doesn't fit your hot temper.

90
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,744
"Stalker" is more suitable.

91
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,580
Get some sleep.

92
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,018
I knew it.

93
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:51,057
It was ten years ago,
how could she remember?

94
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,561
Park Su-ha?

95
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,199
It does kind of ring a bell.

96
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,037
Stalker! Turn off the lights.

97
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,126
JANG HYE-SEONG
HYE-SEONG CHICKEN

98
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,878
Why did you make so much for breakfast?

99
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,981
It's Do-yeon's birthday today.

100
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,685
I made reservations for seven o'clock.
Please be there on time.

101
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,690
I met the director
of public prosecutions yesterday.

102
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,059
I heard about the dropped charges.

103
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,427
What happened?

104
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,131
About that...

105
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,434
The victim changed her statement.

106
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,637
Do-yeon was taken by surprise.

107
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:15,007
I heard the defense lawyer was Hye-seong.

108
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,477
Yes.

109
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:19,779
Hye-seong?

110
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,382
The one who lived with us ten years ago?

111
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,284
Yes.

112
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,055
She became a public defender
at the Yeonju District Office.

113
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,257
The maid's daughter

114
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,127
returned after ten years
as a public defender.

115
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,697
And you had to drop the charges
on her first case.

116
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,901
I'm sorry.

117
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,671
I won't make the same mistake again.

118
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,142
Aren't you going to eat?
Where are you going?

119
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,179
I forgot that I have to go
and see a crime scene.

120
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,547
I'm sorry.

121
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,993
If you keep this up, rumors will spread.

122
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,196
What rumor?

123
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,833
That Do-yeon isn't our daughter.

124
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,738
That's too much for a joke.

125
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,908
You know it's not a joke.

126
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:09,155
It's not as if being coy
with you will work.

127
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,124
And there is no reason to be coy with you.

128
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,098
You may not know this because
you don't have a sister.

129
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,568
But 99 percent of women have hair
and faces like this in the morning.

130
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,073
So you shouldn't have fantasies

131
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,708
and face reality.

132
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,577
Do you want some?

133
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,145
No.

134
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,901
Here.

135
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,438
Is this dog food?

136
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,142
You're going to love it.
Here, just use this.

137
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,277
How can you have just one spoon?

138
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,214
I live alone.
Isn't it normal to have just one spoon?

139
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:17,857
Is anything missing?

140
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,326
He made a mess here looking for something.

141
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,363
A mess?

142
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,070
The intruder didn't do this.

143
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,372
Who would do this if not an intruder?

144
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,812
This is how you live?

145
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,253
Who is your first love?

146
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,922
She is pretty. Really pretty.

147
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,826
She isn't just pretty. She is nice.

148
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:58,264
Nice and smart.
She is the most amazing woman.

149
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,304
Hey, 99 percent of the women
in the world live like this.

150
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,173
Even celebrities are the same.

151
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,175
They'll probably be the same at home.

152
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,279
Gosh, either eat or speak.

153
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,149
"She is gone. My love is gone.

154
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,653
Through the green mountain
and the maple tree woods,

155
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,923
she walked through
the small path and left me."

156
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:29,061
Some say this poem is
about the lost nation or even Buddha.

157
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,997
But I think it's about first love.

158
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,067
First loves are sad, but beautiful,

159
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,270
just as described in this poem.

160
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,774
Your heart beats with the hope
that you might meet one day.

161
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,244
Don't you all have such first loves?

162
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,279
No!

163
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,858
How did you bring all this?
What about your store?

164
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,861
I asked Mr. Kim from the pizza place
to keep an eye on it.

165
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,398
Your colleagues are going to demand
that you treat them

166
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,133
now that you won your first case.

167
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,870
You won't be able to handle it
on your own,

168
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,505
so I came to help.

169
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,674
Here, look at this.

170
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,978
This is spicy and this is plain.

171
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,813
Hire someone.

172
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,082
You came all the way here by a bus
to bring me this?

173
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,451
This isn't everything.

174
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,121
Here.

175
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,426
"Kirin Hotel, 7:00 p.m."? What is this?

176
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,462
It's my friend's son.

177
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:41,367
You're of similar age and he seems nice.

178
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:45,104
He is a lawyer, too.
You should get along well.

179
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,573
Are you setting me up?

180
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:52,311
His parents own a sauna, so they're rich.
Plus, he is the second son.

181
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,915
Mom, I'm not interested in marriage.

182
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,117
Why?

183
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,054
You used to say
it was your wish to get married early.

184
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,889
That was a month ago.

185
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,592
After going through this trial...

186
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,162
I realized I'm a rising star.

187
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,699
Rising star?

188
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,036
You are out of your mind.

189
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,705
You couldn't say that
if you had seen me in court.

190
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,674
I'm not like the other lawyers.

191
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,810
I was surprised with myself, too.

192
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:29,281
I think it would be a big loss
to get married and stop working.

193
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,785
So consider myself married
to the law for now.

194
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:37,022
Your problem is that you take it too far.

195
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,058
You only just won one case.

196
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,427
Don't hit my head!

197
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:46,398
You must be modest if you want
to keep this job for a long time, okay?

198
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,339
Okay, then. I'll keep it safe for now.

199
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:58,010
Why is this so easy?
Aren't you going to stop me?

200
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:02,581
I looked at your eyes
and they have a sparkle to them.

201
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,817
You should be working,
not getting married.

202
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,087
You should work hard
while you're on a roll.

203
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:13,258
Okay. Mom, stay and have lunch with me.

204
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,494
I have to go now.

205
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,731
Hire someone!

206
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,600
Okay. Go on in.

207
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:29,341
If she wins another case,
we'll be smothered with chicken.

208
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,543
Ms. Jjang, come have some.

209
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,113
I'm okay. I've had a lot.

210
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,015
Isn't this too flashy?

211
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,352
It's the most expensive one.

212
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,754
This would cost you
over 20,000 won at a salon.

213
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,859
This is a strange talent.

214
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,294
Anyway, consider yourself lucky.

215
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,765
There are so many lawyers
who get paid a lot for doing nothing.

216
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,735
But I investigated your school
and persuaded the victim.

217
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,770
And it was all for free.

218
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,773
Consider yourself lucky
that you met such a lawyer.

219
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,444
I know, so I'll do your nails for life.

220
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,447
Okay, write that promise here.

221
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,581
I'll have it notarized.

222
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,419
When I first saw you,
I thought I was screwed.

223
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:18,590
I mean I thought I was doomed
but that wasn't the case.

224
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,493
You believed me when no one else would.

225
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,529
Why did you believe me?

226
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,665
Well...

227
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:33,172
I could just tell that
you were telling the truth.

228
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:37,843
Thank you. You're the only one who...

229
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,547
No, Su-ha trusted me, too.

230
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,949
Why didn't he come with you?

231
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,752
I asked him to,
but he went somewhere after he got a call.

232
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:47,819
Where?

233
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,523
Who is the owner of the phone?

234
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,260
It's some lady's phone.
She just lost it, okay?

235
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,463
So why was it there?
Did you check the fingerprints?

236
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,666
We didn't find any.

237
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,102
What about the guy?
Did you find Min Jun-guk?

238
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,806
He got out and is living his life
as a volunteer worker.

239
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,175
Did you meet him? Where is he?

240
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,646
I can't tell you that.
That's how the law is.

241
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,782
He is a dangerous person.

242
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,318
I think you're more dangerous.

243
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,619
Okay.

244
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:24,723
We'll keep an eye on it,
so you should go study hard.

245
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,660
Is he in Yeonju?
Does he live near the court?

246
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,131
How did he know that? Did he just guess?

247
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,335
No, he lives far away.

248
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,938
I'm not going to answer you,
so please stop asking now.

249
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,279
HELPING THE NEEDY
WITH MEALS MADE WITH LOVE

250
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,222
I wish you good health.

251
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,157
Did you drink a lot yesterday?

252
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,393
-Take one sweet potato.
-Thank you.

253
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,563
Enjoy your meal.

254
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,404
I'm sorry. I just picked it to see.

255
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:19,444
They will become soggy
if you put them in your pocket.

256
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,947
-Thank you.
-Enjoy them.

257
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:27,352
That guy is still alive.
I should have killed him in one blow.

258
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,365
Dad!

259
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,201
I said I'd kill you!

260
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,572
I will kill those you talked to!

261
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,256
Enjoy your meal.

262
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,263
You look like a student.
Are you here because you're hungry?

263
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,368
No, I'm interested in volunteering here.

264
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,603
-How do I start?
-Really?

265
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,040
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

266
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,509
This student wants to do volunteer work.

267
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,178
What's your name?

268
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,515
Kim Chung-gi.

269
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,764
Ms. Jang. Here's your new case.

270
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,100
Why are there so many documents?

271
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:52,771
SEO DO-YEON

272
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:57,075
-It's Seo Do-yeon.
-I heard you were classmates.

273
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:01,747
Yes, she was inefficient
even in high school.

274
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,183
She is the kind who makes one cookie
with a whole sack of flour.

275
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,020
It looks as though
she went overboard again.

276
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,991
I don't think that is the case.

277
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,828
It's an unusual case.

278
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,234
Two brothers robbed a convenience store.

279
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,169
Who are you? What are you doing?

280
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,073
When the owner caught them,
one of them stabbed him with a knife.

281
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,974
Let go of me!

282
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,409
And the other tried to stop him.

283
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,880
It doesn't sound unusual at all.

284
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,481
The murderer gets homicide by robbery.

285
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,284
And the other one would be charged
with special larceny.

286
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:44,456
But the prosecutor indicted them both
with homicide by robbery.

287
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,793
Is she in her right mind?

288
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:51,062
One of them tried to stop it.
How can she charge them both?

289
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,498
This is how she is.
She always goes overboard.

290
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,369
That may be true,
but it looks as though it was inevitable.

291
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:02,908
You can't tell who stabbed the man,
and who tried to stop it.

292
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,746
Why can't they clarify that?
There must be a video of it.

293
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,551
They are twins,
and identical twins at that.

294
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:18,457
And they both confessed
that they stabbed the man.

295
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,660
How similar do they look?

296
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,198
Oh my gosh.

297
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,536
Do I have the murderer
or the one who tried to stop it?

298
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,306
It says it's the murderer
in the arraignment.

299
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,643
ROBBERY HOMICIDE

300
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,851
You're Jeong Pil-seung,
not Jeong Pil-jae, right?

301
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:49,120
Yes, I'm Jeong Pil-seung.
I'm the younger one.

302
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:53,091
I'm the public defender
who will be defending you.

303
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,194
I know. You're Jang Hye-seong, right?

304
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,163
I heard a lot about you.

305
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,298
You heard about me?

306
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,702
You crushed the prosecutor
on your first case.

307
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:05,904
Everyone knows about it.

308
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,974
They said I was lucky and envied me.

309
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:14,012
We'll see at the end of the trial
whether you're lucky or not.

310
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:20,018
You and your brother were both charged
with homicide.

311
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,052
Right?

312
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,087
My brother shouldn't be.

313
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,756
He just came along and got involved.

314
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,960
-I stabbed the man.
-You don't have any convictions.

315
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,097
Yes, but my brother does.

316
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,233
If he is convicted of a crime again,

317
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,968
he might get life imprisonment.

318
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,241
So you're going to take the fall
for him instead, is that it?

319
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,176
No, it's not like that.

320
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,913
I did it. He is innocent.

321
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,048
Please defend me with that in mind.

322
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,519
Look, I am your lawyer.

323
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,289
And convictions are not mileage points,

324
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,791
you don't get any rewards.

325
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,527
Get a hold of yourself, Pil-seung.

326
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,764
You could end up rotting in prison.

327
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:07,699
I know.

328
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:13,505
That's why I have a favor to ask of you.

329
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,538
I recently picked up a puppy
on the street.

330
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,575
I didn't know this would happen.

331
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,244
Could you take care of the puppy?

332
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,554
GRAND PRIZE, JEONG PIL-SEUNG

333
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,660
COUNSEL'S STATEMENT

334
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,301
AS STATED ABOVE...

335
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,384
Either sleep or type. Choose one.

336
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,321
I can't. My closing argument
for the Jo Yeong-sook case is tomorrow,

337
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,856
so I have to finish.

338
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,290
Go easy.

339
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:41,893
You stayed up all night, right?

340
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:47,265
I should get a new brain.
It's just not working properly.

341
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,001
-Hello.
-Hello.

342
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,102
What is this?

343
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,974
Oh my! Where did you get this dog?

344
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:01,446
It's Jeong Pil-seung's dog.
I'm watching it until the trial ends.

345
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:02,814
Until the trial ends?

346
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,783
He is charged with homicide by robbery.

347
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,651
He'll get at least ten years.

348
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:10,655
He didn't commit the homicide by robbery.
The indictment is wrong.

349
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,791
Are you going to get the charges
dismissed again?

350
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,858
Yes.

351
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,027
I did it last time. I can do it again.

352
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,865
But the case has been consolidated
with his older brother's case.

353
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:23,001
CONSOLIDATION: WHEN MULTIPLE CASES
TRIALS ARE HELD AT ONCE

354
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:27,539
What? So, are the two brothers
going to be tried at the same time?

355
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:32,343
Yes, you're going to have to prepare
to argue against the brother's lawyer.

356
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,647
They will also insist
that it wasn't murder.

357
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,417
Who is the brother's lawyer?

358
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,320
-It's a public defender.
-A public defender?

359
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,857
-Mr. Shin?
-No.

360
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,060
It's Mr. Cha.

361
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:53,631
Mr. Cha?

362
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,471
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING

363
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,379
You must be tired.

364
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,750
This won't even last us a week though.

365
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,985
When did you start volunteering here?

366
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:15,987
It's been about a month.

367
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,090
So it's been a month
since you lived at the church?

368
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,759
Yes.

369
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,597
Why are you looking at me like that?

370
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,666
Don't you remember me?

371
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,401
You seem familiar.

372
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,973
No.

373
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,645
Where did I see him?
He does seem familiar.

374
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,118
Didn't you come
to the Yeonju Courthouse recently?

375
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:52,390
Did this guy see me there?

376
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,559
Right?

377
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,966
No, I never went there.

378
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,704
I must have you confused
with someone else.

379
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,588
One green-grape sparkling water, please.

380
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,656
Yes, ma'am.

381
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:29,394
I'll have a grande
red berry iced tea, please.

382
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,563
And put hers on my card, too.

383
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:32,664
Yes, sir.

384
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,137
Don't think that old people
only drink instant coffee.

385
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,440
It's not that. What's gotten into you?

386
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,309
You never pay for mine.

387
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:46,811
Shall I cancel the payment?

388
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,448
There's no need to do that.

389
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,585
Are you free tonight?

390
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,020
We should have a team dinner.

391
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,223
With me as well?

392
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,125
You always left me out.

393
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,128
-So you can't come?
-It's not that.

394
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,167
Let me check my schedule.
I'll go if I can.

395
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,939
What are you doing here?
You don't have a trial today.

396
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:18,977
Mr. Cha has a trial today.
I came to see how he is doing.

397
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,680
There isn't really much
that a lawyer can do on that case.

398
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:26,284
The defendant said she is guilty.
It's a simple case.

399
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:30,021
I'm curious as to how much
he can reduce the sentence.

400
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:38,529
On March 16, 2012, at Haetsal Center,
Jo Yeong-sook stole

401
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,932
six million won
from the donations for the disabled,

402
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,401
and was reported to police
by the center's director.

403
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:47,939
She swung a knife at the police
while being arrested.

404
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,409
Even if we take her disability
into account,

405
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:56,047
she had planned the crime,
lied during the trial and didn't repent.

406
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,816
The victim is asking
for severe punishment.

407
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,753
With the charges of special larceny
under Article 331 of the Criminal Code,

408
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:06,157
and obstruction of justice
under Articles 136 and 144,

409
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:09,227
we ask that she be
given two years in prison.

410
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,099
Next.

411
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,902
Make your closing argument, counsel.

412
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,704
Yes, Your Honor.

413
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,801
It's not that folder.
Click the USB folder.

414
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,003
Okay, the USB.

415
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,306
Did he bring the wrong one?

416
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,413
Why isn't this working?

417
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:07,652
It's the USB folder in there.
It's inside that one.

418
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,253
Yes, the USB folder.

419
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:11,589
What?

420
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:20,498
What is he doing?

421
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,268
Why isn't this working?

422
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,307
The USB folder in there!

423
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:31,609
Okay.

424
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:35,813
Why is this...

425
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,951
Counsel, I said inside there!
Can't you hear me?

426
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,428
I can hear you clearly, Your Honor.

427
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:55,400
For a moment,
you were in the shoes of the defendant.

428
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:01,372
Just like her, you were not heard,
even though you kept speaking to me.

429
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,943
In 50 seconds,
you became angry and hit your desk.

430
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:13,317
If others cannot understand what we say,

431
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,553
we speak a little louder.

432
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,557
But if they cannot understand that either,

433
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,528
then we speak even louder.

434
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:27,265
If they still don't understand,
then we get mad.

435
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,868
Just like you, Your Honor.
In just 50 seconds.

436
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:36,040
What if it wasn't 50 seconds,

437
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,044
but 50 years that you were not heard?

438
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,681
You would have gotten angry a lot.

439
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:48,352
The defendant donated money,

440
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,154
instead of shouting or getting angry.

441
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:54,759
She wanted it to be used
for disabled people like her.

442
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,629
She has donated
over 30 million won to Haetsal Center.

443
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,934
When she couldn't pay back her loan,

444
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,435
she went to the director at the center.

445
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:07,572
She asked for a loan,
but they refused to help.

446
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:11,976
She asked many more times,
but they wouldn't listen.

447
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:19,550
The fact that she stole the money
is a clear crime.

448
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,821
She should have suppressed it.
Just like she had for 50 years.

449
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:29,060
But couldn't someone have heard her voice

450
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:33,264
during that long time?

451
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,735
How would it have been

452
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,804
if someone had heard her cries?

453
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:44,842
It's not the defendant
who put herself on the stand today.

454
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:48,146
It might've been us who refused to listen.

455
00:35:56,854 --> 00:36:00,558
Couldn't someone have listened
to her voice

456
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,028
during that long time?

457
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,533
How would it have been

458
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,601
if someone had heard her cries?

459
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:15,173
It's not the defendant
who put herself on the stand today.

460
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:16,874
It might've been us,

461
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:18,910
who refused to listen.

462
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,048
What are you doing here?

463
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,785
Why did you come here?

464
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:33,791
I heard that lawyer was assigned
to the twin case.

465
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,629
What?

466
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,765
Did you come to spy on him?

467
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:42,733
Yes.

468
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:46,804
I am pretty concerned about this case.

469
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,707
Of course.

470
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,343
A public defender got
your charges dismissed

471
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,512
and it's evaluation period soon.

472
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,182
If you can't make it up with this case,
you should be concerned.

473
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,451
Exactly.

474
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,054
And the opponent is pretty strong.

475
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,691
-Are you complimenting me?
-No.

476
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:08,993
Not you.

477
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,495
It's Cha Guan-woo.

478
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,434
You must be feeling nervous
after watching the trial.

479
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,402
Aren't you?

480
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:24,175
Not really.

481
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,520
-Jun-guk.
-Yes?

482
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,590
Do you have the number
of the student who came yesterday?

483
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:42,827
I don't know his number.
I know his name and school.

484
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:46,564
Really? I forgot to give him
the volunteer certificate.

485
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:47,965
Let me...

486
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,635
Is this important?

487
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:54,138
I heard it's used to get into colleges.

488
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,241
-What should I do?
-I'll go give it to him.

489
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:17,962
Hey, Kim Chung-gi...

490
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,999
Could you go and get me that student?

491
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,768
The tall one playing ball.

492
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,936
Who? Park Su-ha?

493
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,073
Park Su-ha?

494
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,309
Is that his name? Isn't he Kim Chung-gi?

495
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,810
No, he isn't.

496
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,813
I'm Kim Chung-gi.

497
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,582
Did he pretend to be me?

498
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,518
No.

499
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,291
Park Su-ha?

500
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,831
Don't you remember me? You seem familiar.

501
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:07,878
Do you happen to know Su-ha's number?

502
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,414
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

503
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,187
This is good.

504
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,224
You should have some wine, too.

505
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,593
Mr. Shin is treating us today.

506
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,295
I don't drink.

507
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,398
Should I order a cocktail for you, then?

508
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,870
Why are you staring at me?
Is there something on my face?

509
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:37,675
You let me come to the team dinner.

510
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:38,976
And you're speaking casually, too.

511
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:40,511
It seems strange.

512
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,246
You never used to be like this.

513
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,416
I am always polite
to someone who's a nobody.

514
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,754
Are you saying that Ms. Jjang was a nobody
until now?

515
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,888
Yes.

516
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,157
You were casual
with Mr. Cha right from the start.

517
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,593
He isn't a nobody.

518
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,396
You saw his trial today.

519
00:39:58,696 --> 00:39:59,997
Mr. Shin.

520
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,200
Is this why you invited me here?

521
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,402
So you can pick on me like this?

522
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,570
Why don't you keep being polite to me?

523
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,773
Why did you change your mind
if I'm a nobody?

524
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,776
Don't worry. You have your strengths.

525
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,413
I don't need that.
Don't try to comfort me.

526
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,683
What is my strength?

527
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,221
Your eyes.

528
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:26,690
My eyes?

529
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:33,264
You have eyes that can tell
whether the defendant is lying.

530
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,134
But that...

531
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,772
What else? What other strengths?

532
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,274
Other than that?

533
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,145
Nothing. That's all.

534
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:49,480
No way.

535
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,082
I went to the defendant's school
because of that case.

536
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,717
Mr. Cha took you.

537
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,987
And even when the prosecutor
picked on the witness's oath...

538
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,623
You only squeezed by
because I gave you that hint.

539
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,292
-And?
-And?

540
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:02,893
And!

541
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,066
-Excuse me, a bottle of wine!
-You said you can't drink.

542
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,368
I didn't say I can't.
I just said I don't drink.

543
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,317
Why do I only have one strength?

544
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:30,754
Why do I only have one strength?

545
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:36,427
Why didn't you say she has ten?
Look what you've done.

546
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,929
Who knew she would react so badly?

547
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:40,731
Let's go now.

548
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,766
What about Ms. Jjang?

549
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,836
Mr. Cha will take care of her.

550
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,906
-Or you can take her home.
-What?

551
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:52,209
I'm sorry. I have to go home early today.

552
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,112
I have to be at a memorial service.
I have to go now.

553
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,426
Those eyes are not mine.

554
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:15,232
I don't have eyes
that can see through defendants.

555
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,936
I'm blind. I can't see it.

556
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,047
Where did everyone go?

557
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,184
Ms. Jjang? Where did everyone go?

558
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:36,921
I don't know.

559
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,657
I think they all abandoned me.

560
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,464
She becomes quite violent
when she is drunk.

561
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:50,634
I can't see the truth.

562
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:01,979
Oh no!

563
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,316
I can't see at all.

564
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,619
What will I do? What am I going to do?

565
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,220
Hold on.

566
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,657
Here.

567
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,093
Can you see now?

568
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,864
Oh my gosh.

569
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:23,367
My eyes must have gone bad.

570
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,771
You have become handsome.

571
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,342
My eyes have gone bad.

572
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:33,377
Handsome?

573
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,855
Okay, I don't have the eyes
to see the truth.

574
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,692
So I need my stalker.

575
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,096
Ms. Jjang, let's talk about him later.

576
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:55,199
Tell me where you live. Where do you live?

577
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:01,372
Without him, I can't go to trial.

578
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,442
Why? Because my eyes have gone bad.

579
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,113
I can't see again.

580
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,817
-Oh no.
-Hey.

581
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,924
Hey, where do you live?

582
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,028
She is too drunk.

583
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:36,240
Why isn't she coming?

584
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,476
Why isn't she answering her phone?

585
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,584
What's going on?

586
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,025
What is it? Is she sick?

587
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,365
-She smells bad.
-You were at our office, right?

588
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:04,401
-Yes.
-What are you doing here?

589
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,371
I needed to speak to Ms. Jang.

590
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,874
As you can see, she can't listen to you.

591
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:15,079
Where does Ms. Jjang live?
I can't take her to my place.

592
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,448
Should I leave her at the office?

593
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,349
It will be cold at night.

594
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,953
I'll take Ms. Jang home.

595
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,522
What? Do you know where she lives?

596
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,257
Yes. I was there a few times.

597
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,059
Hand her to me and help me get a taxi.

598
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,929
What? Okay. Here.

599
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,504
You know what? I will go alone.

600
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:44,408
Will you be okay?
She is heavier than she seems.

601
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,944
But the two of us holding her
would be overkill.

602
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:48,579
I suppose so.

603
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:52,983
-Please take them home safely.
-Sure.

604
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,987
Can I trust this kid?

605
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,760
Can I have your business card?
I'll call you when I get there.

606
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,394
Sure.

607
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,765
Call me if you need help.
I'll be right there.

608
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,400
I'm okay. I can manage on my own.

609
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,945
How much did she eat tonight?

610
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,383
Why is she so heavy?

611
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:32,723
Shoot.

612
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,092
She hasn't fixed it yet.

613
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:39,229
How can she be so fearless?

614
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,671
She is so heavy.

615
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,064
Gosh, my back.

616
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,342
What a mess.

617
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,481
Stalker...

618
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:41,525
Bring him to me.

619
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,663
I need him.

620
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,398
What is she saying?

621
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,635
I need Stalker.

622
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:56,907
I need him by my side.

623
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:02,246
My eyes have gone bad.

624
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,320
-Hello?
-Hey, you!

625
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,355
Answer your phone!

626
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,658
Do you want me to worry myself to death?

627
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:49,993
I called you over 20 times!

628
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:53,030
Do you want me to beat you to death?

629
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:56,433
Mom, please speak softly.

630
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,202
I'll die from my ear exploding
before you beat me to death.

631
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:03,373
What's wrong with your voice?

632
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:06,009
Are you sick?

633
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,714
We had a team dinner last night.

634
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,016
I guess I was busy drinking.

635
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:16,853
You don't like to drink.
Why did you drink?

636
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,423
Did something happen?

637
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,793
Mom.

638
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,397
Should I meet the guy
you mentioned the other day?

639
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:30,067
You said you were married to the law.

640
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,937
-I broke up with it.
-Why?

641
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:38,475
I don't know. I guess I'm not for him.

642
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:44,614
How can you change your mind so easily
like flipping pancakes?

643
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,420
I know. What's wrong with me?

644
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,865
Hye-seong. Is there anything you can do?

645
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:07,070
Good morning.

646
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:09,373
Did you get home all right?

647
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,408
Are you feeling okay?

648
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,811
-Yes.
-How do I look?

649
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,781
Do I still look handsome?

650
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,887
Get a hold of yourself.
Are you still drunk?

651
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:36,700
I must be crazy.

652
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,736
My eyes must be broken.

653
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,739
I'm not drunk

654
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,143
and he has his glasses on,
but still looks handsome.

655
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,726
Good morning.

656
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:16,173
Why are you looking at me?
Is there something on my face?

657
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:20,744
Did nothing happen
between you and Ms. Jang?

658
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,579
Nothing happened.

659
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:25,115
Remember the high school student?

660
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,884
Park Su-ha? He came to pick her up.

661
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:31,321
He always walks her here
and comes to take her home.

662
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:33,023
Is he her bodyguard?

663
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:36,493
Mr. Cha.

664
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:41,531
Did you ask Ms. Jjang
if she knows Min Jun-guk?

665
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,543
How do you know Min Jun-guk?

666
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,980
He shared a cell with someone I know.

667
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,682
Do you know him?

668
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:01,852
Yes.

669
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,521
He was recently released.

670
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,257
Apparently he asked about you.

671
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,260
He was released?

672
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:15,332
When was he released?

673
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,435
It's been a little over a month.

674
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,471
He said he owes you something.

675
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,291
Could he have sent these?

676
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,277
I'm sorry.

677
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:30,674
What are you doing here?

678
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:34,578
You didn't answer your phone,
so I just came.

679
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,280
Why haven't you gotten a new lock yet?

680
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,350
Go. I'll take care of it.

681
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,720
It's okay. This is for saving Seong-bin.

682
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:44,955
Just go!

683
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,761
What's wrong? Did something happen?

684
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:54,664
Get lost! Go! Don't ever come here.

685
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,571
He might be working with Min Jun-guk.

686
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,190
-Hello?
-It's me.

687
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,459
Do you recognize my voice?

688
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,896
Yes. You're Mr. Min Jun-guk, right?

689
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:30,800
-How did you know my number?
-I was at your school yesterday.

690
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,770
Park Su-ha.

691
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,474
I didn't recognize you
because you had lied about your name.

692
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:40,710
I guess it's been ten years
since the trial.

693
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:44,414
Where are you right now?

694
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,404
I don't know what you like,
so I got you a shrimp burger.

695
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:09,306
Eat it.

696
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:12,342
So you came, kid.

697
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,011
What are you up to?

698
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,948
You've grown a lot, kid.

699
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:23,019
You read my mind ten years ago.

700
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:26,156
I guess you still have that talent.

701
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:27,223
Talk.

702
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,192
Don't think.

703
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,261
What are you worried about?

704
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:34,164
Why? Do you think I'll hurt you?

705
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:40,170
You were behind the phone.
You put it there, didn't you?

706
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:49,813
Are you scared because of that?
I haven't even gotten started.

707
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:52,816
What are you thinking?

708
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,752
Don't you worry.

709
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,321
I have nothing against you.

710
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:03,026
It was your father, not you
that I had a grudge against ten years ago.

711
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,996
And this time, it's someone else again.

712
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:13,002
If it's not me,

713
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,071
then who is it?

714
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,807
She became a lawyer.

715
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,243
Bitch.

716
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,354
He is hurting me!

717
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:32,889
Oh my gosh!

718
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:39,295
Someone help me!

719
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:15,565
Hello?

720
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:19,769
The police?

721
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:26,443
-Jang Hye-seong. Hello.
-What happened?

722
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,579
You know Park Su-ha, who was with you

723
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:31,681
when you found the phone, right?

724
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:32,916
Yes.

725
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:36,252
He's here for beating someone.

726
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:39,155
We need someone to vouch for him,

727
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:41,124
but he has no parents
and his teacher can't be reached.

728
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,860
That's why we called you, Ms. Jang.

729
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:45,795
What about the victim?

730
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,865
He said he doesn't want him
to be punished and left.

731
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:53,269
He just got released from prison,
so he probably didn't want trouble.

732
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,806
-Released from prison?
-Yes.

733
00:57:56,906 --> 00:58:00,143
There is security footage
of Su-ha hitting him.

734
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,613
So we can't release him
without someone to vouch for him.

735
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:08,184
What is the victim's name?

736
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,187
It's Min Jun-guk.

737
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,022
He was released last month.

738
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:15,358
Why?

739
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,293
Do you know him?

740
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:24,234
Could I see the video?

741
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,504
Let me see. This is from yesterday.

742
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,506
Why did he hit Min Jun-guk?

743
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:30,840
I don't know.

744
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,277
The witnesses said it was one-sided.

745
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,247
There must be a reason.

746
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,015
There is no reason.

747
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:42,719
Jun-guk didn't say anything,
but Su-ha just beat him up.

748
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,854
There were so many witnesses.

749
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,222
I was at the scene, too.

750
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,625
Jun-guk didn't say a word.

751
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,194
Su-ha kept talking on his own.

752
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,298
SUJIK-DONG HAMBURGER
RESTAURANT ASSAULT

753
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,233
I've found it! Here.

754
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,076
-What is Su-ha saying?
-What did he say?

755
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:12,448
He kept telling Jun-guk to speak.

756
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,250
"Don't just think, speak."

757
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:21,824
Speak, you asshole!
Don't just think, speak!

758
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,028
No.

759
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,096
What are you doing? Let go of him first.

760
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:30,300
Someone help me!

761
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,703
If it weren't for her,
you would have killed me ten years ago.

762
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:37,140
So I consider my life a borrowed one.

763
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:39,542
I'm going to protect her.

764
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,445
Let go of him.

765
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,783
I'm going to protect her,

766
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,952
so don't try anything or I'll kill you.

767
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:52,255
-Let go!
-Listen to me!

768
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:53,823
I'm going to kill you.

769
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:57,961
He screamed that he'd kill him
if he hurt some woman.

770
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,064
I almost crapped my pants
tearing him off him.

771
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:02,565
He is totally crazy.

772
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,403
He even had a hammer in his bag.

773
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:10,273
It could have become a huge incident.

774
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:17,347
Listen to me.

775
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,183
If it weren't for her,
you would have killed me ten years ago.

776
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,125
I will...

777
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,430
I will protect you.

778
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:38,034
So I consider my life a borrowed one.

779
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:39,602
I'm going to protect her.

780
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,676
I'm going to protect her with my life.

781
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,311
I will...

782
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:52,782
I will protect you.

783
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:58,187
What is this? You can speak.

784
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:06,529
Kid. What's your name?

785
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:09,932
Su-ha.

786
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,469
Park Su-ha.

787
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,785
I will vouch for him.

788
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,120
Where is Su-ha?

789
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,192
You can't let Min Jun-guk go!

790
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,828
Did you get his address?
What about his phone number?

791
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,365
You don't seem
to understand the situation.

792
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:44,734
You're the one who hit him
and he got beaten up.

793
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:48,337
You're the attacker
and he is the victim, okay?

794
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:53,009
Do you know what he said?
He is going to get revenge.

795
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,279
He is going to kill the witness
who testified against him ten years go.

796
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:58,848
I got statements
from all of the witnesses.

797
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:00,550
But he never said that.

798
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:04,153
Min Jun-guk volunteers
at six different places,

799
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,589
including the soup kitchen
and the abandoned dog shelter.

800
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:09,492
Why are you framing someone

801
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,994
who is trying to live a new life
without any evidence?

802
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,865
You should at least bring proof.

803
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:26,008
-I have proof.
-What? What proof?

804
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:31,681
-I heard it. I can read his--
-Stop it.

805
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,553
Don't say anything foolish.

806
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,157
You'll just become a laughingstock,

807
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:44,327
just like you were ten years ago.

808
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,296
Park Su-ha.

809
