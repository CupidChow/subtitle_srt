1
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,527
The victim is currently unconscious.

2
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,462
You do know you'll be charged with murder

3
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:32,832
if the victim dies, right?

4
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,802
-Objection! The victim is still alive!
-Objection! The victim is still alive!

5
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:43,576
Prosecution,
please restrain from speculation.

6
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,048
No further questions.

7
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,186
Is that all?

8
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:55,922
Yes.

9
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,596
It must be hard for you.

10
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,966
It's all because of me, Ga-yeon.

11
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:19,412
Father, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

12
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,155
Hey, did you see the jury?

13
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,757
How many are on our side?

14
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,326
What? I thought you didn't need me.

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,995
That's still true.

16
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,898
But now that you're here,
tell me the vote.

17
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,568
That's not important. About Seo Do-yeon...

18
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,370
Don't even mention her.

19
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,474
You asked me to let her off, so I did,
but she's a robot.

20
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,076
She didnn't even blink an eye
when she attacked her father...

21
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,578
I don't think it's like that.

22
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,379
What?

23
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,716
I think Hwang Dal-jung knows
that Seo Do-yeon is his daughter.

24
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,852
Really?

25
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,186
How did he know?

26
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,255
Go and find Seo Do-yeon.

27
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,258
-Why?
-I don't think she should be alone.

28
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,193
She went to the restroom.

29
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,262
Okay.

30
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,881
Seo Do-yeon. What's wrong?

31
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,817
Hye-seong.

32
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,453
I...

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,088
I feel like I'm going to die.

34
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,594
Help me.

35
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,932
Please save my dad.

36
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,751
Hey. How are you going to go
into trial like this?

37
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,657
Ms. Jjang.

38
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,426
What are you doing here?

39
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,361
Shouldn't you be preparing your closing?

40
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,199
Ms. Seo?

41
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,267
What are you doing here?

42
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,240
It must have been really hard
to question her father.

43
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,684
It's okay.

44
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,719
I'm better now.

45
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,654
As you know,

46
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,590
if this were a normal trial,

47
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,592
you would never get a dismissal
or a not-guilty verdict.

48
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:51,564
Father was released on parole,
so he can't get a suspended sentence.

49
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,001
If he's found guilty,
he has to go back to jail.

50
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,669
I'm aware.

51
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:00,206
That's why we asked for a jury trial.

52
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,141
We thought
that if the jury says he's innocent,

53
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,345
then we're hoping
the judge may bend the law a little bit.

54
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,381
Could you persuade the jury?

55
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,284
A majority will not be enough.

56
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:13,953
I'll do my best.

57
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,125
Thanks.

58
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,728
Please do your best.

59
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,263
Will you be okay?

60
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,532
Why don't you recuse yourself
from the trial?

61
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,834
No.

62
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,837
I'm going to see this through all the way.

63
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,482
We have to get a unanimous decision
to have a chance of winning.

64
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:48,054
I'll try my best.

65
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:50,523
Ms. Jjang,

66
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,761
could you do the closing argument?

67
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,562
What?

68
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,899
I already failed 26 years ago.

69
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,969
That's all the more reason
for you to do it.

70
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:07,073
Judging by how you looked at her,

71
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,042
you seem more desperate than I do.

72
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,780
So, please do the closing argument.

73
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,056
IN SESSION

74
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,325
The examination phase is over.

75
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,760
Prosecution, tell us what your demand is.

76
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,767
Twenty-six years ago,
the victim, Son Chae-ok,

77
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,903
committed a crime she shouldn't have.

78
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,073
She made the defendant spend more
than half of his life in prison.

79
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,443
But the statute of limitations
on that crime is already over.

80
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,379
Her current charge
would be falsifying her identity...

81
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,148
which would count as obstructing justice.

82
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,318
She would get a one-year sentence,
though probation would be more likely.

83
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,687
But the defendant stabbed the victim

84
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,156
and she is fighting for her life.

85
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,592
It's a much worse punishment

86
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,628
than what the law would have decided.

87
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,599
The defendant spent time in jail
for something he didn't do.

88
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,603
As a prosecutor, I deeply regret
the verdict from 26 years ago.

89
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,707
However,
just because the verdict was regrettable

90
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,976
doesn't mean he can take the law
into his own hands.

91
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,578
He should have a retrial.

92
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,748
And that's when he should punish
Son Chae-ok, no, Jeon Young-ja

93
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,317
with the law, as that is what is right.

94
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,054
That is the order of the law.

95
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,822
If the law is not maintained,

96
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,326
this would be a lawless world full
of vigilante justice.

97
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,596
So that this does not
become a lawless world,

98
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,231
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

99
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,267
I await your wise decision.

100
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,238
How many jurors are on our side?

101
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,580
Only four?

102
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,717
That means there are six left.

103
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,219
Will I be able to persuade them?

104
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,257
Counsel,
please make your closing argument.

105
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,127
Don't be nervous and do well.

106
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,495
"Nervous"?

107
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,331
Do I look nervous?

108
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,410
Your Honor!

109
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,920
Your Honor and members of the jury,

110
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,256
you must be tired
from taking part in this long trial.

111
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,392
Is she hosting a show?

112
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,093
What is she doing?

113
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,281
What are you listening to?

114
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,718
Hi. I always listen to this music
before a trial.

115
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,021
Just like how Park Tae-hwan listens
to music before an event.

116
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,323
What song is it?

117
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,993
It's classical music.

118
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,128
It makes you seem sophisticated.

119
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,132
It's the overture
from The Thieving Magpie, an opera.

120
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,536
Why does it help control your mind?

121
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:27,673
This opera was based on a true story.

122
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,142
"A true story"?

123
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,956
Do you know an opera called
"The Thieving Magpie"?

124
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,959
It's an opera that's based
on a true story.

125
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,561
In this opera,

126
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:52,632
a girl is executed
for stealing a silver plate.

127
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,500
But it turns out

128
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,069
the culprit who stole the silver plate

129
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,338
is a magpie.

130
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:03,976
What comes to your mind
when you hear this story?

131
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,146
"That girl was so unlucky."

132
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,982
"Why did the magpie
have to steal that plate?"

133
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,817
Don't those thoughts come to mind?

134
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:16,522
No, the girl didn't die
because she was unlucky.

135
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,224
And the magpie is not at fault, either.

136
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:22,228
However, in this case,
there is a perpetrator.

137
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:27,033
It's those
who didn't find out the truth properly

138
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,670
and rashly sentenced the girl to death.

139
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,172
Everyone in that courtroom

140
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,274
was the perpetrator.

141
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,687
These photos are those

142
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,023
of the defendant's high school friends.

143
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,059
They are currently living

144
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,728
as fathers, husbands,

145
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,130
and office workers.

146
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,068
If the trial from 26 years ago
had produced the correct verdict,

147
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,071
then the defendant...

148
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,907
would also be living like these people.

149
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,877
The girl's death cannot be reversed.

150
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:17,516
Neither can the 26 years
that the defendant lost.

151
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,398
Of course, as the prosecutor said,

152
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:36,235
he should have followed the law
when he encountered the victim.

153
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,972
But what do you think
the law meant to him?

154
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:45,144
It was the law that put him
in jail for half of his life.

155
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,179
It was the law
that took away his daughter.

156
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,515
And it was the law
that took away his job and friends.

157
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,552
And here we are forcing the law
on the defendant again.

158
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,721
If you were the defendant,

159
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,057
would you be able to accept that law?

160
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,601
The defendant could go to retrial

161
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,505
and be compensated for his time.

162
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,640
But that would happen
in a few months' time.

163
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:18,277
A retrial is a very complicated process.

164
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,446
That is how stingy the judiciary is

165
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,883
about correcting its faults right away.

166
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,055
To the defendant
who doesn't have much longer to live,

167
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,223
each day is very precious to him.

168
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,861
The defendant could die before seeing

169
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,530
whether he could have a retrial.

170
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,874
Your Honor, the closing argument is longer
than the allotted time.

171
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,476
For 26 years!

172
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,114
For 26 years,
the defendant has waited for this moment.

173
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,149
It will be over soon.

174
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,186
Please listen for a little bit longer.

175
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:05,958
Please give defense counsel a chance
to say everything she wants to say.

176
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,562
Counsel.

177
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,965
Please continue.

178
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,502
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

179
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,105
and Your Honor.

180
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,742
This trial is about figuring out

181
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,011
whether this man is guilty.

182
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,981
But it's also a trial to determine
whether the judiciary was guilty

183
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,683
of making a wrong decision in the past.

184
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,553
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

185
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,058
you should determine the result
for a retrial in the judiciary's stead.

186
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,793
And show the defendant

187
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,363
what the citizens think the law is

188
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,899
with your verdict.

189
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,735
VERDICT: THE JURY DECIDES GUILT
OR INNOCENCE AND DEGREE OF PUNISHMENT

190
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,182
Thank you for listening
to my long closing.

191
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,950
Nothing further.

192
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,387
Su-ha!

193
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,861
What are you doing here?

194
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,832
We've been fighting for a while
because of this trial.

195
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,970
What's that on your nails?

196
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,271
What?

197
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,440
Who? What?

198
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,610
Is the verdict out?
Is he going back to prison?

199
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,814
We don't know yet.
The jury and judge don't agree.

200
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,382
What's the jury's verdict?

201
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,918
-Not guilty.
-What about the judge?

202
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,053
Guilty.

203
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,955
Then this is over.

204
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:19,391
The judge will win.
Judges are really powerful.

205
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,661
Why bother having a jury
if the judge is going to decide?

206
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,500
Why did you call us here
if you're not going to listen to us?

207
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,003
I know. We think he's not guilty.

208
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,572
That's the conclusion we got
after this 10-hour trial.

209
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,407
Yes, I know.

210
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,110
But we have the law in Korea, don't we?

211
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,012
This is what we think the law is.

212
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,914
Common sense is the law.

213
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,215
We feel so bad for him.

214
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,985
It's cruel to send him back to jail.

215
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,453
You're really mean.

216
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,022
YEONJU DISTRICT COURT

217
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,760
Call the defense counsel and prosecution
to the mediation room.

218
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:55,928
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

219
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,029
MEDIATION ROOM - 206

220
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,738
YEONJU DISTRICT COURT
MEDIATION ROOM 206

221
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,750
Why are you hesitating?

222
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,919
The jury's verdict is just a guide.

223
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,854
It has no legal binding power!

224
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,790
But the jury's decision was unanimous.

225
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,092
How can I go against it?

226
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,694
It's too much of a burden.

227
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,665
Of course, your verdict should be in line
with the jury's decision.

228
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,833
That's much less of a burden.

229
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,571
Hello? Yes, Yu-chang.

230
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,476
No, you should follow the law,
not the jury's verdict!

231
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,012
Shut your mouth, Grass Head! I can't hear!

232
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,581
Yes.

233
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:50,983
Yes.

234
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,885
Okay. Thank you.

235
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,288
Jeon Young-ja just woke up.

236
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,791
Doesn't this change things?

237
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,628
Why?

238
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,463
Is there something on my face?

239
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:09,868
It seems Mr. Jo is the only one
who doesn't agree, right?

240
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,138
I still think Judge Kim shouldn't agree
with the jury.

241
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,508
Then it will be a huge issue
in the news tomorrow.

242
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,312
They'll ask why you even
had a jury trial to begin with.

243
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,882
Ms. Seo, why are you quiet?

244
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,417
Tell us what you think.

245
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,820
Why don't we drop the indictment?

246
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,722
PROSECUTION REQUESTS
CANCELLATION OF INDICTMENT

247
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,790
Hey. Are you crazy?

248
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,125
Really?

249
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,828
Would that be okay?

250
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,530
If that's possible, that would be great.

251
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,133
It would be less burdensome to us.

252
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,534
No.

253
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,970
You can't decide this on your own.

254
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,872
We need approval from the Director
of Prosecutions.

255
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,974
It's too late to get an approval.

256
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,342
And,

257
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,679
isn't the prosecutor
an independent judicial officer?

258
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,082
According to the principles,
we don't need approval.

259
00:16:58,617 --> 00:16:59,818
You...

260
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,754
I'll take full responsibility.

261
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,857
The final decision is
that the indictment will be dismissed.

262
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:08,861
IN SESSION

263
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,697
The announcement for case number 2013-1354

264
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,567
regarding Hwang Dal-jung will begin.

265
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,337
Defendant, please rise.

266
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,544
You'll get in so much trouble.
It won't end with a warning.

267
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,479
I know.

268
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,915
Even though the defendant

269
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,683
was wrongly accused
of murdering the victim,

270
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,620
it should have been handled
through a retrial.

271
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,357
He should not have attacked the victim
who was still alive.

272
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:43,395
According to legal principles,
it is difficult to say he is not guilty.

273
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,934
However,
all ten jurors believe he is not guilty.

274
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,738
And they believe the defendant was found
guilty of an act he did not commit

275
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,841
and lost his daughter
and life by being imprisoned.

276
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,378
And he lost 26 years of his life.

277
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,614
In a way,
the former judges and prosecutors

278
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:07,386
have ruined a man's life by not being able
to find out the truth properly.

279
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,422
Therefore, it is hard to accept

280
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,159
that this man would be punished again
in the name of the law.

281
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,430
He could get a retrial, but it would be
only monetary compensation.

282
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:22,101
And the defendant's 26 years
could never be returned.

283
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:27,139
The defendant is terminally ill
and if he were found guilty,

284
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:32,177
it is highly possible
that he would pass away in jail.

285
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:37,916
He was enraged that the victim
did not repent for ruining his life,

286
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,220
and he impulsively attacked the victim
with a small glass piece.

287
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,156
As he has already served 26 years in jail,

288
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,459
the jury found it is too cruel
to punish him

289
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:51,063
for attempted murder of the same person.

290
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:56,301
It's not for the citizens to be eye-level
with the law,

291
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:01,507
but the law should be eye-level
with the people. That is our view.

292
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,410
And we believe
that is the spirit of a jury trial.

293
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,412
Also, just because the jury's verdict

294
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,582
is different from legal principles
or existing jurisprudence,

295
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,185
does not mean that it is wrong.

296
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,921
Consequently, while we were deliberating,

297
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,757
the prosecution decided
to respect the opinions of the people

298
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,093
and dismiss the indictment.

299
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,565
Thus, pursuant to Article 328, section 1,
clause 1 of the Penal Code,

300
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,002
the charge has been dismissed.

301
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,937
INDICTMENT DISMISSED AND TRIAL TERMINATED

302
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,462
Will you be okay?

303
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,197
You'll probably be punished.

304
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,733
I said it knowing I may be.

305
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,005
Aren't you leaving?

306
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,173
No.

307
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,542
I want to stay a little longer.

308
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,959
I'm sorry.

309
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,664
"Sorry"?

310
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,499
Not, "thank you"?

311
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,102
Eleven years ago,

312
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,406
for lying and making you the culprit,

313
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,275
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,981
Do you finally believe
that I didn't do it?

315
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,582
After 11 years?

316
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,054
I think I didn't want to admit...

317
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:07,693
that I could be wrong,
just like my father.

318
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:12,531
I realized today
how terrible it is not to admit...

319
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,634
that one can be wrong.

320
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,575
I apologize.

321
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,811
Sincerely.

322
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,581
Sure.

323
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,833
COURT OF LAW

324
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,771
Let's take my car.
I'll take you to the hospital.

325
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,042
-Why?
-In that piece of junk?

326
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,745
I haven't had an accident in 16 years.

327
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,624
That is my daughter Ga-yeon, right?

328
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,694
Yes. How did you know?

329
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,163
She came to see me yesterday.

330
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,564
Really?

331
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,702
Then you must know about this, too.

332
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,871
Judge Seo Dae-seok turned a blind eye

333
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:29,441
when he had found out your wife was alive.

334
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:34,813
When I heard that he had adopted Ga-yeon,

335
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,682
I sort of guessed that.

336
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:41,820
Aren't you angry?

337
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,054
I am.

338
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:47,292
I'm so angry
that I could kill him if I saw him.

339
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,661
But,

340
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,029
I forgive him.

341
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,432
"Forgive"?

342
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,803
Can you forgive him?

343
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,071
How can you?

344
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:03,041
I don't have much time.

345
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:08,413
I don't want to use the rest
of my life hating someone.

346
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:13,285
I don't want the emotions I feel

347
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,988
before I die to be so horrible.

348
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,192
That's why I'm forgiving him.

349
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:24,830
I'm not doing it
because I like Seo Dae-seok.

350
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,900
Promise me.

351
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:35,941
Don't waste your life hating someone,
okay?

352
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,079
You only live once.

353
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,984
There's barely enough time to love people.

354
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,820
Okay?

355
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:37,836
Is that you, Do-yeon?

356
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,639
Have you had dinner?

357
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,717
What's with you again? My gosh.

358
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,655
Do-yeon.

359
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,390
Mom.

360
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,094
Whatever I tell you,
I'm still your daughter, right?

361
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,766
What's wrong?

362
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,935
What happened?

363
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,970
Good heavens.

364
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,909
Mom, please don't be shocked

365
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,245
and listen to what I have to say.

366
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,047
Okay?

367
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,116
What is it?

368
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,724
You haven't changed yet?

369
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,293
I'm just going to sleep like this.

370
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,263
I can't even lift a finger.

371
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,000
I guess you did do your best today.

372
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,236
It wasn't just me.

373
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,574
You helped me win the trial. Thank you.

374
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:53,278
I didn't do much. You did all the work.

375
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:57,382
No. I wouldn't have been able
to do anything without you.

376
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,455
This is a problem.

377
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,991
I can't keep relying on you.

378
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,860
Why not?

379
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,595
Why do you think?

380
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:11,830
That's because...

381
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,732
The "Attempted Murder of a Ghost" case...

382
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:16,067
Oh! It's coming on.

383
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:16,968
What is?

384
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,638
At today's jury trial,
the charges were dismissed.

385
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,973
Virtually,
he received a not-guilty verdict.

386
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,143
Because the jury
unanimously voted not guilty,

387
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,813
the tribunal decided to drop the charges
in keeping with the purpose to have juries

388
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,216
despite what would have been
a guilty verdict under the law.

389
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:35,553
Mr. Hwang was arrested on July 3rd
for the attempted murder

390
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,056
of his wife who had framed him
for murder 26 years ago.

391
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,157
Now, to our next story.

392
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:45,163
Dog poop. Is that all?
How could they not show my face?

393
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,099
I was the true heroine of this trial.

394
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,934
How could they not mention me?

395
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,837
Didn't you see me defend him?

396
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,106
How can they do that?

397
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,175
Is that what they call the news?

398
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,743
You said it was all because of me.

399
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,946
Hey. I didn't really mean that.

400
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,350
Shall I call them?
Should I have a press conference?

401
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:12,991
Why is there only one bowl?
Do you have plans?

402
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,862
I'm going take Do-yeon
and stay with my parents for a while.

403
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,597
Why?

404
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,504
I heard everything from Do-yeon.

405
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,506
Even about Hwang Dal-jung.

406
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,415
I lived with you for over 30 years,
but I didn't know.

407
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,418
I didn't know you were so cruel.

408
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,389
I'm so scared that for a while...

409
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,693
No, for a pretty long time...

410
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,130
I won't be able to look at you.

411
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,450
What did I do wrong?

412
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,732
I didn't do anything wrong.

413
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,740
I didn't do anything wrong!

414
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,287
I got up to do the closing argument,

415
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,790
and my hands were shaking so bad.

416
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,058
I know what you mean.
You can't control them, right?

417
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,928
Yes, I couldn't think of anything.

418
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,329
It was as if my head went blank.

419
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,497
So?

420
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:03,868
That's when I remembered
what you had said about mind control.

421
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,970
Do you mean "The Thieving Magpie"?

422
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:12,177
First, I started out
with "The Thieving Magpie" story.

423
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,612
Then I put up his friends' photos

424
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,182
and I could tell
some of the jurors were affected.

425
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,150
That's when I knew I had them.

426
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,785
Mr. Shin.

427
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,220
Please tell him

428
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,722
how my closing argument went.

429
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,226
I don't want to boast,
so I can't say it myself.

430
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,963
She was good. Ms. Jjang was the best.

431
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,699
If Mr. Shin is praising you,

432
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,601
you must have been good.

433
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,203
Did you hear that?

434
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,139
Yu-chang, come and listen.

435
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,074
Now comes the important part.

436
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,475
She was good.

437
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:48,012
If I had done the closing argument...

438
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,350
the jury wouldn't have
unanimously voted for us.

439
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,254
I would only have been able
to persuade half of them.

440
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,756
You're being too modest.

441
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,458
Tell them about the mediation-room part.

442
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,127
Yu-chang, come sit down.

443
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,336
I thought, "26 years ago,

444
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,239
why couldn't I do what Ms. Jjang did?"

445
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,908
I really questioned myself.

446
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,943
I wonder...

447
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,046
if I appeared conceited this whole time

448
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,849
just because I have experience.

449
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:29,087
I think I've been too blunt
and patronizing.

450
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,789
I'm really sorry.

451
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,126
It's okay. It's all in the past.

452
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,494
Stop talking about that.

453
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,364
Please tell them
what I was like yesterday.

454
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,966
Ms. Jjang, I'll hear how
you were yesterday

455
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,535
from Mr. Shin another day.

456
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,905
Why? Why don't you hear it now?

457
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,642
I would love to,
but I forgot I have an interview.

458
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,010
I'll make sure to hear it.

459
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,444
Really?

460
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,914
You should hear it, too.

461
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,383
Yes, I'll make sure I do.

462
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,919
I'm going to check if you heard it later.

463
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,155
Then, I'm going to get coffee.

464
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,723
Does anyone want anything?

465
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,926
No.

466
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,094
That's better for me.

467
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,736
Ms. Jang is so infinitely frivolous.

468
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,505
And she is so slow-witted.

469
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,009
Are you okay, Mr. Shin?

470
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,012
Yes, of course. I'm okay.

471
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,792
Ms. Seo.

472
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:46,297
You're so short that it's hard
to believe that you're my father.

473
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,372
Here are the things you had
when you were arrested.

474
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,748
Weren't there some crayons in here?

475
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,626
Didn't you buy these for me?

476
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,031
Please come sit down.

477
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,270
Are you going to draw me?

478
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:33,277
My face must be bloated
because it's early in the morning.

479
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,348
You look the same as last night.

480
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,219
Really?

481
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:47,125
I'll come whenever I can to draw you,
Father.

482
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,526
Sure.

483
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:55,833
What?

484
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,569
I'll come whenever I can.

485
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,272
What did you say after that?

486
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,148
Father.

487
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,536
Don't move. You'll ruin the picture.

488
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,045
Okay. Sure.

489
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,648
Sure.

490
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,206
If you pour your own drink,
you'll be unlucky for three years.

491
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,540
Hi.

492
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,045
The trial ended well.

493
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,713
Why aren't you happy about it?

494
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,084
What would've happened

495
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:26,991
if Hwang Dal-jung had someone else
as his lawyer 26 years ago?

496
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,192
What?

497
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:37,401
If he had met a lawyer
like you or Ms. Jjang,

498
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:42,507
he wouldn't have wasted his life
like this, right?

499
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,082
Mr. Shin.

500
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:57,788
Didn't someone spread poop
all over your car seven years ago?

501
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,360
How did you know that?

502
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,500
I... was the one who did it.

503
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,203
What? Why?

504
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,338
You didn't know me then.

505
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,841
I did it because I didn't.

506
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,710
You jerk!

507
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,579
You jerk!

508
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:25,917
Do you know how hard it was
to wash it all off?

509
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,486
Why did you do that?

510
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,754
I'll tell you if you don't hit me.

511
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,323
I'll decide that after I hear it.
Tell me at once!

512
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,225
Do you remember
the Red Socks of Wolje-dong?

513
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,427
He was indicted
for serial rape and murder.

514
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,597
Yes! How can I forget? I defended him.

515
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,633
I was the one who caught him.

516
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:44,735
What?

517
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,206
SEVEN YEARS AGO

518
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,047
He's here.

519
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,683
I got you.

520
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,851
Red Socks.

521
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,595
When I was with the police,

522
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,698
I went without sleep or being able
to change my underwear for ten days,

523
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,033
and staked him out so I could get him.

524
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:21,672
We had his hair, footprints,
and a lot of other evidence.

525
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,475
The most crucial one was some toilet paper

526
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:28,112
that had the victim's blood and his semen
on it.

527
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,283
He kept saying that he didn't do it.

528
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:36,087
I interrogated him for three days
without sleep and got a confession.

529
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:37,188
Kim Su-hwan!

530
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,489
Kim Su-hwan!

531
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:39,991
Hey!

532
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,126
Shall I tell you again?

533
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,729
This is the toilet paper you used.

534
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:48,432
There's your semen and the victim's blood
on it.

535
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,201
How will you explain this?

536
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,203
How are you going to explain this?

537
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,006
You killed her, right?

538
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,073
Right?

539
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,109
Yes, I killed her.

540
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,543
Right?

541
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,714
Get up!

542
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,516
You made the right decision.

543
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:06,917
Detective Cha.

544
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,152
Hello.

545
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,888
Thank you so much.

546
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,490
It was nothing.

547
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,997
Thank you.

548
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,166
Thank you so much.

549
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:26,170
The victim's mother thanked me
over and over.

550
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:34,045
After all that, some public defender
got him a not-guilty verdict at trial.

551
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:38,149
He said there wasn't enough evidence
and that the confession was coerced.

552
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,985
So he got a not-guilty verdict
because of reasonable doubt.

553
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,523
That's right.
That public defender was me. Me!

554
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,458
Is that why you sprayed poop on my car?

555
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:48,726
Yes, I did.

556
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:53,698
I was so angry that you let him go
with just a few words.

557
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,200
So it was you!

558
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:59,070
How could you do that?

559
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,206
Red Socks was innocent!

560
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,909
I know! The real murderer was caught
the following month.

561
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,143
What?

562
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,778
The real murderer was caught?

563
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,247
Yes, we caught him.

564
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:14,085
We found the victim's things
and the weapon at his place.

565
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,253
And he confessed to the crime, too.

566
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,023
So what was that toilet paper
with the blood on it?

567
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,592
You said Red Sock's semen was on it.

568
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:25,129
The victim's blood had splattered
onto the toilet paper he had thrown away.

569
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,264
I didn't think of that.

570
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,967
See? I was right.

571
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:31,335
I was right!

572
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,171
You could have put the wrong man away.

573
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:38,476
He almost went to jail for a long time
because of some toilet paper.

574
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:44,048
Yes, you saved two people, Mr. Shin.

575
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,751
You saved Red Socks
from going to jail in vain.

576
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,555
And you saved a policeman
who almost sent an innocent man to jail.

577
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:56,627
That's why I quit the police force
and started studying law,

578
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,464
so I could become a public defender
like you.

579
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,869
You're the one who got me started.

580
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:09,573
So stop blaming yourself
and just stay right where you are.

581
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,077
Keep nagging and scolding me

582
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,712
just as you have been.

583
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,157
Mr. Shin.

584
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,029
That's really great.

585
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,705
Hey. Do you know how hard it was
to wash it all off my car?

586
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:47,912
The poop smell stayed for three years.
For three whole years.

587
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,165
Su-ha.

588
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,368
Get up. It's morning.

589
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,349
What is this?
Why are you wearing that at home?

590
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,888
Is this a dream?

591
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,591
Do you think this could be real?

592
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,160
Your dream is so childish.

593
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,496
Look at this dress.

594
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,266
Why? It's pretty.

595
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,136
Never mind. Wake up already
This is too uncomfortable.

596
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,475
No, this is my dream.

597
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,410
I'll get up when I want to.

598
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:24,808
What is this?

599
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,151
No. This can't happen.

600
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,686
Get up! Get a hold of yourself.

601
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:42,259
No, get up. This can't be happening.

602
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,564
No. Get up.

603
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:50,000
Su-ha. Get up.

604
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,005
Look at all that sweat.

605
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,641
Did you have a bad dream?

606
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,312
What are you doing?

607
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,715
I'm so glad you're okay.

608
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,485
What dream did you have?

609
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,689
It's nothing.

610
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,125
Then why are you acting like this?

611
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,735
Hello.

612
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:12,850
TO: JANG HYE-SEONG

613
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,489
TO: CHA GUAN-WOO

614
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,666
TO: JANG HYE-SEONG
TO: CHA GUAN-WOO

615
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,580
ATTORNEY CHA GUAN-WOO

616
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:53,957
REPORTER KIM DONG-GEUN

617
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,126
This time it isn't
Park Ju-hyeok's article.

618
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:01,165
"A Mr. Min who caused
a scene at a hospital"?

619
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,800
SEGI UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

620
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,305
MR. MIN ARRESTED, DRUNK AND DISORDERLY

621
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,709
Could this be Min Jun-guk?

622
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,883
IS KOREA'S WELFARE SYSTEM ANY GOOD?
ELDERLY WOMAN WITH DEMENTIA DIED ALONE

623
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,186
"An old lady
with dementia starves to death."

624
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,854
What is this?

625
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,794
Ma'am!

626
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,963
The daughter-in-law died
from heart disease.

627
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,265
The son was arrested?

628
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:38,569
Could this be...

629
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,405
Good morning!

630
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,007
Why are you here so early?

631
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,243
I have a lot to prepare
for my trial today.

632
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:48,512
What were you looking at?

633
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,013
They're...

634
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,082
They're appeals!

635
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,351
Oh, appeals.

636
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:56,620
I see.

637
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,890
Why are there so many appeals?

638
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,832
You're still pale.

639
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,901
Won't you tell me about the dream?

640
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,169
No.

641
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,738
This is so unfair.

642
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:18,142
You can read my thoughts,
but you won't tell me yours.

643
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:21,378
I don't even want to talk about it.
That's why.

644
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,748
Was it an erotic dream?

645
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,684
I guess he's a guy, too.

646
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,319
It's not like that.

647
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:31,355
I must be right. You're so mad.

648
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,690
No, it isn't I said!

649
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,193
Okay. All right. Let's say it's not.

650
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,228
It really wasn't such a dream.

651
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:39,830
Okay.

652
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,933
You go ahead.
I have to get these shoes fixed.

653
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,034
I'll come with you.

654
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:45,302
It will take some time.

655
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,437
You'll be late for class. Go on.

656
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,555
This is so pretty.

657
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,191
But it's a little expensive.

658
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,794
I could buy over 300 sausages
for that price.

659
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,310
That little thing is really expensive.

660
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,380
I shouldn't have bought
those hiking shoes.

661
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,350
I wonder if my uncle has sent me money.

662
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:36,887
These are good times.

663
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,422
Sir,

664
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,290
I want to date, too.

665
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,625
You're crazy.

666
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,561
Does your wife know about this, too?

667
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,797
If she did, I would be dead.

668
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:51,835
What's she doing?

669
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,339
Don't you have a new one?

670
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:59,243
No, this is the last one we have.

671
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:01,578
-Really?
-No. That can't happen.

672
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,784
I don't like the ones that
have been on display.

673
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,388
Shall I buy it or not?

674
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:18,061
Sir, Park Su-ha is running.

675
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:19,563
Go after him.

676
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:21,164
Shoot.

677
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,608
Please select the button.

678
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:39,383
BALANCE: 1,038,411 WON

679
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:42,452
WITHDRAWAL

680
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,556
Please take your cash.

681
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:50,961
Is he running again? My gosh.

682
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,003
It's been on display.

683
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,605
Give me a 20,000-won discount.

684
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:06,576
Even the open-air markets
have fixed prices these days.

685
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,779
You can't get a discount.

686
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,448
Really? I'll buy this one.

687
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:17,387
You should give me the mirror
and the bracelet as extra gifts.

688
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:21,325
Those are gifts for those
who spend over one million won.

689
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,293
I'll buy more later.

690
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,300
Give me that necklace. I'll buy it.

691
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:33,870
Yes, sir.

692
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,473
Oh, hallelujah.

693
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,832
They say that my right side looks better.

694
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,167
Don't move.

695
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,570
Both sides look the same to me.

696
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:07,938
Really?

697
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,141
I see.

698
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:20,183
Do you think I could have raised you
just as well as this?

699
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:22,185
Of course.

700
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,990
I would have been pretty and smart,
no matter where I was raised.

701
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,659
That's a relief.

702
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,508
What do you think?

703
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,976
Isn't it just like you?

704
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,111
Yes, it is.

705
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:51,081
That's a good drawing.

706
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:56,720
But I think you were right
to become a prosecutor.

707
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:58,488
What?

708
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,226
Can you take a selfie with your phone?

709
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:04,628
Let's take a photo together.

710
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,129
What?

711
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:10,233
Let's take one and send it
to Mr. Shin and Ms. Jang.

712
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,468
What?

713
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,645
What is this?

714
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:24,714
SEO DO-YEON

715
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,684
What is this?

716
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:41,998
Oh gosh!

717
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,035
What's wrong?

718
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:52,309
I just saw something more horrible
than you can imagine.

719
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,151
Yu-chang, do you have a new thumb cover?

720
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:03,553
No, I don't.

721
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,989
Try Mr. Cha's desk.

722
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,225
He always has a few extra.

723
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:10,494
When is he coming in?

724
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,297
Let me see. He should be back soon.

725
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,533
He doesn't have any trials this afternoon.

726
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:23,039
TO: JANG HYE-SEONG

727
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,880
This letter is addressed to me.

728
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:34,184
What is this?

729
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:36,620
I saw him looking at it away from me.

730
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:37,988
"Away" from you?

731
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,657
Yes, when I came in, he hid it right away.

732
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:45,362
Why did Mr. Cha read my letter?

733
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:47,497
LEGENDARY 100% SUCCESS RATE
HEART TRANSPLANT SURGERY

734
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,669
Mr. Cha. Here you are.

735
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,538
Ms. Jjang.

736
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,380
Why do you have a letter
that is addressed to me?

737
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,817
Well... that is...

738
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,260
-Stop right there!
-Stop!

739
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:21,565
The license plate number is 4885.

740
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:27,370
-Are you okay?
-Yes. He's out and about early.

741
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:29,706
I have to get that bag back.

742
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,209
Don't worry. I know who that is.

743
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,145
It's me.

744
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,747
That 4885 is at it again.

745
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:40,584
Go to his hideout and bring him in.

746
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,698
What are you doing there?

747
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:57,634
Where are Mr. Cha and Ms. Jjang?

748
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,841
Why are they so serious?

749
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:08,912
You can't hear them?

750
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:15,518
Mr. Cha.

751
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,654
Look at me. Right now.

752
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,888
I'm looking at you.

753
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,628
Explain this. What is this?

754
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,296
Who is Park Ju-hyeok?

755
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,932
And what about the old lady with dementia
and her grandson?

756
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,434
-I can't tell you.
-Mr. Cha!

757
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,337
I can't tell you. I'm sorry.

758
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:37,907
I don't want to lie to you.
So please don't ask anymore.

759
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,280
You must be doing this for me.

760
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:47,484
There must be a good reason.
That's the kind of person you are.

761
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,287
It must be one of the following.

762
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:54,591
Either it will hurt me
or hurt someone else.

763
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,863
If it's me, then I'm really disappointed.

764
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:05,201
I can't believe you think I'm so pathetic
that I can't handle it.

765
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,204
Okay.

766
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,240
I'll find out for myself.

767
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:15,578
Park Ju-hyeok is Park Su-ha's father.

768
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:19,149
The old lady with dementia
and grandson are

769
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:22,952
Min Jun-guk's mother and son.

770
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,390
And the one who sent you the letter

771
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:29,959
is Min Jun-guk.

772
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:43,306
Su-ha.

773
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:45,442
Here.

774
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,243
You really found it.

775
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,346
Thank you. Thank you so much.

776
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,082
-Check if anything is missing.
-Okay.

777
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:56,353
It's here.

778
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:59,122
What about your wallet and mobile phone?

779
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:04,661
The wallet is here and so is the money.

780
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:10,633
I think my phone is missing.

781
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,136
It's really not here.

782
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,872
When did he take it out?

783
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,908
Don't worry.
I'll tell the guys to look for it.

784
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:21,411
You can take your time.

785
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,246
I've found this, so it's okay.

786
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,048
Thank you!

787
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,950
Hey, stop running.

788
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,220
I should have tailed Ms. Jang instead.

789
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:34,958
-Yu-chang.
-Yes.

790
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:38,928
How do I set this photo as my wallpaper?

791
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,297
Oh. Hold on a moment.

792
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,903
Are you really going to use this?

793
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,037
Yes.

794
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:51,141
You have a very strong stomach.

795
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,845
Hey, it's you.

796
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,448
Isn't Ms. Jang in?

797
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,984
She went to court for a trial at 2 p.m.

798
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:02,752
She went with Mr. Cha.

799
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:04,654
Really?

800
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:06,322
Thank you.

801
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:08,091
Do it.

802
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,093
Are you sure?

803
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,195
Just do as you're told.

804
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,870
-Yes?
-Is the trial over?

805
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,306
No, we didn't even get to start.

806
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,542
-Why?
-The lawyer didn't come.

807
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:29,913
She didn't come for 30 minutes,
so we had the trial postponed.

808
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:32,715
Why didn't she come?

809
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,050
Who knows?

810
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,719
The judge kept calling,
but couldn't get hold of her.

811
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,929
Park Su-ha!

812
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,135
Do you know where Ms. Jjang is?

813
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:53,236
Ms. Jjang?

814
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,838
Isn't she in trial?

815
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,873
It must have started at 2:00 p.m.

816
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,108
She wasn't there. They couldn't reach her.

817
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:01,578
That can't be. Did you try calling?

818
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:04,881
No, I lost my phone to a thief.

819
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,585
Hello? Ms. Jjang?

820
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:12,922
It got cut off.

821
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,825
I walked her to court.

822
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,764
Is it because of that article?

823
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:24,701
No, that can't be.

824
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,104
By chance,

825
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,974
did you tell Ms. Jjang about my father?

826
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:32,609
What?

827
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,445
Yes.

828
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,381
While going through my desk,

829
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:41,217
she found the articles
Min Jun-guk had sent.

830
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,456
I'm sorry. I had no choice.

831
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:49,626
Does she know everything?

832
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,427
Yes.

833
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:53,096
Almost.

834
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,200
So...

835
00:58:58,101 --> 00:58:59,602
That's why she disappeared.

836
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:02,205
No. This has nothing to do
with her finding out.

837
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:04,207
-This is--
-What do you know?

838
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:08,144
Why did you tell her?

839
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,418
Park Su-ha!

840
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:16,619
Park Su-ha!

841
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:21,424
Sir.

842
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,927
Let's change the person
we are in charge of now.

843
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:27,564
I'll take Ms. Jang.
You should take Park Su-ha.

844
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:31,301
No, we should stick to
who we're in charge of.

845
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:34,837
I think I'm going to die
from following him.

846
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,606
Hurry up.

847
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:37,974
You're going to lose him.

848
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:41,210
He's really fast.

849
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,448
Isn't that?

850
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:48,418
Did you see Ms. Jjang?

851
00:59:48,484 --> 00:59:51,487
-You went in with her.
-So you didn't see her come out?

852
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:52,922
No. Why?

853
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:54,190
She's disappeared.

854
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:57,727
-She didn't come to court.
-That can't be.

855
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,098
I stayed right here.
I didn't even go to the toilet.

856
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:05,802
Unless she snuck out on purpose,
I couldn't have missed her.

857
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:08,304
She's not answering her phone.
Where did she go?

858
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:50,580
I'm not the one who started all of this!

859
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,149
It was your father!

860
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,921
Is there anything
else you haven't told me?

861
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,557
Is that all you lied about?

862
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:23,780
What should I tell her?

863
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:26,616
No excuses will work.

864
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:29,819
What if she hangs up
when she hears my voice?

865
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:34,924
Will I be able to live
if this is the end for us?

866
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:53,676
Hello?

867
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:56,012
It's Su-ha. Don't hang up on me.

868
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:59,015
I heard everything from Mr. Cha.
You heard about my father--

869
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:02,518
I've been waiting for you to call,
Park Su-ha.

870
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,056
Are you looking for Jang Hye-seong?

871
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,908
On July 26, 2013, at 3:10 p.m.,

872
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,411
she was kidnapped by Min Jun-guk.

873
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:31,347
Two hours and thirty minutes later,

874
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:35,218
our 11-year story came to an end.

875
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,689
