1
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:39,172
I'm not the one who started all of this!

2
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,342
It was your father!

3
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,982
So that was what I wanted to erase.

4
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,786
But erasing it won't make it go away.

5
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,736
What will I do with you?

6
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,074
She'll resent me more
if she finds out about this.

7
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:19,612
She'll be so afraid
if she finds out Min Jun-guk is alive.

8
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,250
Min Jun-guk is alive.
Su-ha didn't kill him.

9
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,719
So he kept the promise he made.

10
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,329
Hello?

11
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,165
Where are you? Are you at home?

12
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,937
No. I'm outside.

13
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,207
Min Jun-guk is alive.
Seo Do-yeon and Mr. Cha found out.

14
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,741
I see.

15
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,145
What's with that response?
Min Jun-guk is alive.

16
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,014
You're innocent.
You don't have to go to trial.

17
00:01:55,582 --> 00:02:00,420
If he's alive,
that means you're in danger.

18
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,189
You fool. We can worry about that later.

19
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,259
Seo Do-yeon won't appeal again.
She told me so.

20
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,428
So you're no longer a defendant--

21
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,231
Hey, you...

22
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,868
You're the fool.

23
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,005
Your life is in danger again.

24
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,908
How can my innocence come first?

25
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,577
How can you be like that?

26
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,828
Thank you for having kept your promise.

27
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,414
You're innocent now.
You have nothing to be afraid of.

28
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,284
Go register at a cram school
and prepare for the GED.

29
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,654
Make up what you've missed for a year,
okay?

30
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:08,955
Okay.

31
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,392
I already registered
at a cram school and for the GED.

32
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,295
I took the GED, too.

33
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,698
You and I are quite similar in many ways.

34
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,236
What about your memory? Not yet?

35
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,273
Not yet.

36
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,510
I see.

37
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,715
If your memory returns,
you have to do as you promised.

38
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,517
You can never come looking for me again.

39
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,219
Why?

40
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,522
Why do you think?
There's no reason to be together.

41
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,358
I was your guarantor and lawyer.

42
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,127
Once you get a not-guilty verdict
and your memory back, go live your life.

43
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,729
And don't mooch off me.

44
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,801
Mooch off you? I'm mooching off you?

45
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,370
Was I too harsh?

46
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,173
No, I was right.

47
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,509
If I give him any leeway,
it will be hard to fold my feelings in.

48
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,012
"My feelings"?

49
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,684
Don't you think I'm right?
You're mooching off me right now.

50
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,588
Will I be able to forget about him?

51
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:21,027
I will be able to hide my feelings
until Su-ha leaves.

52
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,500
No way.

53
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,307
Do I still bother you?
Do you still hate me?

54
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,809
Yes, I do.

55
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,645
I like you.

56
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,617
Do you really want me to leave?

57
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,720
Yes, I want you to.

58
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,990
I want to ask you to stay by my side.

59
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:59,032
Your lips were lying
and your eyes were telling the truth.

60
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:06,439
Your eyes were saying
what I had wanted to hear for 11 years.

61
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,411
But I had to pretend I didn't hear it
to stay by your side.

62
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,730
POLICE

63
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,298
What are you doing here?

64
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,701
Hello, Ms. Jang.

65
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,006
We heard Min Jun-guk is still alive.

66
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,811
We're planning to set up
more security cameras here.

67
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:49,282
One on the telephone pole
and one down there.

68
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,585
Will two be enough?
That side is quite scary, too.

69
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,193
We were barely able to get two cameras.
What should we do?

70
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:04,931
I don't care. I'll just get reprimanded.

71
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,935
We'll find out what we can do there.

72
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,672
Thank you for all of your effort.

73
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,942
No. We're just doing our job.

74
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,011
Sorry for being mistaken about you.

75
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,248
We'll increase the patrols from now on,
so don't worry.

76
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:23,816
Okay.

77
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,598
Does losing your memory
change your personality, too?

78
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,436
You seem calmer than before.

79
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,972
Shall I say that you're more rational?

80
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,341
Really?

81
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:56,349
Even if you meet Min Jun-guk,
be calm and rational like this.

82
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:01,154
Don't try to go up against him.
Report him or run away, okay?

83
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:06,225
I don't want him to ruin his life again
because of that man.

84
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,694
Okay.

85
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:15,735
That's strange.
Why are you so casual with me?

86
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,806
Well, that is...

87
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,510
Don't you like that?

88
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,381
Do as you wish. Whatever you like.

89
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,786
Then I'll keep being casual with you.

90
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,622
Whatever.

91
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,866
If you found out that it was my father
who had started all of this,

92
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,703
you won't ever want
to see me again, right?

93
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,411
Why is she calling so late?

94
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,814
Hello?

95
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,382
It's me.

96
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,684
I know.

97
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,588
I asked the police to increase the patrols
around your house.

98
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,324
And I asked them to install
more security cameras.

99
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,393
I know. Did you call to boast?

100
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,929
What a jerk.

101
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,868
Call me right away
if you see anything suspicious.

102
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,905
Why? Are you worried
that Min Jun-guk might hurt me?

103
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,909
Not at all. Why would I worry about you?

104
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,479
I want to catch Min Jun-guk myself.

105
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,015
What a jerk.

106
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,352
Of course.
Results are so important to you.

107
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,188
Anyway, thank you so much.

108
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,624
I am so very grateful

109
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,427
since a prosecutor is trying to
catch him herself.

110
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:54,433
Don't try to solve it yourself.
You don't have the capability.

111
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,835
I'm hanging up.

112
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,029
Hwang Dal-jung?

113
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,299
You're Seo Dae-seok's daughter, right?

114
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,136
What are you doing?

115
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,472
How did you get here?
Were you released on parole?

116
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,410
Bring Seo Dae-seok out here.
Bring him out here at once!

117
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,546
Hey, what are you doing? Get away from me.

118
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,885
Mom, come on out. Come on out right now.

119
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,321
Do-yeon. What's going on?

120
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,223
Honey! Come out here!

121
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,433
Excuse me.

122
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,606
Are you sick?

123
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,044
Get a hold of yourself Hwang Dal-jung.

124
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,714
Hwang Dal-jung!

125
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,948
Honey.

126
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,718
What's going on?

127
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,886
Is this man dead?

128
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,521
No, I think he passed out.

129
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,858
-Mom, call 911.
-Okay.

130
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,234
Hello? 911? A man has collapsed here.

131
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:39,605
The address? Yes, well, it is...

132
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,615
We'll need to do an MRI to know more,

133
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,852
but it looks like a brain tumor.

134
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,122
It's too late for surgery.

135
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,692
Does that mean
he doesn't have much time left?

136
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,295
Yes, he only has
about three or four months.

137
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,067
So did he get a stay of execution?

138
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,269
A STAY OF EXECUTION MAY BE GRANTED
FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS

139
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,506
But why did he come find you
as soon as he got out?

140
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:19,011
Ms. Seo. Is Hwang Dal-jung here?

141
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,579
Yes, Mr. Kang. Right here.

142
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,515
What's wrong with Hwang Dal-jung?

143
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,751
He just got a stay of execution
and stabbed someone when he got out.

144
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,319
Why did he go see you?

145
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,688
He stabbed someone?

146
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:33,826
Oh my gosh. He did that right
after getting out of jail?

147
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,227
Why?

148
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,630
We'll have to question him to know that.

149
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,265
Let's go in.

150
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,469
Do-yeon.

151
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,612
LOCATION TRACKING

152
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,986
-Are you leaving now?
-Yes.

153
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,054
What about breakfast?

154
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,424
I don't have an appetite. I'm leaving.

155
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,893
Sit down. Eat breakfast.

156
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,695
What?

157
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,366
You're avoiding me
because it's uncomfortable.

158
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,369
I will go outside.
Don't make excuses and eat.

159
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:21,874
Hey, are you treating me like a kid
because I said you could be casual?

160
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,678
If you're going to be like this,
don't be casual and--

161
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,782
-What? What? What?
-Cockroaches!

162
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:32,051
-Where?
-Over there! A lot of them.

163
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,023
Those are watermelon seeds.

164
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,933
That was totally humiliating.
What should I do?

165
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,384
I'll leave you alone.
Come out when you're done.

166
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,819
I'll take you to your office.

167
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,921
I should say he doesn't have to.

168
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,157
But I can't because of Min Jun-guk.

169
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,527
I can't believe how pathetic I look.

170
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,565
The cram school is near your office.
I'll pick you up on my way home.

171
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,700
Okay.

172
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:23,636
Come out when you're done.

173
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,672
Su-ha.

174
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,209
Let's eat together.

175
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:35,047
I'll tell him to leave
once he gets his memory back.

176
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,583
Let's not push him away now.

177
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,964
What trial is it this time?

178
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,569
It's an attempted murder
where a wife stabbed her violent husband.

179
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,504
I'm going to say it was self-defense.

180
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,973
-Is there a chance?
-Not much.

181
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,409
It's hard to use self-defense
as an actual defense in Korea.

182
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,376
So why?

183
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,879
That's what the client wants.

184
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,883
If I work hard enough to bleed
out of my rear, I could get it.

185
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,086
How can you say that while we're eating?

186
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,988
Just say that you'll do your best.

187
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,800
MISSED CALL

188
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,146
What should I do about Mr. Cha?

189
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,482
He worked hard for Su-ha.

190
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,184
Would buying dinner be enough?

191
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,822
I don't want to keep
getting involved with him.

192
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,795
I have a question. What does Mr. Cha like?

193
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,231
What? Why do you ask?

194
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,933
I want to give him a present.

195
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,435
He worked hard to prove my innocence.

196
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,306
He worked so hard for me,
I think I should do something.

197
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,707
I should pay him back.

198
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,409
Really?

199
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,313
I don't know. What does Mr. Cha like?

200
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,316
I think he said mountain climbing
was a hobby of his.

201
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,117
Mountain climbing?

202
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,790
What are you looking for?

203
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,792
What is the best product you have here?

204
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,695
Show me something
that would be an overwhelming gift.

205
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,930
What about this?

206
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,668
It's a little expensive,
but all hikers want one.

207
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:13,172
I don't need an explanation.
Please put the price tag in, too.

208
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,907
Okay.

209
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:23,015
Thank you for fighting
to prove my innocence.

210
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,050
What is this?

211
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,820
I got you hiking boots
since I heard you like mountain climbing.

212
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,389
I know this isn't enough as a legal fee.

213
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,291
If needed, I will pay you back in time.

214
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,160
Thank you.

215
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,596
I don't need a fee.

216
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,066
Instead, please wish me luck.

217
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,835
For what?

218
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,504
I'm going to apply
to be a public defender again.

219
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,607
Yeonju is finally hiring
a new public defender.

220
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,712
I think it's time to go back
to my place now.

221
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,349
Do you remember what I told you before?

222
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,919
Yes, I do.

223
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:06,025
Then that's enough.
Aren't you going to wish me luck?

224
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,893
Do you think I'd want to do that?

225
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,229
I knew it.

226
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,646
CULTIVATING KOREA'S SOARING HUMAN TALENT

227
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:33,986
Su-ha, don't pretend to be an adult.
Try acting like a real adult.

228
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,089
Putting on a suit
doesn't make you an adult, does it?

229
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,549
How could you do this? Attempted murder?

230
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:04,983
I know.

231
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,619
I should have finished the job.

232
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,222
But I couldn't.

233
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,992
How can you say that?

234
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,895
You just got out!
How could you stab someone?

235
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,198
It was her.

236
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:24,069
It was the person
I had supposedly killed 26 years ago.

237
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:27,940
What?

238
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,608
Can you believe it?

239
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,511
My wife was alive!

240
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:38,851
I was sentenced 26 years ago
as a convicted murderer.

241
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,086
And I thought I could have done it.

242
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,690
I thought I had gotten drunk
and lost my mind.

243
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,525
I thought I could have killed her!

244
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,627
But...

245
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,165
I hadn't.

246
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,568
I hadn't.

247
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,540
It was 26 years.

248
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:11,350
I rotted in here for 26 years
for something I didn't even do.

249
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,587
It's half of my life.

250
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:20,192
In here!

251
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,963
Is that...

252
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,169
Is that why you stabbed her?

253
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,805
Yes. She's dead anyway, right?

254
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:38,310
I didn't stab a person. I stabbed a ghost.

255
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:40,946
So...

256
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,182
I am innocent.

257
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:51,690
So you have to prove my innocence.

258
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,230
You have to.

259
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,001
Goodness.

260
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:07,573
So the person who had died
26 years ago was actually alive?

261
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,809
Yes, that is what he is insisting.

262
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,012
I think he's lying. It can't be, right?

263
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:18,884
But why did he kill his wife 26 years ago?

264
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,355
I think she had an affair
with another man.

265
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:28,093
And she always said she wanted to run away
because of his debts.

266
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,431
What a man.

267
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:37,502
He served 26 years in jail.
Why didn't he just live quietly?

268
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,071
Why did he stab someone again?

269
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:45,177
They say a devil in different clothes
doesn't make him an angel.

270
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,280
He was born to be a criminal.

271
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:50,549
I know.

272
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,119
Are you going to take on this case?

273
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,889
Yes, it will be hard,
but I think it will be fun.

274
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,036
Mr. Jang. This is Seo Dae-seok.

275
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,506
I called to ask you a favor.

276
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,075
It's nothing big.

277
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,678
It's about the Hwang Dal-jung case.

278
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:26,585
Could you reassign the case to someone
other than my daughter?

279
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:31,156
MURDERER WITH LIFE IMPRISONMENT
STRIKES AGAIN AFTER RELEASE, WHY?

280
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,642
I want to get you a not-guilty verdict.

281
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,078
But

282
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,582
how can I do that? You stabbed a person.

283
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,588
Let's say you regret it
and ask for a light sentence.

284
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:08,260
And if you get released
with a stay of execution--

285
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,895
I don't need that.

286
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,265
I don't have a long time to live.

287
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,235
I am innocent.

288
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,772
Please claim my innocence!

289
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,648
IN SESSION

290
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:41,026
The defendant and the victim
had domestic troubles for a long time

291
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,729
because the victim had used violence.

292
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,065
Around 9 p.m. on June 30, 2013,

293
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:50,135
the defendant did not make dinner
for the victim,

294
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,805
and the victim hit
the defendant's face and stomach.

295
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,207
The defendant was furious...

296
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:15,394
The defendant was furious
and with the intent to murder the victim,

297
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,931
swung a kitchen knife that was 16cm long,

298
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,000
and left a 2cm stab wound

299
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,936
in the victim's neck
and a 7cm wound on his stomach.

300
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,509
Pursuant to Article 250, Section 1
of the Penal Code and Article 254,

301
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,145
we are charging
the defendant with attempted murder.

302
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:34,946
Counsel?

303
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,016
Do you admit to the charges?

304
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,723
We admit to the facts
that are written in the indictment.

305
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,968
However, the defendant acted
in self-defense.

306
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,604
So we are pleading not guilty.

307
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,711
CONFERENCE ROOM

308
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,016
PUBLIC-DEFENDER APPLICATION NOTICE

309
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,460
WAITING ROOM

310
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:35,073
If it's 1 out of 20,
do I have a better chance than before?

311
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,713
The defendant is claiming
that it was self-defense.

312
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,884
But what she did was not self-defense,
but an attack.

313
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,954
The fact that she stabbed him
in the neck proves it.

314
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:53,091
And the fact that the victim's injuries
are worse than the defendant's

315
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,360
hardly suggests self-defense.

316
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:03,201
She picked up a knife
because the victim's hand was a weapon.

317
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,438
The victim was a former volleyball player.

318
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:12,477
Having suffered from assault, my client
exhibited punch-drunk-syndrome symptoms.

319
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,480
Only boxers who get hit
in the head a lot suffer from it.

320
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,884
How can we not take that
into consideration

321
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:23,088
and say the victim's injuries are worse
than the defendant's?

322
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,858
Before she swung a knife at the victim,

323
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,294
she should have asked her
neighbors or the police for help.

324
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,764
Or if she had the strength to pick
up a knife, she should've run away.

325
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,467
The residence where she lives is

326
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,104
so cramped that you can even hear
the neighbors' flatulence.

327
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,874
She should have found
a more rational way to resist.

328
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,945
The prosecutor said
"a more rational way to resist."

329
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,881
So I tried an experiment
with such a "rational way to resist."

330
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:57,789
This is in front of the victim's house.

331
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,825
I played some rock music
in front of the house.

332
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:07,599
Who is it? Turn it off!
I'm going to call the police!

333
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,570
Within ten seconds,
a person said he would call the police.

334
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,171
However,

335
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:17,542
when I turned something else on,
I got a very strange result.

336
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,714
-Hit me! Hit me!
-How dare you?

337
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:28,987
Help me! Neighbors!
He is trying to kill me!

338
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,992
Please call the police.

339
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,563
The neighbors yelled after ten seconds
when I played music.

340
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,834
But they were quiet for one minute
and the police didn't come either either.

341
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:47,339
Rational resistance?
The defendant already tried it.

342
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,175
And every time,
she only got silence and indifference.

343
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,544
"I'm different from those neighbors."

344
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,347
"I would have called the police.
I would have tried to help her."

345
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,582
How sure can you be of that?

346
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,884
I can't be sure.

347
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,588
That is why I am claiming self-defense.

348
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,791
Because of the silence
and indifference of people like me,

349
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:11,463
there was almost no other way
for the defendant to protect herself.

350
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,774
RESUME
CHA GUAN-WOO

351
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,111
Mr. Cha, you're at a disadvantage.

352
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:29,514
Your score is good
but you quit once before.

353
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:32,384
It gives the notion
that you could give up again.

354
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:36,421
I know,
but it could also be my strong point.

355
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,722
Why is that?

356
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:41,860
I have no illusion
about being a public defender.

357
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:46,231
I know how dangerous a lawyer
armed with lame ideals and beliefs can be.

358
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,934
There's someone who taught me that.

359
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,369
Who is that?

360
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,439
It's the one who I used to work with,

361
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,274
Jang Hye-seong.

362
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,678
You put on quite a show today.

363
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:02,681
-What?
-I thought you were Mr. Cha.

364
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,284
You even made a video
and put on a great show.

365
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,553
You made a pathetic attempt
to appeal to sensitivity.

366
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,289
When did you start to imitate Mr. Cha?

367
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:16,094
There's a better word than "imitate."
"Learned."

368
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:20,832
I learned from Mr. Cha.
Is there a problem with that?

369
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,870
There's quite a lot to learn from Mr. Cha.

370
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,372
Don't you agree?

371
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:30,575
I learned a lot from Jang Hye-seong.

372
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,479
I learned how dangerous it is
to trust a client fully,

373
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:39,584
and how incompetent a touchy-feely lawyer
without expertise can be.

374
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,188
It's good that you have no illusions
about being a public defender.

375
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,923
But isn't it a problem
not to have any at all?

376
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,092
You need a reason to be a public defender.

377
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,393
I do.

378
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:54,365
Both Jang Hye-seong and I have
a solid reason to be public defenders.

379
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,067
2013 GED TEST

380
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:59,804
Ms. Jang and I saved
a person's life as public defenders.

381
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,074
We saved an innocent person
who could have rotted in jail.

382
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,979
And that person will live well
as a normal person in this world.

383
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:16,020
His life is the reason
and drive for us being public defenders.

384
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,630
Mr. Yang,
when is Hwang Dal-jung coming in?

385
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,532
Well, about that...

386
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,302
Ms. Seo, the Hwang Dal-jung case
has been reassigned to me.

387
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:35,440
"Reassigned"? Why so suddenly?

388
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,877
I have no idea.
The chief told me to do it.

389
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,079
When did we ever get any explanations?

390
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,016
I've already looked
into the Hwang Dal-jung case a lot.

391
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,520
I don't want it either.
Do you think I want more work?

392
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,689
Why did the chief
suddenly change his mind?

393
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:55,160
I'm not sure, but I think
your father gave him a call.

394
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:57,996
My father?

395
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,537
PROSECUTOR SEO DO-YEON

396
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:12,610
Was Min Jun-guk's cellmate,

397
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,379
Hwang Dal-jung?

398
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,616
Back off that case.
The sentencing is over.

399
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,352
It's left your hands now.

400
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:25,223
-But it's Hye-seong's--
-Do as you are told.

401
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,997
Hello? 911? A man has collapsed here.

402
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:37,135
The address? Yes, well, it is...

403
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,448
MISSED CALL

404
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:54,219
What was that?
I ran in, but the caller hung up.

405
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,359
Did you have dinner?

406
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,628
No, not yet. I'll make dinner.

407
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,598
Will you? Do you have any laundry?

408
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,266
Yes, this one.

409
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,441
Didn't you say you took
the GED test today?

410
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,442
Yes.

411
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,177
Did you do well?

412
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,880
I just did what I could.

413
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,152
How much rice do you want?

414
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,521
Hey, what is this?

415
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,093
Don't look at it! Give it to me!

416
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,264
Wow, the police academy.

417
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,499
Are you interested in the police academy?

418
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,968
No, I'm not serious about it.

419
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,873
Not serious? I heard it's hard to get in.

420
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,576
I know.
That's why I'm not serious about it.

421
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,245
If I did my best and didn't get in,
it would be embarrassing.

422
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,065
It's not embarrassing.

423
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,035
If you study hard, you can get in.

424
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,905
I guess you don't remember
what you were like.

425
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,542
You were a good student.
I saw your grades, so believe me.

426
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:29,280
So don't say you're not serious
and really put your mind to it.

427
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,749
Okay.

428
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,691
Is it okay to get so used to him?

429
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,361
What if I have to let him go later?

430
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:47,131
It will be so hard. Just like a year ago.

431
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,673
What are you thinking?

432
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,608
Nothing.

433
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:02,613
Just that I'd like you to get
your memory back so you can leave.

434
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,504
He's trying so hard.
When will he get his memory back?

435
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,814
Hello? Hello?

436
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,184
Why aren't they saying anything?

437
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,890
-Are you done washing?
-Yes.

438
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,503
REDIAL

439
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:03,241
This number cannot receive calls.

440
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,277
-Please check the number...
-It doesn't receive calls?

441
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,755
This number cannot receive calls.

442
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,424
REDIAL

443
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,996
This number cannot receive calls.

444
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,899
Please check the number and call again.

445

REDIAL

446
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:34,772
Hello?

447
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,875
Who is this?
I got a call from this number.

448
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,712
This is amazing.
I got a call on a payphone.

449
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,116
Is this the number of a payphone?

450
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,250
Yes.

451
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,687
Where is that? Which payphone is it?

452
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:57,028
-So you got a call from here?
-Yes.

453
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,335
We got several other calls
from numbers that don't receive calls.

454
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,003
"Numbers that don't receive calls"?

455
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,574
That means those were all payphones, too.

456
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,842
Why payphones?

457
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:14,178
There's a security camera over there.

458
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,784
-Did you jot down the times?
-Yes.

459
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,554
What time did you say you got the call?

460
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,090
It was 9:25 in the morning.

461
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:30,761
-Nine twenty five...
-There it is.

462
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,471
It's Min Jun-guk!

463
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:44,942
Mr. Nam, report to the chief
that Min Jun-guk is in Yeonju.

464
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:46,110
Yes.

465
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:47,445
Hurry.

466
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,947
Why did Min Jun-guk call?

467
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,315
He's checking.

468
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,953
He called to see
if Ms. Jang still lives at that house.

469
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,055
That jerk.

470
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,914
CRIMINAL PROCEDURE LAW

471
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,200
What did you just say?

472
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,968
I asked you to help me.

473
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,071
You want who to help whom?

474
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,874
I want you to help me, Ms. Jjang.

475
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:56,280
Yu-chang, did you hear that?
Mr. Shin wants me to help him.

476
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,717
Yes, I heard clearly.

477
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,025
Hold on. Let me think.

478
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,798
Come here and tell me about it.

479
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,969
I'll help if it sounds reasonable.

480
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:29,013
Do you know about the Hwang Dal-jung case?

481
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,017
Yes, he stabbed someone right after
he was released from prison.

482
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,654
I'm a little thirsty.

483
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:42,760
Yu-chang, go get a drink
from the vending machine.

484
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:49,767
Not from the vending machine.
And I'd like something sweet, too.

485
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,339
-Yu-chang!
-Yes, sir!

486
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,847
Yes! Can I get something for me, too?

487
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,181
You think?

488
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:15,559
So you want to do a jury trial
with me, right?

489
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:16,694
Yes.

490
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:21,065
I guess I was pretty impressive
at the last trial by jury, right?

491
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,501
Yes, you were impressive.

492
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:28,239
Then you should explain to me
what the main points are.

493
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:34,111
As you know, Hwang Dal-jung was charged
for killing his wife,

494
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:36,914
and was just released
after serving 26 years.

495
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,618
He was hospitalized after being diagnosed
with a terminal-brain tumor.

496
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:44,755
And he met his wife
who was working as a caretaker there.

497
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:49,327
He didn't mean to stab her at first.

498
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:54,965
But what she said agitated Hwang Dal-jung.

499
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,270
I'm sorry.

500
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:04,108
But at that time,
it was the best I could do.

501
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:08,379
I hated you and I hated your debts.

502
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,415
I didn't want to live
as your wife anymore.

503
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:16,087
And I didn't want to raise my daughter
with that pile of debt.

504
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:21,959
Is that why
you even cut off your own hand?

505
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,129
To put me in prison?

506
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,964
Think about it.

507
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,734
It would have been better to be in prison

508
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,702
than running from the debt collectors.

509
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:38,843
Our daughter lives with a wealthy family
and doesn't know about us.

510
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:43,381
If you had raised her
you couldn't have raised her as well.

511
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:48,486
-I met a better person than you...
-What?

512
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:09,540
So did Hwang Dal-jung serve for 26 years
for something he didn't do?

513
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:10,574
That's right.

514
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,678
Is this even a crime?
He stabbed someone who is dead.

515
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,749
I don't know. I'm not sure about that.

516
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:24,655
She may be dead legally,
but she was still alive at the time.

517
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:31,295
But Hwang Dal-jung is saying
he stabbed a ghost and is innocent.

518
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:37,067
We may not have a big chance,
but it's worth pleading not guilty.

519
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,637
But there is one more problem.

520
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:40,871
What is it?

521
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:44,675
There is no proof that the victim
is Hwang Dal-jung's ex-wife.

522
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:48,012
She changed her identity 26 years ago.

523
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,381
Legally, she is
a totally different person now.

524
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,117
But her fingerprints
should be in the system.

525
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,852
She has no fingerprints.

526
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:58,389
She worked at a restaurant,
and handled a lot of hot pots.

527
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,724
So all of her fingerprints are gone.

528
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,262
Then how do we prove
that they were married?

529
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:08,799
We can do it by finding the daughter
and doing a DNA test.

530
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,367
Where is the daughter?

531
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,871
-That's what we should be looking for.
-What?

532
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:21,445
Whatever the reason, he stabbed someone.
Will he be found not guilty?

533
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,981
How do we find the daughter?

534
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:30,554
-Su-ha!
-Why didn't you answer your phone?

535
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:31,989
Did you call?

536
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,492
I must have set it to silent during trial.

537
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,160
Why? Did something happen?

538
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,395
Min Jun-guk is in Yeonju.

539
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,132
What?

540
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:46,871
He called from a payphone
to check if you still lived there.

541
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,305
Your place is dangerous now.

542
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,644
Don't go home for a while.
Stay at my place starting from today.

543
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,046
Your place?

544
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:13,998
I'll give you the passcode
and my apartment number later.

545
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,266
What?

546
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:17,134
Okay.

547
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:55,239
There's a security guard
and cameras in the corridors.

548
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,640
It should be safer than your place.

549
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,243
Min Jun-guk doesn't know about this place,

550
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:00,844
so stay here for a while.

551
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,113
-Do the police know?
-Yes.

552
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,382
They'll start searching for him today.

553
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:07,251
That's good.

554
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,956
What if Su-ha thinks
of something dangerous again?

555
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,224
He just got his life back.

556
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:17,528
What if he goes to
Min Jun-guk to get revenge?

557
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,197
Is that...

558
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,370
I brought some of your things.

559
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,906
Tell me if you need more.
I'll go and get them.

560
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:32,610
No, if I'm in danger, so are you.
Don't go there.

561
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:36,780
I'm going to ask the police,
prosecution and Mr. Cha for help.

562
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,850
I won't try to do anything myself.
So you don't have to worry.

563
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:41,752
Okay.

564
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,355
I'm hungry. Do you have anything to eat?

565
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,492
No, there won't be much.
Shall I go buy some things?

566
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,962
There's enough to prepare a meal.

567
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,064
Sit down. I'll make something.

568
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,121
Dog food again?

569
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,824
Don't you ask for more later.

570
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,976
Su-ha, did you get your memory back?

571
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,915
No, why?

572
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:48,085
You just said, "Dog food again?"

573
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,991
Doesn't that mean
you remember eating this before?

574
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,495
I just...

575
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:03,200
I had something similar for lunch.
That is why I said "again."

576
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,135
Did we eat this before?

577
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:08,472
Yes.

578
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:13,210
I guess he has no reason to lie to me.

579
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,912
He wouldn't do that.

580
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:07,931
Where are you all hiding?

581
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,026
Why? Are you feeling unwell today?

582
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:37,861
You keep slicing.

583
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,797
I know.

584
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,366
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

585
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:48,906
Mom, do you remember
the Hwang Dal-jung case?

586
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:51,308
Yes.

587
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:58,582
Father called the chief to assign the case
to another prosecutor.

588
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,251
Your father? Why?

589
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,820
I'm not sure.

590
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,123
I don't think he'll give me an answer
if I asked him.

591
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:07,658
He is very strange.

592
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:10,093
He's so sensitive about Hwang Dal-jung.

593
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:13,864
Hold on.

594
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,500
Could he be that guy?

595
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:18,735
What do you mean?

596
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:24,541
The first case he got
as a senior judge was strange.

597
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,045
It was a case where a man cut up his wife.

598
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:32,182
I think the defendant's name
was similar to that.

599
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,264
JUDGE: SEO DAE-SEOK

600
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,439
DEFENDANT: HWANG DAL-JUNG
VERDICT: LIFE IMPRISONMENT

601
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:10,854
Hwang Ga-yeon.

602
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,694
This is a little difficult.

603
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:19,763
Why?

604
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,398
It's an undisclosed adoption.

605
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:25,002
The family that adopted her asked
never to reveal anything.

606
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:31,341
The birth father is looking for her.

607
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,978
And it's the only way to save that father.

608
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:39,416
I'm sorry. It's the rule.
I cannot tell you anything.

609
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:48,358
Let's go.

610
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,461
She says it's the rule.

611
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,797
I'm so sorry.

612
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,445
We should get going.

613
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,785
That was very low.

614
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,187
I know. I know.

615
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,159
NOTICE OF PUBLIC DEFENDER HIRING

616
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,894
-It's here.
-It came.

617
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:25,996
I'm sure you got the job.

618
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,632
If not, they wouldn't send it.
You should open it.

619
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:31,868
-I'm too nervous.
-Just open it.

620
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,239
CHA GUAN-WOO: DID NOT PASS

621
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:46,316
It's okay. I can try again.

622
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,553
It was a close call.
I was in second place.

623
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,056
Second place? Why did they write that?

624
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,058
Did you not get the job?

625
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,562
Park Su-ha. What are you doing here?

626
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,031
You didn't wish me good luck, did you?

627
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:05,068
Did you curse me so I won't get it?
Is that what you did?

628
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,237
I did then, but not now.

629
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,907
What's with the change in attitude?

630
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,976
Min Jun-guk turned up in Yeonju.

631
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,450
What will we do? Are you going to give up?

632
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,952
I'm going to go back.

633
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:26,590
I'm not going to be foolish like someone,
but try to persuade her.

634
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,359
How nice of you.

635
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,496
I'll go meet a client
at the detention center.

636
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:36,933
After you get back,
you should find similar precedent.

637
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,136
If there aren't any in Korea,
then find overseas ones.

638
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,171
Okay.

639
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:43,807
Mr. Cha!

640
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:48,011
Are you going to see a client?
I'll go with you.

641
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:49,613
Do you have an interview, too?

642
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,815
You said you don't have any cases.

643
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,886
-I'm going as Ms. Jjang's bodyguard.
-"Bodyguard"?

644
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:59,189
I heard from Su-ha. Min Jun-guk showed up.

645
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:03,994
Call me when you go to court
or for interviews, don't go alone.

646
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:06,763
Mr. Cha.

647
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,482
YEONJU POLICE
MR. CHA

648
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,350
YEONJU DISTRICT COURT - SEO DO-YEON

649
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,697
-I trust you.
-Yes.

650
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,833
-See you.
-Yes, goodbye.

651
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,271
Father.

652
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,143
I can't believe
we ran into each other here.

653
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,079
Don't you have any trials today?

654
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,782
Why did you come to meet Mr. Jang?

655
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,485
I had no specific reason.

656
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:04,421
I just came for a seminar
and happened to run into him.

657
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:09,292
No, you came to confirm
Hwang Dal-jung's case was reassigned.

658
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,629
I never asked him to do that.

659
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:17,200
Don't avoid it. Answer me.
Why can't I take on that case?

660
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,735
I said I never asked him.

661
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,475
No way.

662
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,245
You said
that you never asked him to do it.

663
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:31,915
I will tell the chief
what you just said to me.

664
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,651
And I am going to get that case back.

665
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,454
Do-yeon!

666
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:09,519
-Are your classes over?
-Yes.

667
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:12,255
Can you wait a little?
I just need to wrap this up.

668
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,495
Take your time. I will wait.

669
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,332
POLICE ACADEMY SAMPLE QUESTIONS

670
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:28,872
I wish Su-ha had read
the orphanage director's mind.

671
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,374
Then we would have found
Hwang Dal-jung's daughter.

672
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,917
No, no, it's better
he doesn't have the ability.

673
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,253
He had such a hard time about it.

674
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:52,529
Su-ha, did you bring all the notes
from my house?

675
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,397
The ones you put up on the closet door.

676
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:56,233
No.

677
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:01,571
You should have brought them.
Let's go get them now.

678
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,978
Later. I'll go get them later.

679
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,214
What? Okay.

680
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:23,493
What should I do?

681
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,463
I have to find Hwang Dal-jung's daughter.

682
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,666
Shall I sneak into the orphanage?

683
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:33,637
If I were a prosecutor,
I could file for a warrant.

684
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,239
There's nothing that a lawyer can do.

685
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,078
Do you know what you are like?

686
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:46,650
You looked for me for ten years
to keep a promise I don't remember.

687
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:49,753
I guess he has no reason to lie to me.

688
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,554
He wouldn't do that.

689
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,697
What? Do you have something to say?

690
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:05,268
If I tell her the truth,
will she look at me like this?

691
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,471
No, I don't.

692
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,307
What a fool.

693
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:14,210
Su-ha. Here.

694
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:27,991
Hey, I meant that you got pen marks
on your face.

695
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:31,695
Really? I misunderstood.

696
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,298
That was so out of the blue.

697
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:56,252
We've been to Ms. Jang's place.
Let's go to Park Su-ha's place.

698
00:55:56,453 --> 00:56:00,990
Is there anyone else that
Min Jun-guk might go to?

699
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:05,261
I don't know.
Seo Do-yeon could be another one.

700
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:09,366
She really cornered him
at the trial before.

701
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:12,869
Then shall we go there
after we go to Park Su-ha's?

702
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:13,903
Okay.

703
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,444
Text me once you've arrived home safely.

704
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:39,562
Who is it?

705
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,331
Mr. Cha.

706
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:44,467
He's been taking care of me
all day long and I feel bad.

707
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,778
I have something to tell you.

708
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,247
What? What is it?

709
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:57,207
It's been a long time, Mr. Cha.

710
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:01,444
I don't know what you came to find out.

711
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,447
I cannot tell you anything.

712
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:06,816
I didn't come to find something out.

713
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,919
I came
because I have something to tell you.

714
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,392
Why are you hesitating so much?

715
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:22,131
I...

716
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,635
know who Hwang Dal-jung's daughter is.

717
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,872
Really? Who is it?

718
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,341
Seo Do-yeon.

719
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:35,078
Are you kidding? You're talking rubbish.

720
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,183
The judge at Hwang Dal-jung's trial
26 years ago was Seo Dae-seok.

721
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,986
The day after he sentenced
Mr. Hwang with a life sentence,

722
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,455
that woman appeared before Seo Dae-seok.

723
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,123
That woman?

724
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,595
Do you mean Jeon Young-ja, the wife?

725
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,877
Weren't you dead?

726
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:12,615
I died so I could live.

727
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,585
How can this be?

728
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,788
Do you know what you have done?

729
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,491
You turned your husband into a murderer.

730
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:25,562
So, what should I do?

731
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,598
Shall I go and give myself up?

732
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:35,638
I know how important this case is to you.

733
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:41,611
You even had an interview
that you're the best judge of our time.

734
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:49,085
I know that you cannot even imagine
changing your verdict.

735
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,322
I came because I have a favor to ask.

736
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:55,391
If you agree to do as I ask,

737
00:59:55,458 --> 01:00:01,197
I will hide my name and myself
until the day I die.

738
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:06,836
I will make sure
that I do not cause trouble for you.

739
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:10,073
-How can you say that?
-Why can't I?

740
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,042
If that man is in prison like now,

741
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:16,479
everyone will be in peace,
both you and me.

742
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:19,983
And even my daughter.

743
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:21,884
Even

744
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:24,621
your daughter?

745
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,056
You don't have children, do you?

746
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,660
And you're looking to adopt.

747
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:34,797
Please take my daughter in.

748
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:38,434
That is what I came to ask you.

749
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:48,811
Seo Dae-seok accepted that offer
and that daughter is...

750
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,613
Seo Do-yeon?

751
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:00,823
How can that be?

752
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:05,628
How could they conspire
to ruin a person's life?

753
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,598
Hwang Dal-jung spent
half his life in prison.

754
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,802
How did you know this?

755
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:21,878
I saw Judge Seo Dae-seok
when I went to the Prosecutors' Office.

756
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,617
And I saw his eyes.

757
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:31,454
"Saw his eyes"?

758
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,658
Do you mean...

759
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,468
The ability has returned.

760
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,575
And my memory, too.

761
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,855
