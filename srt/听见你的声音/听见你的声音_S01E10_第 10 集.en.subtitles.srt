1
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,904
Su-ha?

2
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,716
Su-ha. Park Su-ha.

3
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:54,788
You fool. Where have you been?

4
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,991
You should have called.
Why didn't you? I was worried.

5
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,194
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

6
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,165
Why did they handcuff you?

7
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,604
Is my name Park Su-ha?

8
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,712
That's what they all call me
by the name here.

9
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,120
Do you know me?

10
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:40,500
No. He confessed that he did it.

11
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,435
How can we release someone who confessed?

12
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,704
He said he could've killed him,
not that he did.

13
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,440
Look, he can't even remember his own name.

14
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,809
How could he possibly know
if he killed that man or not?

15
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:54,080
I feel sorry for her
but I can't remember that person.

16
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,684
She is defending me so hard.

17
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,122
But I can't remember her voice
or her eyes.

18
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,457
He could be pretending
to have lost his memory.

19
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,493
We're going by the law.

20
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,061
We're going to get an arrest warrant.

21
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,296
And once we get it,
he is going to be confined to a cell here.

22
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,133
Why are you assuming
that Park Su-ha is a murderer?

23
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,735
Judging from their conversation,

24
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,838
it seems like I killed someone a year ago.

25
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,376
The confession and evidence are enough
to prove he's the murderer.

26
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,111
A week before this incident happened,

27
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,780
he had gone with a knife
saying he was going to kill Min Jun-guk.

28
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,450
He had failed his first attempt,
so he tried again.

29
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,452
I don't want to get my memory back.

30
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:37,457
I don't want to know
that I am such a terrible person.

31
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,194
Park Su-ha is an excellent student.

32
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,531
He gets straight As,
so he can go to any college he wants.

33
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,601
And he helped a wrongly accused friend
as though his life depended on it.

34
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,504
He protected others,
even if he got hurt by doing it.

35
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,308
But on the other hand, I'm also curious.

36
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,645
Even a good student can kill a person.

37
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,015
A good person can kill someone by mistake.

38
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,583
He promised!

39
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,623
He made a promise to me.

40
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,159
He said he would never hurt anyone.

41
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,696
He is really good
when it comes to promises.

42
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,932
He even kept a promise
that he made ten years ago.

43
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,335
That person is trying so hard to help me.

44
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,071
So what kind of a person was I?

45
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,818
Where have you been staying?

46
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,290
You're reading my mind, right? Answer me.

47
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,965
Can't you hear what I am thinking?

48
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,368
Think? What thoughts?

49
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,539
You've lost your ability, too.

50
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,674
What ability?

51
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,144
Well, that's probably better.

52
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,547
Your world must be quieter now.

53
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,483
Never mind. You don't need to know.

54
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,587
How old am I?

55
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,023
Twenty.

56
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,292
I'm younger than I thought.

57
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:24,664
Yes, you look older than you are.

58
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,101
It's strange that you're so polite to me.

59
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,903
Was I rude to you?

60
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,341
Yes. You were never polite to me,
not even when we first met.

61
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,279
I must have been a rude person.

62
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,982
Maybe I am a bad person after all.

63
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,720
Don't you have a wound on your shoulder?

64
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,891
-Yes.
-You got hurt while protecting me.

65
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,927
Why did I do that?

66
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,530
Why do you think?
It's because you're a good guy.

67
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,032
Would you have done it if you were bad?

68
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,304
So don't say you think you're a bad person
or you think you killed someone.

69
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,572
Don't ever say that
in front of the detective.

70
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,808
It will all be used against you later,
understand?

71
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,420
You have to be strong.
You're going to go through a lot.

72
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,093
-Is that the only outfit you have?
-Yes.

73
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,162
It's too shabby.

74
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,734
I'll send some new clothes. Wear them
to the crime-scene investigation.

75
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,704
"Crime-scene investigation"?

76
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,642
Don't say anything foolish.
Just do as I say.

77
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,420
WANTED

78
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,668
DISMEMBERED LEFT HAND FOUND
AT INDOOR-FISHING FACILITY

79
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,005
SUSPECT OF LEFT-HAND MURDER CASE
IN CUSTODY

80
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:30,323
How many open warrant investigations
do we have today?

81
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,257
Three.

82
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,859
WARRANT INVESTIGATION
INQUIRY OF LEGALITY

83
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,160
That's a lot.

84
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,696
Where's Ms. Jjang?

85
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,365
I don't know.
She's probably slacking off somewhere.

86
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,869
She does all the client interviews
over the phone these days. It's maddening.

87
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,304
Does she want to do her job or not?

88
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,507
I'll be back.

89
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,642
See you.

90
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,356
What?

91
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:07,126
You like iced tea, right?

92
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,863
What is going on?
You don't talk to me anymore.

93
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,333
Aren't you on your way
to investigate pending warrants?

94
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,736
Yes, it's my turn.

95
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,439
I want to go in your stead.

96
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:20,740
Why?

97
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,110
Is one of the defendants someone you know?

98
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,045
Yes.

99
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,649
Park Su-ha is among them.

100
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,186
I have to get in the investigation
to be his public defender.

101
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,254
I don't know.

102
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:40,693
From how you've been doing,
that would be bad for Park Su-ha.

103
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,197
I think I would be better suited than you.

104
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,703
No other lawyer knows Su-ha
as well as I do,

105
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,706
nor trust him as much as I do.

106
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:57,743
So...

107
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:03,583
Please let me take this case.

108
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,298
Thank you.

109
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,537
POLICE DETECTIVE

110
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,916
-What are you doing?
-Ms. Jang.

111
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,951
I've been selected as his public defender.

112
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,087
I am Park Su-ha's public defender now.

113
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,122
So I'm going with you
to investigate the scene.

114
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,893
Why would a lawyer go to the scene?

115
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,328
Why wouldn't a lawyer
go investigate the scene?

116
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,566
She's really aggressive.

117
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,768
Are all public defenders like that?

118
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,603
I don't know. Let's get in.

119
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,279
Are a lot of reporters coming?

120
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,248
Of course. It was all over the news.

121
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:10,917
Put this on.

122
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,787
If you don't remember,
just say that you don't.

123
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,124
Don't make guesses. Okay?

124
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,494
Prepare yourself.

125
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:25,665
The defendant has no memory right now.

126
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,667
Please refrain
from asking leading questions.

127
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,835
If you coerce him at all,

128
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,872
I'll bring them all up as issues
and use them to get an acquittal.

129
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,107
That's enough. Enough.

130
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,703
Please move.

131
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,171
-They say he's the murderer...
-Now, now!

132
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,373
-And he dismembered the body.
-He looks young.

133
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,211
Excuse me! I'm his lawyer.

134
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,283
Please move. You're interfering.

135
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,753
-Ms. Jang.
-Don't worry. I'm here.

136
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,526
Because of a grudge going back
about ten years,

137
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:32,732
a crime-scene investigation is in effect
for the "left-hand murder case."

138
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:37,003
The investigation started
at the indoor-fishing facility,

139
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,205
where the victim's left hand was found
a year ago.

140
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,110
What will Su-ha do?

141
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,313
What is he going to do?

142
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,116
The investigation took place
for 40 minutes.

143
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,685
They intensely interrogated the suspect
about how he did it,

144
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,222
-and where he hid the corpse...
-Okay, hold it like this.

145
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,923
You probably stabbed him like this, right?

146
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,960
What? No...

147
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,262
You can't ask him like that.
He has no memory.

148
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,597
This is all speculation!

149
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,834
But the suspect who admitted to the crime
when he was investigated,

150
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,671
is now saying he has no memory
of the incident.

151
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,706
Don't answer him. Don't answer him.

152
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,976
Where's the remote control.
Let's watch something else.

153
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,780
Hold on!

154
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,351
Leave it on.

155
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:30,723
The police plan to hand the case
over to the prosecution this week.

156
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,824
Answer me!

157
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,627
Don't take it off.
He's still just a suspect.

158
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,930
Wow, what's going on with Ms. Jang?

159
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,999
She never went to these things before.

160
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,271
She kept the suspect's face hidden
but her face was plastered all over.

161
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,546
She should have protected
her own rights first.

162
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,855
You evil! How could you do that?

163
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,694
You jerk!

164
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,996
-Cover up his face!
-Was the crime personal?

165
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,898
Cover up his face!

166
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,977
YEONJU POLICE STATION

167
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,053
You probably...

168
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,556
-Victim.
-Stabbed him like this, right?

169
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,792
How many times?
Where did you hide the body?

170
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,761
-Can't you remember?
-They say he's the murderer.

171
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,062
And he dismembered the body.

172
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,301
Don't you have a wound on your shoulder?

173
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,105
You got hurt while protecting me.

174
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,582
What kind of a person am I?

175
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,866
Aren't you Ms. Seo?

176
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,401
Yes.

177
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,642
-What floor?
-The fifth.

178
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,644
Our office is on that floor, too.

179
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,549
By any chance,
are you coming to visit our office?

180
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,050
Is Ms. Jang in?

181
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:43,856
CCTV
CELL PHONE RECORDS

182
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,525
What is this?

183
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,296
This is a copy of Park Su-ha's SIM card.

184
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,133
These are his phone records
and these are the crime-scene photos.

185
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,734
Use them for your defense.

186
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,471
Why are you doing this?
You're the prosecutor.

187
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,809
Think of it as a coupon I'm giving you.

188
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,578
"Coupon"?

189
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:12,918
I should never have let
Min Jun-guk be released a year ago.

190
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,790
So I feel hugely indebted to you,
the victim.

191
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,226
And this is how you'll pay me back?

192
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,030
I think Min Jun-guk deserved to die, too.

193
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,834
So I'm going to ask
for a ten-year sentence for Park Su-ha.

194
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,570
It's a dismemberment-murder
and he hid the body, too.

195
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:35,808
I will probably be questioned
for demanding only a ten-year sentence.

196
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,245
Park Su-ha is not the murderer.

197
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,381
This is why I came.

198
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,318
Look. There's too much evidence
for him to be innocent.

199
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,288
Plead guilty.

200
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,325
Then I should be able
to get a ten-year sentence.

201
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,427
If you defend him well

202
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,529
and Park Su-ha is a model prisoner,

203
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,231
he should be released before he's 30.

204
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,533
Then he could start over.

205
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,840
What if I plead not guilty to the end?

206
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,511
Then I won't be able to be lenient.

207
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,115
If he is convicted,
the minimum sentence is 20 years.

208
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,617
I know why you're doing this.

209
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,387
But it's too reckless.
It won't help Park Su-ha.

210
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,226
I understand Park Su-ha's position, too.

211
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,727
I want to help him.

212
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,399
You know that I am sincere, right?

213
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,239
Yes.

214
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,710
But I can't say he's not guilty
because he killed a bad man.

215
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,679
-So--
-Thanks.

216
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,415
I understand what you mean.

217
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,518
I'll think about it carefully.

218
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,742
What?

219
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,510
You look so pathetic.

220
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,292
Come on.

221
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:43,769
Mr. Cha.

222
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,107
Please. Let's stop for a moment.

223
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,412
You're weaker than you look, Yu-chang.

224
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,681
We've only been walking for 30 minutes.

225
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,854
Why did you say you would come hiking
with me?

226
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,391
Because I need to talk to you.

227
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,227
Talk to me about what?

228
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,265
Seo Do-yeon.

229
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,403
Guilty. Ten years. No.

230
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,173
-Twenty years.
-Ms. Seo came to strike a deal?

231
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,743
So, 10 years if they plead guilty
and 20 years if they don't?

232
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:31,450
Too much evidence.
It's difficult. Difficult.

233
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,521
I know. It must be difficult.

234
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:40,426
There's too much evidence
to plead not guilty.

235
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,263
Ms. Jjang's head. Boom.

236
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,765
I guess so.

237
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,802
Her head must be just about to burst.

238
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,841
Could you make some copies
of Park Su-ha's case files?

239
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,853
Oh my, did you carry all
of this weight from the start?

240
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,626
What is this?
Did I just get played by you?

241
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,128
Yes.

242
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,605
Ten years and twenty years.

243
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,412
Seo Do-yeon, you're so mean.

244
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,482
You're putting me to the test
to the very end.

245
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,352
Ouch, that hurts.

246
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,693
Mr. Shin! I almost lost a baby.

247
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,928
Do you have a baby to lose?

248
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,930
No.

249
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,367
What is this?

250
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,369
Hwang Dal-jung's case file.

251
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,404
It was my case 26 years ago.

252
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,573
Hwang Dal-jung?

253
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,477
Why do I have to read his case?

254
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,012
I don't want to.

255
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,482
This case is very similar
to Park Su-ha's case.

256
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:17,422
Like Park Su-ha, Hwang Dal-jung
couldn't remember anything.

257
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,591
He was too drunk.

258
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,498
There was too much evidence
to plead not guilty.

259
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,767
His fingerprints were on the knife.

260
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,070
And part of his wife's body
had been found.

261
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:36,141
And even worse,
they had a big fight the day before.

262
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,245
I was at a loss
when the prosecutor came to me.

263
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:41,980
The prosecutor?

264
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,551
Just like Seo Do-yeon, he made an offer.

265
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,821
He said he would ask for 15 years
if we pleaded guilty,

266
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:54,126
and say it was an accidental murder
due to the wife's infidelity.

267
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,129
He said he'd recognize
that the client was in an unstable state.

268
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,164
-Did you accept it?
-No.

269
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,165
Your Honor.

270
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,670
-I maintained a not guilty plea.
-He couldn't remember anything.

271
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,306
This confession was coerced out of him.

272
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,444
And the evidence does not directly prove
that he killed the victim.

273
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,980
It's all circumstantial.

274
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,249
I argued that Hwang Dal-jung didn't do it.

275
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:22,721
And that
the murderer was the wife's boyfriend.

276
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,592
But I lost.

277
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,696
The boyfriend had an alibi.

278
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:37,202
So Hwang Dal-jung has been in jail
for 26 years now.

279
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,673
And I don't know how much longer
he will be in jail.

280
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,877
If you had pleaded guilty
like the prosecutor suggested,

281
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,747
he would have gotten out a long time ago.

282
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:56,421
This is a record of my shameful failure.

283
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:02,261
Whether you plead guilty or not guilty...

284
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,696
this should be of some help.

285
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,370
Mr. Shin.

286
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:18,343
If you were to return to 26 years ago,

287
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,682
would you plead guilty?

288
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,225
So then, I'll get less than ten years
if I plead guilty.

289
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:38,230
Or at least 20 years if I plead not guilty
and the trial goes against me.

290
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,599
Did I understand you correctly?

291
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:41,767
Yes.

292
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,736
What should I do?

293
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,908
Let's plead not guilty. You're not guilty.

294
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:52,778
Okay.

295
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,782
No, no. Let's plead guilty.

296
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,318
You might be guilty.

297
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:03,021
If things go wrong, you may spend the rest
of your life in jail.

298
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,692
Okay, let's do that.

299
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,628
Come on, think before you answer.

300
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,096
It doesn't matter.

301
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,132
You're the one who knows me better
than I myself do right now.

302
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,103
You should make the choice.
I will take the responsibility.

303
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,108
You.

304
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,611
What do you think I am?

305
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,048
A public defender.

306
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,350
Do you know what that is?

307
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,820
I'm not sure,
but I sort of get the feeling.

308
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,456
"Feeling"?

309
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:43,095
Aren't you someone who takes my side
when no one else does?

310
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:49,401
Why? Am I wrong?

311
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,039
No.

312
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,275
You're right.

313
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,114
You're right. But I didn't know.

314
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:08,387
Mr. Shin, if you were
to return to 26 years ago,

315
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,756
would you plead guilty?

316
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:21,400
I asked myself that question so many times
over the past 26 years.

317
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,869
But the answer was always the same.

318
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:30,409
Even if I were to go back again,
I would still plead not guilty.

319
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,215
I...

320
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,019
am going to plead not guilty.

321
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,623
Okay, I get it.

322
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,128
Is there anything at all
that you remember?

323
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,499
Not yet. I'm sorry.

324
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,171
It's okay. You can take your time.

325
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:07,245
If you remember anything,
you have to tell me first.

326
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,413
Okay?

327
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,115
Yes.

328
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:35,273
Can I do this?
Will I be able to save Su-ha?

329
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,444
Should I have said to plead guilty?

330
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,558
It's been a long time, Ms. Jjang.

331
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:05,437
I saw you on TV when you were
at the crime scene.

332
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,541
You were as bright on screen
as Angelina Jolie.

333
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,579
Why are you here?

334
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,853
About Park Su-ha's case.

335
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,322
Why don't you have a trial by jury?

336
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,858
"A trial by jury"?

337
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:30,862
Yes. The possibility of being found
not guilty is eight times higher.

338
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,432
It's easier to appeal
to the jury's emotions.

339
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,268
I think it would be good
for Park Su-ha's case.

340
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,038
Su-ha is young and it's his first offense,
so you can use that angle.

341
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:41,706
What do you think?

342
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,944
It's good. Why didn't I think of that?

343
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:50,782
You know that you need one more lawyer
for a jury trial, don't you?

344
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,184
Yes.

345
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,954
I want to do it.

346
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,992
I've been living in hell
for the past year.

347
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,331
I sailed through the open sea,
only looking at a lighthouse ahead.

348
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:10,702
But suddenly it felt like
that lighthouse disappeared,

349
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,638
like my entire world fell apart.

350
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,143
I know it's foolish,
but I still want to believe in the law.

351
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:22,814
I want to believe the last case
wasn't a failure, but a lesson.

352
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,585
I want to verify that
with Park Su-ha's case.

353
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,894
Okay. Let's defend him together.

354
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:42,434
I don't care about the state of your world
or about whether you believe in the law.

355
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:47,772
To me, you're only a lawyer with the skill
to make a guilty person be found innocent.

356
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,544
And I need someone like that right now.

357
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,312
Desperately.

358
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,320
Thank you for letting me help.

359
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,224
Let's make this work.

360
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,900
It took a year to hold this hand.

361
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:25,176
INTERVIEW REQUEST

362
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,751
NAME: KIM CHUNG-GI
RELATION: WORST ENEMY EVER

363
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:39,658
RELATION: FRIEND

364
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,729
Park Su-ha. Look at you in those clothes.

365
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,865
You look horrible.

366
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,735
Do you know me well?

367
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,272
What's with the formal language?
Get real. I'm your friend from school.

368
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,510
Okay, I see.

369
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,079
Are you trying to get your memory back?

370
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,614
Like taking medicine?

371
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,116
No.

372
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,323
I took this out of your locker last year.

373
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,126
I'm not sure if it's a diary or a letter.

374
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,496
You should read it. It might help.

375
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,865
-Are you sure it's mine?
-Yes.

376
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,969
Sir, how do I give this to him?
It's his diary.

377
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,838
Diaries aren't allowed.

378
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,641
Really? He has to read this.

379
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,943
Then you should read it to him.

380
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,944
What?

381
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,647
This is really cheesy.

382
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,183
Did you read it?

383
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,854
Just a few pages. It was too cheesy.

384
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,024
Read it to me.

385
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,359
I have to get my memory back.

386
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,262
Hey, visits are limited
to only ten minutes.

387
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,398
I would have to come here
every day to read this all.

388
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,868
-Can't you do that for me?
-What?

389
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:00,438
I don't want to.

390
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,744
Don't go. Please.

391
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,120
From the beginning?

392
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,388
Yes.

393
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,993
"September 13, 2003."

394
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,763
Isn't that when we were in third grade?

395
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,098
I think so.

396
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,934
"I got a first-degree belt in taekwondo.

397
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:34,339
I got a little confused
because I was a little nervous at first.

398
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:38,643
But I did my best thinking
that you were watching me.

399
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,813
'Park Su-ha, first degree in taekwondo.'

400
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,982
Isn't that great?" It's not at all!

401
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,750
Please read it properly.

402
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,992
"If that bad man gets out of jail,

403
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,928
I will beat him up
with the kick I learned.

404
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,830
Trust me."

405
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,065
Oh, this is too much.

406
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,042
Did you hear?

407
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,745
They asked for a jury trial
for Park Su-ha's case.

408
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,747
I heard.

409
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:19,551
Why does Ms. Jjang always have
to make things so complicated?

410
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:24,155
With a jury trial, the media will come
flocking because of all the interest.

411
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,859
There is so much to think about right now.

412
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:34,566
We should get going.
We have to write our opinions.

413
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,900
I should go, too.

414
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,702
What's wrong?

415
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,173
Mr. Cha!

416
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,644
It's been a long time, Judge Kim.

417
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,448
Yes, it has. What brings you here?

418
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:54,919
Last year, you said you owed me
for giving me Min Jun-guk's case.

419
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,021
I did.

420
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,257
But why do you bring that up now?

421
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,392
Please repay that debt now.

422
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:02,727
What?

423
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,029
Please let me defend Park Su-ha.

424
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,398
I will defend him
along with Jang Hye-seong.

425
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:11,302
But you gave up your position
as a public defender.

426
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,205
Please let me take part
as a court-appointed lawyer.

427
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:19,244
Isn't that possible?

428
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,155
Mr. Cha!

429
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,925
-Hello.
-Hi.

430
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,861
I'm going to help
with the Park Su-ha case.

431
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:40,198
Since I don't have an office,
I'll have to work here for the time being.

432
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,635
Sure. Help Ms. Jjang out.

433
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,803
She's finally acting like a lawyer.

434
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,673
Don't worry. Where is she?

435
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,477
She's in the office, but she hasn't slept
for days so she's a mess.

436
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,715
-Why didn't you come earlier?
-Please stop it.

437
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:00,451
Let's go.

438
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:18,636
Ms. Jjang?

439
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,739
Hello.

440
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,177
Hi.

441
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,622
Why are you smiling?
Did you think I was sleeping?

442
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:41,492
No. What should I start on?

443
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,566
INTERVIEW REQUEST

444
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,602
You can't visit Park Su-ha today.

445
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,671
A friend is visiting him right now.

446
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:57,208
Again? He can only have one visitor a day?

447
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:59,177
Yes. Come again tomorrow.

448
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,988
I can't believe this.
How many times has it been?

449
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,195
"Have you been to an aquarium?

450
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,664
I really want to go."

451
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,668
Are you a kid? Why an aquarium?

452
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,141
"My world is so noisy.

453
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:34,212
I feel it would be quiet and peaceful
if I were to go there."

454
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,115
What do you mean? Why is the world noisy?

455
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:44,255
"I really want to go to the aquarium
with you one day."

456
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,758
I'm going to be sick.

457
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,601
Keep reading.

458
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,206
"Today was my father's birthday.

459
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:09,714
Whenever I think of him,
I think about you as well.

460
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,518
I remember the time you came
into the courtroom.

461
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,587
If you hadn't been there,

462
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:20,892
I would've choked from anger
whenever I thought of my father.

463
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,630
I am always grateful. You let me breathe."

464
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:31,803
Is the woman in this diary the same one
over the whole ten-year period?

465
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,206
Yes.

466
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,309
Is it the lawyer?

467
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,645
I think so.

468
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,483
But I can't remember.

469
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:50,121
I didn't see you as the type,
but you're a true romantic.

470
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,360
"I took my final exams today."

471
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,697
VISITOR'S AREA

472
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,237
CIVIL AFFAIRS OFFICE

473
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,840
Hey, Kim Chung-gi!

474
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,410
Oh, Ko Seong-bin! It's been a long time.

475
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:17,482
I can't visit Su-ha
because you visit him every day.

476
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,218
He only gets one visit a day.

477
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,488
Why do you come every day?
You're not even close to him.

478
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,623
Hey!

479
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,528
Never mind.
I pity you, so I'll let this pass.

480
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:32,897
Why do you pity me?

481
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:37,568
Ko Seong-bin, stop wasting your time
and get a hold of yourself.

482
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:42,673
Park Su-ha, even if--
No, he'll never fall for you.

483
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,475
Never.

484
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,250
Hey!

485
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,824
-Hey.
-I know, you jerk.

486
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,861
I already know that I'm wasting my time!

487
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:12,170
Hey. Why are you crying?

488
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:14,639
Ko Seong-bin!

489
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:19,310
So you woke up one day
and you were at the old man's house.

490
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,712
And he said you were his grandnephew.

491
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:23,247
Yes.

492
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:27,785
That's strange. Why did he say that?

493
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,757
Why are you trying so hard?

494
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,159
Are all lawyers like this?

495
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:39,597
Or am I special to you?

496
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,369
Yes, you're very special.

497
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,040
Min Jun-guk, the man you allegedly killed,

498
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,542
killed your father and my mother.

499
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,979
But he used the law to get away.

500
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,515
And he turned you into a murderer.

501
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:03,588
If we lose this case,
I won't believe in the law or in justice.

502
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,357
And I won't be able to be a lawyer
anymore.

503
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,492
I can't let that happen.

504
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,695
I'm going to find a way
to protect you with the law.

505
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:15,166
So, you are incredibly special
to me right now.

506
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,369
Who are you to me?

507
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,005
What?

508
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,908
Who were you to me?

509
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,380
Just someone you know.

510
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,449
Is that all?

511
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:36,654
Did I like you? Or were you special to me?

512
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:44,195
There is one more thing you don't know.

513
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,690
If you must know, you didn't like me much.

514
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,492
You didn't like me.

515
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,494
You said I was filthy and materialistic.

516
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,329
You're lying.

517
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,132
It's not true, right?

518
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,769
-It's true.
-Why does it feel like a lie?

519
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,938
It's not a lie. It's true.

520
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,611
And I wish it were true, too.

521
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,717
Concentrate on the trial now. Understood?

522
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:14,618
What are you doing here?

523
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,392
I came to prepare for the trial.

524
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,160
It's my first jury trial.

525
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,730
What about you?

526
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,066
I came to do a rehearsal, too.

527
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,769
Are you nervous?

528
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,905
No, not one bit.

529
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,209
I'm nervous.

530
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:43,114
To think that Su-ha's life depends
on my every word...

531
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,516
makes me scared and nervous.

532
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,952
You can't be nervous.

533
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,158
Don't worry.
I'm going to do my very best tomorrow.

534
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,395
I'm going to get an acquittal
no matter what.

535
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:03,234
Though it's not much, it's my way
of paying back the debt I owe you two.

536
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,344
And once I get an acquittal,

537
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,815
I'm going to ask you again.

538
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,185
If you can consider taking me back.

539
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,557
-Mr. Cha, I--
-I haven't asked yet.

540
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:31,729
So don't answer yet and please wait.

541
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,533
Until I ask you.

542
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,026
Yu-chang, I hope you didn't forget
what I asked for.

543
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,329
Don't you worry.
I'll get going right away.

544
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:06,831
Before that.

545
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:09,967
Here.

546
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,635
What is it?

547
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,771
I kept it from a year ago.

548
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:17,675
I was waiting for the right time
and I think this is it.

549
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,823
Did the lawyer buy you new clothes?

550
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,459
Yes.

551
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:38,929
I guess she's trying to make you look good
before the jury.

552
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,499
Your lawyer is really dedicated.

553
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:46,070
Though you'll probably get sentenced
within a day...

554
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,440
-You must be nervous.
-Yes.

555
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,748
What is it? Are you sick?

556
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,921
No, I'm okay.

557
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,226
All rise.

558
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,105
Please be seated.

559
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:35,085
Are the prosecution
and defense counsel all present?

560
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,854
-Yes.
-Yes.

561
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:40,624
Please bring the defendant in.

562
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:04,148
More than ever,
I need you to read my mind.

563
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,551
Why is it that you can't do it right now?

564
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:11,422
Will I be able to win this trial
without your ability?

565
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,458
Will I be able to protect you?

566
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:21,265
Are you two arguing
the jury trial together?

567
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,435
Yes, I asked him to help,

568
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,137
as it's my first trial by jury.

569
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,407
-You'll give the opening statement?
-Yes.

570
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,544
Should I prepare it like any other trial?

571
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,747
No, the delivery
is very important in a jury trial.

572
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,282
Don't show off.

573
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:42,219
You have to be modest and show the jury
that you trust them to decide.

574
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:54,131
I am Seo Do-yeon, the government attorney
overseeing prosecution of this case.

575
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:58,302
I am here to assist you
with your decision-making.

576
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,739
To help the jury members
understand the case better,

577
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,575
I have prepared a screen presentation.

578
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:08,579
TRIAL BY JURY

579
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,347
OPENING STATEMENT

580
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:17,187
It's so flashy. We just have a PowerPoint.

581
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:21,425
Don't worry. It just hurts the eyes
and isn't very effective.

582
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:24,061
CRIMINAL CHARGES
AGAINST THE DEFENDANT

583
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:31,168
Eleven years ago, father of the defendant,
Park Su-ha, was killed by Min Jun-guk.

584
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,673
Min Jun-guk continuously
threatened the defendant.

585
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,176
And last year, he even hurt the defendant.

586
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,547
The defendant had a grudge
against Min Jun-guk.

587
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,350
Around 11 p.m. on July 22, 2012,

588
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:50,287
he met the victim at an indoor-fishing
facility in Yeonju and murdered him.

589
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,289
After dismembering the body,

590
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,659
he concealed it in the river
and we filed the indictment accordingly.

591
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:07,771
The defendant already confessed
to the crime during the investigation.

592
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,941
Today, I am going
to present various evidence,

593
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:15,012
to prove the charges to the jury.

594
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:20,784
The defendant cruelly mutilated the body
to hide his crime.

595
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,920
And instead of regretting
what he had done,

596
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:27,357
he stayed hidden in Ganghwa Island
to avoid getting caught.

597
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,460
But he was found
when someone reported him to the police.

598
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:35,332
Pursuant to Articles 250 and 161
of the Penal Code,

599
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:39,369
we are charging him with murder,
corpse mutilation, and concealment.

600
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:48,512
Defendant, did you hear all the charges?

601
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:49,780
What?

602
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,585
Defendant, do you admit to the charges?

603
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:11,268
No, I do not.

604
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,139
Does that mean
you are pleading not guilty?

605
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,375
Yes.

606
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,012
All right.

607
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:26,617
Counsel. Your opening statement, please.

608
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:28,685
Yes, Your Honor.

609
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,896
The opening statement is important.

610
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:43,167
Show the jury you respect the prosecutor
and praise her.

611
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:49,540
That way the jury will think
you are objective and rational.

612
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:55,846
They will think there must be a reason
that you're defending the defendant.

613
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:59,116
You want me to praise Do-yeon?

614
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,085
I could never do that.

615
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:06,256
I am Jang Hye-seong, Park Su-ha's lawyer.

616
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,492
Before I begin my opening statement,

617
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:13,864
let me commend the prosecutor
for doing her best to prove the truth.

618
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:26,510
When I first saw the charges,
I thought the defendant was guilty.

619
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:30,781
But after reviewing the facts
and talking to the defendant,

620
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,585
I found some facts
that make it hard to believe he is guilty.

621
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:41,892
The defendant had no memory
and the confession was coerced.

622
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:47,064
And there is no direct evidence
that he killed the victim.

623
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,298
It's merely circumstantial.

624
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,467
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE:
INDIRECT PROOF THAT LINKS TO THE CRIME

625
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,870
The defendant living on Ganghwa Island
for a year,

626
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,305
he wasn't trying to cover up his crime.

627
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,242
He couldn't return home
because he had lost his memory.

628
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:04,414
The prosecutor will tell you her plan
to prove the allegations.

629
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:08,986
But we will also provide evidence
to disprove the prosecution's charges.

630
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,791
There is absolutely no direct evidence
that the defendant killed the victim.

631
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,595
That is why we are denying the charges.

632
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:19,830
That is all.

633
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,245
Shall I show them the phone records
and confession?

634
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,381
I think you should leave them out.

635
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,717
Such evidence will be difficult
and boring to the jury.

636
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:44,187
Find evidence
that will provoke the jury instead.

637
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:47,090
It should be visually shocking.

638
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:12,015
As you can see,
the defendant resented the victim a lot.

639
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:16,954
And that resentment grew
when Min Jun-guk evaded the law.

640
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,790
The defendant
couldn't trust the law any longer.

641
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:24,094
He took the matter
into his own hands by killing him.

642
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:28,832
And the defendant dismembered the body
out of resentment.

643
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:32,336
He then hid it thoroughly
and stayed hidden for a year.

644
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:35,706
However...

645
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,485
JURY

646
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:59,262
When this left hand was found,
his perfect crime was ruined.

647
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:02,666
What a witch.

648
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,102
Why did she have to show that in color?

649
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:13,110
The prosecution says the crime
was committed between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m.

650
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:18,415
And that the murder weapon is a knife
with a 15cm blade.

651
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:23,020
Min Jun-guk was 80kg. He was quite large.

652
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,455
ARGUMENT SUMMARY

653
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,523
BREAKING DOWN RIBS

654
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:38,201
Recently, with 80kg of beef ribs,

655
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:41,772
I took it apart with a knife
of the same size.

656
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:45,842
It took me over seven hours
to cut it into wrist-sized pieces.

657
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,545
At the time of the crime,

658
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:53,884
the defendant had been stabbed
in the left shoulder by Min Jun-guk.

659
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:59,356
Could the defendant,
with only one working arm,

660
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:02,225
have killed the victim
and cut the body apart, in four hours?

661
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,305
This is going to be a tough fight.

662
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,442
The defendant has no memory of the event.

663
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:21,011
And the main evidence is the knife
with fingerprints and the left hand.

664
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:24,514
Then the phone records
and footprints are more evidence.

665
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:28,018
An abundance of evidence
can be interpreted in two ways.

666
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,488
Either Park Su-ha
could be the murderer or...

667
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:36,093
Or someone could be setting up Park Su-ha
as the murderer.

668
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:40,964
According to the prosecutor,
the defendant is thorough enough

669
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:45,368
to cut up the body
and stay hidden to hide the crime.

670
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:48,939
But the abundance
of evidence is too contrived

671
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:53,243
for such a meticulous person
to leave behind.

672
00:51:53,743 --> 00:52:00,450
It's as if they are here to tell us,
"He is the murderer."

673
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,395
Maybe we're not realizing
that someone else did it

674
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,831
and we're being tricked by that person.

675
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:19,669
We must also question
whether there could be any other suspects.

676
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:24,941
If such doubt is reasonable,
then the defendant is not guilty.

677
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,861
Wouldn't it be dangerous
to present other suspects?

678
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:49,466
It will be a failure
if the prosecution provides alibis.

679
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:54,304
I lost Hwang Dal-jung's case
because I used that strategy.

680
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,707
But isn't it the best way
to make the jury doubt?

681
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:02,245
All we can do right now is
to present reasonable doubt.

682
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,749
It may be dangerous,
but it's worth trying.

683
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:09,586
From the beginning, the police
and prosecution investigated this case

684
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:14,591
with no suspects other than Park Su-ha.

685
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:17,594
Someone other than the defendant

686
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,363
could have been at the scene
at the same time.

687
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:28,905
Three different footprints were found
on the scene.

688
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,941
One was from Min Jun-guk.

689
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,176
Another was from Park Su-ha.

690
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:35,979
And last print was from Ji Cheol-soo,
the fishing facility's owner.

691
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:39,349
The fishing facility was supposed
to be open all year round.

692
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,918
But it wasn't open only
on the day of the crime.

693
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:43,820
Isn't that strange?

694
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,223
Why was it closed on that very day?

695
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:49,626
It is as though it had been prepared
for this crime.

696
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:57,767
Kim Gi-ho, taking in the defendant
who had no memory or relation to him,

697
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,904
did not report the defendant
but took care of him for a year.

698
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:04,241
And he lied to his neighbors
that the defendant was his grandnephew.

699
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,576
It doesn't make sense.

700
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:11,348
People lie
because they want to hide something.

701
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:15,085
And we need to question what that was.

702
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:23,693
The defendant will likely try to argue
reasonable doubt,

703
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,029
and bring up the possibility
of other suspects.

704
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,631
That's better for us.

705
00:54:27,964 --> 00:54:30,500
Let them present
all the suspects they have.

706
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:36,840
I admit other suspects were excluded
from the investigation.

707
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:41,745
So much circumstantial evidence pointed
toward the defendant.

708
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:48,752
The defense just presented the possibility
of other suspects.

709
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,187
But before we present their alibis,

710
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:55,725
the defense has already excluded them
as suspects.

711
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:59,496
Ji Cheol-soo, the owner
of the fishing facility,

712
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,699
is 61 years old
and suffers from severe diabetes.

713
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:07,103
Kim Gi-ho, who took care
of the defendant for a year,

714
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,506
is currently 74 years old.

715
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,877
According to the defense,
the murderer is someone

716
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:18,648
who is strong enough
to destroy a 80kg body in four hours.

717
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:23,086
The two men are old men
who are much weaker than the defendant.

718
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,491
Isn't that enough to remove them
from the list of suspects?

719
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:38,068
Groundless suspicion

720
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:43,206
only makes the suspicion stronger
that the defendant is guilty.

721
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:47,310
I admit that there were other suspects.
However,

722
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:54,417
of all the suspects,
defendant Park Su-ha is the most solid.

723
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:16,806
Nod your head
as if you just heard something important.

724
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,342
-Smile and look confident.
-What?

725
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:22,445
Pretend to be very shocked
so we can fool the jury.

726
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:29,786
What good will that do
when we're totally defeated?

727
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,325
We need to break the flow
of this trial first.

728
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:42,699
Your Honor, I would like
to discuss our defense with Ms. Jang.

729
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:45,001
Could I request a recess?

730
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,170
Are you crazy?

731
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,408
Shall we adjourn for now?

732
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,413
-Prosecution, what say you?
-We agree.

733
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:01,451
Members of the jury,
you cannot discuss the case during recess.

734
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,122
We will reconvene at 4 p.m.

735
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,065
GAPYEONG BUS TERMINAL

736
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:30,013
Please take me to this address.

737
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:38,021
You were right to cut off the flow.
But I can't think of a strategy.

738
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,560
What should we do?
The prosecution is winning.

739
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,297
Shall we continue with Ji Cheol-soo
and Kim Gi-ho being suspects?

740
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:49,766
No, that won't work.

741
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:52,202
The prosecution said they have alibis.

742
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:54,671
If you continue,
you'll just get destroyed.

743
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:01,177
There is one more suspect,
although the possibility is low.

744
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:02,479
Who?

745
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:05,482
The person who reported Park Su-ha
and took the reward.

746
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:08,818
-Moon Sung-nam.
-That person lives in Gapyeong.

747
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:10,553
There's no relation to Yeonju.

748
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,957
That's why it's strange.
Park Su-ha was on Ganghwa Island.

749
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:17,327
How could someone living 130km away
in Gapyeong report him?

750
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:21,664
Is that why you sent Yu-chang to Gapyeong?

751
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,666
-To find that person?
-Yes.

752
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,971
This is a gut feeling
as an ex-police officer, not a lawyer.

753
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:31,574
There is something about that person.

754
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:34,911
CHOI YU-CHANG

755
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,582
Yu-chang? Did you meet that person?

756
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,484
Is the person really large?

757
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:44,187
Does he look strong enough
to cut up a body?

758
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:47,490
MIN'S FARM

759
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,059
No, it's not even close.

760
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:55,565
She's an older lady.

761
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,767
An older lady?

762
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:01,404
Why does that lady have a name
that sounds like a man's?

763
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,772
I thought it was a man.

764
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,641
I know.

765
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:08,711
I guess some men have women's names
and vice versa.

766
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:10,680
Why are you hitting me?

767
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:12,715
-Get out of here!
-I was about to leave.

768
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,919
I didn't come to take your reward.

769
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,558
-I'll return right away.
-Okay.

770
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:32,969
What should we do? Should we plead guilty?

771
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,374
Shut it!

772
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,351
What is this?

773
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:07,070
Are you going to plead guilty?

774
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:11,174
There's too much evidence,
and they're too strong for us to break.

775
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,778
Could there be any other
reasonable doubt we didn't think of?

776
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:17,647
There are no other suspects.

777
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,515
Should we say that it was an accident?

778
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:25,455
It's going in the same direction
as the Hwang Dal-jung case 26 years ago.

779
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:28,257
It's so ironic.

780
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,893
Even the nickname of the case is the same.

781
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:33,229
"The left-hand murder case."

782
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:39,035
"Hwang Dal-jung"?
"The left-hand murder case"?

783
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:44,974
I got it.
The reasonable doubt that we missed.

784
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:49,445
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

785
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:53,916
Yes, there is one suspect
who fits all the evidence.

786
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,985
Who is that?

787
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,124
IN SESSION

788
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,476
Defense counsel,
do you have anything to add?

789
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,446
Or shall we proceed?

790
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:36,592
I have something
to tell Your Honor and the jury.

791
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,861
Please go ahead.

792
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:52,842
I admit that we doubted other suspects
without any grounds.

793
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,748
But she said that all
of the evidence points toward

794
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:02,385
only one person, the defendant Park Su-ha.

795
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,354
But, there is one more person.

796
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:12,228
He was at the scene
on the day of the crime.

797
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,430
And all of the circumstances match.

798
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:18,334
There were phone records
and he was in possession of the knife.

799
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:22,138
And he has the strength
to cut off a wrist.

800
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,173
Who is that?

801
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:30,346
It's the victim, Min Jun-guk.

802
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:34,183
What are you saying?

803
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,520
Min Jun-guk is the victim
who died in this crime. How--

804
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:41,624
How can he be a suspect?

805
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:43,259
Your Honor.

806
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,629
And members of the jury.

807
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:52,568
The defense is arguing that the victim
Min Jun-guk is still alive.

808
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,726
