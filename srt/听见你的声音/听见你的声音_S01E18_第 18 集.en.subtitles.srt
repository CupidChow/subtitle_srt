1
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,134
How did your mother pass away?

2
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,538
She died about a month
after the heart transplant.

3
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,240
It got rejected.

4
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,745
That's why Min Jun-guk got even angrier.

5
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,949
The heart that was to save his wife
was gone just like that.

6
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:52,619
Yes.

7
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,454
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

8
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,590
The more I wanted you,
the more I got scared.

9
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,160
I was scared that I might lose you.

10
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,533
Do I look like someone
who would abandon you for that?

11
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,135
I've told you many times.

12
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,806
"I have a personality
that surpasses the average person's."

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,877
We were so happy we were alive
that we forgot about one important thing.

14
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:24,284
That once Min Jun-guk was caught,
his past would be revealed to the world.

15
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,320
And when his past was revealed...

16
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,058
my hidden past would also be revealed
to the world as well.

17
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,970
When do you take the stitches out?

18
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,238
Today.

19
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,975
What if it leaves a scar?

20
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,979
You said he's a doctor
who can even erase gang tattoos.

21
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,114
It won't scar.

22
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,515
I hope not.

23
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,386
I thought I brought all my books,
but I left some behind.

24
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,222
I'll have to go back home.

25
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,858
You're bringing more books?

26
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,194
Hey! I'm running out of space
on my bookshelf because of your books.

27
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,996
Throw out the ones you don't read.

28
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,967
Anyway, why do you want to live here?

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,869
Your house is bigger and better than mine.

30
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,338
Then you should come live at my place.

31
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,508
Hey, you must have forgotten,

32
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,777
but we started living together
because of Min Jun-guk.

33
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:28,848
Now that he's in prison,
we have no reason to live together.

34
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:30,783
Of course there is.

35
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,685
What is it?

36
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,358
What are you doing?

37
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,271
Why is your reason so lecherous?

38
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,707
This, here. This is the reason.

39
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:02,015
Anyway, keep your distance
while you live here, okay?

40
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,219
Is the Police Academy exam tomorrow?

41
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,121
Yes.

42
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,990
-How do you feel?
-I won't know until tomorrow.

43
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,959
Right now, it doesn't feel good.

44
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,545
Hold on!

45
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,025
Thank you for waiting.

46
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:48,861
It was nothing.

47
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,098
I heard you're in charge
of the Min Jun-guk case.

48
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,366
Yes.

49
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:58,304
Oh, no. Don't tell me
that you're going to defend him.

50
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,506
Come on. I'm a victim, too.

51
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,776
The spot he hit me still hurts
when it rains.

52
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,714
Then again, you wouldn't defend him
unless you were crazy.

53
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,250
It must be a long list of charges.

54
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,318
He's done so much wrong.

55
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,553
Yes.

56
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,421
Let me tell you in advance.

57
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:19,659
But I don't have an ounce
of sympathy for him.

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,462
I'm going to demand the death sentence.

59
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,064
And I will certainly get
the death sentence at trial.

60
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,681
Why did you come?

61
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,616
I came to make a request.

62
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,022
Whoever your lawyer is,
I hope you won't lie to that person.

63
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,759
I would lie if it would change anything.

64
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,028
But there's no chance.

65
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,664
It's obvious what will happen.

66
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,068
If that's what you think,
you should speak about your buried past,

67
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,469
and let it all go.

68
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,305
If, as you said,

69
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,507
lying won't change anything,

70
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,777
-then admit everything you hid--
-If I say everything...

71
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,380
Will you defend me?

72
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:15,682
What?

73
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,084
If you say you will defend me,
I will think about it,

74
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,386
about saying everything.

75
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:22,855
Why is it me again?

76
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,059
I have a lot of rancor toward you.
I broke my arm because of you.

77
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,361
And Ms. Jjang almost died because of you.

78
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,097
A year ago in a similar situation,

79
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,466
you still took my side.

80
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,137
Isn't the result of this trial obvious?

81
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,407
I'm not asking you to change the result.

82
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:45,044
I just want you to hear my story
until the end.

83
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,039
Mom, you worry too that might scar, right?

84
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,143
Me too,

85
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,246
but they said the doctor is good,
so it will be okay.

86
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,186
Mom.

87
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,856
Min Jun-guk has been caught.

88
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,259
There's so much evidence this time,

89
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,162
so he can't get away.

90
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,102
How do you feel?

91
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,406
Does it feel better?

92
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,409
Is your sadness relieved?

93
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,252
I wish I could hear your voice

94
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,454
just once more.

95
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,458
Hye-seong.

96
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,328
Yes.

97
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,565
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

98
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:18,638
If everyone lived by that law,
everyone would become blind.

99
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,341
I know.

100
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,243
Promise me.

101
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,614
Don't waste your life
hating someone, okay?

102
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,118
You only live once.

103
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,621
There's barely enough time to love people.

104
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,528
Okay.

105
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,598
I promise.

106
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,438
SUSPECT INTERROGATION PROTOCOL

107
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,707
The murder of Jang Hye-seong's mother

108
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,676
won't be handled during this trial.

109
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,378
It will be tried separately
at the appellate court.

110
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,849
I wrote an appeal and the reason
for the appeal last year,

111
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,051
and I had it put on hold.

112
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,254
Okay.

113
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,524
So, shall we keep going?

114
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,293
On the day of your release a year ago,

115
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,930
you called Park Su-ha and Jang Hye-seong
out to a parking garage, right?

116
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,132
I called Park Su-ha myself.

117
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,202
Jang Hye-seong found her way there
on her own.

118
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,406
So at the parking garage,
you only intended to hurt Park Su-ha?

119
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,541
Yes.

120
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:32,778
But you stabbed Jang Hye-seong first
when she turned up there.

121
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,080
No.

122
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,583
I wasn't the one
who stabbed Jang Hye-seong.

123
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,585
Then who did?

124
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,587
Park Su-ha did.

125
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,726
Are you lying again?

126
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,396
Lying about it won't change anything.

127
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,632
I'm being honest.

128
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,768
I'm the one who stabbed Park Su-ha.

129
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:56,936
But

130
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,940
Park Su-ha was the one
who stabbed Jang Hye-seong.

131
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,346
2014 POLICE ACADEMY EXAM, FIRST ROUND,
GYEONGGI PROVINCE

132
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,068
I can't believe this.

133
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,772
Why did Min Jun-guk ask for Mr. Cha again?

134
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,440
That can't happen.

135
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,810
Mr. Cha is a victim
who was hurt by Min Jun-guk.

136
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,479
How can a victim defend his own assailant?

137
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,883
-It can't be, right?
-Of course not.

138
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,551
Just assign it to Mr. Shin.

139
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,854
Mr. Shin asked me
not to give it to him, either.

140
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,290
And the defendant wants it.

141
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:57,229
If I asked Mr. Cha to do it again,
that would be shameless, right?

142
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,664
-Yes.
-Yes.

143
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,201
Okay. I won't.

144
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,905
I can't ask a victim
to defend his assailant.

145
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,212
I'm not excluded as his defense counsel,
even with special circumstances.

146
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,113
Mr. Cha.

147
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,217
Maybe it's a reason for a judge,
but it doesn't apply to exclude a lawyer.

148
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:22,421
Mr. Cha, are you really thinking
of defending Min Jun-guk?

149
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,891
What should I do?

150
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,598
Of course, I will be grateful
if you take it.

151
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,135
It's what the defendant wants,
and the others don't want this case.

152
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,170
But it's too shameful.

153
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,373
I cannot ask you to take this case.

154
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,577
Isn't it right
that I be grateful if he did take it?

155
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,880
But I won't ask him to. Why?

156
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,216
Because I know I shouldn't.

157
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,085
I will do it.

158
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,487
I will defend Min Jun-guk.

159
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,658
Really?

160
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,728
You really don't have to.
Why are you doing this?

161
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:07,266
You're making me into a shameless person.
Goodness.

162
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,040
Are you crazy?

163
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,343
I like you, Mr. Cha, but this isn't right.

164
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:21,414
Do you know how dark our office mood was,
because of his case a year ago?

165
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,883
I really hate it
when it's gloomy like that.

166
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,286
I don't think this is right, Mr. Cha.

167
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,922
I feel uneasy about taking on Min Jun-guk,

168
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,457
but not as much as if you do.

169
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,360
I will take Min Jun-guk.

170
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,062
I think I will have to do it.

171
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,798
Min Jun-guk wants me to do it.

172
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,733
Mr. Cha...

173
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,235
But still...

174
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:49,575
Do you think
you'll be able to face Ms. Jjang again?

175
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,277
Of course not.

176
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:55,314
This is something
you should never do to Ms. Jang. Never!

177
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,984
Excuse me.

178
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,253
I'm right here.

179
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,823
Why are you speaking as if I weren't here?

180
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,760
I want you to know my position
in this situation.

181
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,329
I am on your side.

182
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,501
Really? If you're on my side,
then take Mr. Cha's side, too.

183
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,002
I'm on his side.

184
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,270
What?

185
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,705
Ms. Jjang.

186
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,976
In this situation,
does anyone have it harder than Mr. Cha?

187
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,244
No, right?

188
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,681
Then I don't think we can say anything
about it.

189
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:40,993
Ms. Jjang.

190
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:46,198
Please don't say anything like,
"Thank you for understanding."

191
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,834
I didn't take your side willingly.

192
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:49,902
That's not it.

193
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,304
Your skirt is backward.

194
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,241
I see.

195
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,212
I won't make a mistake like last time.

196
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:05,718
He said if I defended him,
he would admit to all he did 11 years ago.

197
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,286
That's why I took it.

198
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:08,988
Was that the reason?

199
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,490
You should have told me in advance.

200
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,794
You still took my side,
even though you didn't know.

201
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,130
Well...

202
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,200
Thank you for understanding.

203
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,975
I think it's going to leave a scar.

204
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,580
It will probably fade with time.

205
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,083
And you can't see it
if you do your hair like this.

206
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,718
Really?

207
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,655
Should I wear a big hairpin on this side?

208
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,690
That will draw the attention away.

209
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,794
Oh. I have something to give you.

210
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,496
What is it?

211
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,018
What is this?

212
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,500
Hey. How did you...

213
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,438
I saw how you wanted it.

214
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,442
You're crazy. This is really expensive.

215
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,445
Go and return this.
Do you have the receipt?

216
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,180
No. It's a present. I won't.

217
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,948
You don't have this kind of money.

218
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,351
I'll accept the thought.
I'm truly thankful.

219
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,754
So don't ever buy anything
like this again. Got it?

220
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,824
Why is he burdening me?

221
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,094
I should be careful even thinking
about something I want.

222
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,566
Do I still look like a kid to you?

223
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,336
Young, childish,
and someone to worry about?

224
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:05,938
Right?

225
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,876
Are you upset?

226
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,445
No. I just feel bad.

227
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,049
I'll return this. Don't worry.

228
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,520
Okay. Thank you.

229
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,507
There are so many other reasons
why we can't be together.

230
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,776
So I think we should end things
at some point.

231
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,613
I can't keep relying on you
to win my trials.

232
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,481
I'm a lawyer after all.

233
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,518
I'm going to try it on my own today.

234
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:57,790
This is a problem.
I can't keep relying on you.

235
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,204
Ms. Seo.

236
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:16,108
Cha Guan-woo is the lawyer
in charge of the Min Jun-guk case.

237
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,609
Really?

238
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:20,846
He must be crazy.

239
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,014
He is crazy.

240
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,084
I know. He must have no feelings.

241
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,319
Why does he want to be played
by him again?

242
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,256
I won't let him off this time.
I'm going to let him have it.

243
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,194
Ms. Seo. It's Mr. Cha.

244
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,598
Tell him I'm not in. From now on,
I won't take his calls or visits.

245
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,766
Okay.

246
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,104
Mr. Cha? What?

247
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,606
He said he heard that.

248
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,780
From now on, never take his calls.

249
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,651
What should we do
about the Park Su-ha case?

250
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,320
I did send a subpoena.

251
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,824
What do you think?
We can't just let it pass.

252
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,114
Why did the Prosecutor's Office
send me something?

253
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,524
SUBPOENA
TO: PARK SU-HA RE ATTEMPTED MURDER

254
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,096
YEONJU DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
PROSECUTOR: SEO DO-YEON

255
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,778
Ms. Jjang. We're in trouble.

256
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,682
-What?
-Park Su-ha has been subpoenaed

257
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,384
as a suspect for attempted murder.

258
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,289
What do you mean? "Attempted murder"?

259
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,558
I don't know what went wrong.

260
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:17,963
In the parking garage, was it Park Su-ha,
not Min Jun-guk, who stabbed you?

261
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,639
Is that right?

262
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,375
How did they know?

263
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,946
I think Ms. Seo found out
while questioning Min Jun-guk.

264
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,683
Was it really Park Su-ha who stabbed you?

265
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,888
I got in between them.

266
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,791
Su-ha didn't know it was me.

267
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,761
Attempted murder?
We worked so hard to get here.

268
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,731
We can't do this to Su-ha.

269
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,468
Oh, no.

270
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,610
Ms. Jjang!

271
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,217
TO: PARK SU-HA
REGARDING THE ATTEMPTED MURDER

272
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:30,969
Su-ha.

273
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,840
What is that? Is it a subpoena?

274
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,242
Did you find out?

275
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,683
This is nothing.

276
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,218
Go say you didn't do it.

277
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,654
Just say that Min Jun-guk stabbed me.

278
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,658
There were no cameras there.
We can get our stories straight.

279
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,027
We'll say that Min Jun-guk is lying.

280
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,467
No. We can't do that.

281
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,437
We can do that. This is why I came,
because I worried you would be like this.

282
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,473
I'll meet Seo Do-yeon tomorrow
and talk about everything.

283
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,309
What will she do if I deny it?

284
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,844
Don't worry. I can do this.

285
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,380
I know that you can do it.

286
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,517
But I also know that you shouldn't do it.

287
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,118
Su-ha.

288
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,226
This is different from the last trial.

289
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,363
I clearly remember what I did.
I can't lie about it.

290
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,668
I stabbed you with a knife.
I can't cover that up with anything.

291
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,403
Listen to me, please.

292
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,241
With attempted murder, nothing changes
even if I agree to settle.

293
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,742
You could go to jail.

294
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,944
Then you'll become an ex-convict.

295
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,846
You can't become a police officer.

296
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,148
Your future will be ruined.

297
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,655
I know all of that.
It's okay. I'll find another job.

298
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,759
You fool. Why won't you listen to me?

299
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,730
You don't have to do this.
We worked so hard to get here.

300
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,200
You can lie. You can do it this once.

301
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,402
You can really do that.

302
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,307
No, I can't.

303
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,863
Ms. Seo Do-yeon!

304
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,867
Please talk to me!

305
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,540
Ms. Seo Do-yeon! Please talk to me!

306
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,442
Hey! Seo Do-yeon!

307
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:53,745
She stopped.

308
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,448
What? "Hey! Seo Do-yeon!"?

309
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,321
Ms. Seo. Please talk to...

310
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,095
What was that?
Did she trick me on purpose?

311
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,497
Shoot!

312
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,810
SUBPOENA

APPLICATION PERIOD FOR THE POLICE ACADEMY

315
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,469
LET'S GO TO THE POLICE ACADEMY!
YOU CAN DO IT! GOOD LUCK!

316
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,984
I'm going to the Prosecutors' Office.

317
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,888
I'm sorry for not listening to you.

318
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,964
You once asked about the dream I had.

319
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:26,338
In my dream, you keep getting hurt
as you did that one time.

320
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,807
And you're bleeding.

321
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,543
It must have been a warning...

322
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,579
That I shouldn't forget about that day.

323
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,450
I'm getting punished
for ignoring that warning.

324
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:44,423
I'll go and tell them everything honestly.

325
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,593
Then at least, I won't have such dreams.

326
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,837
Can I ask you a favor before I go?

327
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,507
If...

328
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,143
If...

329
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,980
I have to leave your side
because of this...

330
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,219
Can you wait for me?

331
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:01,066
Ms. Seo.

332
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,608
Seo Do-yeon!

333
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,578
Hey, Seo Do-yeon!

334
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,028
Ms. Seo Do-yeon. Please talk to me.

335
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:31,997
I have nothing to say.

336
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,901
Then let's talk here.

337
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,404
Excuse me. Please let me out.

338
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,809
I have no sympathy for Min Jun-guk.

339
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,212
I don't think I have
to make any allowances.

340
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,714
I didn't come to talk about Min Jun-guk.

341
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,585
I came to talk about Park Su-ha.

342
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,290
Excuse me!

343
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,883
LET'S GO TO THE POLICE ACADEMY!
YOU CAN DO IT! GOOD LUCK!

344
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,382
What's this?

345
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,320
It looks like my notebook. Why is it here?

346
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,465
"This was the day
before Min Jun-guk's final trial."

347
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,336
"Even if I disappear..."

348
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:23,408
"Even if I disappear,
I don't want you to know.

349
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:32,117
I want you to think
that I'm living well somewhere..."

350
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:50,502
PARK SU-HA, YOU HAVE PASSED ROUND ONE
OF THE ENTRANCE EXAM

351
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,059
"That I'm studying well,
getting along with my friends...

352
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,161
And preparing to become a policeman.

353
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,330
I want you to think that I'm doing well.

354
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:31,776
I don't want you to cry,
even if I'm not around.

355
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,412
I want you to be happy always.

356
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:46,424
And I want you to remember me
occasionally, very occasionally."

357
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,813
How can you summon Park Su-ha
as a suspect for attempted murder?

358
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,282
Have you forgotten
why that happened that day?

359
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:14,519
It upsets me, too.
But it's the truth, so what can I do?

360
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:18,523
It was Park Su-ha
who had stabbed Jang Hye-seong that day.

361
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,925
It was an accident that occurred
while he was protecting Ms. Jjang.

362
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,194
And that's why Ms. Jjang kept it a secret.

363
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:26,364
A crime is a crime.
Do you want me to let it pass?

364
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,500
How can you say that to a prosecutor?

365
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,968
Why did that crime happen?

366
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:33,438
You, me, and Mr. Kim.
The three of us created that crime.

367
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,907
Why are you bringing me into this?

368
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,476
If I hadn't been fooled
by Min Jun-guk a year ago,

369
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,478
and if you hadn't made
the witness commit perjury,

370
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:44,382
and if the judge had been more prudent
in grasping the facts of the situation,

371
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,718
Park Su-ha wouldn't have done something
like this.

372
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,220
Park Su-ha is the one
who fixed our faults.

373
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:53,057
Park Su-ha played the biggest role
in catching Min Jun-guk.

374
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,226
Why aren't you taking that
into consideration?

375
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:56,628
What about compensation?

376
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,731
Who will compensate Park Su-ha
for the damage he suffered?

377
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,600
No credit or compensation,
but you'll punish him for his crime?

378
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,637
Is that what you think the law is,
Seo Do-yeon?

379
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,806
Yes, I do.

380
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,442
More than anything,
the law should be objective.

381
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,416
Can you stop? I'm in a rush.

382
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,137
Ms. Seo. Ms. Seo Do-yeon.

383
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,041
Why? What is it now?

384
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:04,062
YEONJU DISTRICT
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

385
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:11,636
"The defendant tried to get revenge
on Jang Hye-seong who had testified

386
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:18,009
against him and decided to kill her
and her protector, Park Su-ha.

387
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:31,656
He tried to stab Park Su-ha
from behind with a knife,

388
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,526
but a witness
who had followed the victims appeared.

389
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,263
He failed in his attempt

390
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,065
to murder the two victims failed."

391
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,641
Since this is an interrogation,
I will be formal with you, Mr. Park Su-ha.

392
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:51,809
Yes.

393
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:55,146
How long was the knife blade
with which you stabbed Jang Hye-seong?

394
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,682
I think it was about 15cm.

395
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,453
Where did you stab her?

396
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,959
It was the left side, along the ribs.

397
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,565
Ms. Seo. Ms. Seo Do-yeon.

398
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,735
Why? What is it now?

399
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:23,541
I agree with you
that the law should be objective.

400
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:29,981
But I also agree with Mr. Cha
that the law should have a heart.

401
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:35,086
I think you also agree with Mr. Cha a lot.

402
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,454
Am I right?

403
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,491
-No, not at all.
-Really?

404
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:47,465
I think you showed that you do
at the Hwang Dal-jung trial.

405
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,175
Did you stab Jang Hye-seong to kill her?

406
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,078
No, not at all. Min Jun-guk was--

407
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,179
Stop.

408
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:04,082
Did they hear?

409
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,385
It's dangerous if he mentions Min Jun-guk.

410
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:12,256
He could be free of this but get charged
with the attempted murder of Min Jun-guk.

411
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,092
I should cut him off here.

412
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,861
It doesn't sound
as though it was attempted murder.

413
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,329
What?

414
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:23,901
There was no intention to murder
and the knife was too short to kill.

415
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:27,005
And neither was the area
where you stabbed her a critical area.

416
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:32,210
I'll change the charge to bodily harm
caused by possession of a deadly weapon.

417
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,412
LAW REGARDING SENTENCING
FOR ACTS OF VIOLENCE

418
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,882
It's easier to suspend the indictment
for that.

419
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,052
It looks like she's going to let him off.

420
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:42,920
I know.

421
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,956
The victim, Jang Hye-seong, does not wish

422
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,859
for you to be punished, right?

423
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:50,962
Yes.

424
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,469
Park Su-ha.

425
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,939
Did you just meet with Ms. Seo?

426
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,574
Yes.

427
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:06,477
Ms. Seo's ears must be blocked up.

428
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,815
Don't you worry.
I'll go and open up her ears.

429
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,850
Attempted murder does not make sense.

430
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,386
The prosecutor won't raise my indictment.
It's been suspended.

431
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,690
What? She suspended the indictment
for attempted murder?

432
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,429
No, she lowered the charge to possession
of a weapon and suspended that charge.

433
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,965
I see. That's a relief.

434
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,702
Ms. Seo is someone who listens after all.

435
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,206
Thank you.

436
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,376
-For what?
-Everything.

437
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:42,013
I know how much you like Ms. Jjang.

438
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,984
I know you're doing this
for me because of her.

439
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:52,957
I hate to admit it,
but you're someone I can't measure up to.

440
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:57,795
You're such a great person
that I feel bad Ms. Jjang chose me.

441
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,465
What are you doing? This is too cheesy.

442
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,103
I'll be good to Ms. Jjang.

443
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:09,974
I'll take cherish and good care of her
so I don't feel bad about her decision.

444
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,444
What is this?
Why does it sound like a warning?

445
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,013
Are you saying I should keep my distance
from Ms. Jjang?

446
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,683
I'd be grateful if you did.

447
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,063
That little squirt.

448
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,879
Su-ha.

449
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,682
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

450
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,052
I'm sorry, Su-ha.

451
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,290
I'm sorry I pretended not to rely on you
when I do so much.

452
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:37,428
I'm sorry I didn't show you
how much I love you.

453
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,801
I'm sorry I was uneasy about our future
and thought of ending it.

454
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,336
I'm sorry for everything.

455
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,007
You're not going to jail, not ever.

456
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:55,680
I'll defend you with all my might
and get you probation.

457
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,649
And if...

458
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,486
Even if you go, don't worry.

459
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,823
I'll wait for you.

460
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:10,494
I'm not going to jail.

461
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:14,665
What?

462
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,535
Ms. Seo suspended the indictment.

463
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,804
I won't be summoned again about this.

464
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,606
Suspended the indictment?

465
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,109
Do-yeon? Why did she do that?

466
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,845
I think Mr. Cha persuaded her.

467
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:29,480
Really?

468
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:34,685
That's a relief. That's such a relief.

469
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,496
Shoot. I said too much.
This is embarrassing.

470
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,104
Hey. Pretend you didn't hear everything
I just said.

471
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,807
I think I was emotional
and said things I shouldn't have.

472
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:02,813
It's not as though it's not true.
I went a bit overboard.

473
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:03,914
So...

474
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,285
This is so effing embarrassing.

475
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:21,866
Tell me.

476
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,669
You said you didn't say
"I love you" enough.

477
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:26,270
That was...

478
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:29,106
I wasn't in my right mind.

479
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,216
I love you.

480
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,387
What? I can't hear.

481
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,061
Okay. I love you.

482
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:51,095
I love you, okay?

483
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,364
I love you so much. Okay?

484
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,619
I know why you are so anxious.

485
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:53,891
And I know you're always preparing
for the day when I may not be here.

486
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,329
But I won't worry
even if that someday comes.

487
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,266
I recognized you
even though ten years had passed.

488
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:06,303
Even when I had lost my memory
and erased you from my mind,

489
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,274
I fell back in love with you.

490
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:15,079
Even if another ten years pass
and I lose my memory again,

491
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,449
or that someday
that you worry about comes,

492
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:22,319
I'm going to find you

493
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,055
and fall in love with you again.

494
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,662
I will talk
about your wife's heart transplant,

495
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,999
and how your mother
and son starved to death.

496
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:40,304
All we can hope is that they will consider
the mitigating circumstances.

497
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,108
At trial, don't ever say their deaths were

498
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:47,878
because of Jang Hye-seong
or Park Su-ha's father.

499
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,947
I still think they died

500
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,616
because of them.

501
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,120
No, it's not because of them.

502
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:57,822
Of course,

503
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,057
I do feel bad about your wife.

504
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,360
And Park Su-ha's father did something
he shouldn't have.

505
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:04,728
But

506
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:10,868
when you killed him,
you lost your chance to justify yourself.

507
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:12,803
Let's stop.

508
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,507
Your mother and son didn't die
because of Jang Hye-seong.

509
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:20,110
Because you murdered someone,
because you went to jail,

510
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,047
because you weren't able to take care
of your son and mother with dementia,

511
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,049
that's why they starved to death.

512
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,184
Don't say it so easily.

513
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,020
Have you ever once been in my position?

514
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,055
Yes.

515
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:35,659
As your defense attorney,
I spent every day in your shoes.

516
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,729
I tried to see the world
from your point of view.

517
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,500
And I found out

518
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,568
what your true thoughts were.

519
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:56,347
Father. You're home.

520
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:59,283
I came home early today.

521
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,118
Why did you come?

522
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,055
Mother said she left something here.

523
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,625
I got a call

524
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,160
from the chief prosecutor.

525
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,830
You dismissed the indictment

526
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,366
on the Hwang Dal-jung case.

527
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,067
He said

528
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,570
you're going to be investigated for that.

529
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,172
I was prepared for that.

530
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:26,644
You'll be sent to a branch office,

531
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,746
or even be suspended.

532
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,387
I will accept any disciplinary action
that I deserve.

533
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:40,357
So tell me. What are my true thoughts?

534
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:46,864
You also admit that you're the one
who started all of this, right?

535
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,904
You probably realized it at some point,
but it was too late to stop.

536
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,609
If you stopped,
your life would cease to have meaning.

537
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,145
That's why you insisted.

538
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,949
You killed people and insisted
that you were right.

539
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:09,587
Please stop.

540
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:13,490
You should say exactly that at the trial,

541
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,025
that you regret it.

542
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,462
Say that you did something you shouldn't.
Say that.

543
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,967
Be honest and don't lie anymore.

544
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,570
Isn't it painful to keep insisting even
when you know you're wrong?

545
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:37,181
Insisting won't make what's wrong right.

546
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,683
And it won't turn back time.

547
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:44,021
If you keep insisting,
you'll just be abusing yourself.

548
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:50,694
That's why you became so completely alone,
with no one on your side.

549
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,539
Su-ha.

550
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,475
Hello.

551
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,244
Ta-da. What do you think? Pretty, right?

552
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,346
I put our initials here.

553
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,249
This is Su-ha. This is Seong-bin.

554
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:13,651
Love.

555
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:16,320
It's pretty.

556
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,723
I'm going to apply
for the Police Academy next year.

557
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:20,924
I'm going to go there with you.

558
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:23,027
What books should I buy?

559
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,262
What? Oh...

560
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,000
There she goes again.

561
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:35,339
Why does he let her continue
if he doesn't have feelings for her?

562
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:39,877
Seong-bin.

563
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,781
Are you the one
who gave Ms. Jjang my teddy bear?

564
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,082
What?

565
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,885
Yes. How did you know?

566
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:51,822
I left it at school, but she has it now.
So who else but you?

567
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,626
I thought you had bought it for her.

568
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:56,960
Thank you.

569
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:00,964
Then you must know how I feel
about Ms. Jjang.

570
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,332
What?

571
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:04,935
I do.

572
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,771
And you know that it hasn't changed,
not once, for the past 11 years

573
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,440
and won't change in the future, too?

574
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:12,509
Yes.

575
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,578
Then I can tell you this.

576
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,450
-I don't want you to keep--
-Okay.

577
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:23,887
I know what you're going to say.
So you don't have to say anymore.

578
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:25,856
Please stop.

579
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,526
If I hear the rest, I might start crying.

580
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,730
Okay.

581
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,968
These books are really expensive.
I'm glad I didn't buy them yet.

582
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,003
Thanks for telling me
before I bought them.

583
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:43,774
I'm sorry.

584
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:48,479
No, you shouldn't be sorry.
I'm grateful I saved money.

585
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,817
I should go.

586
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:55,686
What?

587
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,888
Okay.

588
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:09,900
Did I

589
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,836
just get dumped?

590
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,440
So suddenly?

591
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:26,617
Hello? Chung-gi? This is Su-ha.

592
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,054
Hey, your underwear is showing!

593
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:34,892
What are you looking at?

594
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,398
Ko Seong-bin. Are you asleep?

595
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,569
What's up? Did Su-ha dump you?

596
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:52,543
It was okay in the beginning.
He said my nails were pretty.

597
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,344
I can't believe you.

598
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:59,616
When a guy says
that your hands or feet are pretty,

599
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,919
it means that your face isn't pretty.

600
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,192
How can you say that in this situation?

601
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,760
Can't you console me?

602
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,466
Hey, Ko Seong-bin!

603
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:20,938
You're really ugly,
but consider yourself lucky.

604
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:25,008
Ugly girls are meant
to meet really good guys.

605
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,446
Are you trying to make me angrier?

606
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,747
Think about it.

607
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,750
Men go after pretty girls
just for their looks.

608
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:37,287
But guys like that have no substance.

609
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,023
But guys who go after girls
who are ugly like you

610
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,393
like you for your heart, not your looks.

611
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,231
So that guy is a great guy.

612
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,536
Yes, I'm ugly. That's why Su-ha dumped me.

613
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:56,974
That's not what I meant.
Why can't you understand me?

614
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:01,545
That's right. I can't understand you.
I'm ugly and stupid. Okay?

615
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:06,850
I can't believe her.

616
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:10,220
Is there a problem with me or with her?

617
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,789
What is this? I can't believe this.

618
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,925
She's so pretty.

619
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,263
Oh, you're in, Ms. Jjang.

620
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:23,000
I wanted to tell you a few things
about the Min Jun-guk trial.

621
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,970
Min Jun-guk agreed to the statements
from both you and Park Su-ha.

622
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:30,774
So neither of you will have to testify
as witnesses.

623
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,610
He must have admitted to everything.

624
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:38,215
Yes, I persuaded him to admit
what he has done.

625
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,351
-Mr. Cha.
-Yes?

626
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:45,188
I heard from Su-ha
that you persuaded Do-yeon.

627
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,658
That was nothing.

628
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:51,061
Seo Do-yeon was more open-minded
than I had thought.

629
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,931
She would have done the same,
even if it weren't for me.

630
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,833
In this situation, you can boast a little.

631
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,571
Thank you.

632
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:04,942
Not at all.

633
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,184
What was that?

634
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:17,554
I'm thanking you for everything you did.

635
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:23,126
For liking me, taking care of me,
and even helping Su-ha.

636
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,495
Thank you for everything.

637
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:35,305
Yes, thank you for thanking me.

638
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,445
I'm sitting right here.

639
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:43,981
Yes, we know.

640
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,717
ATTORNEY SHIN SANG-DEOK

641
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:48,852
Wow!

642
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,121
Did you all hear the news?

643
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:55,225
That mean Ms. Seo is going
to be investigated.

644
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:57,627
-Why?
-Investigated?

645
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,396
-Why?
-Why do you think?

646
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:03,333
For arbitrarily dismissing the indictment
for Hwang Dal-jung.

647
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,969
At the very least,
she'll be sent to a branch office.

648
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:10,173
She might get suspended. Wow! Oh...

649
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,347
Am I

650
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,483
the only one who's happy?

651
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,152
You all hated Ms. Seo.

652
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,989
Ms. Jang, she even slapped you
in the face.

653
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,692
Do you enjoy others' unhappiness so much?

654
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,728
I'm disappointed, Yu-chang.

655
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,263
Shoot.

656
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:38,502
Don't live like that.

657
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:50,414
I heard you're getting investigated.

658
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,750
-Did the rumor reach you already?
-Yes.

659
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,387
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

660
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:00,290
I'll just get sent to a branch office.

661
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,426
It's nothing to worry about.

662
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,463
So it's not for suspending the indictment
for Su-ha, right?

663
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,566
That's muddy water compared
to the other filth.

664
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:11,768
Filth?

665
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,305
If Su-ha's case is muddy water,
what is the filth?

666
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,641
Your father's case?

667
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,576
What?

668
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,646
Is that how it sounds?

669
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:26,783
Just like me,
you speak without thinking enough.

670
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,621
ELEVATORS TO THE COURTROOMS

671
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,662
Hold on!

672
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,964
Hold on.

673
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,107
Thank you.

674
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,243
Thank you for helping Park Su-ha.

675
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,580
I played a big role in that.

676
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,181
You should thank Mr. Cha.

677
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:02,018
He kept following me
around to persuade me.

678
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,020
I was so irritated.

679
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:06,456
I already thanked Mr. Cha.

680
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,227
I also asked Ms. Seo to be lenient, too.

681
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,862
He's a good lawyer.

682
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,498
He said the law should have a heart.

683
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,068
That's how he persuaded me. And it worked.

684
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,639
"The law should have a heart."
That is what I said.

685
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:26,309
I know. Mr. Cha is good with words.

686
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,217
Ms. Jjang!

687
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:39,289
You're too much.
Is it so hard to say thank you?

688
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,130
Thank you.

689
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:51,168
Oh, she did it. That mutant really did it.

690
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:55,272
I have to record this and keep it forever.

691
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,941
Hold on. No!

692
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,176
No!

693
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,580
Even if I go to a branch office,

694
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:07,217
Mr. Cho will handle the Min Jun-guk case,
so don't worry about it.

695
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,152
Will you come see the trial?

696
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:11,988
No, I'm busy learning something new
these days.

697
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,057
I don't have time
to go see Min Jun-guk's trial.

698
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,593
But shouldn't you watch the trial?

699
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,363
He killed your mother
and tormented you for 11 years.

700
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,766
Don't you want to see how things end
for him?

701
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,135
Not really. You'll take good care of it.

702
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,538
Okay, then. Don't worry about it.

703
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,174
Mr. Cho will find a way
to get the death sentence.

704
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:39,115
Do you think I want
to see him get the death sentence?

705
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,483
Don't you?

706
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,321
That person deserves to die. No...

707
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,756
I can't even call him a person.

708
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:51,294
I don't know. I'm not sure about that.

709
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:56,566
What? Are you pretending to be a lawyer?

710
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,669
Were you a lawyer
with that much sense of duty?

711
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,839
-Of course not.
-So why are you like this?

712
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:06,243
Do you feel bad for him? Is it sympathy?

713
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:09,512
I'm not Mother Teresa.
I don't have sympathy for him.

714
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:12,782
-It's not that at all.
-What is it, then?

715
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:19,456
To say, "You should die
because you killed my mother,"

716
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,993
is just what Min Jun-guk would think.

717
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,631
It feels disgusting
to think I could be the same as he is.

718
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:29,766
So

719
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:32,369
I'm against the death sentence.

720
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,944
TWO MONTHS LATER

721
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:49,085
You know tomorrow is the day
for sentencing Min Jun-guk, right?

722
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,054
-Yes.
-Are you going?

723
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:54,824
No, you know I have my interview
at the Police Academy tomorrow.

724
00:54:55,058 --> 00:55:00,430
Do you want Min Jun-guk
to get the death penalty?

725
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,801
I used to. But not anymore.

726
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:06,770
Why?

727
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,408
No, don't say it. I'll guess it.

728
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,678
You don't want to become just like him.

729
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,279
-Right?
-Wow.

730
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:18,782
How did you know?

731
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,785
I guess I've developed an ability
that is similar to yours.

732
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,221
It's baseball time.

733
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:30,126
Why are you going to the fridge?

734
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,130
Let's wear these.

735
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:39,636
-It's 7 to 7.
-No, I'm never going to wear that.

736
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:43,740
-He hit it low to the ground.
-Oh!

737
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:44,708
Oh, no!

738
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:45,942
Fence! Over the fence!

739
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:46,843
Gosh!

740
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,179
Su-ha doesn't like
to go to crowded places.

741
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:53,116
So we don't go to baseball fields
or movie theatres.

742
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,855
Ms. Jjang becomes a monster
when she watches baseball.

743
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,292
Sometimes it's very scary.

744
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:11,501
Su-ha is good at cooking
since he's lived alone from middle school.

745
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,636
It must have been very lonely.

746
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:22,011
Ms. Jjang mixes everything together
because she couldn't spare time to cook.

747
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,314
It must have been very exhausting.

748
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:32,689
I think Ms. Jjang still thinks
that our relationship will have to end.

749
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,725
I don't care if she thinks that.

750
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,662
Even if it ends, I will find her again.

751
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:43,166
We'll start over and become happy again.

752
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:47,804
I still feel anxious when I look at Su-ha.

753
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,206
It feels as if this might end one day.

754
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:57,580
To calm that anxiety, I try to be more
understanding and considerate of Su-ha.

755
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:01,718
I will probably continue to feel anxious.

756
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:05,555
And I will be happy with Su-ha
for quite a long time.

757
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:10,627
Number 139, Park Seong-wook,
and 140, Park Su-ha, please come in.

758
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,898
Park Su-ha, you have very good grades.

759
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,367
Your physical condition is good, too.

760
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,003
However...

761
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:24,174
It says that you quit high school.

762
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:25,408
Yes.

763
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,745
Why did you quit high school?

764
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:35,118
Park Su-ha, you're quite famous
among the police.

765
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,988
Let's see how honest you can be.

766
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,424
A lot of things happened.

767
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:45,028
I lost my memory for a year
and went missing.

768
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:47,564
And I was tried as a murder suspect.

769
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,099
I was also the target
of a retaliatory crime.

770
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:54,537
You made it all this way
despite all those terrible things.

771
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:56,673
Yes.

772
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:00,109
I probably wouldn't have made it
if I were on my own.

773
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,580
Who helped you?

774
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,686
There are many people. The first one is...

775
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:14,390
the person who turned me into an adult.

776
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:19,429
Even if no one else in this world does,
a lawyer should believe his client.

777
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:24,100
He believes people so much
that he seemed like a fool.

778
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:28,638
But I saw him change people
with that belief.

779
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:33,576
So I had no choice but to respect
and acknowledge him as an adult.

780
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:38,548
If you get life imprisonment,
the prosecution will appeal.

781
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:40,416
Then you'll go to a second trial.

782
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:44,187
And they will consolidate the case
for the murder of Jang Hye-seong's mother,

783
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,889
so it will be an even tougher fight.

784
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,725
What if I get the death penalty here?

785
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,794
Then we should appeal, too.

786
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,498
"We"?

787
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,601
Why? Don't you want to appeal?

788
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:00,270
No...

789
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:02,472
It's not that.

790
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:08,711
I haven't heard the word "we"
in a very long time.

791
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:17,053
There is someone who looked arrogant
because she was so sure of herself.

792
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:20,156
Your defense was impressive.

793
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:23,426
So don't beat yourself up.

794
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,095
You did pretty well.

795
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:29,632
For a public defender.

796
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:36,940
But that person admitted she was wrong
and apologized for it.

797
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:45,415
I saw so clearly how amazing it is
for someone to repent and apologize.

798
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:53,056
And there's someone
who showed me what not to do.

799
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,260
You should become a murderer, too,

800
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,796
and live at the bottom.

801
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:05,702
He was a foolish and pitiful man
who chose to live like an animal.

802
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,805
All crimes were retaliatory.

803
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:13,109
And he killed innocent people
to cover up his crimes.

804
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:17,780
He also staged them as accidents.
His crimes are extremely bad in nature.

805
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:22,385
But the defendant claims that the actions
of Woo Seong-sik and Park Ju-hyeok

806
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,654
resulted in the death of his wife.

807
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:29,225
And his mother and son died
because he couldn't support them.

808
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:33,529
These matters must be considered as well.

809
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:38,134
Also, he has admitted
to everything he has done,

810
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:41,270
and is repenting deeply,
so that should be considered, too.

811
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,373
Therefore, the defendant...

812
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:51,080
will get a sentence lighter
than the death penalty.

813
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,516
I hereby sentence him
to life imprisonment.

814
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:06,596
Once, I almost made the same decision
as he did.

815
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:11,000
-Almost made the same decision?
-Yes.

816
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:15,338
I was also blinded by revenge
and almost made the same decision.

817
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:20,710
If it weren't for her,
I would probably be living like an animal.

818
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:22,211
Her?

819
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:24,514
Yes.

820
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,817
-She is so materialistic.
-What about the truth?

821
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:31,120
She has no manners
and is not modest at all.

822
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,758
Doesn't the truth win in court?

823
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:39,328
Of course not. It's the other way around.

824
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:44,300
Truth doesn't win in court.
Whatever wins in court is the truth.

825
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:53,276
But she started to fight for the truth
and see the person.

826
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:59,916
And that became the light and way
for me when I was in the dark.

827
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:05,288
If it weren't for her,
I would never have made it so far.

828
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:16,165
Because of her, I learned
how precious it is to protect someone.

829
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:21,370
Because of her, I learned
how important it is to listen to people.

830
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:26,909
So I think I will be able
to become a really good police officer.

831
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:37,687
Shall we try to do the sentences
all together?

832
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:40,056
All together? It's so long.

833
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:43,459
This is so hard.

834
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,895
Let's begin.

835
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:50,533
I am going to listen

836
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,870
to everything you have to say.

837
01:02:55,505 --> 01:03:00,676
I will hear your story
from your point of view.

838
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:07,216
I am your public defender.

839
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,022
