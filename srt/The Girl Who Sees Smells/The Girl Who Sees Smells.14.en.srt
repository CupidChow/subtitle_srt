[Episode 14]

2
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:16,061
This is a sound of gunshot, isn't it?

3
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:16,955
Yes.

4
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:27,519
What do you think you're doing?

5
00:00:41,504 --> 00:00:43,514
Where is Lt. Yeom?

6
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:49,065
Seeing that you're looking for her,
she must be missing.

7
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:50,623
Tell me, you bastard.

8
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:52,927
Where is Lt. Yeom?

9
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:05,803
Detective Choi, get off of him!

10
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:08,309
What are you doing? Calm down.

11
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:13,718
That scumbag kidnapped Lt. Yeom.
We have to find her.

12
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:16,141
Lt. Yeom was kidnapped?

13
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:17,653
Is that true?

14
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:19,140
Yes.

15
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,673
Just what is going on?

16
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:23,547
How could Lt. Yeom be kidnapped?

17
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,861
Cho-rim, it's nice to see you.

18
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:51,317
Where is Lt. Yeom?

19
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:52,990
Hurry up and tell me.

20
00:01:54,754 --> 00:02:02,612
Cho-rim. You became quite
close to the police lately.

21
00:02:02,612 --> 00:02:05,727
I know you kidnapped Lt. Yeom
thinking that she was me.

22
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:07,533
So hurry up and tell me.

23
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:10,389
Where is Lt. Yeom!

24
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:23,177
I thought you and I were close,
but I guess we weren't.

25
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:25,821
That puts me in a bad mood.

26
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,969
You're never going to be forgiven.

27
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:18,976
Detective Choi! Detective Choi!

28
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:20,175
It's over here!

29
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:23,644
Detective Choi! Detective Choi!

30
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:31,297
Detective Choi!

31
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,876
What happened to Lt. Yeom?

32
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:57,848
Was she really kidnapped?

33
00:03:57,848 --> 00:04:00,780
I think we'll have to watch and
see to be sure.

34
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,950
Please secure the surveillance video
from the roads near the Chinese restaurant

35
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,280
and verify the movement of the vehicles.

36
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,621
Detective Ki, I'd like for you to find out
Kwon Jae-hee's whereabouts for today.

37
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:12,366
Detective Yeom and I haven't taken our
eyes off all this time. Kwon Jae-hee...

38
00:04:12,366 --> 00:04:13,859
He didn't leave the house!

39
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:17,578
Then where did Lt. Yeom go?

40
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,467
If Kwon Jae-hee did this...

41
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:23,962
Isn't he going to kill her after 6 days?

42
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,683
Are you disappointed that it's me?

43
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:48,950
I'm sure your original plan was to
bring the witness Oh Cho-rim...

44
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:53,741
You made a big mistake
that's unlike Kwon Jae-hee.

45
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:57,264
I think you would do just fine, too.

46
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:04,617
This is... Is this the secret space
behind the library?

47
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:08,812
As you saw from the monitor earlier,
no one can come in here.

48
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:12,215
Even if you scream, no one will hear you.

49
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:23,506
I'll let you know what you need to do now.

50
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,673
Barcode?

51
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:32,825
You'll write about your
whole life for me right here.

52
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:34,807
Write about when you were born,

53
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:40,520
what kind of parents you had,
happy events and sad events.

54
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,446
And what you've learned after
becoming a detective...

55
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:49,492
Write down everything about your life
without leaving anything out.

56
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:55,623
Did you make all the victims do this
and then carved a barcode on their wrists?

57
00:05:59,302 --> 00:06:02,768
I'm going to give you 6 days.

58
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:13,594
You were living off of other people's lives
you couldn't have and couldn't hope to have.

59
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:21,182
If you write, Please save me,
I'll kill you.

60
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:24,230
If you cause sympathy from me, I'll kill you.

61
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:30,470
If you refuse this, I'll kill you right now.

62
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:42,276
So you're saying that you received
a phone call from an alumni association

63
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,909
a few days ago looking for a person
named Choi Eun-seol, right?

64
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:47,647
Yes. He said he was Park Seung-jin...

65
00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:52,051
He even made a reservation of
the meeting place and paid for it.

66
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:55,513
Yes. I understand. Thank you.

67
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:59,190
Park Seung-jin.

68
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,386
Yes. It does say Park Seung-jin.

69
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:05,852
Was it this person by any chance?

70
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:07,962
No. He was very old.

71
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:09,923
Please look carefully.

72
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:12,026
I'm not sure.

73
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,170
Would it be okay for me to
see the surveillance video?

74
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,786
Thank you.

75
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,643
Here it is.

76
00:07:26,643 --> 00:07:30,056
I guess someone else paid the bill.

77
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:33,187
That's right. He paid with cash.

78
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:46,183
You want to place the
order directly with me?

79
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:51,344
Sir, tell me what you'd like to eat.

80
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:04,159
By the way, was it this person who took you
to the Chinese restaurant yesterday?

81
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:14,437
No.

82
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:16,102
It's not him?

83
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:18,437
He wasn't this young.

84
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:37,690
About Lt. Yeom... Do you think
she's really locked up in that house?

85
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,346
If not, just where do you think she is?

86
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:43,829
First, we just have to make sure
we don't lose Kwon Jae-hee.

87
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:47,156
It looks to be a long battle.

88
00:08:47,156 --> 00:08:49,458
I'll have to make some preparations.

89
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,971
I'm going to buy ventilated seat cushion.

90
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:57,040
I better buy some toe socks.

91
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:24,829
It's been two days since
Lt. Yeom has been kidnapped.

92
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:30,232
We had to endure through this painful
period without having gained anything.

93
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:36,511
[Day 3 of Lt. Yeom's disappearance]

94
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:49,753
Lt. Yeom, you can't write like this.

95
00:09:49,753 --> 00:09:51,464
Do you see this part?

96
00:09:51,464 --> 00:09:53,321
The part where you wrote that you

97
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:55,807
first decided to become a police officer
after much struggle...

98
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:58,137
I want to know more about this.

99
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:04,110
Please write in more detail about
how you came to have this kind of a dream.

100
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:08,342
Finish until I get back.

101
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:27,831
Write it more sincerely.

102
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,108
Can't you give me a watch?

103
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:42,248
If I know what time it is,
I think I can write more efficiently.

104
00:10:42,248 --> 00:10:50,583
No. I control everything.
You just have to do what I say.

105
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:08,341
Ventilated seat cushion.

106
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:14,544
Detective Yeh, you're pretty amazing.

107
00:11:14,544 --> 00:11:17,474
You even get a delivery on the street.

108
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,120
Now I can live.

109
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,176
Oh, it's cool.

110
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:23,750
Here it is.

111
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:28,787
This is nice. It's a wonderful world.

112
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:37,156
Yes. You're working hard.

113
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:39,026
I'm going to an autograph
session for my fans now.

114
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:43,981
I'll be back after four hours,
so don't suffer too much until then.

115
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:47,019
Please rest comfortably.

116
00:12:10,768 --> 00:12:11,761
What is your name?

117
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:14,100
Choi Eun-seol.

118
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:22,949
I was wondering who you were.

119
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:26,386
Did you come alone?

120
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:30,023
You didn't bring a book.

121
00:12:30,023 --> 00:12:32,220
I'll give you a book as a gift.

122
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:34,860
What should I write for you?

123
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:40,399
Please don't hurt Lt. Yeom.

124
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,866
Take me instead.

125
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:46,140
Do you like the message I wrote?

126
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:13,933
It's fine.

127
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:19,813
I know you have hidden room in your house.

128
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:24,176
I'm going to find you and
crush you completely.

129
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:57,753
I didn't think you were going to do it.

130
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,879
How could you come here
by yourself without any fear?

131
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,713
It's clear that Lt. Yeom is
at Kwon Jae-hee's house.

132
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,185
I know that, too.

133
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:08,385
I saw it.

134
00:14:08,385 --> 00:14:11,899
Lt. Yeom's scent was on
Kwon Jae-hee's hand.

135
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:16,162
I'm sure it's the custom perfume
I made for her.

136
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:17,399
She sent us a message.

137
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,630
She's telling us that she's fine
and to come find her.

138
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,701
It's his house.

139
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:25,272
Lt. Yeom is locked up
inside Kwon Jae-hee's house.

140
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:30,700
Where are you going?

141
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,214
The person whom Kwon Jae-hee wanted was me.

142
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:36,524
I just have to tell him to take me
and release Lt. Yeom.

143
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,022
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

144
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:39,505
Oh Cho-rim, come to your senses!

145
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:42,475
How can I be in my right mind?

146
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:45,025
Because of me...

147
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:47,936
Someone else is dying.

148
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:53,588
Is it okay as long as I'm safe? Is it?

149
00:14:53,588 --> 00:15:00,712
No. I don't want to be
a selfish person like that.

150
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:05,416
If Lt. Yeom dies,
I can't live. I can't live.

151
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,066
How could I live?

152
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:14,048
Then do you think I could live if you die?

153
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:19,759
How could I live without you?

154
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:24,997
Then what should I do?

155
00:15:26,303 --> 00:15:32,405
Even now, I'm frustrated to death because

156
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:38,477
I feel guilty for letting your sister die
because of me.

157
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:41,389
Then what am I supposed to do?

158
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:06,441
Please save Lt. Yeom.

159
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,330
Please.

160
00:16:09,362 --> 00:16:10,842
Yeah.

161
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,764
It's alright.

162
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:47,905
How can you drink that coffee
without any suspicion?

163
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:50,778
I could've put poison in it.

164
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:55,158
I haven't even finished writing
about my high school years...

165
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:59,164
You won't kill me because
you're curious about what comes next.

166
00:16:59,164 --> 00:17:02,184
You're quite good at reasoning.

167
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:05,162
I have a lot of people I want to
bring to this room all of a sudden.

168
00:17:05,162 --> 00:17:08,267
I want to bring your subordinate
Detective Choi here, too.

169
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:11,289
Why do you want to bring Detective Choi?

170
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:16,880
You don't have to have
a reason for everything.

171
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:23,525
Kwon Jae-hee is legitimizing
the murders he's committed.

172
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:26,523
He says there's no reason for them...

173
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:30,596
[Day 4 of Lt. Yeom's disappearance]

174
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:54,799
I'll keep it simple.

175
00:17:56,014 --> 00:17:59,199
You can go in detail if you want.

176
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:01,977
I'm not sure what you're
talking about though...

177
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:07,422
Please release Lt. Yeom-mi.

178
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:10,930
Please don't underestimate me
because I was

179
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,797
thankful to you when
I didn't know your true identity.

180
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:18,014
We know everything about each other now.

181
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:22,538
If you keep talking to me like that,
I'll be really hurt.

182
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:27,438
You and I really have
an ill-fated relationship.

183
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:31,695
Officer Choi's sister died because of me.

184
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:37,819
And again, Lt. Yeom
might die because of me.

185
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:40,633
That's really horrible.

186
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:44,101
You did both things.

187
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:52,305
I feel as though I'm going to die right now.

188
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:56,285
I feel so sorry to Lt. Yeom
that I want to die.

189
00:18:56,285 --> 00:19:00,812
If something bad happens to
Lt. Yeom because of me...

190
00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:04,591
That just can't happen.

191
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:06,735
I won't be able to live with myself.

192
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:17,697
Please take me instead of Lt. Yeom.

193
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:23,652
Please release Lt. Yeom.

194
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:26,487
There's not much time left.

195
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:29,917
If you just release her,
I'll come to you with my own two feet.

196
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:32,222
I'm being serious.

197
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:44,999
I just don't know what you're talking about.

198
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:47,093
If you're going to talk to me
about things like that, don't come.

199
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:48,697
Please go back.

200
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:06,215
I'm going to bring Oh Cho-rim over here.

201
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:10,182
Is it too small for two people to be in here?

202
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:21,099
Oh that's right. Lt. Yeom
will be dead after 52 hours.

203
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:23,341
Then it will be alright.

204
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:29,034
Oh Cho-rim won't come here.

205
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:33,468
You're going to get caught before then.

206
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:38,844
Do you know what Cho-rim told me
at my restaurant today?

207
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:41,855
You'll be shocked if you hear it.

208
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,123
She asked to switch places with you.

209
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:50,992
What?

210
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:56,362
She asked me to take her and release you.

211
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,680
I was really moved.

212
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:03,106
I guess that's what they call a friendship.

213
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,955
It's something that you'll never know.

214
00:21:15,247 --> 00:21:20,623
I have more things
I want to ask Choi-rim now.

215
00:21:32,284 --> 00:21:33,193
Are you coming back from your shift?

216
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:34,830
Good work.

217
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:39,372
Kwon Jae-hee is flatly denying it and
not responding to what I'm saying.

218
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:45,134
The person Kwon Jae-hee is targeting is you,
so why isn't he accepting your proposal?

219
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:47,100
Do you think it's because
he'd be admitting that he locked up

220
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,035
Lt. Yeom if he accepts
Cho-rim's proposal?

221
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:52,806
He's so shameless even though
he's locked up someone.

222
00:21:52,806 --> 00:21:54,587
He's even boldly continuing
his social activities.

223
00:21:54,587 --> 00:21:56,982
But he's really careful about
something like this.

224
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:01,511
We probably can't catch him right now
because he's that fierce.

225
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:06,404
But where is he keeping Lt. Yeom?

226
00:22:06,404 --> 00:22:08,810
Lt. Yeom is inside Kwon Jae-hee's
house for sure.

227
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,588
And there's certainly a separate entrance
that leads to the secret place somewhere.

228
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:17,918
There was a clear change in Kwon Jae-hee's
face when I told him to take me instead.

229
00:22:17,918 --> 00:22:20,543
I think he refused because
he's being careful right now.

230
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:24,662
He might accept my proposal if
I press him more aggressively.

231
00:22:24,662 --> 00:22:29,889
Kwon Jae-hee will try to come and
take Oh Cho-rim no matter what it takes.

232
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:35,564
But there is no other way than this, right?

233
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:47,735
The reason Kwon Jae-hee made

234
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:50,576
all the victims write about their lives is
so he can enjoy thinking

235
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:55,615
that he owns the lives of the
victims after they die.

236
00:22:55,615 --> 00:22:57,910
I own this person's life.

237
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:03,222
"I didn't kill this person,
but I completely own his life."

238
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:05,984
This is the way he thinks.

239
00:23:16,548 --> 00:23:20,867
Now you have about 48 hours to live.

240
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:25,546
Why do you think you're fixated
on someone's life story?

241
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:29,723
Please stop, Lt. Yeom.

242
00:23:29,723 --> 00:23:32,968
Do you think you can profile me?

243
00:23:39,523 --> 00:23:43,499
You didn't always not recognize people's
faces from the beginning.

244
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:45,899
You started having prosopagnosia

245
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:52,742
after you started getting abused
by people and started to fear people.

246
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:57,697
Score.

247
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:02,570
Your brain is rejecting people's faces.

248
00:24:04,282 --> 00:24:06,919
Scored again.

249
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,259
When you realized you had
an appetite for killing people,

250
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:18,208
you decided to see their into lives
instead of their faces.

251
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:22,134
Scored three times.

252
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:28,507
But you're quite delusional.

253
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:32,971
There wasn't a single time
you owned their lives.

254
00:24:33,703 --> 00:24:37,850
I can't agree with that statement.

255
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,519
You're no longer interesting.

256
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,897
I think I know everything.

257
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:47,868
You're too ordinary.

258
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,049
You must think that you know me so well.

259
00:24:55,049 --> 00:24:57,741
I'll give you a question.

260
00:24:57,741 --> 00:24:58,378
If you guess correctly,

261
00:24:58,378 --> 00:25:01,027
your life will be extended by
three more hours. If you guess incorrectly,

262
00:25:01,027 --> 00:25:03,479
your life will be shortened by three hours.

263
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:08,389
If you don't answer,
you'll just die in 48 hours.

264
00:25:08,795 --> 00:25:18,086
Do you think I want to kill
Oh Cho-rim or not?

265
00:25:23,362 --> 00:25:27,629
You don't want to kill her.

266
00:25:28,815 --> 00:25:35,311
No. I really want to kill her.

267
00:25:39,334 --> 00:25:42,117
That's too bad.

268
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:49,088
Your life was shortened by
3 hours in less than 10 minutes.

269
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:52,091
Now there is 45 hours left.

270
00:25:52,091 --> 00:25:57,397
I'm going to kill you the day
after tomorrow on Friday at 7 p.m.

271
00:25:58,498 --> 00:26:01,086
I've enjoyed our conversations.

272
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:23,472
[Day 5 of Lt. Yeom's disappearance]

273
00:26:23,952 --> 00:26:25,484
You were over here.

274
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:26,874
Oh you're here.

275
00:26:26,874 --> 00:26:28,622
Who's watching Kwon Jae-hee's house?

276
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:32,232
We were able to switch with two detectives
from the investigation department.

277
00:26:32,232 --> 00:26:33,520
Good work.

278
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,976
Since we're guarding the front entrance,

279
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:37,303
he should use the secret passage,
so we can catch him.

280
00:26:37,303 --> 00:26:42,101
It's really driving us crazy because
he's using the front entrance.

281
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,609
I'm sure he only uses the secret passage
when he does bad things.

282
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:47,137
Lt. Yeom's life is in danger right now.

283
00:26:47,137 --> 00:26:48,708
What should we do?

284
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:51,292
We have to find the secret passage quickly.

285
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,695
Lt. Yeom.

286
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:12,972
You must read the mail I'm sending you now.

287
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:15,941
I didn't get a chance to you call you sister.

288
00:27:15,941 --> 00:27:18,442
I'm going to start calling you that now.

289
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,937
Sis, let's go eat tripe together.

290
00:27:21,937 --> 00:27:23,740
You have to stay strong.

291
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,701
We'll meet again for sure.

292
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,819
I accept your exchanging
places with Lt. Yeom.

293
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:41,432
Wait at Nambu Station
tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.

294
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:47,128
I accept your exchanging
places with Lt. Yeom.

295
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:51,682
Wait at Nambu Station
tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.

296
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:53,242
It's not Kwon Jae-hee's number,

297
00:27:53,242 --> 00:27:54,716
but the content is definitely
from Kwon Jae-hee.

298
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,288
The object of this operation is to

299
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,206
have Kwon Jae-hee come out
through the secret passage.

300
00:27:58,206 --> 00:27:59,539
He's coming out to kidnap Oh Cho-rim.

301
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:01,879
So he'll come out through the
secret passage for sure.

302
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:05,124
Please put a scent that
I can see on Kwon Jae-hee.

303
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:10,975
Put a scent on him so that Cho-rim can pursue
that scent and find the secret passage.

304
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:14,126
At the rendezvous point, the moment
we figure out Kwon Jae-hee's location,

305
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,968
we'll give Oh Cho-rim the signal to leave.

306
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:18,832
Once Oh Cho-rim leaves,
Kwon Jae-hee will give up on the

307
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:20,601
kidnapping and go back through
the secret passage.

308
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:23,702
At that point, once Cho-rim follows
Kwon Jae-hee's scent and finds

309
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,517
the secret passage, the operation will end.

310
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:30,060
Currently, Lt. Yeom has
about 23 hours to live.

311
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,450
This will be the last chance we have.

312
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,487
We must succeed.

313
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:35,073
Cho-rim. It will be dangerous.

314
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:37,402
Will you be alright?

315
00:28:37,402 --> 00:28:41,721
Yes. Even if it's even more dangerous,
I will do it.

316
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:54,844
You lost 3 hours yesterday,
so now you have 20 hours left.

317
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:59,912
If you let me ask you 3 questions,
I'll give you 3 more hours.

318
00:29:02,222 --> 00:29:05,528
Do you not cherish your life?

319
00:29:07,573 --> 00:29:09,985
Fine. Go ahead.

320
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:15,234
Why did you kill Dr. Chun Baek-gyung?

321
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:20,407
I killed him because he found
out that I killed people.

322
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,140
Where is Joo Ma-ri's diary?

323
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,377
It's upstairs in the living room.

324
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:27,503
No one could find it.

325
00:29:27,503 --> 00:29:30,617
I had Dr. Chun hold it for me.

326
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:39,413
Dr. Chun died because of that.

327
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:41,602
Ask me the last question.

328
00:29:41,602 --> 00:29:45,825
Why do you carve a barcode
on the victim's arm?

329
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:51,006
Once the person writes
an autobiography for me,

330
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:54,422
that person is just an empty shell.

331
00:29:54,422 --> 00:29:57,427
He's nothing more than
a book cover at that point.

332
00:29:57,427 --> 00:29:59,831
It's because you can't
recognize their faces, isn't it?

333
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,863
You already asked all 3 questions.

334
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,949
Your life was shortened by 3 hours
in less than 10 minutes.

335
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:13,348
Now there's only 17 hours.

336
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:18,777
I'm going to kill you tomorrow at 4 p.m.

337
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,951
[Day 6 of Lt. Yeom's disappearance]

338
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:49,340
It's because I'm a morning sleeper.

339
00:30:50,955 --> 00:30:55,414
Yes. Kwon Jae-hee hasn't
come out his front door yet.

340
00:30:55,414 --> 00:30:57,630
[6 hours before Lt. Yeom's scheduled murder]

341
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:08,057
[Verify that the key
is on top of the locker.]

342
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,517
Hello.

343
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:38,962
Put your phone inside the locker.

344
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:43,565
I put it in.

345
00:31:43,565 --> 00:31:48,080
Do you have in-ear monitor perhaps?

346
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,821
I don't have anything like that.

347
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:56,682
If the police are following you,
this exchange will stop immediately.

348
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,522
Yes. I'm alone.

349
00:31:58,522 --> 00:32:03,963
Lt. Yeom will die in 6 hours at 4 p.m.

350
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,731
Why?

351
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:08,532
She made a bet, so it shortened her life.

352
00:32:08,532 --> 00:32:10,469
I told you I'm coming.

353
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:12,504
Please let Lt. Yeom live.

354
00:32:12,504 --> 00:32:15,984
If you want to save her,
don't do anything foolish.

355
00:32:16,263 --> 00:32:18,277
Then what do I need to do next?

356
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:21,605
I'm going to see if anyone is following you.

357
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:27,980
Run to the sports complex in
30 minutes and wait for my call.

358
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:01,751
Kwon Jae-hee must be hiding somewhere
and giving her orders. We don't see him.

359
00:33:01,751 --> 00:33:04,682
The fact that he's giving her orders
must mean that he left his house.

360
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:10,557
Yes. For now, please head over to
the sports complex first.

361
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:12,037
There is only one chance.

362
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:15,418
Please don't get discovered.

363
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:20,572
He said he's going to kill
Lt. Yeom at 4 p.m. today.

364
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:12,491
Why isn't he calling me?

365
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:14,427
I'm so dizzy.

366
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,269
How's it going?

367
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:30,465
The next call hasn't come.

368
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,487
She looks tired from running so fast.

369
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:41,387
If we just find Kwon Jae-hee,
Cho-rim can leave.

370
00:34:41,387 --> 00:34:43,191
We just don't see him.

371
00:35:18,905 --> 00:35:22,731
You'll need to go to one more place.

372
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:24,879
Go to Happiness Park.

373
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:27,633
I'll give you 20 minutes.

374
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,945
It's Happiness Park.

375
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:38,911
Happiness Park.

376
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:40,375
Let's go.

377
00:36:08,807 --> 00:36:10,685
You worked hard.

378
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:15,558
There is a container below the bench.

379
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,758
I found it.

380
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,785
Open that container.

381
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:23,150
Put the handkerchief on
your nose and breathe.

382
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,263
Once you sleep for a little while,
I'll come by and pick you up.

383
00:36:26,263 --> 00:36:29,629
If you don't, then I won't come.

384
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:48,227
This is the smell that I
saw on Dr. Chun.

385
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:54,978
If you don't breathe it in now,
I'll consider this exchange to be void.

386
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:06,465
I don't know where Kwon Jae-hee is yet.

387
00:37:09,864 --> 00:37:12,536
Are you going to stop?

388
00:37:12,536 --> 00:37:15,762
No.

389
00:37:44,003 --> 00:37:47,626
He's not going to kill her, is he?

390
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:49,192
I can't watch.

391
00:38:07,093 --> 00:38:08,970
Kwon Jae-hee appeared.

392
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,179
It's now. Move.

393
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:24,963
Cho-rim.

394
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:10,766
Miss, wake up.

395
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:13,858
I saw this girl fainting
as I was running earlier.

396
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:18,170
That's why I ran back here.

397
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:18,857
What are you doing?

398
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,618
Hurry up and call 9-1-1.

399
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:32,649
Yes. Hello.

400
00:39:32,649 --> 00:39:36,647
Someone help us!

401
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:41,554
Please help us.

402
00:39:41,874 --> 00:39:43,956
Miss.

403
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:43,012
You're curious about what happened
to Choi Eun-seol, right?

404
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:45,545
You made a good friend.

405
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:51,611
To exchange herself for you,

406
00:41:51,611 --> 00:41:55,721
she breathed in the
anesthetic gas on her own.

407
00:42:02,764 --> 00:42:06,951
I made a mistake. I picked the wrong place.

408
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:10,054
I should've picked a more deserted place.

409
00:42:16,484 --> 00:42:20,291
It's 1:30 p.m. now.

410
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:22,948
There's only two and a half hours left.

411
00:42:41,443 --> 00:42:45,996
Cho-rim, are you alright?

412
00:42:59,137 --> 00:43:01,398
Cho-rim, are you alright?

413
00:43:01,398 --> 00:43:02,788
You were quite shocked, weren't you?

414
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,362
I'm fine.

415
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,310
GPS has stopped about 4,500 meters away
from Kwon Jae-hee's house.

416
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,860
How long will it take from here?

417
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,937
About 20 minutes by car.

418
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,331
This is the deodorant that
we spilled in Kwon Jae-hee's car.

419
00:43:22,331 --> 00:43:24,250
Take a look at the scent.

420
00:43:29,521 --> 00:43:33,979
We can't see it with our eyes or smell it.

421
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,832
[2 hours before Lt. Yeom's scheduled murder]

422
00:43:56,473 --> 00:43:59,632
I see it.

423
00:43:59,632 --> 00:44:02,362
Here. Like this...

424
00:44:02,362 --> 00:44:04,984
I spilled the deodorant everywhere.

425
00:44:04,984 --> 00:44:06,984
You can see it well, right?

426
00:44:14,828 --> 00:44:17,153
I can't believe even when I see it.

427
00:44:17,153 --> 00:44:19,730
Will we be solving the
barcode-murder case today...

428
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:24,446
That's the highlight of our investigation...

429
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:45,666
What's going on all of a sudden?

430
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:48,722
What's wrong? Is it because of the rain?

431
00:44:48,722 --> 00:44:50,571
- I'll bring an umbrella.
- Okay.

432
00:44:50,571 --> 00:44:53,657
She can't see scents when it rains.

433
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:54,508
What?

434
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:57,734
Why not? Does the scent
get washed away by the rain?

435
00:44:57,734 --> 00:45:03,593
When it rains, it's hard to
see the scent particles.

436
00:45:03,593 --> 00:45:06,679
I'll try it as long as I can.

437
00:45:29,132 --> 00:45:33,706
I have save Lt. Yeom.

438
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:43,274
This is not it.

439
00:45:43,863 --> 00:45:45,882
This it not it.

440
00:45:48,054 --> 00:45:48,876
Get up. Let's get up.

441
00:45:48,876 --> 00:45:52,407
No!

442
00:45:52,407 --> 00:45:57,539
Know Jae-hee said he'll kill
Lt. Yeom at 4 p.m.

443
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:16,349
To be honest, you wrote the most
half-heartedly of the people

444
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:21,043
who wrote their autobiographies until now.

445
00:46:21,043 --> 00:46:22,655
You wrote the least amount also.

446
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,095
I'm not a novelist.

447
00:46:25,764 --> 00:46:29,528
I had a hard time making up stories.

448
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:35,132
There's about 2 hours left of your life.

449
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:40,731
If you write it sincerely,
I can extend your time.

450
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:41,960
It was difficult writing the stories

451
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:48,114
I heard from other people and
movies I've seen as my own.

452
00:46:57,803 --> 00:47:03,468
Are you saying you wrote lies in here?

453
00:47:03,468 --> 00:47:09,686
Of course. Why would I write my secrets
and expose my embarrassing stories?

454
00:47:09,686 --> 00:47:16,114
All the other people wrote the truth
at the end of their lives and died.

455
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:19,899
Truth?

456
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:23,512
What a farce.

457
00:47:23,512 --> 00:47:30,037
Exorcist Park Mi-ja whose body
was discovered on March 27th, 2014.

458
00:47:30,037 --> 00:47:34,188
Did she write that she abandoned her child
because she had met another man?

459
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:38,919
She wrote that she got divorced because
of her practice of exorcism, right?

460
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,405
We, the police, can tell by just
looking at the police report.

461
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:48,006
But how come you don't even know that
when you go so far as to kill them?

462
00:47:48,006 --> 00:47:51,639
Don't lie.

463
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:56,048
People are honest before death.

464
00:47:56,048 --> 00:48:00,518
You are so pitiful.

465
00:48:02,844 --> 00:48:06,790
Don't feel sorry for me.

466
00:48:07,569 --> 00:48:09,932
I own their lives.

467
00:48:11,415 --> 00:48:15,621
I owned their whole lives,
then I killed them.

468
00:48:15,905 --> 00:48:18,070
I ended it for them.

469
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,531
I'm going to end it for you, too.

470
00:48:22,475 --> 00:48:30,850
I read and felt their lives that no one
else knows and I owned their lives!

471
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:38,229
You realized just now that
you've completely lost this game.

472
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,983
I'm really curious if you're going to
be able to say that again 2 hours later.

473
00:48:43,983 --> 00:48:49,257
I'm going to kill you after 2 hours.

474
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,966
[Yeom Mi]

475
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:19,065
Is that my autobiography?

476
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:28,440
And you're going to carve the
barcode on my after I die?

477
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:33,183
You know it well since you're a detective.

478
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,649
It's nice since I don't have to explain.

479
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:49,196
That's the most childish thing
I've ever seen in this world.

480
00:49:49,196 --> 00:49:51,417
You don't know that do you?

481
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:55,234
How immature and pathetic that is?

482
00:49:55,234 --> 00:49:59,007
It's no use provoking me.

483
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:02,379
I'm not going to lose my composure

484
00:50:02,379 --> 00:50:07,939
and I'm going to kill you
when I said I would.

485
00:50:07,939 --> 00:50:10,825
I'm not saying that because
I'm afraid of dying.

486
00:50:10,825 --> 00:50:14,970
There must be a human instinct to
speak one's mind to others.

487
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,389
I'm saying this because
I really wanted to tell you.

488
00:50:19,532 --> 00:50:23,632
You're so low-level.

489
00:50:35,337 --> 00:50:39,469
There's a little more than an hour left.

490
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,721
It will be over soon.

491
00:50:50,952 --> 00:50:53,608
The rain isn't stopping.

492
00:50:53,608 --> 00:50:56,348
Let's not do this here.

493
00:50:56,348 --> 00:51:01,843
Let's go somewhere out
of the rain and think about this.

494
00:51:01,843 --> 00:51:07,382
Let's calm down and talk about
what we have to do.

495
00:51:08,176 --> 00:51:09,579
Let's go.

496
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,921
Here's the tea.

497
00:51:17,921 --> 00:51:18,784
Thank you.

498
00:51:22,107 --> 00:51:23,447
Detective Choi.

499
00:51:23,897 --> 00:51:26,319
Ji-min, go inside the room and play, okay?

500
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,786
I'm going to show you something, Grandma.

501
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,730
Okay.

502
00:51:41,007 --> 00:51:43,141
[1 hour before Lt. Yeom's scheduled murder]

503
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:50,116
How about if we just have the SWAT team
destroy Kwon Jae-hee's house completely?

504
00:51:50,116 --> 00:51:53,052
Inspector Kang requested for support from the
fire department, but he was denied.

505
00:51:53,052 --> 00:51:55,081
They said there wasn't evidence.

506
00:51:55,081 --> 00:51:58,777
Who would believe that she can see scents?

507
00:51:58,777 --> 00:52:01,248
This is crazy.

508
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,521
Grandma, what picture is this?

509
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,343
You didn't draw anything.

510
00:52:06,343 --> 00:52:07,772
I can't see it.

511
00:52:07,772 --> 00:52:10,438
There is a picture, Grandma.

512
00:52:10,438 --> 00:52:14,300
Ji-min, there's no picture there.

513
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,910
Grandma, watch carefully.

514
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:32,503
Oh my! There was a white
star hidden in the paper.

515
00:52:32,503 --> 00:52:37,536
It's a white star in the black sky, Grandma.

516
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,226
I see.

517
00:52:39,226 --> 00:52:42,779
Shouldn't we try it like Ji-min's drawing?

518
00:52:42,779 --> 00:52:49,330
Oh Cho-rim can't see the deodorant scent
because the rain made it fade, right?

519
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:55,598
Just like the white stars on white paper,
she can't see it well.

520
00:52:55,942 --> 00:53:00,489
Just like how Ji-min painted the
black paint to show the white stars,

521
00:53:00,489 --> 00:53:04,512
we need to paint with black paint,
so that she can see the scent better.

522
00:53:07,335 --> 00:53:09,195
Black paint.

523
00:53:29,284 --> 00:53:34,253
You're the first person to
stare at me until the end.

524
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:39,825
I think I'm going to leave this world soon.

525
00:53:40,365 --> 00:53:46,100
I sometimes imagined how
I would leave this world.

526
00:53:46,732 --> 00:53:54,932
I should die after I've forgotten everything
and forgiven everyone. That's how I thought.

527
00:53:57,546 --> 00:53:59,471
Doesn't everyone think that way?

528
00:53:59,471 --> 00:54:03,607
I don't think that way anymore.

529
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:08,177
I can't seem to forgive you.

530
00:54:08,177 --> 00:54:14,014
Not because of what you did to me,
but what you did to human beings.

531
00:54:16,026 --> 00:54:18,836
Now there's only 30 minutes left.

532
00:54:18,836 --> 00:54:25,237
You're never going to be forgiven.

533
00:54:31,576 --> 00:54:34,154
Spread it a lot here.

534
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,713
Can you see it?

535
00:54:49,664 --> 00:54:51,934
Yes. I see it.

536
00:54:51,934 --> 00:54:54,854
I can see it slowly!

537
00:54:54,854 --> 00:54:57,535
Over here!

538
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,771
Here it is.

539
00:54:59,771 --> 00:55:01,537
Over here.

540
00:55:01,537 --> 00:55:03,109
Slowly.

541
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:04,913
Over to that direction.

542
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:24,988
It's here.

543
00:55:40,032 --> 00:55:42,608
It was here.

544
00:55:42,608 --> 00:55:44,965
We found it.

545
00:55:45,418 --> 00:55:46,842
We need to save Lt. Yeom.

546
00:55:46,842 --> 00:55:48,622
I'll contact headquarters.

547
00:55:48,622 --> 00:55:52,878
Detective Ki, please block
Kwon Jae-hee's front entrance.

548
00:55:52,878 --> 00:55:57,202
Cho-rim, until the police come,
go hide yourself nearby.

549
00:55:57,202 --> 00:55:58,772
There's not much time,
so I'm going to go inside.

550
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:01,126
Please be careful, Detective Choi.

551
00:56:02,056 --> 00:56:03,636
Detective Ki.

552
00:56:03,636 --> 00:56:05,745
I'll cut off his exit.

553
00:56:16,216 --> 00:56:19,920
I don't like to put my hands
on people's bodies.

554
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,358
That room will soon be filled
with anesthetic gas.

555
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:28,576
It's the gas that the hospital
uses for general anesthesia.

556
00:56:28,576 --> 00:56:32,898
Once you inhale it,
you can't breathe on your own.

557
00:56:32,898 --> 00:56:39,835
That's why they put respirators
on patients at the hospital.

558
00:56:39,835 --> 00:56:42,869
Once you inhale that gas and fall asleep,

559
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:48,772
you'll die without pain because
you won't be able to breathe on your own.

560
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:56,993
After that, I will carve a
barcode on that wrist.

561
00:56:58,027 --> 00:57:00,323
Then it will be over.

562
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:06,767
Ah. It's time.
