00:00:04,707 --> 00:00:10,535
Dear Miss Choi Eun-seol, no,
currently Miss Oh Cho-rim,

2
00:00:10,535 --> 00:00:16,393
you had no chance of survival
when you first came to the hospital.

3
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:24,510
Please forgive this foolish doctor
who can only apologize to you this way.

4
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:27,032
Sincerely, Chun Baek-gyung...

5
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:47,617
What are you doing, Cho-rim?

6
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,740
Did something happen?

7
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,224
What's that paper?

8
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,870
I'm so sorry.

9
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,626
I was reading the script
because I'm quite nervous.

10
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:03,702
Oh, I'm sorry for the books...

11
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:09,962
I made a mistake while being
concerned about the taping.

12
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:12,738
I know the taping can be
quite nerve-wracking.

13
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:14,479
The production crew is waiting for us.

14
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,248
Let's hurry up and go.

15
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:17,115
Sure, go ahead.

16
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:19,940
I'll get a cookbook and come up.

17
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,545
Mr. Chef!

18
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:24,047
We're starting soon.

19
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:24,456
Okay.

20
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:26,844
Let's go.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,121
Camera, stand by!

22
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:38,806
Stand by... Cue!

23
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:39,751
Hello, everyone.

24
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,341
I'm Kwon Jae-hee of "Golden Recipe."

25
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:47,857
I invite you today to my home
kitchen instead of the studio.

26
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:50,549
Lieutenant!

27
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:51,984
I need to talk to you.

28
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:53,984
What's your real reason?

29
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:56,522
Lieutenant!

30
00:01:56,522 --> 00:02:00,559
Lieutenant!

31
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:03,062
Lieutenant!

32
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:05,927
I need to talk to you.

33
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:12,651
Choi Moo-gak, calm down!

34
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:16,773
I need to hear her story first to
figure out what's going on!

35
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:20,917
Please open the door.

36
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:24,191
Let me know the real reason
so I'll be able to quit!

37
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:27,383
Calm down, Choi Moo-gak!

38
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:28,670
I can't calm down.

39
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,948
I'm not going anywhere until
I can understand why!

40
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:33,616
Please open the door!

41
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:35,430
Detective Ki, Detective Yeh...

42
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:43,177
Lieutenant...

43
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:44,136
Take him away!

44
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:46,857
What's the real reason?

45
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:54,374
Detective Ki...

46
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,756
Choi Moo-gak!

47
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:57,122
Go home for now.

48
00:02:57,122 --> 00:02:59,471
We'll find out what the reason is.

49
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,911
We'll try to make Lt. Yeom retract
her order on your behalf.

50
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:04,823
So go home for now.

51
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:19,573
So, what is the reason?

52
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:24,157
Choi Moo-gak has been the bravest
and most diligent member of this team.

53
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:27,120
What's the reason for his dismissal?

54
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:36,325
Detective Choi is a family member of one of
the victims of the barcode-chain-murder case.

55
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:37,851
The victim of the barcode murders?

56
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,359
What do you mean?

57
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:45,864
The murderer killed Detective Choi's
sister thinking she was the witness...

58
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:48,556
She was the only living
family member for Detective Choi.

59
00:03:48,556 --> 00:03:50,836
So his affection for her was exceptional.

60
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:57,864
That's why Detective Choi wants
to kill the murderer.

61
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:04,778
Personal grudges have no place
in police investigations.

62
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,686
B-but how is this possible?

63
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:11,058
So... is that really true?

64
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:13,863
I've dismissed him for an appropriate reason.

65
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:16,202
So don't bring up this matter again.

66
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,383
Let's begin our meeting.

67
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:26,071
Dear Miss Choi Eun-seol...

68
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:29,906
no, currently Miss Oh Cho-rim.

69
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:36,008
Soo-mi! I'm Goh Soo-mi, Eun-seol!

70
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:45,724
[Officer Choi]

71
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:51,496
Hello, Officer Choi.

72
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:52,731
I have something to ask you.

73
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm on my way to the
police station right now...

74
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,723
May I...

75
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:00,408
Why are you home at this hour?

76
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,921
What happened?

77
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:06,039
Shouldn't you be working right now?

78
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,007
Take a seat.

79
00:05:11,383 --> 00:05:13,419
Why are you drinking in the
middle of the day?

80
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:15,975
You're exhausted.

81
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:18,655
You don't look very well.

82
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:20,827
What is wrong?

83
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:22,954
I've been kicked out of
the investigation team.

84
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:24,720
They don't want me anymore.

85
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,207
Why? Who told you that?

86
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:29,472
Why don't they want you anymore?

87
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:31,804
Lt. Yeom did.

88
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,209
She wouldn't tell me the real reason.

89
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:40,548
I've gone through a lot just to
join the investigation team...

90
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,782
But now that I've been kicked out...

91
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:46,785
I'm going crazy.

92
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:59,997
My sister's death is technically
not a barcode murder.

93
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:05,808
At the beginning, Lt. Yeom told me that
she didn't see any problem with that.

94
00:06:05,808 --> 00:06:12,335
But now she wants me to leave all of
a sudden for no other reason.

95
00:06:12,335 --> 00:06:17,549
Is there any other way
that you can join the team again?

96
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:20,579
The other detectives are talking to
Lt. Yeom right now.

97
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:27,930
Don't worry too much then.
Let's wait for now.

98
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:31,464
What is it that you wanted to ask me?

99
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,752
I'll ask you later.

100
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,430
It can wait.

101
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,257
Are you sure?

102
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:40,883
I'm fine.

103
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:44,918
Don't you feel stuffy?

104
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:47,332
Should we go to Han River?

105
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:50,821
I have to go somewhere.

106
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:52,060
Where?

107
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,326
I need to go see my dad.

108
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,738
[Seoul to Wonju]

109
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:18,391
Dad...

110
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:26,956
Am I Choi Eun-seol, not Oh Cho-rim?

111
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:32,506
Cho-rim...

112
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:33,481
Dad...

113
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:44,236
Can you just tell me that first
if I'm really Choi Eun-seol?

114
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:51,215
I always knew this day would come.

115
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:53,755
I guess it's today.

116
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:57,644
Cho-rim... you're right.

117
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:04,523
Your real name is... Choi Eun-seol.

118
00:08:05,858 --> 00:08:09,999
Then why did you do this?

119
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:13,389
How am I Choi Eun-seol?

120
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:18,967
When the car accident
happened three years ago,

121
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:22,603
I was the detective in charge of that case.

122
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:29,085
You were just lying on a hospital bed,
in a coma...

123
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:32,718
and no one came to take care of you.

124
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:35,696
Looking at you reminded me a lot of

125
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:44,384
my own daughter who would've
been your age if she were alive.

126
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:47,333
She went missing when she was five...

127
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:55,207
and her corpse was found a month later.

128
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:05,374
I wanted to take care of you
like my own daughter.

129
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:07,517
So I adopted you.

130
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,100
Then, what happened to my biological parents?

131
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,886
I don't know anything about them.

132
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:32,384
Cho-rim...

133
00:09:32,384 --> 00:09:36,869
It must've been very tough for you, Dad.

134
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:40,125
Raising a daughter who can't even remember...

135
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:47,512
It must've been very frustrating for you,
not being able to tell me all this.

136
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:50,016
Cho-rim, you're the one who's frustrated...

137
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:56,999
It must be still very frustrating for you...

138
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:07,546
No matter what happened in the past,
you're still my dad.

139
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:19,391
Okay...

140
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:24,276
No matter what happens,
you're still my daughter.

141
00:10:32,237 --> 00:10:33,464
Dad...

142
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:38,024
I promise you one thing.

143
00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:46,151
Even if I find my biological parents,
you're still my dad.

144
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:48,811
So I want you to promise me the same thing.

145
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:54,559
Of course.

146
00:11:18,517 --> 00:11:24,790
Cheers.

147
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,838
Moo-gak...

148
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,138
We heard about your sister.

149
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:47,387
Is that why you tried so hard to
join the homicide department?

150
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:52,291
So you can catch the murderer of your sister?

151
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,372
Yes, sir.

152
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,664
But Lt. Yeom is strictly going by the manual.

153
00:11:57,664 --> 00:12:01,724
We can't really argue against that.

154
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:03,698
According to the rules, detectives

155
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:07,594
who are personally related to the case must
be removed from the investigation.

156
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:12,402
We'll do everything we can
to catch the murderer.

157
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:21,542
I'll catch him myself.

158
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,758
How will you be able to
catch the culprit alone?

159
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:27,016
You're kicked off the team...

160
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:32,257
It's possible if you help me.

What is it?

164
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:57,547
We were concerned that
you haven't had dinner yet.

165

So we wanted to ask you to
get dinner with us.

166
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:02,288
Let's go, Lieutenant.

167
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:05,424
I'm fine. You guys can go ahead.

168
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:08,513
Lieutenant.

169
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:10,151
You still have to eat...

170
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:11,602
That'll make us feel better...

171
00:13:11,602 --> 00:13:14,481
Inspector Kang is waiting for you!

172
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:16,948
He says there's something he must tell you!

173
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,940
Inspector Kang wants to see me?

174
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:26,176
Let's hurry up and go.

175
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:29,149
Inspector Kang is waiting for you!

176
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:42,941
Please eat.

177
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:50,063
I was told that you have
something to tell me.

178
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:54,766
We're eating chicken right now.

179
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,485
Do I need to tell you something?

180
00:13:57,485 --> 00:13:59,114
Right!

181
00:13:59,114 --> 00:14:03,435
Fried or seasoned?

182
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:05,447
I'm not hungry.

183
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,253
Eat up, everyone.

184
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:09,145
Lieutenant! Wait!

185
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:12,540
Say something!

186
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,696
Inspector Kang is about to open his mouth!

187
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:18,517
So...

188
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:22,353
Well...

189
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:32,640
If I want to become a profiler like you...

190
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,834
Am I too old for that?

191
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:40,152
You want to be a profiler?

192
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:41,947
Yes!

[Oh Jae-pyo]

196
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:23,693
You came together.

197
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,441
Are you saying that...

198
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:35,040
Oh Cho-rim is the daughter
of the diver couple...

199
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,330
And the witness?

200
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,806
Hello, Cho-rim. This is Lt. Yeom.

201
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:08,686
Where are you right now?

202
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:13,612
Then may I go to your place?

203
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:18,108
Thank you for the cake.

204
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:19,680
Enjoy.

205
00:16:23,622 --> 00:16:26,592
This is so delicious! Try some.

206
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:36,288
Cho-rim, have you ever thought about
recovering your lost memories?

207
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:39,171
My lost memories?

208
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:42,261
It seems like you've recently
started remembering your past.

209
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:45,909
Would you like to remember more?
I can help you.

210
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:48,373
There are specialized programs, too.

211
00:16:56,011 --> 00:17:03,362
If my memory returns, I'll find my past
that's different from who I am right now...

212
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:08,556
I'm not quite sure if that'll make me happy.

213
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:12,136
Don't you think it's okay as long as
I'm happy right now?

214
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:16,858
I guess so.

215
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:21,523
Especially if my past was an unpleasant one.

216
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:23,412
You're right.

217
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:32,858
Perhaps your mind is actively blocking
your memories because they're unpleasant.

218
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:38,292
If that's the case, you shouldn't try
to remember the past by force.

219
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:44,737
Yes. For now, I don't want to
remember my past.

220
00:17:44,737 --> 00:17:47,902
I was being rash without thinking
too much about your opinion.

221
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:49,496
I'm sorry.

222
00:17:49,496 --> 00:17:50,809
Not at all.

223
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:53,544
I know that you're concerned for me.

224
00:17:53,544 --> 00:17:55,060
I must thank you for that.

225
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,116
No, I was being inconsiderate.

226
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,017
Lt. Yeom...

227
00:18:06,992 --> 00:18:10,587
About the sister of Detective Choi Moo-gak...

228
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:13,819
Cho-rim, I prefer not to talk about her.

229
00:18:13,819 --> 00:18:15,838
There are internal rules of the police force.

230
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:20,205
And it's been decided that Officer Choi is
going back to his previous position.

231
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,368
You should rest. I'll get going.

232
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,246
Yes.

233
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:50,044
The witness who has the same name
as my sister is Oh Cho-rim?

234
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,714
Did you kick me off the team

235
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,979
because Oh Cho-rim is the witness
in the chain murder case?

236
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:52,151
Because my sister died instead of Oh Cho-rim?

237
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:55,698
Now that you've found the reason on your own,
our conversation is over.

238
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:59,611
Because I love Oh Cho-rim,
because you thought I'd lose my mind

239
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:05,744
over the fact that my sister was killed
because of the person I love...

240
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:09,910
Is that why you hid that fact from me and
kicked me off of the team?

241
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,450
So should I thank you instead?

242
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,720
I'm afraid this conversation is over.

243
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,748
I am not rescinding my decision.

244
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,052
Lieutenant!

245
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,560
Please let me join the team again.

246
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,029
I will never be affected by
my personal feelings.

247
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:28,740
What you're doing right now is
the prime example of that!

248
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,742
You'll make a mistake that will
cost us the investigation.

249
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,109
Oh Cho-rim is just a witness.

250
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:38,887
There are no feelings.

251
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:40,773
Get out of my way.

252
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:04,170
I must find out what you know, Oh Jae-pyo...

253
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:45,678
I was wondering who was in that car. I wasn't
expecting to see you here, Chef Kwon.

254
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:47,648
I know.

255
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,549
I'm surprised to see you here,
Detective Choi.

256
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:56,347
This countryside doesn't have anything
to do with your restaurant.

257
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:58,795
What brings you here?

258
00:21:58,795 --> 00:21:59,749
No...

259
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:05,326
I guess it'd be more appropriate to
ask you what you're looking for.

260
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:23,609
If you ask me like that, do I have to answer
that we're looking for the same thing?

261
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:27,028
Looking for the same thing...

262
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:32,850
So we must know the same thing right now.

263
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,985
I guess that's why we're at the
same place right now.

264
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:36,653
Both of us.

265
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:39,065
I wonder what we're looking for.

266
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:42,351
I don't think it's to find some
good restaurants.

267
00:22:44,837 --> 00:22:46,867
Well, I'm a chef.

268
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,849
So I was talking about finding
good hidden restaurants.

269
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:53,678
I'm a detective. So I was talking
about finding a witness.

270
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:17,640
So I guess we've been talking about
different things so far.

271
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,713
I guess so, too.

272
00:23:19,713 --> 00:23:22,298
I guess the reason we talked
about different things is...

273
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:25,277
because we're on different paths.

274
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:28,851
I wonder what you mean by "different paths."

275
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:35,014
One of those two paths will lead to death.

276
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:39,914
Yes, how interesting!

277
00:23:39,914 --> 00:23:42,649
It's very interesting for me, too.

278
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:43,766
I'm afraid I must go now.

279
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:47,302
Someone's waiting for me.

280
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,098
It sounds as though you're in a hurry.

281
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:53,138
I'll back out so you can pass.

282

Now I know how you found out
about this place.

may I borrow your mobile phone?

to treat me out to a delicious lunch!

Isn't this a trick that's usually
reserved for couples?

328
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:41,853
We're on different paths.

329
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:46,872
And this will be over only
when one of us dies.

330
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:48,932
Let's make it quick.

331
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:55,685
Spy app?

332
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:58,248
Yes, sir.

333
00:27:58,248 --> 00:27:59,875
Reset your phone right now!

334
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:00,653
Yes, sir.

335
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:03,800
[Device Reset]

336
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,046
Who was it?

337
00:28:05,046 --> 00:28:06,049
Was it Kwon?

338
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:07,254
I'm certain.

339
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:09,194
You should've been more careful!

340
00:28:09,194 --> 00:28:11,864
I'm sorry. I didn't pay attention enough.

341
00:28:30,482 --> 00:28:32,387
[Officer Choi] [I'm at the meeting point]

342
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,783
I'm at the meeting point.

343
00:29:04,016 --> 00:29:05,426
[When will you get here?]

344
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:16,895
When will you get here?

345
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:35,301
[Still not here?]

346
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:45,414
Still not here?

347
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:03,265
What if it's really like that?

348
00:31:03,265 --> 00:31:08,881
What if Choi Eun-seol is really alive?

349
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:12,880
The murderer killed Choi Moo-gak's sister

350
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,925
thinking that she was the witness
because they had the same name!

351
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:22,887
And the murderer now knows that
the real witness is alive...

352
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:25,057
and is trying to kill her, too!

353
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:30,417
If Choi Eun-seol is alive,
then why isn't she coming forward?

354
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:32,353
She disappeared after being hospitalized at

355
00:31:32,353 --> 00:31:36,248
Jeju Baekrok Hospital
where Dr. Chun used to work.

356
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:38,934
Now she's registered as dead.

357
00:31:38,934 --> 00:31:41,635
Dr. Chun Baek-gyung...

358
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:58,802
Choi Eun-seol is the witness.

359
00:31:58,802 --> 00:32:04,701
Officer Choi's sister was
killed because of me.

360
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,882
Oh Cho-rim!

361
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:33,944
Where have you been on
a very important day like today?

362
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:38,712
Today is my birthday!

363
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:40,288
Ah...

364
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,562
Ah... What does that mean?

365
00:33:45,562 --> 00:33:46,958
Is it the expression of a girlfriend

366
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:50,915
who is too cool to celebrate
her boyfriend's birthday?

367
00:33:50,915 --> 00:33:58,870
Or that of an absent-minded girlfriend
who forgot about her boyfriend's birthday?

368
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:01,079
I'm sorry.

369
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,376
I knew it was today, but I forgot.

370
00:34:04,754 --> 00:34:07,049
So are you saying it's both of those?

371
00:34:07,543 --> 00:34:13,354
To make up for it, you must sing
"Happy Birthday" as loudly as possible.

372
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:17,126
My first birthday since we started
dating is a self-service birthday!

373
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:19,298
My life is quite unlucky!

374
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,468
What are you doing?
Let's go in.

375
00:34:24,691 --> 00:34:25,680
About yesterday...

376
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,099
The reason I couldn't go see you...

377
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:31,231
It's fine. I assume you went off
on an investigation.

378
00:34:32,578 --> 00:34:35,522
Yes. I'm sorry.

379
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,752
Why did you buy so much?

380
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:42,988
That's enough food for the
whole neighborhood!

381
00:34:42,988 --> 00:34:44,411
Let's go inside.

382
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:52,882
We must have savory pancakes for my birthday!

383
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:56,276
Let's start cooking the
sausages first.

384
00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:58,506
Should I cut them circular? Or slanted?

385
00:34:58,506 --> 00:35:02,421
Slanted, of course.

386
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:06,445
Be careful.

387
00:35:08,437 --> 00:35:11,984
When a right-handed and
left-handed person sit next to each other,

388
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,943
they hit each other and get tangled up...

389
00:35:15,943 --> 00:35:17,041
It's a mess.

390
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:20,061
But we're both left-handed!

391
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:22,127
So it's very efficient!

392
00:35:22,127 --> 00:35:25,368
Case closed!

393
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:36,768
Let's use this for the seafood pancakes...

394
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,511
And this for the mung bean pancakes.

395
00:35:40,403 --> 00:35:41,480
Why are we cooking so much?

396
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,936
Who will eat all of it?

397
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:46,952
All birthday dishes go in groups of three.

398
00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:49,321
Three different kinds of pancakes,
three different kinds of vegetables...

399
00:35:49,321 --> 00:35:51,890
Three different kinds of meat dishes!

400
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,749
That was the tradition at my house.

401
00:35:55,749 --> 00:36:00,218
You must be aware of this tradition
if you want to be married to me!

402
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,998
Are you laughing?

403
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:05,822
What are you doing?

404
00:36:05,822 --> 00:36:07,737
Don't do that. It's dangerous.

405
00:36:07,737 --> 00:36:10,739
What's so dangerous?

406
00:36:15,235 --> 00:36:18,636
I'll let it slide because it's my birthday!

407
00:36:20,522 --> 00:36:23,386
Well...

408
00:36:23,386 --> 00:36:25,638
So pretty!

409
00:36:29,183 --> 00:36:31,765
Why do you look so pretty today?

410
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:35,638
Never mind. Flip this before it burns!

411
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,920
Here we go...

412
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,720
♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

413
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,750
You must sing louder.

414
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,801
♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

415
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:05,939
♪ Happy birthday, dear Moo-gak... ♪

416
00:37:05,939 --> 00:37:07,255
No, wait...

417
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:13,468
Instead of my name, say "my love."

418
00:37:14,284 --> 00:37:18,875
♪ Happy birthday, my love... ♪

419
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:23,318
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

420
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:27,572
You have to make a wish.

421
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:38,203
Here we go.

422
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:47,440
Where's my phone?

423
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,309
I need to turn the lights on.

424
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:02,913
Here.

425
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:03,867
Thanks.

426
00:38:14,141 --> 00:38:19,124
By the way, did you just find my phone
by seeing the scent in the dark?

427
00:38:19,124 --> 00:38:19,807
Yes.

428
00:38:19,807 --> 00:38:23,268
You still can see scents in the dark?

429
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:28,287
I see. I had no idea.

430
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:31,275
There seem to be many things
I still don't know about you.

431
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:35,043
We'll get to know each other better
as time goes by.

432
00:38:35,043 --> 00:38:39,625
What if you come to hate me as
you get to know me more?

433
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:45,166
When I remember my past that
I don't remember right now...

434
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:47,933
What if you don't like what I remember?

435
00:38:48,348 --> 00:38:53,553
I think we only need to know and remember
the things that came after we first met.

436
00:38:53,553 --> 00:38:56,871
The meaningful thing here is being with you.

437
00:38:56,871 --> 00:39:00,221
Everything else is meaningless.

438
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:03,076
The past isn't important at all.

439
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:06,124
The important thing is that
you're with me right now.

440
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:12,791
Your birthday is almost over. It's 11:50.

441
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:14,730
We still have ten minutes!

442
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,214
What should we do to have fun?

443
00:39:16,214 --> 00:39:17,466
Should we dance?

444
00:39:17,466 --> 00:39:20,870
You must go.

445
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:23,027
Huh?

446
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,730
It's getting late. You should go.

447
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,810
Should I?

448
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,010
Are you tired?

449
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,687
Should I go?

450
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:45,824
Go back in.

451
00:39:45,824 --> 00:39:47,434
Make sure you lock the door.

452
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:50,429
I'll go once you go back inside.

453
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:55,301
I'll walk you home because
it's your birthday.

454
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:56,905
Let's go.

455
00:39:56,905 --> 00:39:59,900
Really?

456
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,527
Okay. Let's go.

457
00:40:22,976 --> 00:40:24,681
Go ahead.

458
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:29,162
I'll walk you back home.

459
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:30,427
Let's go.

460
00:40:34,978 --> 00:40:37,958
My birthday is over anyway.

461
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:44,717
Wow, it's well past midnight already!

462
00:40:44,717 --> 00:40:48,279
I'll walk you home.

463
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,454
Let's break up.

464
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:56,578
What? I said my birthday is over.

465
00:40:57,326 --> 00:41:00,103
I'm serious.

466
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:03,264
I don't want to see you anymore.

467
00:41:03,264 --> 00:41:06,297
What are you talking about right now?

468
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,059
I've thought about this a lot.

469
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:11,481
I think this is a good time to end it.

470
00:41:14,053 --> 00:41:18,125
I don't think I'll be able to
date you anymore.

471
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,445
Why? Why all of a sudden?

472
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,041
What's the reason?

473
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:27,235
It's not that I came to hate you,
or dislike the things you do.

474
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,686
Then, why?

475
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,072
Why do you want to break up?

476
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:34,033
Let's just call it quits.

477
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:38,504
I think we won't be able to
make it even if we try.

478
00:41:38,504 --> 00:41:43,434
So you don't have to understand.
You can blame everything on me.

479
00:41:47,482 --> 00:41:56,320
And I won't change my mind...
in case you try to do so.

480
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,514
Why are you doing this?

481
00:41:59,514 --> 00:42:00,617
Tell me the truth.

482
00:42:00,617 --> 00:42:02,094
And don't lie!

483
00:42:02,094 --> 00:42:04,040
Tell me the truth!

484
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,136
How could I lie about something like this?

485
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:12,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:44:49,265 --> 00:44:51,505
You don't look well.

487
00:44:51,505 --> 00:44:57,740
You mentioned something about
a program designed to restore memories...

488
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,708
I'd like to try it.

489
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:01,623
Why have you changed your mind?

490
00:45:01,623 --> 00:45:05,125
Because I'm the witness
who saw the murderer's face.

491
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:11,936
That way, we can catch the murderer. Right?

492
00:45:11,936 --> 00:45:15,721
I heard everything. I know.

493
00:45:24,672 --> 00:45:27,070
You don't have to force yourself to do this.

494
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:29,214
Not at all.

495
00:45:29,214 --> 00:45:31,635
I want to do this.

496
00:45:31,997 --> 00:45:38,375
To be honest, I'm scared.

497
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:41,343
But I want to know the truth.

498
00:45:41,343 --> 00:45:47,641
Once your memories return,
things might get harder for you.

499
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:48,851
But...

500
00:45:50,618 --> 00:45:53,499
Officer Choi's sister died because of me!

501
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:55,986
That's not true.

502
00:45:57,696 --> 00:45:59,163
Listen to me carefully.

503
00:45:59,163 --> 00:46:01,198
That was the murderer's fault.

504
00:46:01,198 --> 00:46:03,566
The one who killed her is wrong.

505
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:06,210
Yes, that bad murderer!

506
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:10,609
This case will be over once
I remember my past.

507
00:46:15,513 --> 00:46:21,377
But in exchange, please bring Officer Choi
back to the investigation team.

508
00:46:21,377 --> 00:46:26,065
And don't tell him any of this.

509
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:40,910
Cho-rim, I'm suspecting Chef Kwon
to be the murderer.

510
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:43,437
For your own safety,

511
00:46:43,437 --> 00:46:46,945
I want you to drop everything
you're doing with Chef Kwon.

512
00:46:46,945 --> 00:46:50,535
If your suspicion is true,

513
00:46:50,535 --> 00:46:55,773
then I'm the only person
who can be near Chef Kwon.

514
00:46:57,381 --> 00:47:02,756
Please use me when you need me.

515
00:47:07,401 --> 00:47:10,361
Please leave a voicemail...

516
00:47:14,062 --> 00:47:17,042
Please leave a voicemail...

517
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,966
After the beep... [Oh Cho-rim]

518
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,700
[Oh Cho-rim]

519
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,569
Please leave a voicemail...

520
00:47:42,509 --> 00:47:45,472
This is Choi Moo-gak.

521
00:48:16,804 --> 00:48:20,427
I've decided to trust your determination.

522
00:48:21,049 --> 00:48:24,364
So you're bringing me back on the team?

523
00:48:26,148 --> 00:48:27,138
Thank you.

524
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:29,585
Please don't do anything that will
disappoint your colleagues.

525
00:48:29,585 --> 00:48:30,523
Yes.

526
00:48:31,937 --> 00:48:35,154
There will be a meeting soon.

527
00:49:12,457 --> 00:49:13,325
I created an association for

528
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:18,697
the victims' families after the
third victims got murdered in Jeju.

529
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:26,735
People think of the Jeju diver couple
as the victims of my second murder...

530
00:49:26,735 --> 00:49:30,276
but Oh Jae-pyo knows them as my third victim.

531
00:49:30,703 --> 00:49:37,589
How does he know that
my first murder was separate?

532
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:40,230
[Hong Ji-yeon]

533
00:49:50,903 --> 00:49:52,996
This is $30,000!

534
00:49:52,996 --> 00:49:55,298
This is a lot of money!

535
00:49:55,298 --> 00:49:58,871
This is my donation to the
association of victims' families.

536
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,928
Thank you very much.

537
00:50:00,928 --> 00:50:03,244
I'll put this to good use.

538
00:50:03,244 --> 00:50:07,802
What kind of activities does
the association organize?

539
00:50:07,802 --> 00:50:12,890
The best consolation will come
from catching the murderer.

540
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:14,704
Of course.

541
00:50:14,704 --> 00:50:16,513
The police aren't doing anything.

542
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,998
They won't be able to catch the murderer!

543
00:50:18,998 --> 00:50:22,801
We have the witness on our side.

544
00:50:22,801 --> 00:50:27,305
So we'll catch the murderer on our own.

545
00:50:27,305 --> 00:50:29,808
There's a witness?

546
00:50:29,808 --> 00:50:33,172
Yes, I'm keeping the witness
as close to me as possible.

547
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:38,744
It seems like the coffee is done.

548
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,678
Excuse me.

549
00:50:57,297 --> 00:51:04,036
A year after Soo-jung went missing,
our family was shattered into pieces.

550
00:51:04,036 --> 00:51:07,110
My husband, Jae-pyo, became a detective.

551
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:10,276
And he started to come home less and less.

552
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:15,220
And there were increasingly more nights
when I'd fall asleep after drinking.

553
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,650
Every morning, I woke up to a nightmare

554
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:22,684
that my five-year-old
Soo-jung was killed.

555
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:30,298
Jae-pyo and I got divorced two years
after Soo-jung's death.

556
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:56,776
Mr. Oh...

557
00:51:56,776 --> 00:51:57,664
Yes?

558
00:51:59,234 --> 00:52:01,051
I respect your devotion to this cause

559
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:06,365
even though you're not
a family member of a victim.

560
00:52:06,365 --> 00:52:08,327
Not at all.

561
00:52:08,327 --> 00:52:10,131
It's not a big deal.

562
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:15,755
But aren't you too focused on
all these other families?

563
00:52:15,755 --> 00:52:18,506
Isn't it true you don't have much time
to focus on your own family?

564
00:52:18,506 --> 00:52:20,287
I have a daughter.

565
00:52:20,287 --> 00:52:22,774
But she takes care of herself quite well.

566
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,947
You look quite young.

567
00:52:24,947 --> 00:52:29,153
You already have a grown-up daughter?

568
00:52:29,153 --> 00:52:32,114
She turns 22 this year.

569
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:37,869
Try your coffee.

570
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:39,014
Thank you.

571
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,069
It smells great.

572
00:53:01,021 --> 00:53:03,057
You ordered coffee?

573
00:53:03,057 --> 00:53:05,236
Before your memory
recovery program starts tomorrow,

574
00:53:05,236 --> 00:53:07,966
they'll test you on how susceptible
you are to hypnosis.

575
00:53:07,966 --> 00:53:09,889
You need a lot of sleep for that.

576
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:11,130
So caffeine isn't good.

577
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:14,068
Switch with me.

578
00:53:14,068 --> 00:53:15,768
Thank you.

579
00:53:15,768 --> 00:53:20,338
Anything else I should watch out for?

580
00:53:20,338 --> 00:53:22,171
Your mind must be relaxed.

581
00:53:22,171 --> 00:53:25,451
For that, your body must be relaxed, too.

582
00:53:25,451 --> 00:53:29,539
After this, make sure you go straight home
and get a good night's sleep!

583
00:53:33,442 --> 00:53:36,115
Is there a problem?

584
00:53:37,264 --> 00:53:39,826
My dad said he'd come home tonight.

585
00:53:39,826 --> 00:53:42,351
But he hasn't come back yet.

586
00:53:42,351 --> 00:53:44,436
He's been out of town for a while.

587
00:53:44,436 --> 00:53:45,990
Have you tried to call him?

588
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:49,371
I couldn't reach him.

589
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:53,142
If you're that worried,
do you want me to look into it?

590
00:53:53,142 --> 00:53:55,607
I'd be grateful.

591
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,351
Please give me your father's phone number.

592
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:18,584
You have something to tell me?

593
00:54:18,584 --> 00:54:26,578
Cho-rim found out she's the witness
of the barcode-chain-murder case.

594
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:32,311
What are you talking about?

595
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,786
Are you saying that her memory has returned?

596
00:54:33,786 --> 00:54:35,714
It's not that.

597
00:54:35,714 --> 00:54:40,478
I think she overheard
our detectives' conversation.

598
00:54:42,471 --> 00:54:47,898
Then, how much does she know?

599
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:48,897
Does she...

600
00:54:48,897 --> 00:54:57,340
She knows that your sister was killed
because the murderer mistook her.

601
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,766
Why didn't you tell me first?

602
00:55:05,766 --> 00:55:10,184
Was that also because you thought it
would negatively affect the investigation?

603
00:55:12,112 --> 00:55:14,431
Cho-rim is probably still nearby.

604
00:55:36,727 --> 00:55:40,131
Hey, I'm rather drunk right now.

605
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:42,543
Do you think you can come pick me up?

606
00:55:42,543 --> 00:55:47,049
I'm at 154 of Pyeongchang Neighborhood,
Jongro District, Seoul City.

607
00:55:49,492 --> 00:55:51,999
Lieutenant!

608
00:55:54,103 --> 00:55:56,595
I've located the mobile
number that you requested.

609
00:55:56,595 --> 00:55:58,813
It's in Pyeongchang Neighborhood right now.

610
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:01,734
Pyeongchang Neighborhood?

611
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,869
Kwon Jae-hee's house is there.

612
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:06,833
Why is Mr. Oh there?

613
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:15,007
Lieutenant, I got in touch with my dad.

614
00:56:15,007 --> 00:56:17,246
I'm on my way to see him.

615
00:56:17,246 --> 00:56:20,176
Thank you for your concern.

616
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,891
[Oh Cho-rim]

617
00:56:29,658 --> 00:56:30,979
[Lt. Yeom]

618
00:56:36,702 --> 00:56:38,747
Yes, Lieutenant.

619
00:56:38,747 --> 00:56:40,837
Mr. Oh is at Kwon Jae-hee's house?

620
00:56:40,837 --> 00:56:45,485
And it seems that Cho-rim is on
her way there right now, too.

621
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,367
I'll go there right now.

622
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:49,591
I'm heading out there, too.

623
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,752
[Dad]

624
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:45,608
[Daughter]
