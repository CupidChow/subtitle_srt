[Episode 13]

2
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:37,619
Are you here to look for your wallet?

3
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:40,457
Yes, Mr. Chef.

4
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:44,361
Did I surprise you?

5
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:47,203
I suppose you didn't expect me
to be here right now, right?

6
00:00:48,527 --> 00:00:50,664
Yes, a little bit.

7
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:55,260
My meeting got canceled,
so I came home early.

8
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,460
Go ahead, keep looking around.

9
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,979
I'll go make some coffee upstairs.

10
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,073
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:42,114 --> 00:01:46,319
I'll get going, Mr. Chef.

12
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,611
Why? Come here and have a seat.

13
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:55,513
I need to be somewhere...

14
00:01:56,913 --> 00:02:00,214
At least drink some coffee before you go.
I made it for you.

15
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:03,769
Come sit down.

16
00:02:07,592 --> 00:02:08,467
Yes.

17
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:21,958
Try it.

18
00:02:24,723 --> 00:02:26,319
Thank you.

19
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:35,376
It's fine. Try it.

20
00:02:35,744 --> 00:02:36,535
Yes.

21
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:59,425
It smells great.

22
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:02,216
Is that so?

23
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,687
Coffee makes one relaxed.

24
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:06,569
Yes...

25
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:10,443
Try some more.

26
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:13,873
Yes...

27
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:45,061
Kwon Jae-hee!

28
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:48,574
It seems as though we have a guest.

29
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:52,306
Please stay with me a little bit longer
while drinking your coffee?

30
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:54,834
Kwon Jae-hee!

31
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,091
Detective Choi!

32
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:02,125
What brings you here?

33
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,571
What is it, Detective Choi?

34
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:21,240
We both know why I am here.
Why do you even ask?

35
00:04:23,684 --> 00:04:26,549
You're rather brazen.

36
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:34,487
Let her go.
And we'll have talk.

37
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:40,626
Sounds good.

38
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,094
Cho-rim!

39
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:44,063
Didn't you say you had a meeting?

40
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:45,026
Aren't you late?

41
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:45,757
What?

42
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:48,400
Go to your meeting right now.

43
00:04:52,338 --> 00:04:53,808
You can't be late to your meetings.

44
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:55,240
Go ahead.

45
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:02,545
Then...

46
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,412
I'll get going first.

47
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:21,855
Are you here to take your spy camera?

48
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:24,611
It seems like I don't need it anymore.

49
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:26,275
So I should take it back.

50
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:32,974
Then the person who put it
there should retrieve it, too.

51
00:05:58,013 --> 00:05:59,705
By the way...

52
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:06,140
Cho-rim was just in this room
to find her wallet.

53
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,784
I was upstairs making coffee.

54
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:13,156
Cho-rim was here alone briefly.

55
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:16,489
I don't understand what you're trying to say.

56
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:22,195
I just hope the spy camera is
still in the same spot.

57
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:30,819
What if Cho-rim is the one who left the
camera here and then took it away?

58
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:33,239
She has nothing to do with this.

59
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:38,644
I guess we will see by checking
if the camera is still here.

60
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:49,018
I just hope that Cho-rim didn't come
here to pick up the camera...

61
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:19,280
If you trespass on my property again,
I won't let that slide.

62
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:32,205
You got pissed off by my intruding, right?

63
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:41,735
You killed my sister...
and destroyed my family.

64
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,809
You'll die soon.

65
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,061
Do you want to live?

66
00:08:02,975 --> 00:08:05,037
Then you must kill me.

67
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:14,076
You must stop now.

68
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,909
Kwon Jae-hee knows.

69
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:18,721
He may pretend like he doesn't,
but he'd at least be suspicious, right?

70
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:22,465
I'm certain. He's suspicious of you.

71
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:25,707
So, I can't go near him anymore?

72
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:27,886
No, it's too dangerous.

73
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:31,176
Then what should I do?

74
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:34,127
I have something that
I must find out from him.

75
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,689
Something that you must find out from him?

76
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:40,468
I saw the same scent from Chef Kwon, too.

77
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:53,921
What do you mean "the same scent"?

78
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:57,759
The scent that I saw from Dr. Chun's body.

79
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,904
Ah, the scent that you don't recognize?

80
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:07,002
Chef Kwon had the same exact scent.

81
00:09:07,002 --> 00:09:09,828
He didn't have that scent at the restaurant.

82
00:09:09,828 --> 00:09:12,231
But when I saw him at his home,
he had the scent.

83
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:14,728
So that means the scent got on him
somewhere in between.

84
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,770
Yes, I'm certain.

85
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:19,535
There's something about that house.

86
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:25,392
Please tell your colleagues
that I can see scents.

87
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:29,239
There's no need for you to tell others.

88
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:32,184
It's too dangerous by yourself.
I won't let that happen.

89
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:35,154
You must catch him with the other detectives.

90
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:39,686
For the other detectives to trust me,
they must know I can see scents.

91
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:48,234
You can see... scents?

92
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:52,530
See... scents?

93
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,574
That can't be true!

94
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:56,477
You want us to believe that?

95
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:58,162
Do you think we're that stupid?

96
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:00,793
Officer Choi is speaking the truth.

97
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:04,317
I really can see scents.

98
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:07,981
The fact that I've been oddly
smart in our investigations...

99
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:11,402
That's because she's able to see smells.

100
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,762
No, that's not it...

101
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:17,213
Anyway...

102
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:20,112
I can see scents.

103
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:24,503
Can you prove it?

104
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,745
We're all ready.

105
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:09,924
Detective Ki's uniform is inside of
Inspector Kang's locker.

106
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:22,588
Officer Choi's uniform is inside of
Detective Ki's locker.

107
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:29,495
No way...

108
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:35,370
And inside of Officer Choi's locker...

109
00:11:35,848 --> 00:11:38,090
Detective Yeh's?

110
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,419
No, Lt. Yeom's uniform.

111
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,329
Incredible...

112
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,839
So, you followed the scent
also when you found out

113
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:01,867
where Joo Ma-ri's car was?

114
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:03,743
That's correct.

115
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:11,308
So with that marijuana murder case, you
were able to track the marijuana scent?

116
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:12,907
Yes, that's right.

117
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:16,322
She tracked the murderer
by looking at the scent.

118
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:27,434
By the way, how did you get
this amazing ability, Cho-rim?

119
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,814
I'll tell you everything in the near future.

120
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:52,512
I hope you won't talk to anyone
about Cho-rim's eye.

121
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:00,481
Shall we go?

122
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,603
It's just incredible!

123
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:11,213
Sometimes, I feel like I can hear
what people are thinking!

124
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:12,902
That's just some auditory hallucination.

125
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:15,712
Honestly, I have a little bit of premonition.

126
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:19,846
There are times I can see the future...

127
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:23,671
Begin with seeing what's
in front of you first.

128
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:28,515
Hey! What's going on?

129
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:32,158
Those two little brats
just lost a pickpocketer!

130
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:33,925
This is driving me crazy!

131
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:36,935
How in the world are we going to
catch the pickpocketer again?

132
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:38,785
Darn it!

133
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,231
I'll give it a try.

134
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:02,588
Apparently the pickpocketer
had a stomachache.

135
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:03,917
So they unlocked the handcuffs.

136
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:07,365
But he escaped through the restroom window!

137
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:08,835
Why do you want to see his jacket?

138
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:11,297
This is what he was wearing earlier?

139
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:13,363
That's right.

140
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:14,734
May I?

141
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:17,354
Take a look.

142
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,636
What are you doing?

143
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:27,916
Are you kidding us?

144
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:32,158
We just wasted time!

145
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,816
Are you done?

146
00:14:40,816 --> 00:14:42,261
Can you really find him?

147
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:43,286
Yes!

148
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:26,540
He's here.

149
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:32,421
What are you doing in front of my car?

150
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:47,994
If you don't come out,
we'll use a forklift to open the trunk!

151
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:49,236
You have three seconds.

152
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:52,179
One, two...

153
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,420
There's the pickpocketer!

154
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,359
Come here!

155
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,604
Come here! Get out!

156
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:06,403
What a relief!

157
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:09,506
I should make sure to lock
my car from now on...

158
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:15,721
But... how did you know
that he was in my trunk?

159
00:16:23,953 --> 00:16:25,131
It was rather obvious!

160
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:26,841
Let's go in.

161
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:28,610
You...

162
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,730
Cho-rim left the restaurant to go to

163
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,381
Kwon Jae-hee's house five minutes
after he left the restaurant.

164
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:39,638
Kwon Jae-hee was home already
by the time she got there...

165
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:43,828
which means he went straight from
the restaurant to his home.

166
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:46,320
It takes around 30 minutes to
get there from the restaurant.

167
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,090
And Kwon Jae-hee had a scent at his house
that you didn't see at the restaurant?

168
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,361
Yes, it's hard to say that he got the scent
from somewhere else on his way home.

169
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:59,370
So we can conclude that he
got the scent from his house.

170
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:06,467
So, Kwon Jae-hee was somewhere inside
the house where Dr. Chun used to stay.

171
00:17:06,467 --> 00:17:08,181
And that's how the scent got on him?

172
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:10,843
If there is indeed a space like that,

173
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:13,055
we'll be able to secure a critical
piece of evidence there.

174
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:16,247
There must be a hidden space in
Kwon Jae-hee's house.

175
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:20,391
He probably locked up his victims
there and killed them.

176
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:24,891
The problem is that we can't enter his house.

177
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:28,348
I'll volunteer myself to be
kidnapped by him, so I can go there.

178
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,882
No!

179
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:34,136
That's too dangerous.

180
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,168
We must check his house.

181
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:38,342
I'm sure there is something.

182
00:17:38,342 --> 00:17:42,442
Even if we can't check it,
we must shake him at least.

183
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:45,236
Do you have a way to get in there?

184
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:46,809
No.

185
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:56,209
Moo-gak, you can't joke around with
such a handsome and serious face.

186
00:17:56,556 --> 00:17:59,998
Then let's start making a way.

187
00:18:04,463 --> 00:18:10,146
Detective Yeh, please get the blueprint
of Kwon Jae-hee's house.

188
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:17,352
Detective Ki, please go to the fire
department and report a fire code violation.

189
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:19,531
What should I do?

190
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,315
Please accompany Detective Ki.

191
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,405
Once the fire department orders
an emergency inspection...

192
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:27,181
we can enter Kwon Jae-hee's house right away!

193
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,667
The fact that the police switched
the pictures means I got the right

194
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:37,181
picture of Choi Eun-seol from the beginning.

195
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:41,204
But why did the police switch the pictures?

196
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:46,977
That means they know that
I can't recognize people's faces.

197
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:52,518
And I only told Oh Cho-rim
about my prosopagnosia.

198
00:18:53,168 --> 00:18:56,984
Why is Oh Cho-rim cooperating
with the police?

199
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,565
Where could Choi Eun-seol be?

200
00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:10,787
Eun-seol started school at
Jeju Seonam High School.

201
00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:14,098
She entered the same school
that I had graduated from.

202
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:18,804
The brightest period of her life has begun.

203
00:20:18,804 --> 00:20:24,346
My best friend's daughter, Yoon Mi-na,
also started at Seonam High School.

204
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:26,933
They became best friends, too.

205
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:30,416
They're always together, talking
and laughing with each other.

206
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:33,542
They're closer than
Mi-na's mother and I were.

207
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,207
[Jeju Seonam High School]

208
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:44,432
[Yoon Mi-na, born in 1994]

209
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:55,744
Did you watch the baseball game last night?

210
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:57,644
How could they turn the game
at the bottom of the ninth inning?

211
00:20:57,644 --> 00:20:59,350
I knew that'd happen because
I can see the future.

212
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,274
You came early!

213
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:02,615
Good morning!

214
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,185
Welcome.

215
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:08,614
Today is the first day of your 24-hour,
witness protection program, right?

216
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:09,882
Yes.

217
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:12,752
Don't you think you're being overprotective?

218
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:18,357
Please let us know if you need anything.

219
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:19,926
Sure.

220
00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:20,597
Do you want some coffee?

221
00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:21,357
You don't have to!

222
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:23,162
We'll go get it ourselves.

223
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:26,377
You don't have to do such a thing!

224
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:27,934
Just relax on that sofa.

225
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:28,789
Let's go.

226
00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:33,438
Hello, southern police precinct!

227
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:36,196
No, this isn't a restaurant.

228
00:21:39,106 --> 00:21:40,563
Why are you answering the phone?

229
00:21:40,563 --> 00:21:42,319
Because it was in front of me...

230
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,339
I was going to transfer it to you.

231
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:48,081
Just relax on the sofa.

232
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:48,916
Alright already.

233
00:21:53,392 --> 00:21:57,851
Lt. Yeom, any progress on
Cho-rim's memory recovery?

234
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:03,603
We're even using hypnosis,
but it's not working so well.

235
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:09,101
But it's not like we can show her
the picture of her dead parents...

236
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:11,566
and tell her to remember them as her parents!

237
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:14,100
That's too cruel.

238
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,638
We can't do that.

239
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:17,413
Is there any other way?

240
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:20,411
We'll have to place our bets on her friends.

241
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:27,035
Some people are able to regain their memories
by hanging out with their old close friends.

242
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:29,047
I really feel sorry for her.

243
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:36,053
As a father myself,
I feel really bad for Cho-rim.

244
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,910
Then I'll leave a message like that...

245
00:22:58,491 --> 00:22:59,577
Keep slurping.

246
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,347
How about you?

247
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,095
Eat this, too!

248
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:15,029
This is Choi Moo-gak.

249
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:19,434
The fire department ordered the inspection?

250
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,155
The fire department and the southern
police precinct will inspect your house.

251
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:39,865
Inspect for what?

252
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:43,770
We've received a report of a
fire code violation here.

253
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,735
We'll check if the initial fire

254
00:23:44,735 --> 00:23:47,411
prevention system at the time of
completion is still intact...

255
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:50,718
and whether you changed
the structure illegally.

256
00:23:50,718 --> 00:23:51,648
Let's start.

257
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:52,500
Okay.

258
00:23:57,797 --> 00:24:04,062
We'd like to make sure you don't have
any illegal structures in your basement.

259
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:37,684
I think I should turn this
into a routine checkup!

260
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,754
It's very suspicious here!

261
00:24:39,754 --> 00:24:41,949
You're making me upset.

262
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:51,951
So I guess you kill people when you're upset.

263
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,814
Then go ahead.

264
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,234
I told you already.

265
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:07,854
Kill me if you want to
live a comfortable life.

266
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:14,227
If you don't kill me, you'll die.

267
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:18,803
Why?

268
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:22,344
You want to kidnap me right now,
lock me up for six days...

269
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:25,626
then kill me on the seventh day
and display me to the world?

270
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:33,045
Here, I'm all yours.

271
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:38,784
I'd love to see your secret chamber.

272
00:25:39,826 --> 00:25:43,456
I know it's definitely inside of this house.

273
00:25:43,456 --> 00:25:45,395
Then why don't you search yourself?

274
00:25:45,395 --> 00:25:47,199
I'm serious.

275
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,594
I'd love to see it.

276
00:25:48,594 --> 00:25:50,129
Please kidnap me.

277
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,033
Kidnap me!

278
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:09,792
Ms. Choi has lost all of her memories
from a car accident three years ago.

279
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,112
I see...

280
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,909
That's why she couldn't
recognize me on the set.

281
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:19,205
Then what can I do to help, detective?

282
00:26:19,205 --> 00:26:21,849
You can treat her naturally
as you did back in high school.

283
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:26,756
But please do not mention anything
about her parents' death.

284
00:26:26,756 --> 00:26:27,921
I see.

285
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:32,887
And please spread the word to
your high school classmates.

286
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:37,510
Is this the alumni association of
Jeju Seonam High School?

287
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:43,407
I'd like to find a person. Is that possible?

288
00:26:44,277 --> 00:26:45,976
Hello, this is Yoon Mi-na.

289
00:26:45,976 --> 00:26:48,188
I'm Choi Eun-seol's friend.

290
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:48,725
Yes...

291
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:50,519
Hi, my name is Park Seung-jin.

292
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,934
Thanks for calling.

293
00:26:52,934 --> 00:26:56,771
The alumni association told me that
you're looking for Eun-seol, too.

294
00:26:56,771 --> 00:27:02,301
I guess none of your classmates
know where she is?

295
00:27:02,301 --> 00:27:07,656
That's right. No one has heard from her since
that accident three years ago.

296
00:27:07,656 --> 00:27:10,347
Some say she died.

297
00:27:10,347 --> 00:27:12,909
There's a rumor that she's in Seoul.

298
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:13,918
Really?

299
00:27:13,918 --> 00:27:16,730
I'll have to contact all
my classmates in Seoul then.

300
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,925
Would you please let me know
once you hear anything?

301
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:22,041
Yes, I will!

302
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:26,932
Song-yi!

303
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:30,216
I'm sorry that I couldn't recognize you.

304
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,087
I suppose I made you upset back then, right?

305
00:27:32,087 --> 00:27:36,144
Don't say that, Choi Eun-seol.

306
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:38,997
It's so good to see you again.

307
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:40,466
Thank you.

308
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:43,391
I'm going to organize a gathering with
all your high school friends.

309
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:45,641
You must come! It'll be a reunion!

310
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:48,046
Okay. Thanks.

311
00:27:53,812 --> 00:27:56,155
Give me a call once the date
is set for the reunion.

312
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:57,176
Thanks.

313
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,532
Okay, I'll be in touch.

314
00:27:58,532 --> 00:28:00,648
Goodbye!

315
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:02,061
Thank you.

316
00:28:02,061 --> 00:28:03,688
Goodbye.

317
00:28:06,412 --> 00:28:08,155
I suppose the talk went well.

318
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:09,789
There'll be a reunion?

319
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:12,837
Something good may come from the
meeting with old classmates.

320
00:28:14,355 --> 00:28:17,195
Keep up the good work with
your close protection.

321
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,477
Sure.

322
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:20,408
Goodbye, Lieutenant.

323
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:25,370
Let's go eat.

324
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:31,553
What are you doing there?

325
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:33,115
If you're protecting me closely...

326
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:36,306
Aren't you supposed to follow me
wherever where I go?

327
00:28:36,306 --> 00:28:38,931
You can't just say,
"Let's go eat," and leave!

328
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:40,822
That's not a bodyguard!

329
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:43,776
Darn, it's my fault!

330
00:28:43,776 --> 00:28:45,968
Where would you like to go, ma'am?

331
00:29:07,271 --> 00:29:08,828
Why are you stopping?

332
00:29:10,024 --> 00:29:11,664
What do you feel like?

333
00:29:11,664 --> 00:29:14,088
I'll go wherever you want to eat.

334
00:29:14,634 --> 00:29:16,687
How gracious of you to be concerned
for such a lowly person like me.

335
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:21,369
I'm going to cry because I'm so touched!

336
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:23,777
That's how you want to play this?

337
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:26,946
Should I go this way?

338
00:29:26,946 --> 00:29:29,812
No, I'm going this way!

339
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:36,588
This way? No, that way!

340
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:41,131
What? Where are you going?

341
00:29:41,131 --> 00:29:43,709
You can't leave me here!

342
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:57,432
Has there been anything suspicious
coming from Kwon Jae-hee?

343
00:29:57,432 --> 00:29:59,712
Nothing.

344
00:29:59,712 --> 00:30:03,139
I thought he might call you,
but he hasn't made any movement.

345
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:04,184
Let's talk about that later.

346
00:30:04,184 --> 00:30:05,873
Eat for now!

347
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:08,222
Okay. Eat up!

348
00:30:20,074 --> 00:30:21,530
What's wrong?

349
00:30:23,504 --> 00:30:27,445
This is spicy, isn't it?

350
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:31,055
Yes, that's right!

351
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:33,480
Can you taste now?

352
00:30:35,315 --> 00:30:37,351
Then...

353
00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:38,851
How about this?

354
00:30:44,324 --> 00:30:45,587
Pretty sweet?

355
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:47,120
That's right!

356
00:30:47,685 --> 00:30:54,823
How about this then...?

357
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:04,352
Bittersweet and spicy...
more like sweet and sour...

358
00:31:04,352 --> 00:31:07,108
hot and spicy and bland and
salty at the same time!

359
00:31:08,095 --> 00:31:11,083
That's enough.

360
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,223
So you said that was spicy
because it's red...

361
00:31:13,223 --> 00:31:16,610
and this was sweet because it's white!

362
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:21,551
You're always thinking about how to prank me!

363
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:28,968
I told you I won't be able to regain
my senses until your memory returns.

364
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:35,445
I appreciate the sentiment,
but I can't just will it happen.

365
00:31:37,783 --> 00:31:41,366
Don't you feel stuffy these days
because of Kwon Jae-hee?

366
00:31:41,688 --> 00:31:43,708
It's okay.

367
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:47,157
Shall we get some fresh air today?

368
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:49,080
I'll be sure to protect you.

369
00:31:50,457 --> 00:31:53,363
Now that you mention it,
I'd love to go biking.

370
00:31:53,363 --> 00:31:54,259
Biking?

371
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:55,594
Yes.

372
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:57,733
Slurp it up and let's go!

373
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:05,173
There are a lot of people outside
because the weather is nice!

374
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,093
A lot of families, too!

375
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,541
Look at how that little kid moves!

376
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:11,877
How cute!

377
00:32:11,877 --> 00:32:14,019
Take a look!

378
00:32:15,323 --> 00:32:16,567
What are you doing?

379
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,847
I thought you were supposed to
protect me as a bodyguard.

380
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:21,787
How's this?

381
00:32:21,787 --> 00:32:22,576
I think it'll look good on you.

382
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:23,775
Try it on!

383
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,999
Excuse me, but those are for dogs.

384
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:29,996
These are for people.

385
00:32:29,996 --> 00:32:31,285
Please take a look.

386
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:33,833
I'd like something designed
for people, Officer Choi.

387
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,301
Designed for people...

388
00:32:37,436 --> 00:32:40,006
How's this?

389
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:42,333
It's cute!

390
00:32:45,082 --> 00:32:46,839
Do people actually use things
like this these days?

391
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,617
It's pretty!

392
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:49,181
Are you buying it for me?

393
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:50,233
How much is it?

394
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,939
Yes, two...

395
00:32:51,939 --> 00:32:53,014
Three dollars.

396
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,282
Three...

397
00:32:54,282 --> 00:32:55,966
Okay...

398
00:32:56,495 --> 00:32:58,250
I have a lot of small bills.

399
00:32:58,591 --> 00:33:00,192
Here you go.

400
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:02,504
Thank you!

401
00:33:02,504 --> 00:33:05,531
- Thank you!
- Thank you! Goodbye!

402
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,413
I like them!

403
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:15,943
Thank you, Officer Choi.

404
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:19,865
If you're so thankful, then
you can treat me.

405
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:22,654
We've eaten so much already!

406
00:33:22,654 --> 00:33:25,256
We're here to bike!

407
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:31,891
Okay, I'll treat you.

408
00:33:34,441 --> 00:33:36,512
He doesn't have any shame!

409
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,797
How much is the ice cream?

410
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:38,517
One dollar.

411
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,599
I'll take two.

412
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,542
They only have vanilla.

413
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,756
Okay.

414
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:46,591
Here you go.

415
00:33:46,865 --> 00:33:48,723
Thank you!

416
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:49,713
Are you taking a picture?

417
00:33:49,713 --> 00:33:53,279
Wait! One, two three...

418
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:56,858
Hold on... One, two, three!

419
00:34:03,649 --> 00:34:05,511
Are you okay?

420
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:09,989
Why is it so hard?

421
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:12,667
Why is it so hard today?

422
00:34:13,374 --> 00:34:17,241
What? Why are you not pedaling?

423
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:19,325
Why am I doing it alone?

424
00:34:20,106 --> 00:34:22,814
I'm pedaling!

425
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:30,144
Stop!

426
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:38,224
Seriously...it was so hard!

427
00:34:38,224 --> 00:34:39,633
Maybe I should work out or something!

428
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:42,295
I'm not like how I used to be!

429
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:44,290
What are you doing?

430
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,632
Why are you taking pictures of me like this?

431
00:34:46,632 --> 00:34:48,165
Wait...

432
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:50,303
If you want pictures,
let's take them together!

433
00:34:50,303 --> 00:34:51,818
Shall we?

434
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:56,208
Looking like a mess will be a memory, too!

435
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,052
One, two, three!

436
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,356
That's it.

437
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:15,353
Let me see...

438
00:35:19,466 --> 00:35:21,145
What is that?

439
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,528
I'm tired...

440
00:35:25,528 --> 00:35:27,984
Then should I take the front seat?

441
00:35:27,984 --> 00:35:30,914
I never let anyone take the front.

442
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:33,320
I can't even decide on the direction either!

443
00:35:34,475 --> 00:35:37,031
But because I'm tired...
do you want the front seat?

444
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:38,504
I'll yield.

445
00:35:38,905 --> 00:35:40,897
Okay. Here!

446
00:35:43,481 --> 00:35:45,392
I'll take the front seat. Let's go!

447
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:48,066
Nice!

448
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,872
Where would you like to go, ma'am?

449
00:35:57,481 --> 00:35:59,286
Rain!

450
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,901
It's cold.

451
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:04,867
I'm completely wet!

452
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,249
That rain startled me!

453
00:36:10,249 --> 00:36:13,693
Oh no, my hair pin!

454
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:14,731
Is it gone?

455
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:16,889
It's not here...

456
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:20,593
I think it came off while riding the bike.

457
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:23,229
Let's try to find it.

458
00:36:23,229 --> 00:36:26,588
You can trace it by your
shampoo scent, right?

459
00:36:41,914 --> 00:36:44,651
I can't see scents when it rains.

460
00:36:44,651 --> 00:36:47,753
I don't see scents when it rains.

461
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:48,659
Really?

462
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:51,311
You can't see scents when it rains?

463
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:56,218
I'm such a dummy!

464
00:36:56,218 --> 00:36:56,908
It's fine!

465
00:36:56,908 --> 00:36:58,599
I'll buy you another one on the way out.

466
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,199
It's not that!

467
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,025
How upsetting!

468
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,224
Right.

469
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:12,110
This is right after we bought it...

470
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,841
It was there at the park entrance...

471
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:16,945
and in front of the ice cream truck...

472
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:20,728
and when you were
sitting in the front seat...

473
00:37:20,728 --> 00:37:23,669
and when you were tired at the bench...

474
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:26,258
But not after that.

475
00:37:26,258 --> 00:37:28,423
I've found it!

476
00:37:28,423 --> 00:37:30,492
You probably dropped it at the bench!

477
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:38,208
It's fine, let's just go.

478
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,814
I'll buy you another one.

479
00:37:39,814 --> 00:37:40,320
No!

480
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,144
We must find it.

481
00:37:42,144 --> 00:37:44,518
We were here, right?

482
00:37:44,518 --> 00:37:47,346
Yes.

483
00:37:47,346 --> 00:37:48,738
Look on that side.

484
00:37:57,996 --> 00:38:00,681
Look more thoroughly!

485
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:02,333
I would've found it already
if it wasn't raining right now!

486
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:05,037
But why does it have to rain right now?

487
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:10,002
Let's just go. Please.

488
00:38:10,002 --> 00:38:11,785
Okay, but...

489
00:38:11,785 --> 00:38:13,129
Let's just go.

490
00:38:13,129 --> 00:38:14,778
That'll be more helpful.

491
00:38:14,778 --> 00:38:15,821
Okay...

492
00:38:15,821 --> 00:38:16,543
Let's go.

493
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:17,276
I'm sorry.

494
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:18,631
It's fine.

495
00:38:23,249 --> 00:38:25,193
Yes, Lt. Yeom.

496
00:38:25,193 --> 00:38:26,173
Yes.

497
00:38:27,353 --> 00:38:29,887
Yes, Kwon Jae-hee is home right now.

498
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:33,259
He didn't come outside at all today.

499
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:36,406
Yes, we'll keep an eye on him.

500
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:38,141
Okay, goodbye!

501
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,348
Why do you think he's not moving at all?

502
00:38:44,348 --> 00:38:48,175
He's not going to the restaurant,
and he also canceled all of his TV shows.

503
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,958
I suppose he's trying to figure out
how to run away.

504
00:38:51,477 --> 00:38:55,739
♪ The guy in front is the thief ♪
♪ And the guy in back is the cop! ♪

505
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:56,885
How do you know that song?

506
00:38:56,885 --> 00:38:58,797
That was popular when I was little!

507
00:38:58,797 --> 00:38:59,988
How old are you?

508
00:38:59,988 --> 00:39:02,190
I'm two years older than you.

509
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,142
Funny...

510
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,593
I wish I was younger than you.

511
00:39:07,593 --> 00:39:12,149
Elena keeps nagging me for being old.

512
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:16,369
A 15-year-age gap isn't that big!

513
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:20,702
Speaking of Elena Shivanova...

514
00:39:20,702 --> 00:39:22,196
she doesn't seem to be
calling you often these days.

515
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:28,003
That's right. We're in a cold war,
pushing and pulling.

516
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:30,684
Is that so?

517
00:39:30,684 --> 00:39:32,518
You got in touch with Choi Eun-seol?

518
00:39:32,518 --> 00:39:36,016
Yes, she's going to meet up
with all her classmates!

519
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:40,054
Great news!

520
00:39:40,054 --> 00:39:43,898
You should have the reunion
at a restaurant that I know.

521
00:39:43,898 --> 00:39:45,744
You'll be able to use the space for free.

522
00:39:45,744 --> 00:39:46,707
Really?

523
00:39:46,707 --> 00:39:48,071
Yes.

524
00:39:48,071 --> 00:39:50,175
If you let me know
how many people will be there...

525
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:53,873
I'll make a room reservation.

526
00:39:54,364 --> 00:39:55,963
Okay.

527
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:06,285
You want some instant coffee?

528
00:40:06,285 --> 00:40:07,653
Okay.

529
00:40:08,394 --> 00:40:10,639
Oh, we're out of coffee.

530
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,793
I'll go buy some.

531
00:40:13,793 --> 00:40:14,586
You don't have to go anywhere.

532
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:15,528
I have it here.

533
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:16,896
What?

534
00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:24,198
What? You've had this since the park?

535
00:40:24,198 --> 00:40:26,595
You know how upset I was!

536
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:27,663
Dummy...

537
00:40:27,663 --> 00:40:29,743
If you couldn't find it by scent,
you could've found it with your eyes!

538
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:31,671
It was right in front of you.

539
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:34,137
That's because I was disturbed!

540
00:40:34,137 --> 00:40:36,200
So mean!

541
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:40,636
Why? Does it hurt?

542
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:44,362
I said I'll regain my senses once
your memory comes back!

543
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:46,123
Seriously!

544
00:40:46,123 --> 00:40:48,795
Why would you joke about that?

545
00:40:51,196 --> 00:40:52,453
Yes, Lieutenant!

546
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:55,297
Cho-rim's classmates will have a reunion
at a Chinese restaurant tomorrow.

547
00:40:55,297 --> 00:40:57,535
I'll send you the time and place.

548
00:40:57,535 --> 00:40:58,868
Yes, ma'am.

549
00:40:58,868 --> 00:41:00,406
How should we protect her?

550
00:41:00,406 --> 00:41:01,637
Should I do it alone?

551
00:41:01,637 --> 00:41:03,764
It's a big space, so I'll be there too.

552
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:05,381
Yes, ma'am.

553
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:08,153
Also, may I speak to Cho-rim?

554
00:41:08,153 --> 00:41:10,316
Cho-rim?

555
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:11,614
Sure.

556
00:41:11,614 --> 00:41:12,801
Here you go.

557
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:16,142
Hello, Lieutenant?

558
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:18,166
Are you free right now?

559
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:19,880
I'd like to go somewhere with you.

560
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,628
Right now?

561
00:41:22,628 --> 00:41:25,337
Sure... Okay.

562
00:41:31,134 --> 00:41:32,610
You haven't seen your friends in a long time!

563
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,945
You should dress up for the occasion.

564
00:41:34,945 --> 00:41:37,401
Pick whatever you want.

565
00:41:39,145 --> 00:41:42,175
I'm buying you this so you can
meet them in a good mood.

566
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,218
So that I can get my memory
back more quickly?

567
00:41:48,152 --> 00:41:49,855
That'd be nice, too.

568
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:58,515
How about this one?

569
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:00,166
I think it looks good on you.

570
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:03,931
I like it, too.

571
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:05,834
We'll take this.

572
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:06,936
Sure.

573
00:42:08,082 --> 00:42:09,101
Thank you.

574
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:10,943
I'm going to pay for it.

575
00:42:16,729 --> 00:42:20,086
Thank you so much for paying
attention to every detail.

576
00:42:20,086 --> 00:42:22,973
I'm doing it because I want to.

577
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,478
But why are we here?

578
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:27,954
May I look around for a bit?

579
00:42:34,038 --> 00:42:45,763
With this freesia scent that you use often,
I'll mix in the rose scent that I like...

580
00:42:46,086 --> 00:42:51,008
And since it'll be summer soon,
I'll add some ocean scent for uniqueness.

581
00:42:53,317 --> 00:42:55,891
What do you think?

582
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:12,791
They scents are all pretty and look as
though they go well together.

583
00:43:14,684 --> 00:43:17,422
And they smell great, too.

584
00:43:28,302 --> 00:43:31,883
I'm not sure if I can accept this.

585
00:43:31,883 --> 00:43:34,293
I'm doing it because I want to.

586
00:43:34,293 --> 00:43:36,094
Thank you.

587
00:43:42,357 --> 00:43:45,265
Oh, hello!

588
00:43:45,265 --> 00:43:47,199
Hello.

589
00:43:50,198 --> 00:43:52,326
This is Kwon Jae-hee's file from America.

590
00:43:52,326 --> 00:43:55,882
How did you manage to get this,
Detective Choi?

591
00:43:55,882 --> 00:43:58,946
I was curious to see what
kind of person he is.

592
00:43:58,946 --> 00:44:02,505
We got this through a person
Lt. Yeom knows.

593
00:44:03,428 --> 00:44:07,693
Kwon Jae-hee. His American
name is Jay Kwon Ford.

594
00:44:07,693 --> 00:44:09,822
He is a dropout of Harvard Medical School.

595
00:44:09,822 --> 00:44:11,460
Harvard Medical School?

596
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,447
One of the best medical schools in the world?

597
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:21,968
Looking at how the barcodes were done,
no wonder they were so meticulous!

598
00:44:21,968 --> 00:44:27,040
Kwon Jae-hee was a very quiet student.
He also had a part-time job.

599
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,674
He worked at a Japanese sushi restaurant.

600
00:44:30,674 --> 00:44:36,956
And he showed exceptional skill
in anesthesia class.

601
00:44:36,956 --> 00:44:38,925
Anesthesia...

602
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:44,260
The reason of death for all victims
so far has been suffocation.

603
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,761
That's right.

604
00:44:47,303 --> 00:44:49,694
Why did he drop out?

605
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:52,505
I don't know the exact reason...

606
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:58,300
But in America, all medical students
are subject to a psychological test.

607
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,369
He dropped out right after that test.

608
00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:05,944
I assume he was declared
unfit to be a doctor.

609
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:09,539
Then why did he become a chef?

610
00:45:11,027 --> 00:45:16,455
Because it's an occupation that
allows him to kill living things legally.

611
00:45:16,455 --> 00:45:20,795
I think it was hard for him to
suppress his urge to kill.

612
00:45:20,795 --> 00:45:27,240
So I assume he felt conflicted
by the life-saving nature of doctors.

613
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,722
Kwon Jae-hee assigns a particular
meaning to his murders.

614
00:45:30,722 --> 00:45:35,781
The fact that he kills after six days
of kidnapping shows it.

615
00:45:35,781 --> 00:45:39,784
The reason he kills is
most likely from those six days.

616
00:45:39,784 --> 00:45:42,591
So we must find out
what happens in those six days.

617
00:45:42,591 --> 00:45:45,001
That'll finish Kwon Jae-hee.

618
00:45:49,189 --> 00:45:50,563
Detective Choi.

619
00:45:50,563 --> 00:45:53,752
We must leave for Cho-rim's reunion.

620
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:55,833
Yes, ma'am.

621
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:06,979
Wait in the lobby.

622
00:46:06,979 --> 00:46:08,573
I'll park then come up.

623
00:46:08,573 --> 00:46:10,186
Okay.

624
00:46:13,595 --> 00:46:15,927
I didn't feel this when I was home...

625
00:46:15,927 --> 00:46:18,681
But now that I'm here, I'm very nervous.

626
00:46:18,681 --> 00:46:22,470
They're your high school friends,
so there's nothing to be worried about.

627
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:25,152
Relax. Let's go in.

628
00:46:25,152 --> 00:46:26,630
Okay.

629
00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:44,241
[Bamboo Room]

630
00:46:53,859 --> 00:46:55,217
[Chrysanthemum Room]

631
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:43,404
Sirs, have you eaten?

632
00:47:43,404 --> 00:47:48,117
Shall we go eat after taking a bath?

633
00:47:55,382 --> 00:47:56,998
Nothing suspicious here.

634
00:47:58,496 --> 00:48:00,777
It's the corner room. Shall we go in?

635
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:01,632
Okay.

636
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:04,463
Good luck. I'll stay out here.

637
00:48:04,463 --> 00:48:06,552
Okay.

638
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:14,079
Choi Eun-seol!

639
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,935
Welcome, Eun-seol!

640
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,514
It's so good to see you!

641
00:48:18,514 --> 00:48:21,280
How have you been?

642
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,141
Hello, everyone.

643
00:48:24,141 --> 00:48:26,123
It's really you, Eun-seol!

644
00:48:26,123 --> 00:48:27,625
I'm so glad to see you!

645
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:30,193
Good to see you, Eun-seol!

646
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:40,433
You started already.

647
00:48:40,433 --> 00:48:43,742
I wanted us to alternate just in case.

648
00:48:43,742 --> 00:48:44,737
I'm sorry.

649
00:48:44,737 --> 00:48:45,444
Why don't you order?

650
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:48,168
Order me the same thing.

651
00:48:48,168 --> 00:48:50,464
One more black-bean noodle, sir!

652
00:48:50,464 --> 00:48:51,223
Okay!

653
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,312
It's me, Detective Ki.

654
00:48:59,072 --> 00:49:02,897
Kwon Jae-hee hasn't made any movement yet.

655
00:49:02,897 --> 00:49:05,042
You're sure, right?

656
00:49:06,461 --> 00:49:11,953
Yes, we stayed up all night
watching his house.

657
00:49:11,953 --> 00:49:12,953
If you notice anything, report it to me

658
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:15,400
as soon as possible and
call for the reinforcement team.

659
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,242
Yes, ma'am.

660
00:49:17,242 --> 00:49:18,892
Seriously!

661
00:49:26,316 --> 00:49:27,779
No movement from Kwon Jae-hee.

662
00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:30,772
I wonder what he's doing in his house.

663
00:49:30,772 --> 00:49:32,810
So good to see you!

664
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:35,289
How nice to see you, Eun-seol.

665
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:37,409
It's so good to see you too!

666
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:39,718
Eun-seol, it's awkward, isn't it?

667
00:49:39,718 --> 00:49:43,097
I heard that you can't remember
anything prior to your accident.

668
00:49:43,097 --> 00:49:46,153
We all understand, so feel comfortable!

669
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:48,091
Thank you for understanding.

670
00:49:48,091 --> 00:49:51,945
Honestly, I don't remember any of your faces.

671
00:49:51,945 --> 00:49:53,074
So what?

672
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:56,442
You can remember us from now on!

673
00:49:56,442 --> 00:49:59,408
She can't remember?

674
00:50:00,905 --> 00:50:03,269
I used to be your best friend!

675
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:06,473
My name is Yoon Mi-na!

676
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:08,829
Yoon Mi-na?

677
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:13,704
Her voice sounds familiar...

678
00:50:13,704 --> 00:50:16,952
Eun-seol!

679
00:50:16,952 --> 00:50:19,158
It really is you, Eun-seol!

680
00:50:19,158 --> 00:50:19,966
Seo-yoon.

681
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:20,737
Jo Seo-yoon...

682
00:50:20,737 --> 00:50:22,969
She was friends with everyone at school!

683
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:24,737
Good to see you, Seo-yoon.

684
00:50:24,737 --> 00:50:27,778
I saw you on TV! "Golden Recipe"!

685
00:50:27,778 --> 00:50:30,131
You were there with Chef Kwon Jae-hee!

686
00:50:30,131 --> 00:50:31,745
I saw that you changed your name, too!

687
00:50:31,745 --> 00:50:33,216
To Oh Cho-rim!

688
00:50:33,216 --> 00:50:34,305
Is that your stage name?

689
00:50:34,305 --> 00:50:36,085
But why Oh Cho-rim?

690
00:50:36,085 --> 00:50:39,082
Why did you change your name?

691
00:50:40,923 --> 00:50:43,352
Mr. Chef!

692
00:50:43,352 --> 00:50:44,423
I'm sorry, Cho-rim.

693
00:50:44,423 --> 00:50:47,099
I was lost in my thoughts.

694
00:51:01,274 --> 00:51:06,483
They're so loud!
This whole building might explode!

695
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:11,020
I thought I was in a girls'
high school classroom.

696
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,718
Where is your car?

697
00:51:12,718 --> 00:51:14,987
In the second floor basement,
right in front of the door.

698
00:51:14,987 --> 00:51:15,776
I'll be there.

699
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:18,934
I'll bring Cho-rim down
once they say goodbye.

700
00:51:42,174 --> 00:51:43,188
I'm serious!

701
00:51:43,188 --> 00:51:52,147
A kind-looking man bought us food
and these clothes!

702
00:51:52,147 --> 00:51:54,193
I'm telling you the truth!

703
00:51:54,193 --> 00:51:57,659
These are the leftovers from what we had!

704
00:51:57,659 --> 00:51:59,034
Keep in touch!

705
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:00,992
We'll meet again!

706
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,703
- Let's plan our trip, too!
- Okay!

707
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,972
Goodbye! Send us the picture!

708
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:16,404
Did he go to the car already?

709
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,007
Choi Eun-seol.

710
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,088
Should I call you Choi Eun-seol?

711
00:55:01,088 --> 00:55:03,942
Or Oh Cho-rim?

712
00:55:03,942 --> 00:55:06,975
Which one do you prefer?

713
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:12,956
You can call me Lt. Yeom.

714
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:02,263
Why did Lt. Yeom get kidnapped?

715
00:56:02,263 --> 00:56:05,508
Why did Kwon Jae-hee kidnap her?

716
00:56:05,508 --> 00:56:08,656
Why did Kwon Jae-hee kidnap Lt. Yeom?

717
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:13,760
Lt. Yeom was wearing the same clothes as you.

718
00:56:20,326 --> 00:56:24,098
Oh, you're the exact same
clothes as Oh Cho-rim.

719
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:27,215
You never know.

720
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:31,401
So you're thinking that
Kwon Jae-hee won't recognize you

721
00:56:31,401 --> 00:56:35,960
if you have the same clothes
and similar hairstyle as Cho-rim?

722
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:40,501
We'll be able to get him when he's confused.

723
00:56:41,667 --> 00:56:44,889
Does Cho-rim know that
you're wearing the same clothes?

724
00:56:44,889 --> 00:56:46,466
She doesn't.

725
00:56:46,466 --> 00:56:50,419
Women don't like to wear the same clothes.

726
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:57,336
Then, she got kidnapped because of me!

727
00:56:57,336 --> 00:56:58,657
Then what if...

728
00:56:58,657 --> 00:57:01,014
What if something happens to her?

729
00:57:01,014 --> 00:57:03,374
No one is going to get hurt.

730
00:57:03,374 --> 00:57:06,042
I'm going to kill Kwon Jae-hee right now.

731
00:57:06,906 --> 00:57:08,870
What do we do?

732
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:10,732
She can't be hurt because of me.

733
00:57:10,732 --> 00:57:12,666
She can't be!

734
00:57:29,759 --> 00:57:32,203
Wait here. Whatever you do, don't go inside.

735
00:57:51,421 --> 00:57:55,121
What are you doing right now?

736
00:58:07,795 --> 00:58:11,136
Where is Lt. Yeom?

737
00:58:12,138 --> 00:58:15,710
I guess she's gone missing.

738
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:19,518
You little brat, say it, where is she?
