1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,603
When we horizontally flipped
the barcodes of the victims' bodies,

2
00:00:10,603 --> 00:00:14,605
we realized they're mimicking actual
barcodes that are usable in real life.

3
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:17,979
There are 13 numbers in a barcode.

4
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:22,336
All these barcodes begin with 978,
which is used for books.

5
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:25,179
89, which comes next, means
the Republic of Korea.

6
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:28,660
After that, 86755 denotes
the publishing company.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,648
So all these 5 barcodes are
describing books from

8
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:36,628
a single publisher in South Korea.

9
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:42,267
ISBN stands for International
Standard Book Number.

10
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,837
They denote the order of
publication of these books.

11
00:00:52,837 --> 00:00:59,700
That order of publication is matching
the order of the murders.

12
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:05,852
The murderer is presenting
the victims as books.

13
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:09,774
The next victim, if there is one,
will have this barcode.

14
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:11,103
978...

15
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,640
89...

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,059
86755...

17
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:26,566
Then 06 to denote the sixth victim...
[Chun Baek-gyung]

18
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:33,395
If this barcode is real,
the last check digit will be 0.

19
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,502
There's something that upsets me.

20
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:55,669
The real ISBNs don't start from 1, but 0.

21
00:01:55,669 --> 00:02:01,180
So you're saying the first murder
should've been 0, not 1?

22
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,307
So you're saying that the first murder
happened five years ago,

23
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:07,419
not four years ago.

24
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,489
I wonder what kind of monster he is.

25
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,458
My guess is the murderer is
highly educated with

26
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:15,088
a high level of self-discipline.

27
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:18,138
Seeing how he dominated the victims
and carried their bodies,

28
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,647
he is probably well-built and strong.

29
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:22,901
Looking at the way he left the barcodes,

30
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:27,154
I think he's a smart-looking guy
who's quite neat.

31
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:30,304
I really want to see this jerk's face!

32
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:32,811
Could he work in the publishing industry?

33
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:36,234
Let's check the publishing company
that's represented in those barcodes.

34
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,931
Hello, Mr. Chef.

35
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:13,311
This is Manager Hong.

36
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:17,244
They're here right at the
designated time you wanted.

37
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:19,464
Yes, I'll go inside then.

38
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:20,679
Okay.

39
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:22,782
Let's go inside.

40
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:32,693
Since you're standing next to
our cabinet "Kitchen d'Or,"

41
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:37,709
so many housewives' hearts will melt!

42
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,605
I really ask for good reviews from you.

43
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:44,319
I always try to be as honest as possible
when it comes to my reviews.

44
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,489
Yes...

45
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,314
Of course...

46
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:53,367
I'm afraid I have to run to a meeting
for a TV show now, Ms. Hong...

47
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:59,431
Then we'll take your oven, cabinets,
kitchen island, and sink right now...

48
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:05,571
and we'll install everything tomorrow
with our brand new items!

49
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:07,827
Please start.

50
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,608
Geez, no!

51
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:17,449
Don't you know how much
this crystal decanter is?

52
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:20,119
You should've been more careful!
What will you do now?

53
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:22,208
I'm sorry, ma'am.

54
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,623
I'm sorry, Mr. Chef.

55
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:37,594
I think you should
let them go home for today.

56
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:41,763
I'd like to have a group of professionals
take care of this tomorrow.

57
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:42,560
I see.

58
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,343
I'll tell them to leave.

59
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:47,055
Thanks.

60
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:52,336
So I looked into the publisher
that's represented in the barcodes...

61
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:54,199
It was a publishing company called
Friday, Saturday and Sunday Publishing.

62
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,785
It was in operation from 1993 to 2000.

63
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:00,598
It folded in 2000?

64
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:03,521
What kind of books did they publish?

65
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:05,497
They published everything
that would make them money,

66
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:10,997
such as kids, health, cooking,
world literature, travel...

67
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:12,373
Sex life guides for married couples...

68
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:13,909
Sex education textbooks...

69
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:14,907
Botany, the game of Go...

70
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:16,072
It's very diverse!

71
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:17,976
Obviously it doesn't exist
anymore. Do you think

72
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:21,806
the murderer would start a publishing company
to leave a trace of the murders?

73
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:24,583
Look into the person who started
that publishing company.

74
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,224
Yes, ma'am.

75
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:32,015
So far the only things the murderer
left behind were the corpses.

76
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:37,953
But there was another thing that
he left behind with Joo Ma-ri.

77
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,459
It's her car.

78
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,770
That was his big mistake.

79
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,274
He left the car that allows us
to track down his route.

80
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:56,206
The most urgent thing right now is to
figure out how that car got there.

81
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:08,360
I'm feeling down from
all these weird theories...

82
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,817
Let's go out for some barbecue tonight!

83
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:13,854
Barbecue sounds great!

84
00:06:13,854 --> 00:06:19,972
If I go home right now and sleep,
I'll see barcodes in my nightmares!

85
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:23,338
But where is Lieutenant Yeom?
Has she left already?

86
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:26,873
I'm sorry, but I have to leave early
tonight. I have to run some errands.

87
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,554
Why? You don't like barbecue?

88
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:31,254
If you don't like it,
we can go somewhere else!

89
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:32,317
Let's go somewhere else!

90
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:33,140
Sir!

91
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,885
What?

92
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:37,637
I think you've been favoring
Moo-gak too much lately!

93
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:39,886
What did you say?

94
00:06:39,886 --> 00:06:42,119
That's not it. I'm sorry.

95
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:45,077
Okay, go ahead.

96
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,536
I do like barbecue.

97
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:51,159
Do you know how superheroes work out?

98
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,065
Are you guys curious?

99
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:52,805
Yes!

100
00:06:52,805 --> 00:06:55,649
Then let's take a look immediately!

101
00:06:57,576 --> 00:07:00,412
I'm Batman! I clap hard!

102
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:03,896
I'm Superman! I slap my back!

103
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:05,738
I'm Spider-Man.

104
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:07,609
I hang onto buildings!

105
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,833
Geez, it's a nail.

106
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:40,130
Even Spider-Man falls from
a building sometimes!

107
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:46,219
Sometimes his spider web doesn't work!

108
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:55,232
Hey, Oh Cho-rim...

109
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:56,551
In-bae...

110
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:59,071
Hey!

111
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:02,250
Have you decided to ruin my show
because you can't be in it?

112
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,812
That's not it, In-bae.

113
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:04,710
Then why?

114
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,219
Are you mad because someone younger
does it better than you?

115
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:11,657
If you can't do this, look for other jobs!

116
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,953
Why are you letting out your jealousy here?

117
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:20,099
I'm not jealous.

118
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,828
And I won't look for other jobs.

119
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:25,518
I'll work even harder to
get on stage next time.

120
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:31,667
Hey. Before worrying about your future,
worry about your current job first!

121
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,659
Officer Choi.

122
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:53,311
I heard you weren't doing skits anymore.
What brings you here then?

123
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:55,127
What do you mean?

124
00:08:55,127 --> 00:09:00,185
Oh Cho-rim said you can't do the skits
anymore due to personal reasons.

125
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:02,092
I don't know what kind of trouble
you're dealing with...

126
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:06,804
but back in the day, my brother lost
our family fortune to a scam.

127
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:09,813
Even then, I still put a flower on my head
and did a show about a madman.

128
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:12,445
That's the life of a comedian.

129
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:15,883
I'm disappointed in you, Officer Choi.

130
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,410
You should've just helped her out.

131
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,217
He told Cho-rim that she would
only be able to go on stage

132
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:27,301
if she does a skit with you.

133
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:32,750
That's why she's now on the support team
instead of the performance team!

134
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:39,938
Thank you so much!

135
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:42,495
They're very hard to get. Thank you.

136
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:45,045
But getting costumes is the
job of the support team.

137
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:47,006
Why are you doing this?

138
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:49,342
I'm just helping out.

139
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:51,877
Aren't we going to work on our skit?

140
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:55,087
You don't have to worry
about it for a while.

141
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:15,767
Hello?

142
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:17,267
One or two.

143
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,984
Pick a number.

144
00:10:18,984 --> 00:10:22,407
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

145
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:23,573
One.

146
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:25,982
One is spicy pork hock.

147
00:10:25,982 --> 00:10:26,990
Let's go eat.

148
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,657
You don't even know where I am right now.

149
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:33,917
Do you trip even when you walk by yourself?

150
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:44,473
Officer Choi...

151
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:47,102
Get in.

152
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:56,648
I suddenly got a craving for food,
but it's awkward to eat by myself.

153
00:10:56,648 --> 00:11:01,180
How does super spicy pork hock sound?

154
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,071
This is the first time I'm hearing you
talk about something I love.

155
00:11:07,038 --> 00:11:08,261
Okay.

156
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:26,378
This is really spicy!

157
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:33,926
This is so spicy it's making me cry!
Right?

158
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,773
Amazing!

159
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,905
Why? What's the matter?

160
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:57,435

So if option one was this,
what was option two?

Spicy pork hock.

Why did you tell your boss that
I can't do the skits anymore?

187
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:28,688
That's because I think

you're not in the situation to afford
to make others laugh.

Instead, make sure your skit is hilarious.

195
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:18,710
Is that because you ate something spicy?

When people lie,
their body temperature increases,

00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:51,296
So you really were in Incheon yesterday!

325
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:52,828
A sure alibi, don't you think?

326
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:55,567
Yes, it shows the time
she posted these pictures.

327
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,419
It's a certain piece of evidence.

328
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:58,269
Hey, Ma Ae-ri.

329
00:27:58,269 --> 00:27:59,630
Where is my money?

330
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,534
Where did you hide my money?

331
00:28:01,534 --> 00:28:05,528
Wow... You people
shouldn't treat me like this.

332
00:28:05,528 --> 00:28:10,935
I may have been poor, but I never thought
about stealing from others!

333
00:28:10,935 --> 00:28:12,467
Why are you doing this to me?

334
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:14,787
I didn't do anything wrong!

335
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,099
Ae-ri...

336
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:22,151
Well, the report has been filed.

337
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:23,658
You can go home now.

338
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,780
Ms. Ma, don't go anywhere far.

339
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,859
Make sure you pick up all incoming calls.

340
00:28:31,575 --> 00:28:32,651
Go home.

341
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:41,455
Hey... Look into my eyes when you talk.

342
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,901
You...

343
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:51,087
That girl is pushing hard with her
photos on social networking sites!

344
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:52,157
What will you do now?

345
00:28:52,157 --> 00:28:54,755
That's why I'm going crazy!

346
00:28:54,755 --> 00:28:57,818
She posted everything about
yesterday on her account!

347
00:28:57,818 --> 00:29:01,168
What she ate, where she went...

348
00:29:01,168 --> 00:29:05,095
So everyone is believing her and not me,
including the police officers!

349
00:29:05,095 --> 00:29:06,430
This is so unfair.

350
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,908
What's that girl's account ID?

351
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:14,871
Here...

352
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:26,111
Her alibi is solid.

353
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,592
In a case like this where
there's no direct evidence,

354
00:29:31,592 --> 00:29:35,276
she might be found guilty based on
circumstantial evidence like an alibi.

355
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:36,695
I'm pretty sure this girl's lying.

356
00:29:36,695 --> 00:29:37,882
What can I do?

357
00:29:37,882 --> 00:29:40,130
You must break her alibi.

358
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,799
You must prove her alibi is fabricated.

359
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,972
Officer Choi, you believe me, right?

360
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:52,783
Mr. Detective...

361
00:29:54,052 --> 00:29:55,192
I'm sorry...

362
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:56,697
These just popped out of my pocket...

363
00:29:56,979 --> 00:29:59,428
Of course I believe you.

364
00:29:59,428 --> 00:30:01,767
I'll break Myung-ok's alibi!

365
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:04,404
How in the world are you going to do that?

366
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:06,954
I must ask the police.

367
00:30:14,907 --> 00:30:18,143
Well, I'm quite busy with other cases...

368
00:30:30,854 --> 00:30:32,660
This is the place.

369
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,473
Come here.

370
00:30:34,952 --> 00:30:36,728
One, two, three!

371
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:47,029
We'll be able to find an error in her alibi
by comparing our pictures to hers!

372
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:48,914
I think these pictures look different.

373
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:50,136
This should be in the center.

374
00:30:50,136 --> 00:30:52,544
It's more on the left side in your picture.

375
00:30:52,544 --> 00:30:54,137
This is similar enough.

376
00:30:54,137 --> 00:30:55,839
As long as we know where it is...

377
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,889
They must be identical!

378
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,958
We're conducting an on-the-spot inspection.

379
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:09,824
So it took us five minutes to get here.

380
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,465
The timestamp matches.

381
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:15,188
Come closer.

382
00:31:15,556 --> 00:31:17,000
Do we have to do this?

383
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,687
They must be identical if we're going
forward with this as evidence!

384
00:31:19,687 --> 00:31:21,381
Lift your right leg.

385
00:31:23,957 --> 00:31:25,778
I said, lift your right leg!

386
00:31:25,778 --> 00:31:26,896
Yes, ma'am.

387
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:32,823
One, two, three...

388
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:45,464
Can we also order 2 bowls of spicy
noodles and 3 plates of fried rice?

389
00:31:45,464 --> 00:31:46,261
No, we won't order them.

390
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:47,213
I'm sorry.

391
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:48,222
Okay.

392
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:50,773
What is wrong with you?

393
00:31:50,773 --> 00:31:52,471
We're not here to eat and party.

394
00:31:52,471 --> 00:31:55,932
We're here for an on-the-spot inspection.

395
00:31:56,316 --> 00:31:58,175
Please refrain from any activities
that differ from her alibi.

396
00:31:58,175 --> 00:31:59,872
There are only two bowls here!

397
00:32:01,734 --> 00:32:03,081
Seriously...

398
00:32:14,562 --> 00:32:16,819
Bathroom...

399
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:19,610
I don't see a picture of them
going to the bathroom.

400
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,112
Please refrain from any activities
that differ from her alibi.

401
00:32:22,112 --> 00:32:24,299
I'm sure Myung-ok went to the bathroom, too.

402
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:25,948
She didn't.

403
00:32:25,948 --> 00:32:27,318
Look.

404
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:31,443
The time they spent going
here to there is very short.

405
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:34,232
Come.

406
00:32:35,198 --> 00:32:35,974
I have to go...

407
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:42,149
Hold that... Let's take it.

408
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:44,291
One, two, three!

409
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:07,377
One, two, three!

410
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:25,340
The times and places of these
pictures match pretty well...

411
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,049
This means her alibi works.

412
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,859
She is definitely lying!

413
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:36,679
Let's go back and ask the policemen
in charge of this to reinvestigate.

414
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:39,105
As for Ae-ri...

415
00:33:39,105 --> 00:33:43,515
In high school, she was the only friend
who stood by my side

416
00:33:43,515 --> 00:33:49,833
when all the other kids made
fun of my monster-like eye.

417
00:33:50,526 --> 00:33:53,198
I really want to help her now.

418
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:04,208
Let's look at the next picture...

419
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:13,777
What's the next picture?

420
00:34:13,777 --> 00:34:15,147
Never mind.

421
00:34:15,147 --> 00:34:18,484
What are you talking about? We have to do
what they did. What's the picture?

422
00:34:18,484 --> 00:34:20,181
I said never mind!

423
00:34:22,263 --> 00:34:24,149
I'll check it myself.

424
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:31,356
The scenery is so nice.

425
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,465
Why aren't we doing this picture?

426
00:34:40,465 --> 00:34:43,673
We must be identical with everything!
We can't be selective!

427
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:46,454
Fine, let's do it then.

428
00:34:46,454 --> 00:34:48,118
Do it?

429
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:49,589
Let's do it.

430
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:54,012
I'm really going to do it.

431
00:34:57,919 --> 00:35:01,548
What? Are you scared now?
Then you can jump off this cart!

432
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:03,770
No one is scared!

433
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,253
Let's do it!

434
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:06,365
Do it, then!

435
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,333
Here we go!

436
00:35:32,858 --> 00:35:36,594
That was only for a scene reenactment.

437
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:40,776
Of course. It was only for
a scene reenactment.

438
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:43,168
It certainly was a scene reenactment.

439
00:35:56,144 --> 00:35:57,631
This curry place is the last place.

440
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:59,225
But I can't find it.

441
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:01,842
I'm certain it should be here.

442
00:36:02,608 --> 00:36:03,655
Let's go around the block.

443
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:05,257
Let me check the time.

444
00:36:12,858 --> 00:36:14,767
It's so strange.

445
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:17,669
We're back here and
we haven't seen a single curry place.

446
00:36:17,669 --> 00:36:20,335
Maybe it wasn't in this direction.

447
00:36:20,335 --> 00:36:22,561
Should we go in the opposite direction?

448
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:27,900
I think it's a scrape.

449
00:36:30,582 --> 00:36:34,881
Why did you put on those heels
for an on-the-spot inspection?

450
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:37,749
I didn't know it'd be like this.

451
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,077
Let's change them.

452
00:36:39,077 --> 00:36:41,096
Excuse me?

453
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:46,131
Do you really think you can wear my heels?

454
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:53,138
I meant changing them here.

455
00:36:53,138 --> 00:36:54,506
Right. Of course.

456
00:36:59,788 --> 00:37:05,374
You should ask your boyfriend what he likes.

457
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:07,645
He's not my boyfriend.

458
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:12,110
We'll look around.

459
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,870
The scent of curry!

460
00:37:30,614 --> 00:37:32,150
The scent of curry?

461
00:37:32,873 --> 00:37:35,885
The walls of this shoe store
have a strong curry scent.

462
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:38,376
The shoes and employees in
this store don't smell like curry.

463
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:40,085
Only the walls smell like curry.

464
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:41,844
When did you open this store?

465
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:45,290
It's been a week.

466
00:37:46,592 --> 00:37:50,060
So I assume it was a curry
restaurant until a week ago.

467
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,864
That's right.

468
00:37:51,864 --> 00:37:56,127
My brother ran a curry restaurant here,
but he suddenly had to go abroad.

469
00:37:56,127 --> 00:37:59,799
So I took over the lease
and opened a shoe store.

470
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:02,261
Do you have pictures of the curry restaurant?

471
00:38:02,261 --> 00:38:03,760
Of course I do.

472
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:07,539
Here.

473
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:15,419
We've found the error in her alibi.

474
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,580
You'll be able to save your friend.

475
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:30,685
You can check this out.

476
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,107
The curry restaurant you supposedly
visited yesterday closed a week ago.

477
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,608
It's a shoe store now.

478
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:42,481
How did you eat curry at a shoe store?

479
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:45,042
Please note that a giving a false
testimony is its own crime.

480
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:47,881
Where's the stolen money?

481
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,435
I'm sorry...

482
00:38:50,435 --> 00:38:52,699
I did steal it.

483
00:38:56,727 --> 00:39:00,529
Ms. Song Myung-ok, you're
under arrest for larceny.

484
00:39:02,276 --> 00:39:05,881
The rest of you, please come this way.

485
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,111
I'm so sorry, Ae-ri.

486
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:17,503
Forget it. I've fired you already.

487
00:39:17,503 --> 00:39:23,188
You won't be seeing me starting tomorrow.
Don't doubt your employees that easily.

488
00:39:23,188 --> 00:39:28,701
And if you want your restaurant to do well,
spend more time there!

489
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:29,850
Don't touch me.

490
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,203
I've been saving these gift certificates.

491
00:39:36,203 --> 00:39:39,856
I got them when I worked at a barbecue place.

492
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:41,369
Two gift certificates.

493
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:43,020
Thank you so much.

494
00:39:45,736 --> 00:39:46,977
Come with us.

495
00:39:46,977 --> 00:39:48,137
I can't.

496
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:53,683
Now that I've fired that boss,
I need to go find another boss.

497
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:56,854
Goodbye!

498
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,468
You want to go eat barbecue?

499
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:05,331
Only if you eat five boiled eggs
before digging into the meat!

500
00:40:05,331 --> 00:40:06,868
Got it?

501
00:40:12,147 --> 00:40:13,864
Are five eggs too many?

502
00:40:13,864 --> 00:40:15,481
I can cut them in half.

503
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:16,975
Tell me.

504
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:24,517
3283...

505
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:28,473
That's Chun Baek-gyung's car...

506
00:40:59,588 --> 00:41:01,235
Chun Baek-gyung...

507
00:41:26,044 --> 00:41:28,940
Don't look. Turn around!

508
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,555
Chun Baek-gyung...

509
00:41:36,555 --> 00:41:38,685
You can't die...

510
00:41:38,685 --> 00:41:41,616
You can't just die after killing my sister!

511
00:41:42,986 --> 00:41:44,984
No, you've killed so many people.

512
00:41:44,984 --> 00:41:46,002
You can't just die like this.

513
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:48,536
Wake up...

514
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:49,372
Open your eyes immediately!

515
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:51,003
If someone has to kill you, it will be me.

516
00:41:51,003 --> 00:41:53,064
So open your eyes!

517
00:41:53,064 --> 00:41:55,107
Chun Baek-gyung...

518
00:41:55,107 --> 00:41:57,776
He's the serial killer?

519
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,133
Hey!

520
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:25,678
There was a strong scent of alcohol
when I opened the car door.

521
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,377
I've secured surveillance video footage of
the police station starting this morning.

522
00:42:32,377 --> 00:42:35,780
I've confirmed this car belongs to
Chun Baek-gyung.

523
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:39,818
If he wanted to turn himself in,
he could've done it alive!

524
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:43,445
He probably couldn't handle the
pressure of the ongoing investigation...

525
00:42:43,445 --> 00:42:46,492
So he took his own life in the
garage of the police station.

526
00:42:46,492 --> 00:42:49,395
No, I don't think it was a suicide.

527
00:42:49,395 --> 00:42:54,016
He's standing very upright,
in the back seat of the car he owns.

528
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:56,940
That means someone else drove him here.

529
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,843
There's a barcode on his arm!

530
00:43:13,086 --> 00:43:15,808
Analyze the barcode and
find out if that's real.

531
00:43:15,808 --> 00:43:16,588
Yes, ma'am.

532
00:43:17,051 --> 00:43:19,480
I'll try to find fingerprints, footprints,

533
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,286
and hair left inside of the
car to find the driver.

534
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:26,641
Please don't miss anything when
inspecting the car's exterior.

535
00:43:26,641 --> 00:43:27,487
Yes, sir.

536
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:33,605
It appears our suspect has become a victim.

537
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:50,687
Your sister was killed by the chain murderer?

538
00:43:58,323 --> 00:44:03,535
I don't know if I can be of any help...

539
00:44:03,535 --> 00:44:11,076
I'll take a look at Dr. Chun to see
what kind of scent is still there.

540
00:44:12,954 --> 00:44:14,674
You don't have to do it.

541
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:17,510
I'll be okay. I can do it.

542
00:44:33,906 --> 00:44:35,742
The scent of alcohol...

543
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:40,100
and another scent is all over his body.

544
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,145
What kind of scent is that?

545
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,784
I don't know.

546
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:47,035
I've never seen this scent before.

547
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:51,417
What could this scent be?

548
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:52,623
You've never seen it?

549
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:56,557
Yes, I've never seen this scent before.

550
00:45:07,532 --> 00:45:12,103
This is the footage of Chun Baek-gyung's
car coming into the police station.

551
00:45:12,103 --> 00:45:15,181
It was at 2:07 p.m.

552
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:20,979
And now his car is being
parked in the garage...

553
00:45:23,283 --> 00:45:30,118
This is the guy who ran away after
abandoning Chun Baek-gyung and his car here.

554
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:38,764
I got the ID of the driver by searching
for the fingerprints left in the car.

555
00:45:38,764 --> 00:45:39,798
Let's look.

556
00:45:44,837 --> 00:45:46,692
Park Seok-ki. Age 31.

557
00:45:46,692 --> 00:45:48,737
He has 2 criminal records of assault.

558
00:45:48,737 --> 00:45:56,951
So Park Seok-ki fled after abandoning Chun
Baek-gyung's body at the police station?

559
00:45:56,951 --> 00:45:59,158
Arrest him right now.

560
00:45:59,158 --> 00:46:00,812
Yes, sir.

561
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:13,156
Who is it?

562
00:46:13,156 --> 00:46:15,182
I'm here to get my dishes back!

563
00:46:15,182 --> 00:46:17,510
I never ordered takeout foods!

564
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:20,072
You're Park Seok-ki, right?

565
00:46:21,055 --> 00:46:24,546
Are you the police?

566
00:46:24,546 --> 00:46:26,026
Yes...

567
00:46:26,026 --> 00:46:27,673
Well...

568
00:46:29,168 --> 00:46:31,753
Detective Ki Choong-duk from
the southern precinct.

569
00:46:31,753 --> 00:46:37,736
I was told to deliver a car there
yesterday as a relief driver.

570
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:39,788
As a relief driver?

571
00:46:45,664 --> 00:46:51,360
So around 12:30 p.m. yesterday,
you got a call looking for a relief driver.

572
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,931
Then you left from here to the
police station around 1 p.m.

573
00:46:54,931 --> 00:46:56,026
Is that right?

574
00:46:56,026 --> 00:46:57,113
Yes.

575
00:46:57,113 --> 00:47:01,320
When I opened the door, he reeked of alcohol.
He was completely passed out!

576
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,214
Okay, thank you.

577
00:47:02,972 --> 00:47:07,311
The phone number used to call him was a fake.

578
00:47:07,311 --> 00:47:09,292
There's been no call record under
that number for three months...

579
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:13,561
Then it made that one call to him
and got disconnected.

580
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:14,960
Quite meticulously prepared.

581
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,072
We must find out what time that car got here.

582
00:47:20,593 --> 00:47:26,382
I think the lady at that store
might know that.

583
00:47:26,941 --> 00:47:29,232
Excuse me, ma'am!

584
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:32,883
Hello.

585
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:39,985
Did you see this car around here yesterday?

586
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:45,522
I think this car... was the
one blocking that sign.

587
00:47:45,522 --> 00:47:49,367
It was parked there since two nights ago.

588
00:47:53,306 --> 00:47:56,554
I walk through this spot when I go home.

589
00:47:56,554 --> 00:48:00,672
There was no car parked here
when I went home that night.

590
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:04,595
But when I got home, I realized that
I left my wallet at the store.

591
00:48:04,595 --> 00:48:07,905
So I went back to the store.

592
00:48:07,905 --> 00:48:11,047
On my way back to the store,
I saw the car parked right here.

593
00:48:11,047 --> 00:48:15,777
I remember because it was blocking
the sign to the fishing area.

594
00:48:16,779 --> 00:48:22,359
So what time did you see this car here?

595
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:24,782
I go home at 11 p.m. every night.

596
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:26,796
It takes exactly 30 minutes to my home.

597
00:48:26,796 --> 00:48:29,322
This spot is the halfway point of my walk...

598
00:48:29,322 --> 00:48:30,591
So the time would be...

599
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:36,508
You probably got home at 11:30, then it
took another 15 minutes to come back here...

600
00:48:36,508 --> 00:48:38,330
It was around 11:45 p.m.

601
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:40,432
I think so, too.

602
00:48:40,432 --> 00:48:47,698
So this car got here some time
between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m...

603
00:48:47,698 --> 00:48:51,853
Between 11 p.m. on Saturday and
12 a.m. on Sunday.

604
00:48:57,026 --> 00:48:58,216
[Temporarily Closed]

605
00:49:08,714 --> 00:49:13,879
A golden fish must meet a hermit.

606
00:49:13,879 --> 00:49:18,984
A golden fish must meet a hermit?

607
00:49:22,724 --> 00:49:25,034
Mr. Kwon?

608
00:49:25,468 --> 00:49:29,745
I'm very sorry about Dr. Chun.

609
00:49:32,134 --> 00:49:35,234
You can go home now. I'll finish up here.

610
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,922
Detective Choi.

611
00:49:52,922 --> 00:49:55,696
Right, Detective Choi.

612
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:59,010
I am here to ask you some questions.

613
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:03,323
Then I'll get going.

614
00:50:09,168 --> 00:50:10,706
Please sit down.

615
00:50:10,706 --> 00:50:12,104
You can ask me anything.

616
00:50:12,104 --> 00:50:15,225
Ask everything you're wondering about.

617
00:50:21,842 --> 00:50:27,389
Where were you on Saturday night,
between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m.?

618
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:34,851
Saturday night...
I was here at the restaurant.

619
00:50:34,851 --> 00:50:37,519
After 11 p.m.? That's rather late.

620
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,166
Yes, there was something I had to do
after all my employees had left.

621
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:44,037
I was here with my sous chef.

622
00:50:51,236 --> 00:50:55,452
On Saturday, I left work, went home,
cleaned my place, and then went to a sauna.

623
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:58,748
I came back to the restaurant at 11:50 p.m.

624
00:50:58,748 --> 00:51:02,457
I did look at my watch in the parking garage.

625
00:51:02,843 --> 00:51:05,242
'Mr. Kwon left early!'

626
00:51:05,242 --> 00:51:07,086
Where was Mr. Kwon at the moment?

627
00:51:07,086 --> 00:51:12,264
He left the garage to
go home and get some spices.

628
00:51:12,264 --> 00:51:13,519
Did you see him personally?

629
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:14,823
Of course.

630
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:18,100
I even talked to him on the phone.

631
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,770
When did Mr. Kwon come back?

632
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,574
12:30 a.m.

633
00:51:23,574 --> 00:51:26,122
So it took him 40 minutes, round-trip.

634
00:51:26,122 --> 00:51:28,013
Yes, it usually takes him longer.

635
00:51:28,013 --> 00:51:31,850
But it was late at night and
there was no traffic.

636
00:51:33,088 --> 00:51:35,243
What did you do after he came back?

637
00:51:35,243 --> 00:51:37,837
We worked on a secret recipe.

638
00:51:37,837 --> 00:51:41,696
We also practiced the dishes that
he'll demonstrate on a TV show.

639
00:51:41,696 --> 00:51:43,996
We were up all night.

640
00:51:43,996 --> 00:51:47,065
We pulled an all-nighter together.

641
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:53,649
We were taking a break when
Cho-rim came into work early.

642
00:51:53,649 --> 00:51:56,165
So we had coffee together.

643
00:51:57,943 --> 00:52:00,276
I see.

644
00:52:00,276 --> 00:52:03,755
Is there anything else you want to know?

645

No.

Forgive me for bothering you.

Are you saying that Mr. Kwon's
alibi is unbreakable?

648
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:31,129
Yes, if Dr. Chun's body was really
abandoned between 11 p.m. and 12 a.m.,

649
00:52:31,129 --> 00:52:32,955
Kwon Jae-hee's alibi is unbreakable.

650
00:52:32,955 --> 00:52:35,740
The time of the abandonment is
definitely between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m.

651
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:41,376
A fisherman just testified that not
a single car was there before 11 p.m.

652
00:52:41,376 --> 00:52:45,373
It was impossible for Mr. Kwon to be
at that fishing area at that moment.

I must go check the autopsy
report of Chun Baek-gyung.

Yes, I introduced that place to
Dr. Chun because I've used them before.
