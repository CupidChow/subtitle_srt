00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,902
Freeze.

3
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:37,496
Detective Choi,
how did you know this?

4
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:39,726
Be quiet.

5
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,524
Put down the bag
and get down on the floor.

6
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,459
Why don't you just let me go?

7
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:51,165
I'm warning you...

8
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:55,562
If you blab one more word,
you're dead.

9
00:01:57,809 --> 00:01:59,440
I guess that's not possible.

10
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,550
Because I killed your sister...

11
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:57,473
Put down the bag and
get down on the ground.

12
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,881
Detective Yeh freed Lt. Yeom
through the secret passage.

13
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:13,377
Yes. I sent an ambulance there.

14
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:17,322
No...

15
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:19,081
Don't touch it!

00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:25,068
Don't touch it!

19
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:26,550
Be quiet!

20
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,255
You seem wounded anyway.

21

Chun Baek-gyung...

22
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:35,716
Joo Ma-ri... Barcodes...

23
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:38,877
Don't touch it!

24
00:03:39,984 --> 00:03:41,220
Lieutenant!

25
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,806
What are we going to do with her?

26
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,957
We need to get her to
the hospital fast!

27
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:47,921
Lieutenant!

28
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:56,314
You must wake up, lieutenant!

29
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,370
Please go to the hospital with her, Cho-rim.

30
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,947
I'll stay here.

31
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,548
Yes.

32
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:10,806
Thank you.

33
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:14,075
Don't touch it!

34
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,435
Those will all be solid evidence.

35
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,354
They seem like just books.

36
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:33,867
Yes, there are the victims' names and
barcodes on the book cover.

37
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,801
Is that so?

38
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:40,003
Yes. Let's get going.

39
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:44,248
Let's go!

40
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:45,210
Start searching!

41
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,311
Yes!

42
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:54,355
This is driving me crazy!

43
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:56,678
Why is she not waking up?

44
00:04:56,678 --> 00:05:01,171
That crazy jerk released anesthetic
gas so she would suffocate to death.

45
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:03,421
What should we do to kill him?

46
00:05:03,421 --> 00:05:07,676
They said if we had been late by a minute,
she would've died.

47
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,659
We caught Kwon Jae-hee.

48
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:14,861
But how come I don't feel relieved?

49
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:17,776
There's something heavy all detectives
always feel in their hearts

50
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,850
even after catching the criminals.

51
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:26,418
But they just put it aside and
move on to the next case.

52
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,665
Lt. Yeom has woken up.

53
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,395
Really?

54
00:05:34,395 --> 00:05:36,595
Yes, we can go see her briefly.

55
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:42,075
Do you recognize us?

56
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:44,335
Yes...

57
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,608
Kwon Jae-hee...

58
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:53,282
You caught him, Lt. Yeom.

59
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:58,216
You were very brave, Lieutenant.

60
00:05:58,216 --> 00:06:00,018
You must get well soon!

61
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:02,427
I'll buy you some barbecue!

62
00:06:03,226 --> 00:06:06,989
Would you please leave the room now?

63
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:10,498
Everyone should go. I'll stay here with her.

64
00:06:10,498 --> 00:06:12,373
No...

65
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,102
Everyone should leave.

66
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:17,536
She needs absolute rest.

67
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:19,423
Yes.

68
00:06:21,576 --> 00:06:24,166
Everyone should leave.

69
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,855
It must've been tiring since
you haven't even eaten yet!

70
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,121
You must be more tired than I am.

71
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:43,803
You should rest up tonight without
thinking about anything.

72
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:53,240
What is it?

73
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:56,960
Nothing.

74
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,834
Geez... hurry up and eat up.

75
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:05,971
I guess the sin doesn't end even
when the culprit is arrested.

76
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:08,141
Seriously...

77
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:11,547
I told you to not think about
anything and rest up!

78
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:14,393
The suffering of the victims continues.

79
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:18,055
Hey! Enough.

80
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,676
Okay, I'll eat.

81
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:40,019
What is it now?

82
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:42,454
I said stop thinking about today's incident!

83
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:44,218
It's not that.

84
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:47,162
I'm full all of a sudden.

85
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,327
You're full?

86
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:51,747
It looks as though you've
only had two servings.

87
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:57,842
You're full?

88
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:00,176
Can you feel that you're full?

89
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:03,264
Yes.

90
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:06,645
So you really feel your stomach being full?

91
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:08,154
Yes.

92
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:13,810
Oh my! You must be getting your senses back!
This is awesome!

93
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,984
Is this because you caught
the murderer?

94
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:17,928
Maybe because
you've achieved your goal!

95
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:21,890
Then it's my turn to
get my memories back.

96
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,900
I wish they had returned earlier.

97
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:27,702
Don't rush it.

98
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:28,767
Aren't you happy?

99
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,793
Your senses are coming back!
How great is that?

100
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:34,421
Are you happy?

101
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:39,044
This calls for a celebration!

102
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:58,305
Mom...

103
00:08:58,657 --> 00:09:01,019
I'm home, Mom!

104
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,971
I'm home, Dad!

105
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:06,395
I said I'm home, Mom!

106
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:08,106
Why don't you say something?

107
00:09:08,106 --> 00:09:12,071
Aren't you supposed to ask how my day was?

108
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:21,019
Mom...

109
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,489
Dad...

110
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,091
Where did you go, Mom? Dad?

111
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:36,856
Don't go, Mom.

112
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:38,087
Dad...

113
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:42,429
Don't go, Dad...

114
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:48,151
Mom...

115
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:54,934
Mom!

116
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,865
Mom!

117
00:10:06,594 --> 00:10:09,233
Cho-rim...

118
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,629
Are you okay?

119
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:27,953
I remember everything.

120
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:33,093
My mom's face...

121
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:35,369
My dad's face...

122
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:44,008
The day of the accident, my house...

123
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:48,710
It's okay...

124
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,053
It's okay...

125
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,905
The murderer...

126
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,449
Kwon Jae-hee...

Mom and Dad...

128
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,101
And my accident...

129
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:15,767
I remember everything.

130
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:30,468
Everything is alright.

131
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:32,517
Just cry.

132
00:11:56,646 --> 00:12:00,139
We interrogated him
while you were in the hospital.

133
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:02,843
However, he doesn't answer.

134
00:12:02,843 --> 00:12:05,525
He didn't say a single word.

135
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:15,934
I heard you're remaining silent.

136
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,221
Detective Choi,
why are you here so late?

137
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:26,471
Why didn't you shoot me
in the head that day?

138
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:28,901
It all would've been over
if you had done that.

139
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:35,280
I heard this is the notebook that
Dr. Chun wrote in front of you.

140
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,517
What are you doing?

141
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,368
You talk quite a lot for a person
who wants to remain silent.

142
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:49,516
What are you doing?

143
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:51,245
How can he burn a piece of
evidence like that?

144
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:52,736
That's not a piece of evidence.

145
00:12:52,736 --> 00:12:54,219
It's only a notebook that looks exactly

146
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:56,100
like the one we found
at Kwon Jae-hee's house.

147
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:59,206
What are you doing right now?

148
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:02,766
Stop it!

149
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:05,877
You can't burn it!

150
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:09,382
Please! Please stop!

151
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:10,846
I beg you!

152
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:15,412
Please stop!

153
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:19,391
Again, too much talking
while remaining silent.

154
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:24,640
I'll answer. I'll answer everything...

155
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,695
So please stop!

156
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:41,402
Lt. Yeom, I'll switch out.

157
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:52,847
You're alive, Lt. Yeom.

158
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,756
Let's start with your alibi for
Joo Ma-ri's case.

159
00:13:57,756 --> 00:14:00,815
How did you manage to be in America?

160
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:10,627
Jellyfish, make yourself at home.

161
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:14,846
Why are you here?

162
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:17,045
I thought you were
going to the acting troupe.

163
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:18,951
I figured I can go back to
my place now.

164
00:14:18,951 --> 00:14:21,173
I should at least clean up
a bit before I go.

165
00:14:23,047 --> 00:14:25,316
Why? I'll be done cleaning in a bit.

166
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:26,822
Wait a little bit.

167
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:27,835
Just sit here.

168
00:14:27,835 --> 00:14:30,190
Just wait a bit!

169
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,366
It won't take long. Come here.

170
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:46,775
I just went to see Lt. Oh, your father.

171
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:48,447
Dad...

172
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:50,957
I haven't been able to
reach him recently.

173
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,688
Where is he?

174
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:10,873
He wanted me to give these to you.

175
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:13,438
Like this...

176
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:16,631
Mom, Dad, and me.

177
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:20,385
I'm happy seeing the
three of us together.

178
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:28,889
This seems like... my mom's ring.

179
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:32,588
That's right. It used to be your mother's.

180
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:36,408
So Dad's been holding onto
all these things.

181
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:49,701
This is...

182
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:53,712
Your mom had written this before
she passed away.

183
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,039
My daughter, Eun-seol, was a kind girl.

184
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,372
Every time I asked if she gets scared
when she's home alone...

185
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:24,571
she said she didn't get scared because
she imagined us with her all the time.

186
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:27,917
When I came home after a long day at sea...

187
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:34,774
she used to massage my hands
and legs with her little hands.

188
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,156
When I look at Eun-seol all grown up...

189
00:16:38,156 --> 00:16:43,172
I sometimes think about how I was once
a precious daughter to my own parents.

190
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:46,798
I've forgotten the fact that
I used to be a daughter, too.

191
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,977
I've lived my life only as a mom.

192
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:52,152
My Eun-seol will become a mom, too.

193
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:56,166
She'll become a good mother
because she's a good daughter.

194
00:16:56,541 --> 00:17:00,312
I love you, my daughter Eun-seol.

195
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,921
Kwon Jae-hee...

196
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:33,631
This concludes our side
of the investigation.

197
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:36,411
You'll be sent to the
prosecutor's office now.

198
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:44,589
Sign here.

199
00:17:45,257 --> 00:17:49,196
We're done with you, Kwon Jae-hee.

200
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:51,763
You'll now wait for the
judgment of the law.

201
00:17:57,856 --> 00:18:01,208
I'd like to ask for one last favor.

202
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:07,479
- I'd like to talk to him in private.
- Forget it, Detective Choi.

203
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:09,264
Let's send him off to the
prosecutor's office.

204
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:11,903
As a final request please...

205
00:18:11,903 --> 00:18:14,941
It won't be long. It'll be quick.

206
00:18:52,024 --> 00:18:55,760
What are you doing right now?

207
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,637
I won't be able to see you ever again.

208
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,771
So there's something I must do right now.

209
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,324
I'm determined to see you again.

210
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:10,342
You... won't be able to step outside
of the prison ever again.

211
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:12,377
No...

212
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:15,669
We'll definitely meet again.

213
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:18,659
That won't happen.

214
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,778
I'll only tell you this once.

215
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:29,792
Apologize to Cho-rim's parents and
my sister... right here, right now.

216
00:19:31,688 --> 00:19:36,546
Do you think my apology will
make the family feel better?

217
00:19:36,546 --> 00:19:40,138
Do you think you'll be able to escape
that guilty feeling of being a survivor?

218
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,568
Not at all.

219
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:46,846
Just say that one sentence.

220
00:19:46,846 --> 00:19:48,815
Say you're sorry.

221
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:51,492
I'm telling you that's useless.

222
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:54,340
But rather...

223
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,324
I'll tell you how I felt when
I killed your sister.

224
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:12,304
That was from my sister, Eun-seol.

225
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:17,831
And this is from Cho-rim's parents.

226
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:26,518
That's enough! You can't do this!

227
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,320
Put the handcuffs on!

228
00:20:32,252 --> 00:20:35,127
I owe you now.

229
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:37,357
I'll make sure to pay you back.

230
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:38,563
Be quiet.

231
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:58,589
Do you plead guilty?

232
00:20:58,589 --> 00:20:59,887
What was your motivation to kill?

233
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:02,019
Any comment, Mr. Kwon?

234
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:04,053
Anything to the victims' families?

235
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:07,273
Mr. Kwon! Please look here!

236
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,756
Well done, Inspector Kang.

237
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:13,837
Please don't mention it.

238
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:16,291
Lt. Yeom and my teammates
did all the work.

239
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,477
You did well, Inspector Kang.

240
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:22,594
Not everyone can catch serial killers.

241
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:24,684
It was possible because you did it!

242
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:27,813
Thanks.

243
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:30,808
So today is the end of the
special investigation team?

244
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:33,188
Yes, sir.

245
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:49,036
The special investigation team
has finished its duty.

246
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:50,610
I'm going back to my original post
at the Metropolitan Investigation Force.

247
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:57,612
I don't know if I can say this...
But I really don't want to go back.

248
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:03,504
Go back!

249
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:06,617
Inspector Kang...

250
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,276
Please forgive me for
all my impertinence so far.

251
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:10,492
Not at all!

252
00:22:10,492 --> 00:22:12,817
There's nothing to forgive!

253
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:19,921
And Detective Choi, you had to go through
so much because I dragged you onto this team.

254
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,498
Thank you for your hard work.

255
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:23,069
Not at all...

256
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:25,828
I thank you for giving me the
chance to investigate.

257
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:30,142
Thank you all.

258
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:35,081
And Cho-rim... it was my pleasure
getting to know you.

259
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:36,350
Me, too, big sister.

260
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,905
Me, too, big sister!

261
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:47,415
That's not like the Ice Princess we know!

262
00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:50,120
Let's send her off properly.

263
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,827
I'll cheers to her first.

264
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:54,635
To our Lt. Yeom!

265
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:57,736
We love you so much!

266
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:03,559
I love you all very much, too!

267
00:23:06,712 --> 00:23:08,618
Take a look, Officer Choi!

268
00:23:08,618 --> 00:23:12,058
My friend in Jeju posted
a picture of my old home.

269
00:23:12,784 --> 00:23:15,394
This is the bus stop.

270
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,252
And...

271
00:23:17,252 --> 00:23:20,208
Can you see these steps?

272
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:21,664
Your town is pretty!

273
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:23,319
On my way home from school,
I would always text my mom from there

274
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:29,330
and my meal would always be
ready by the time I got home.

275
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,709
Do you want to go see
your parents tomorrow?

276
00:23:34,503 --> 00:23:36,437
To Jeju Island?

277
00:23:36,437 --> 00:23:39,305
No, they're nearby.

278
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:41,014
Your father brought them nearby

279
00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:45,535
so you could visit them often
once you regained your memory.

280
00:23:45,535 --> 00:23:48,717
I also moved my sister nearby
so I can visit her often, too.

281
00:23:48,717 --> 00:23:51,119
They're at the same resting place!

282
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,079
Really?

283
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:57,016
I always wanted to say hello to your sister.

284
00:23:57,016 --> 00:23:58,852
We should go tomorrow.

285
00:23:58,852 --> 00:23:59,969
Yes.

286
00:24:01,582 --> 00:24:02,288
Are there more pictures?

287
00:24:02,288 --> 00:24:02,809
Let me see.

288
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,162
Let's see...

289
00:24:04,703 --> 00:24:06,402
On her profile...

290
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:13,779
Are you looking for anything?

291
00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:17,623
I'm looking for an engagement ring.

292
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:22,178
How about something like this?

293
00:24:24,618 --> 00:24:26,992
Pretty...

294
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:28,956
I'll take this.

295
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,142
Mom, Dad...

296
00:24:35,442 --> 00:24:37,058
I'm here.

297
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:43,430
It took too long to get here.

298
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:45,948
I'm sorry.

299
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:54,786
You must've been so worried about me.

300
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:59,758
I'm fine now.

301
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:03,245
So don't worry about me and rest in peace.

302
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,702
I'll carry on with my life.

303
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:15,264
And I'll come visit you often, okay?

304
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:22,397
I'll take good care of Cho-rim
for the rest of my life.

305
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,983
Don't worry.

306
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:47,112
I'm here, Eun-seol.

307
00:25:48,907 --> 00:25:51,310
But I'm not alone today.

308
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:54,612
I'm sorry for coming so late.

309
00:25:56,033 --> 00:26:00,383
I'll do my best to make up for your life.

310
00:26:00,716 --> 00:26:04,995
I'm sorry and thankful.

311
00:26:08,295 --> 00:26:13,068
I'll let Cho-rim to speak to you informally
because you're younger than she is.

312
00:26:13,068 --> 00:26:15,003
That's fine, right?

313
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:42,327
There's this guy I used to work
with at the Jeju Aquarium.

314
00:26:42,327 --> 00:26:46,992
I heard he got a new job at the
Gyeonggi Aquarium.

315
00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:50,135
It's near here. Do you want
to go with me there?

316
00:26:50,135 --> 00:26:51,816
Sure, let's go.

317
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:54,326
But I really can't imagine it.

318
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:55,503
Can't imagine what?

319
00:26:55,503 --> 00:26:58,196
You in a wetsuit.

320
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:01,608
I think you'd look better in
a police uniform!

321
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:02,878
That's not true.

322
00:27:02,878 --> 00:27:06,267
I look great in a wetsuit, too!

323
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:09,379
You lie quite often these days!

324
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,162
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

325
00:27:12,418 --> 00:27:14,090
Go ahead.

326
00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:20,339
Wow, stingrays.

327
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,844
It's so good to see you again, Moo-gak.

328
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:25,299
It's good to hear you want to
work at an aquarium again.

329
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:28,676
This aquarium is very similar to the
one in Jeju in terms of facility and size.

330
00:27:28,676 --> 00:27:30,559
So you'll get used to it very quickly.

331
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,312
A skilled aquarist like you is
always welcome here!

332
00:27:33,312 --> 00:27:35,990
Thanks.

333
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,688
Your girlfriend is very pretty!

334
00:27:38,688 --> 00:27:41,668
I'm so glad that you're doing well.

335
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:44,825
Go ahead.

336
00:27:44,825 --> 00:27:47,852
I'll call you later.

337
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:49,216
I'll see you later.

338
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:50,251
Nice meeting you, too.

339
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,899
- Come visit us often.
- Sure!

340
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:53,698
Bye!

341
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:58,369
So you used to work at a place like this...

342
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:01,045
Do you like it?

343
00:28:02,441 --> 00:28:06,452
How does it feel to work underwater?

344
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:12,186
It'd be amazing to get married
at a place like this, no?

345
00:28:12,186 --> 00:28:14,051
It does sound wonderful.

346
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:18,000
An octopus will give the blessing,
and the couple can exchange shells!

347
00:28:18,427 --> 00:28:21,326
It'd be great to do it for real.

348
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:23,085
Really do it?

00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:45,528
I need to go use the bathroom.

353
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:47,328
Yes. What do you want me to order?

354
00:28:47,328 --> 00:28:48,688
Anything.

355
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:54,131
Excuse me!

Oh, no!

362
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:11,283
What am I supposed to do now?

363
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:15,681
I must propose soon...

364
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,175
But how should I do this?

365
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:19,668
What kind of event should I do?

373
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:13,963
Cho-rim...

374
00:31:15,731 --> 00:31:18,199
Would you marry me?

375
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:26,010
Say yes!

376
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:46,430
You are in my heart.

377
00:31:49,431 --> 00:31:52,125
My baby...

378
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:57,643
Kiss her!

379
00:32:08,923 --> 00:32:12,257
What is it? Are you thinking
about something funny?

380
00:32:12,257 --> 00:32:13,334
Nothing really.

381
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:14,159
Really?

382
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,058
Should we go somewhere else
other than that place?

383
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:19,088
There are too many people at the fountain.

384
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:22,521
There should be a lot of people!

385
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,023
Let's just go to the fountain anyway.

386
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:26,204
You can just look from here!

387
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:27,472
I'm very thirsty right now.

388
00:32:27,472 --> 00:32:29,145
I want something to drink.

389
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:30,878
Just wait a bit.

390
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:34,481
And fountains are meant to
be enjoyed up close!

391
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:35,886
Let's go!

392
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:40,485
Why is it that close?

393
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:51,454
Oh my! Look at them!

394
00:32:51,454 --> 00:32:56,541
♪ The place where I come to you... ♪

395
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,607
I hate when people propose like that!

396
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:02,413
What?

397
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,596
Don't you feel bad for the girl?

398
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:09,686
I don't know why men think girls
would enjoy something like that!

399
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:11,282
Let's go, Cho-rim.

400
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:13,646
What? I thought you
wanted to see the fountain!

401
00:33:13,646 --> 00:33:14,686
We're here already...

402
00:33:14,686 --> 00:33:15,910
I saw the whole thing already.

403
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,568
Let's go get something to drink!

404
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,890
Something refreshing?

405
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,117
Doesn't he know that she doesn't like it?

406
00:33:22,117 --> 00:33:23,433
Oh no. The girl's beating him up!

407
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:24,423
Let's just go...

408
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:25,364
I'd beat him up, too!

409
00:33:25,364 --> 00:33:28,052
No... Let's just go!

410
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:46,637
I'll hide the ring here...

411
00:33:46,637 --> 00:33:49,114
And as we walk...

412
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,593
"Oh, my shoelace is untied!"

413
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:54,193
Then, as I pretend to tie my shoelace...

414
00:33:54,193 --> 00:33:56,728
I'll take out the ring from the sand...

415
00:33:56,728 --> 00:33:58,650
"Oh, there's something here!"

416
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:03,143
As I say that, I'll give the ring to Cho-rim!

417
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:04,770
Yes!

418
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:08,350
Here you go!

419
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:15,380
Thank you!

420
00:34:17,372 --> 00:34:18,720
Where are we going?

421
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,935
Let's sit down here.

422
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,114
Let's walk around a bit.

423
00:34:24,114 --> 00:34:25,751
Let's go.

424
00:34:26,326 --> 00:34:30,027
It's strange that you're
dragging me around all day!

425
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:35,033
Oh, my shoelace is untied!

426
00:34:57,789 --> 00:35:03,961
What are you doing right now?

427
00:35:03,961 --> 00:35:05,606
Look how pretty this can tab is!

428
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:09,501
I guess they still make them like this!

429
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:44,137
Cho-rim...

430
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:45,801
Seriously!

431
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:49,007
You're not telling me what this
whole sand play is about!

432
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:49,880
What are you doing right now?

433
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,308
Let's just go!

434
00:35:52,308 --> 00:35:54,435
I can't leave here, Cho-rim.

435
00:35:54,435 --> 00:35:56,489
What's the reason?

436
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:57,280
Why can't you leave?

437
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,050
All it takes is just leaving!

438
00:36:05,253 --> 00:36:08,720
How frustrating!

439
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:11,296
I'm so sorry, Cho-rim.

440
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:13,031
But I have to go to the bathroom.

441
00:36:13,031 --> 00:36:15,167
Don't go anywhere. Stay right here!

442
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:20,277
Seriously...

443
00:36:22,169 --> 00:36:25,911
Seriously, how many parks
are we visiting today?

444
00:36:25,911 --> 00:36:28,463
I said this place is different!

445
00:36:28,463 --> 00:36:31,462
I'm starving.

446
00:36:31,462 --> 00:36:32,816
Do you have any perfume with you?

447
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,199
Why?

448
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,517
Give it to me.

449
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:41,116
Don't go anywhere. Stay right here.

450
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,530
Why?

451
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:46,031
Just relax and stay right there.

452
00:37:04,149 --> 00:37:09,021
[Will you...]

453
00:37:23,185 --> 00:37:25,645
[Will you marry me?]

454
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,451
[Will you marry me?]

455
00:38:48,047 --> 00:38:50,115
Where did you find this?

456
00:38:50,115 --> 00:38:55,623
I picked it up from that playground earlier,
while you were in the restroom...

457
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:12,070
It's pretty.

458
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,071
Will you marry me?

459
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:23,161
Yes.

460
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:32,564
Thank you.

461
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:35,394
I said it'll only be over
when one of us dies!

462
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,004
No!

463
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,617
It's almost done.

464
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,587
Looks great!

465
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,413
Don't you feel bad I come here every
morning to make you breakfast?

466
00:41:16,413 --> 00:41:20,061
Are you still worried about
last night's dream?

467
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:25,043
It was just a dream,
but you got hurt pretty badly in it.

468
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:27,408
Dreams always come true
in the opposite way!

469
00:41:27,408 --> 00:41:29,682
But I'm still upset by it.

470
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:35,687
Kwon Jae-hee won't be able to
step outside of prison ever again.

471
00:41:35,687 --> 00:41:37,707
So don't worry.

472
00:41:38,744 --> 00:41:40,064
Right?

473
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,355
Of course.

474
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,424
I guess I often dream about weird things.

475
00:41:46,424 --> 00:41:48,038
Let's eat!

476
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:49,822
Bon appetite!

477
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:51,624
Bon appetite!

478
00:42:03,576 --> 00:42:05,774
Turn the TV on! Watch the news!

479
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,639
What?

480
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,780
Breaking news...

481
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,385
Around 5:10 p.m. today,

482
00:42:10,385 --> 00:42:14,750
the car that was carrying alleged serial
killer Kwon Jae-hee fell into the

483
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,834
Han River while crossing Banghwa Bridge.

484
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:20,659
Witnesses claim that the car
had a flat tire in the back...

485
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:25,337
which made it lose its balance
and veer off into the river.

486
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:31,947
Five police officers were escorting
Kwon Jae-hee in the car.

487
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:33,075
The police have blocked off

488
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:37,858
Banghwa Bridge and are trying
to lift the car out of the river.

489
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:42,818
There are also divers working
underwater to look for survivors.

490
00:42:42,818 --> 00:42:47,213
We'll update you as this
story progresses.

491
00:42:48,327 --> 00:42:49,461
What is this?

492
00:42:49,461 --> 00:42:51,820
What if this was Kwon Jae-hee's plan?

493
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,128
No, it can't be.

494
00:42:54,128 --> 00:42:56,951
There were five police officers with him.

495
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:59,547
And it was a traffic accident!

496
00:42:59,547 --> 00:43:05,607
Even Kwon Jae-hee can't intentionally cause
a car accident in that situation!

497
00:43:05,607 --> 00:43:08,347
Kwon Jae-hee is under a
prosecutorial investigation right now.

498
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:11,179
Why was he crossing the Han River?

499
00:43:11,179 --> 00:43:13,533
I think he's trying to do a field
simulation these days.

500
00:43:13,533 --> 00:43:15,958
It seems as though he was going back
to the prison from the crime scene.

501
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:18,991
He can't be dead, can he?

502
00:43:18,991 --> 00:43:21,297
And how about the police officers
who were with him?

503
00:43:21,297 --> 00:43:23,682
The search team will rescue them.

504
00:43:23,682 --> 00:43:26,467
Kwon Jae-hee can't just die like this.

505
00:43:26,467 --> 00:43:32,354
He must be brought to justice and get
the maximum legal sentence possible!

506
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:35,673
So then... what happens now?

507
00:43:35,673 --> 00:43:39,811
So we have to pray for his survival now?

508
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,670
I guess that's the case.

509
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:50,732
Anyway, I hope the search
team will find them soon.

510
00:43:54,117 --> 00:43:54,760
[5 Days Later]

511
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,568
After the car fell into Han River,
the search continued for five days.

512
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:06,872
They said the search is officially over.

513
00:44:06,872 --> 00:44:08,314
What?

514
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:09,894
The search is over?

515
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:13,052
So you're just going to report the
missing three as dead?

516
00:44:13,052 --> 00:44:15,051
If we couldn't find them after combing
the bottom of the river for five days...

517
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:16,634
It means that they're dead.

518
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:20,124
But you still haven't found
Kwon Jae-hee's corpse!

519
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:24,222
That means he died with the other
two police officers then.

520
00:44:24,222 --> 00:44:26,125
And I heard Kwon Jae-hee was
handcuffed at the moment.

521
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:28,959
How could he possibly survive
underwater? No way!

522
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:34,512
So is this really the end of
Kwon Jae-hee's case?

523
00:44:34,512 --> 00:44:38,303
The case is closed due to
the lack of a defendant.

524
00:44:38,713 --> 00:44:42,120
We can say that it was Kwon Jae-hee's
punishment from heaven...

525
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,323
But then what about those

526
00:44:43,323 --> 00:44:45,168
innocent policemen who got
killed in the accident?

527
00:44:45,168 --> 00:44:48,271
I feel so sorry for them.

[Choi Moo-gak]

00:45:05,935 --> 00:45:08,905
For arresting the serial killer,

531
00:45:08,905 --> 00:45:11,566
everyone on the special investigation team
got promoted by one rank.

532
00:45:11,566 --> 00:45:14,707
Then they returned to their regular posts.

533
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:23,053
Inspector Kang got the daughter
he had always wanted.

534
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,938
Hello!

535
00:45:24,938 --> 00:45:26,822
How cute!

536
00:45:28,379 --> 00:45:31,365
So he now has six sons and one daughter.

537
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,538
What on earth are we doing
on this sunny day?

538
00:45:35,538 --> 00:45:37,796
Let's just go home.

539
00:45:37,796 --> 00:45:39,084
Yes.

540
00:45:49,576 --> 00:45:52,475
Long time no talk, Shivanova.

541
00:45:52,475 --> 00:45:55,109
You can't come here!

542

I love you.

00:46:17,961 --> 00:46:18,837
Me, too.

547
00:46:18,837 --> 00:46:24,564
Detective Ki resumed his passionate love
affair with Shivanova after a brief cold war.

548
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:29,348
Hey, you've had enough.

549
00:46:29,348 --> 00:46:31,151
Now come back and learn
how to run this company!

550
00:46:31,151 --> 00:46:34,304
I want to continue being a cop, Dad.

551
00:46:34,304 --> 00:46:37,289
I want to be the head of the
homicide department one day!

552
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:39,555
This little brat!

553

Dad...

554
00:46:42,222 --> 00:46:46,388
It turns out that Detective Yeh is the
only child of a large corporation CEO.

555
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:50,598
He refused to take over the company
and decided to remain on the police force.

556
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:51,713
Give me a chance, yes?

557
00:46:51,713 --> 00:46:53,205
So even in a case like this,

558
00:46:53,205 --> 00:46:59,006
you must judge carefully whether
it's actual defamation...

Here you go...

561
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:15,749
Lt. Yeom became
a professor of criminology.

562
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:17,496
And as for me...

563
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:24,355
So, why do you meet in private?
Has something good happened?

I quit the police force in order to
go back to the aquarium.

Hello.

571
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:49,222
I'm Oh Cho-rim of "I Want to Know."

572
00:47:49,222 --> 00:47:53,529
I just met with the kids
who ran away from home.

573
00:47:53,529 --> 00:47:56,634
But...

574
00:47:56,634 --> 00:47:58,502
After I told them that I'm from
a TV station...

575
00:47:58,502 --> 00:48:00,090
and that I want to help...

576
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:04,318
I asked them what they needed the most.

577
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,539
The kids' answer really surprised me.

578
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:12,646
They all wanted the autographs from
the group Big Bang.

579
00:48:12,646 --> 00:48:16,623
So now is the time when TV stations
and the Korean Singers Association

580
00:48:16,623 --> 00:48:21,850
must work hard to secure
the autographs from Big Bang!

581
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,965
Is this funny to you, Cho-rim?

582
00:48:25,797 --> 00:48:28,260
When were we supposed to laugh?

583
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,077
What's wrong with her?

584
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:34,547
Cho-rim went back to her troupe
and started laughing again.

585
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:39,531
The real estate agent said we should
look at the layout from the showroom...

586
00:48:39,531 --> 00:48:42,433
and just sign the lease with the landlord.

587
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:44,691
The rent has gone up so much lately.

588
00:48:44,691 --> 00:48:46,581
It's a big problem.

589
00:48:47,918 --> 00:48:48,887
You know that, too?

590
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:50,687
Why wouldn't I?

591
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,151
I guess you're ready to
get married to me!

592
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:54,118
And that's why you snatched me up.

593
00:48:54,118 --> 00:48:57,596
We decided to get married in a month.

594
00:48:59,322 --> 00:49:01,051
How pretty!

595
00:49:01,051 --> 00:49:03,338
This is the perfect layout!

596
00:49:03,338 --> 00:49:05,909
Do you like it? Should we just sign here?

597
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:06,927
Hello!

598
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:08,045
Hello.

599
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:10,242
You must be getting married soon!

600
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:11,796
Yes.

601
00:49:11,796 --> 00:49:14,947

you can buy it.

It'll be the same as
what's in here right now?

604
00:49:20,113 --> 00:49:21,057
Yes.

605
00:49:21,057 --> 00:49:26,391
We'll install everything in the exact
same way, including the furniture!

606
00:49:27,238 --> 00:49:30,118
Half the price is amazing!

607
00:49:30,118 --> 00:49:32,998
Is it possible to get a bigger discount?

608
00:49:40,026 --> 00:49:41,399
That's our place!

609
00:49:41,399 --> 00:49:43,662
Since you said that
it's our place, I'm happy.

610
00:49:43,662 --> 00:49:46,244

But I'm calling you my wife
as soon as we're married!

614
00:49:54,306 --> 00:49:56,549
Don't be so cheeky!

615
00:49:56,549 --> 00:49:58,313
Cheeky?

616
00:49:58,313 --> 00:50:00,216
You want me to teach you a lesson?

617
00:50:00,216 --> 00:50:01,827
Go ahead!

618
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,334
Pause that for now and stand right there.

00:50:24,658 --> 00:50:26,373
What's wrong with your face?

625
00:50:26,373 --> 00:50:28,387
Someone might think
you were forced into this!

626
00:50:28,387 --> 00:50:29,723
I think I practiced too much before.

627
00:50:29,723 --> 00:50:33,076
My facial muscles aren't working!

628
00:50:34,582 --> 00:50:36,259

So is your congratulatory speech ready?

641

I don't need to say much!

642

I'm the living example of fertility!

643
00:51:11,185 --> 00:51:13,696
My standing there should be enough

644

for Moo-gak and Cho-rim to
receive my fertile energy!

645
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:18,169
No speech is necessary!

646

Do you want some of my energy, too?

00:51:44,218 --> 00:51:45,931
Attention!

659
00:51:45,931 --> 00:51:48,391
Yeom Mi!

660
00:51:51,073 --> 00:51:52,329
A smile from the bride, please!

661
00:51:52,329 --> 00:51:52,790
Yes.

662
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,541
One, two!

663
00:51:54,541 --> 00:51:57,976
A different pose! One, two!

664
00:52:03,507 --> 00:52:04,316
All done!

665
00:52:04,316 --> 00:52:05,387
Thank you!

666
00:52:05,387 --> 00:52:07,120
The guests are arriving, Cho-rim.

667
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,086
Go get ready.

668
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:09,588
Yes.

669
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:10,989
I must go to the bride's room.

670
00:52:10,989 --> 00:52:13,366
Yes. Make yourself pretty.

671
00:52:13,366 --> 00:52:14,766
Let's go.

672
00:52:14,766 --> 00:52:16,235
Thank you!

673
00:52:23,597 --> 00:52:24,836
Moo-gak!

674
00:52:24,836 --> 00:52:26,798
Thanks for coming!

675
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:27,907
Congratulations!

676
00:52:27,907 --> 00:52:30,311
Thank you.

677
00:52:30,311 --> 00:52:33,279
You look beautiful, Cho-rim!

678
00:52:33,279 --> 00:52:35,568
Thank you!

679
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,578
Congratulations on your marriage!

680
00:52:38,578 --> 00:52:40,288
I look forward to your leading
the ceremony today!

681
00:52:40,288 --> 00:52:41,392
Yes!

682
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:44,857
Do you think you can do 100 pushups
with her on your back?

683
00:52:44,857 --> 00:52:46,536
Don't request things like that!

684
00:52:46,536 --> 00:52:48,063
That's not a good tradition.

685
00:52:48,063 --> 00:52:50,902
Why would he have to
waste his energy?

686
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:52,467
Sis!

687
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:56,185
You look pretty today!

688
00:52:56,185 --> 00:52:59,208
You look good too, Detective Choi.

689
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:00,868
You guys look great together.

690
00:53:00,868 --> 00:53:01,929
Thank you.

691
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,642
Thank you.

692
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:06,044
Who is that guy?

693
00:53:06,044 --> 00:53:07,588
He's totally my type.

694
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:10,691
Introduce me later.

695
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:11,516
Shall we?

696
00:53:11,516 --> 00:53:13,156
Let's go!

697
00:53:23,272 --> 00:53:25,957
Thank you!

698
00:53:25,957 --> 00:53:27,933
So what brings you to Seoul?

699
00:53:27,933 --> 00:53:30,240
I thought you came to
Seoul to be a comedian!

700
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,418
I wanted to be like you and
meet a Seoul girl!

701
00:53:34,418 --> 00:53:39,063
I tried my best, but I still ended up
with a Jeju girl!

702
00:53:43,818 --> 00:53:45,550
He's good.

703
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:49,036
Choi Moo-gak, you're really funny.

704
00:53:49,036 --> 00:53:50,859
Join us if you come to
hate your married life!

705
00:53:50,859 --> 00:53:53,312
Mr. Wang!

706
00:53:53,312 --> 00:53:55,535
I'm just kidding. Congratulations.

707
00:53:55,535 --> 00:53:58,632
I gave you guys a lot of money.

708
00:53:58,632 --> 00:54:00,932
Thank you.

709
00:54:00,932 --> 00:54:02,695
You've made the right choice, Cho-rim.

710
00:54:02,695 --> 00:54:06,811
Living a married life instead of
being a comedienne isn't bad!

711
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:10,116
Woo-yah, I plan to continue being
a comedienne after the wedding.

712
00:54:10,116 --> 00:54:11,610
That's fine, too!

713
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,103
But you are pretty today. Just a little bit!

714
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:16,407
Thank you.

715
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:17,783
Excuse me.

716
00:54:18,885 --> 00:54:21,057
You're my type!

717
00:54:23,097 --> 00:54:25,527
Miss, we only have 15 minutes
until the ceremony.

718
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:27,687
We must get you ready.

719
00:54:27,687 --> 00:54:29,256
Thank you all for coming!

720
00:54:29,256 --> 00:54:30,329
I'll see you later, Officer Choi.

721
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:32,136
See you later.

722
00:54:35,259 --> 00:54:37,696
I'll show you to your seats.

723
00:54:52,751 --> 00:54:56,755
Cho-rim!

724
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:59,543
So pretty!

725
00:55:00,154 --> 00:55:03,503
Getting married?

726
00:55:04,204 --> 00:55:06,493
Cho-rim!

727
00:55:06,493 --> 00:55:08,133
The ceremony is about to start.

728
00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:09,216
Yes.

729
00:55:09,216 --> 00:55:09,926
Good luck!

730
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:11,857
See you later!

731
00:55:12,343 --> 00:55:13,254
She looks so pretty!

732
00:55:13,254 --> 00:55:16,174
I was going to get married first.

733
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,753
I'm going to see what's
going on in the main hall.

734
00:55:20,753 --> 00:55:21,977
Yes.

735
00:55:21,977 --> 00:55:23,683
I'm nervous!

736
00:55:28,895 --> 00:55:30,701
[Choi Moo-gak and Oh Cho-rim]

737
00:55:30,701 --> 00:55:31,631
[Congratulations on your marriage!]

738
00:55:34,293 --> 00:55:42,551
We'll now start the wedding ceremony of
Mr. Choi Moo-gak and Miss Oh Cho-rim.

739
00:55:42,551 --> 00:55:46,032
Now, the bridegroom will make his entrance.

740
00:55:46,032 --> 00:55:53,255
Please give a big round of applause
to the handsome bridegroom!

741
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:58,090
Please enter, Mr. Bridegroom!

742
00:56:28,648 --> 00:56:34,287
And now, the star of the ceremony,
the bride, will walk down the aisle.

743
00:56:34,287 --> 00:56:43,918
I ask all guests to stand up to
welcome the graceful bride!

744
00:56:43,918 --> 00:56:46,570
Please give a round of applause
when she enters!

745
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:50,238
Please enter, Miss Bride!

746
00:57:14,615 --> 00:57:17,396
Congratulations on your marriage.

747
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:22,328
Cho-rim...

748
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:39,291
Miss Bride? Where are you?

749
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:51,997
Please come out, Miss Bride!

750
00:58:12,815 --> 00:58:14,686
Cho-rim has disappeared.

751
00:58:14,686 --> 00:58:16,677
The bride is gone!

752
00:58:23,204 --> 00:58:24,983
Oh Cho-rim!
