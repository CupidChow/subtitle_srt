1
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:06,534
Officer Choi.

2
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:28,934
Eun-seol, it's your brother.

3
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,481
Have you been well?

4
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,828
I don't know why I'm remembering
this for no reason...

5
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:37,200
We should've just had meat noodles
when I went to Seoul with you.

6
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:49,337
Excuse me. He can't sleep here.

7
00:00:49,337 --> 00:00:53,784
I'm sorry. We'll leave.

8
00:02:14,862 --> 00:02:18,264
I like you, too.

9
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:31,583
I said I like you, too.

10
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:49,062
Officer Choi, wake up.

11
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:50,023
I think it's going to rain right now.

12
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:51,731
Hurry up and wake up.

13
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:03,106
Where are we?

14
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:05,742
You suddenly fell asleep at the restaurant.

15
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:09,818
I barely managed to drag you over here.

16
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,522
I must've fallen asleep while I was eating.

17
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:14,882
I'm sorry. You must've had a hard time.

18
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:23,194
Well... since you cant feel anything,
there's nothing I can do about it.

19
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:25,232
By the way...

20
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:27,136
How did you drag me here?

21
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:29,166
It must've been hard for you.

22
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,197
Tell me. How am I when I'm asleep?

23
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:36,812
Do I just faint completely or
am I half asleep and half awake?

24
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:39,735
Just think that you're like a zombie.

25
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:42,926
It looks as if it's going to rain.

26
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:47,181
Lets hurry up and leave. I have an umbrella.

27
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:56,050
Wake up.

28
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,189
I must be crazy.

29
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:14,452
Is your leg alright? What's wrong?

30
00:04:14,452 --> 00:04:16,356
Does it hurt a lot?

31
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,818
It's fine. My blood circulation
hasn't been great these days.

32
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:21,518
Let's hurry.

33
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:31,789
I'll be going first.

34
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:19,320
When did you put this in my hood?

35
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,496
When you were asleep earlier...

36
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:24,080
Why?

37
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,891
I'm returning it to you since it was a
buy-one-get-one-free doll.

38
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:29,825
What's wrong with that?

39
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:35,957
I'm not the kind of person
who accepts freebies.

40
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,836
How do you know this is a freebie
when they look the same?

41
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:43,079
Don't be ridiculous.

42
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,707
I can tell by just looking at them

43
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:46,548
which one is the main character
and which one is an extra.

44
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:49,735
I know which one you paid for and
which one was free.

45
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:53,079
If you knew so well, you shouldn't have
accepted it from the beginning.

46
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,832
Well, you know... How would the
person who's giving the gift feel

47
00:05:57,832 --> 00:06:06,691
if the other person refuses to accept
it? You should accept it no matter what.

48
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:12,499
There's nothing I can do then
since you've accepted it already.

49
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:13,534
Just throw it away for me.

50
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:15,163
How can I throw this away?

51
00:06:15,163 --> 00:06:18,348
I thought you didn't want it
since it was a freebie.

52
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:27,283
I'm offended, so I can't accept it. But
you should take it home and treasure it.

53
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:30,689
I'm getting off. Bye.

54
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:31,966
Hey Oh Cho...

55
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:36,926
Eun-Seol, it's your brother.
Have you been well?

56
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:18,391
Yes, Dr. Kim. I received the package.

57
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:22,213
I checked the plane ticket, too.

58
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:24,980
It got late while I was packing.

59
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,209
It's still daytime in Senegal, right?

60
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,495
Yes. I'm prepared to
go through some difficulty.

61
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:36,891
I'll sign the medical volunteer
contract and fax it to you.

62
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,416
Yes. I'll see you in three days.

63
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,034
[Jeju Baekrok Hospital / Choi Eun-seol]

64
00:08:08,717 --> 00:08:10,487
Eun-seol...

65
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:18,987
Choi Eun-seol.

66
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:20,897
You wanted to kill the witness,
but you made a mistake

67
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:22,687
and killed my sister, didn't you?

68
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:26,422
Look carefully at my sister Eun-seol
that you murdered, you creep.

69
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,146
She's not the witness.

70
00:08:28,146 --> 00:08:30,571
She's not the witness!

71
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:40,435
Killed the wrong witness...

72
00:08:40,744 --> 00:08:45,696
Then the witness is still alive.

73
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:51,180
The daughter of the diver couple,
Choi Eun-seol...

74
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,751
is still alive as Oh Cho-rim.

75
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,429
Oh Cho-rim was the witness.

76
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:27,803
A wine crate made of wood...

77
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:31,600
It's a wooden wine crate
you see at a wine store.

78
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,459
Yes, that's right.

79
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,437
Do you have it?

80
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:37,604
That's a relief.

81
00:09:37,604 --> 00:09:40,844
Then please put it aside for me.

82
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:43,626
Yes. Thank you.

83
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:50,684
You came to get the accounting
book that was in the wine crate, right?

84
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:53,656
Why are you in such a hurry? It makes me sad.

85
00:09:53,656 --> 00:09:55,724
You already sent all of your luggage.

86
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:58,925
Mr. Kwon, I have to apologize to you
about something.

87
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:00,763
The wine crate you asked me
to hold for you got taken

88
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:05,433
to the moving company
with my luggage by accident.

89
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:06,897
Yes. I heard you talking to
them on the phone.

90
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,339
I heard they have it.

91
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,100
Of course. They have it.

92
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,281
I'm sorry. I'll go get it and
bring it to you later.

93
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,707
Should I go to the moving company myself?

94
00:10:18,707 --> 00:10:23,453
I have to stop by there anyway to deal
with my luggage being sent to Africa.

95
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,274
You said your flight is set for day
after tomorrow, right?

96
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:28,112
That's terrible.

97
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:30,665
I guess we won't be able to
see each other for two years.

98
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:31,776
That's regrettable.

99
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:34,553
Please tell me more in detail
when we have dinner tonight.

100
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:35,564
I'll see you later.

101
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:36,802
Yes.

102
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,834
Hello.

103
00:10:54,678 --> 00:10:56,382
Hello, sir.

104
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:58,948
Yes, Oh Cho-rim. You're here.

105
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:00,761
But why are you here by yourself?

106
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:04,017
Officer Choi won't be able to
come from now on.

107
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:10,699
Didn't I tell you that I'd only accept you
if you come with Officer Choi?

108
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:15,111
I want to be acknowledged by you
without Officer Choi by my side.

109
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:18,140
Why can't Officer Choi do the skit with you?

110
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,677
I think he has personal reasons.

111
00:11:21,677 --> 00:11:25,601
Given your skill level, you can't be
part of the performance team alone.

112
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,152
You might be good enough
for the support team.

113
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:31,882
And even if you do that, I can only pay you
for your transportation costs.

114
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,246
I'll do whatever is necessary.

115
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:39,857
I'll carry the equipment, clean
the stage and sell tickets.

116
00:11:39,857 --> 00:11:43,265
I'll do whatever I can do, sir.

117
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:50,062
Alright. Fine. Then join the troupe again.

118
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:52,700
Thank you. I'll do my best.

119
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,453
Alright. You can go.

120
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,072
Why does her face look like that?

121
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:04,553
Did something happen?

122
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:06,495
Did you scold her again?

123
00:12:06,495 --> 00:12:07,596
Hey Woo-yah.

124
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,294
Yes, sir.

125
00:12:09,294 --> 00:12:14,402
Can't you find Cho-rim a partner
so she can go on stage?

126
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:17,299
Can't you help her with finding
skit material and stuff?

127
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:19,991
I'm busy. too.

128
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:24,304
You're the type that gets hated
even though you help others.

129
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:29,602
You're going to help others anyway,
so why must you complain about it?

130
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:41,430
Chef.

131
00:12:42,991 --> 00:12:44,926
I came to work.

132
00:12:44,926 --> 00:12:48,998
I'm sorry, Cho-rim. I was busy thinking
about something else.

133
00:12:48,998 --> 00:12:49,991
How do you like working here?

134
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:51,646
Does it suit your personality?

135
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,669
Of course. I will do well, Chef.

136
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:58,340
Good. Take it easy.

137
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,301
- Manager Kim Woo-young.
- Yes, Chef.

138
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:06,138
Oh Cho-rim, I need to explain something to
you, so should we go to the kitchen?

139
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:07,584
Yes, ma'am. I'll be going now.

140
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:22,993
Doctor.

141
00:13:22,993 --> 00:13:25,501
Hello.

142
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,069
Excuse me.

143
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:29,701
I got a job at Chef
Kwon Jae-hee's restaurant.

144
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:31,916
Please stop by.

145
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,379
Dear Choi Eun-seol.

146
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,820
No, Ms. Oh Cho-rim now.

147
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,863
I wanted to apologize to you
ever since we've met.

148
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:56,639
It's because I hoped for you to die.

149
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:59,977
When you came to the hospital
due to a car accident,

150
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:02,912
you had no chance of survival.

151
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:08,799
At that time, my wife was a patient
who was waiting for a heart transplant.

152
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:17,895
I wanted to transplant your heart into
my wife and save her.

153
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:25,626
But you were able to hold on.

154
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:32,229
If I wanted to save my wife,
you had to die quickly.

155
00:14:33,402 --> 00:14:39,797
I took the syringe and went to you
with the intention of murdering you.

156
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:46,308
If I lowered your blood pressure and killed
you, no one would've suspected anything.

157
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:54,896
I sincerely apologize for
having bad intentions.

158
00:14:56,297 --> 00:15:00,909
When I see you now, you look happy.

159
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:05,241
I don't think that I should shatter

bring these books to you.

Yes, it is.

00:32:46,562 --> 00:32:52,054
That's good. Cho-rim goes with the flow
and picks up quickly.

321
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,974
Thank you, Brother Kang.

322
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,792
Don't overdo it.

323
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:03,585
Shuffle. Shuffle.

324
00:33:03,961 --> 00:33:04,950
Losers get a flick of the finger.

325
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,381
One flick for each point.

326
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:06,375
Okay.

327
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:09,375
Let's see. Since there are too many people,
we should divide up in groups.

328
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:10,700
I'll be one team.

329
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,655
I'll be on your team, brother.

330
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:16,277
There's a rumor that you're
quite the gambler.

331
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:18,521
I'm not that good, but I did play a bit.

332
00:33:18,521 --> 00:33:23,111
If I'm on Brother Ki's team, I won't get
flicked. My forehead is precious.

333
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:24,381
The two of you guys are on one team.

334
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:26,257
Isn't that obvious?
There are only two of us left.

335
00:33:26,257 --> 00:33:29,209
Do you know how to play?
You don't look like you can play...

336
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:30,692
Don't underestimate me.

337
00:33:30,692 --> 00:33:32,465
Please deal, brother.

338
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:37,213
Cut it.

339
00:33:37,213 --> 00:33:40,557
I hit it and...

340
00:33:40,557 --> 00:33:41,417
Yeah. I cleared them!

341
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,652
Each of you gets a card...

342
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,603
You failed.

343
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:59,129
Why am I holding the card that
needs to be cleared?

344
00:34:04,406 --> 00:34:06,915
Foreheads.

345
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:10,913
I'll take care of Detective Ki
with this finger.

346
00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:18,762
Detective Choi Moo-gak.

347
00:34:31,562 --> 00:34:34,820
I'll take this card and...

348
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:40,142
I'm about to take these cards. Get ready.

349
00:34:40,142 --> 00:34:42,000
You're not cheating, right?

350
00:34:42,587 --> 00:34:43,338
Cleared.

351
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:53,251
What am I supposed to do with this?

352
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:57,199
Wait. Wait.

353
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,584
Let me take a short break
before getting hit again.

354
00:35:19,144 --> 00:35:24,520
By the way, I don't think I can flick
anymore because my fingers hurt.

355
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:31,961
How about we go with one
punch for every ten flicks?

356
00:35:32,825 --> 00:35:35,131
Yes. Let's do that.

357
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:37,007
We'll be changing players.

358
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:38,299
What?

359
00:35:38,299 --> 00:35:39,713
Move aside.

360
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,316
Please deal.

361
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,766
Deal.

362
00:35:50,446 --> 00:35:53,915
First, let me get a card from each of you.

363
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:59,975
Should I keep going?

364
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:07,683
If I keep going and Brother
Kang wins it, then I'll lose badly.

365
00:36:10,623 --> 00:36:12,360
You haven't played
this game before, have you?

366
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,832
Of course, you should stop here.

367
00:36:13,832 --> 00:36:16,626
I'm holding the finishing card.

368
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,185
He's lying. His body odor is coming
out strongly around his eyes.

369
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:25,857
That means that his body temperature
went up because he's nervous.

370
00:36:25,857 --> 00:36:29,974
I'd lose big if Brother Ki finishes it also.

371
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:33,843
If you're afraid, just fold.

372
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:35,248
He's scared.

373
00:36:35,248 --> 00:36:37,960
His toes are starting to sweat.

374
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,986
It means he's very afraid.

375
00:36:39,986 --> 00:36:41,839
They're holding each other's cards.

376
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,501
That means I should let it go one more turn.

377
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:49,699
I don't know. Let's go one more turn.

378
00:36:55,114 --> 00:37:00,674
Since I let it run three more turns,
I multiply it by 2. That's 72 points.

379
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:03,831
But I gave warning in the beginning
so I multiply it by 2 again.

380
00:37:03,831 --> 00:37:05,052
That makes it 144 points.

381
00:37:05,052 --> 00:37:12,310
Brother Ki and Brother Kang are both missing
cards, so you each owe me 288 points.

382
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:16,258
Hey call the police! She's a total gambler.

383
00:37:16,258 --> 00:37:18,279
We'll round down and make it 280 points.

384
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:22,377
Since we decided to go with one punch
for every 10 flicks, that's 28 punches.

385
00:37:22,377 --> 00:37:25,306
Brothers, please bring your
foreheads forward.

386
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:27,864
Come on! Foreheads.

387
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:35,318
Do it softly.

388
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:38,658
I'm about to start, brother.

389
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:41,208
Oh my goodness.

390
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:50,366
27 punches left.

391
00:38:03,593 --> 00:38:06,555
It looks delicious.

392
00:38:10,886 --> 00:38:12,989
I thought I was going to die
from getting hit.

393
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:15,448
Do I look okay?

394
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:19,462
I'm sorry. Please eat a lot.

395
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:21,450
Yes. Eat a lot everyone.

396
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,455
I thought my head was going to split in two.

397
00:38:24,455 --> 00:38:28,644
Where did you learn to play cards like that?

398
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:32,090
There was a skit called "Gambler"
during the comedy performance.

399
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,942
I learned by getting hit
by my colleagues at that time.

400
00:38:34,942 --> 00:38:36,680
Then you should've said something before.

401
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,365
We finally came out for a day off
and just look at my forehead.

402
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:43,818
Everyone had fun and we're eating good food.

403
00:38:43,818 --> 00:38:45,251
It's great to be out after a long time.

404
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:46,583
Eat!

405
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,696
It would've been nice if
Lt. Yeom had come with us.

406
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:55,845
But don't you think she's keeping
us at a distance?

407
00:38:55,845 --> 00:39:02,414
It's great to catch criminals, but how can
a woman only care about that?

408
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:08,680
Actually, she does have a reason
for being so focused.

409
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,076
Her father was a police officer.

410
00:39:11,076 --> 00:39:19,258
But when she was young, he died on duty
while he was on a robbery case.

411
00:39:19,258 --> 00:39:22,353
Let's eat. Dig in.

412
00:39:29,181 --> 00:39:30,793
Sergeant Yeom Chang-hoon.

413
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,484
Dad.

414
00:39:53,612 --> 00:39:55,528
It's pretty here, so take a picture of me.

415
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:02,250
One, two, three.

416
00:40:04,671 --> 00:40:07,495
Brother Ki, you just ate chicken stew
to improve your health.

417
00:40:07,495 --> 00:40:09,572
Why are you exhausting yourself
by wandering around like that?

418
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:11,755
Listen to me.

419
00:40:11,755 --> 00:40:12,638
This house...

420
00:40:12,638 --> 00:40:14,649
It takes 20 steps from there to there.

421
00:40:14,649 --> 00:40:16,047
Don't you think it's too big?

422
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,447
The rooms inside are small.

423
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:22,178
It reminds me of a detective story
I read a long time ago.

424
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:23,652
The secret room.

425
00:40:23,652 --> 00:40:27,080
Are you saying that since the outside of
the building is big, but the inside of

426
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,590
the building is small, there's a
secret room behind the wall?

427
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,861
Yeah.

428
00:40:31,861 --> 00:40:34,626
That's a common trick that appears
often in mystery comic books.

429
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:36,467
But would it exist for real?

430
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:42,135
I know, right? Who would waste energy
and make rooms like that?

431
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:44,041
Anyway, I became a police officer

432
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,018
because I was so fascinated by
the detectives in those stories.

433
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:48,022
What about you, brother?

434
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:49,729
Being a police officer is
all about the badge.

435
00:40:49,729 --> 00:40:53,014
You show it to them and say
"It's the police." It looks cool.

436
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:54,307
What about you, brother?

437
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:57,250
Being a police officer is all
about the handcuffs.

438
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:02,857
Ma'am, do you need help?

439
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:05,233
No. It's fine. It's fine.

440
00:41:12,688 --> 00:41:16,310
Don't waste energy after eating
and sit down here.

441
00:41:17,773 --> 00:41:21,152
That grandmother just now must be very rich.

442
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:24,772
There aren't that many customers,
but maybe the business is doing well.

443
00:41:24,772 --> 00:41:26,682
There was a strong smell of
money coming from her.

444
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:31,120
If you're good at sniffing out money,
you should pick out a good stock for me.

445
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,623
You can just tell this place doesn't
get a lot of customers, so they're probably

446
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:37,073
just breaking even. What money smell?

447
00:41:37,073 --> 00:41:41,015
I know. This place shouldn't
have a smell of money.

448
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:46,465
Money smell?
What are you talking about?

449
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:49,443
You shouldn't play cards with money.

450
00:41:49,443 --> 00:41:53,877
Sir, I think we need to get support
from the local police station.

451
00:41:53,877 --> 00:41:55,744
Support from the local police station?

452
00:41:55,744 --> 00:41:57,795
Why all of sudden?

453
00:41:57,795 --> 00:42:00,510
I think it's an illegal gambling house.

454
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,902
Gambling house?

455
00:42:03,452 --> 00:42:05,513
There's nobody here.

456
00:42:05,513 --> 00:42:06,715
What house are you talking about?

457
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:08,757
The secret room that
Detective Ki just spoke of...

458
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:11,296
I think there actually is one inside.

459
00:42:23,272 --> 00:42:26,535
We'll all go in on the count of three.

460
00:42:26,535 --> 00:42:29,916
One, two...

461
00:42:42,347 --> 00:42:44,927
Don't let them get away! Catch them!

462
00:42:58,073 --> 00:42:59,447
Are you alright?

463
00:43:02,922 --> 00:43:04,474
Come here.

464
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:09,255
Be quiet and get in quickly.

465
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,880
Get in.

466
00:43:18,282 --> 00:43:19,818
Take off.

467
00:43:27,158 --> 00:43:28,993
Look at these $50 bills.

468
00:43:28,993 --> 00:43:34,543
This is the evidence from the crime scene.

469
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:40,221
Place them under arrest for operating
an illegal gambling house.

470
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:49,262
By the way, detectives, what made you
carry out an undercover investigation?

471
00:43:55,264 --> 00:44:00,696
We were coming into a chicken restaurant,
but it smelled of ramen, not chicken.

472
00:44:00,696 --> 00:44:04,774
The gamblers ordered ramen to eat quickly
and save time, but we came to

473
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:09,417
the restaurant suddenly and
ordered chicken, so it delayed the orders.

474
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:14,565
As time passed, the gamblers began running
out of money and borrowed from the owners.

475
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:18,412
You disguised it as a normal restaurant

476
00:44:18,412 --> 00:44:23,058
by blocking half of the building and
operated an illegal gambling house.

477
00:44:23,058 --> 00:44:27,783
And that's what our boss thought.

478
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,062
Place these people under arrest right away.

479
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:35,307
Yes, sir.

480
00:44:50,189 --> 00:44:52,259
It's Officer Choi.

481
00:45:17,177 --> 00:45:19,381
What is it?

482
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:23,853
My boss wanted me to bring this to you.
It's red bean buns.

483
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:27,113
Jackpot. I really like the buns
from this store.

484
00:45:27,113 --> 00:45:29,225
I'm so thankful.

485
00:45:29,225 --> 00:45:32,191
But why did he send me this all of a sudden?

486
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:36,048
Yeah, well we all got one.

487
00:45:36,048 --> 00:45:40,600
He treated us because he still had some
money left after the chicken restaurant.

488
00:45:41,853 --> 00:45:45,106
Please tell him I said thank you.

489
00:45:45,106 --> 00:45:46,735
By the way, have you had this before?

490
00:45:46,735 --> 00:45:48,005
Should we eat it together?

491
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:49,032
Should I go buy some drinks?

492
00:45:49,032 --> 00:45:50,554
Sit down for a second.

493
00:45:50,554 --> 00:45:52,148
I have something to tell you.

494
00:45:56,846 --> 00:46:02,595
I don't want you to get involved with
investigations from now on.

495
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:07,253
What do you mean?

496
00:46:07,253 --> 00:46:13,632
I don't want you to follow the scents
with your eyes at crime scenes anymore.

497
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:17,204
I said this before, too.

498
00:46:17,204 --> 00:46:22,002
Do you know how I'm feeling these days?

499
00:46:23,342 --> 00:46:30,116
My eye... This eye with a monster-like
color that I can't show anyone...

500
00:46:30,116 --> 00:46:35,793
My eye that I have to hide
with a black lens...

501
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:41,564
I'm so happy that I can do
something with it.

502
00:46:43,265 --> 00:46:51,075
I always wanted to hide it, but now
I feel my eye is useful.

503
00:46:54,008 --> 00:46:58,435
You'll never know how happy
that makes me feel.

504
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:03,974
I'm saying this because it's dangerous.

505
00:47:03,974 --> 00:47:06,581
Do you know how dangerous
it was earlier at the crime scene?

506
00:47:08,454 --> 00:47:14,463
But I'm always next to you at
the crime scenes though.

507
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:28,166
If it gets dangerous,
you just have to protect me.

508
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:35,918
I got to go now.

509
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,288
You're saying he cleared his office
yesterday and day before that, right?

510
00:48:06,288 --> 00:48:10,853
Yes. Dr. Chun is leaving for a
volunteer medical trip to Senegal today.

511
00:48:10,853 --> 00:48:13,222
He's leaving for a volunteer
medical trip today?

512
00:48:16,891 --> 00:48:20,963
Yes, sir. We need to request for
a foreign travel ban on Dr. Chun.

513
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:26,948
Dr. Chun reserved a seat on a morning
flight to Senegal, but he didn't get on.

514
00:48:26,948 --> 00:48:30,613
I reviewed the departure record, but there's
no sign that he left the country.

515
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:33,139
Yes, come in.

516
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:35,979
I should've contacted you before
coming here. I apologize.

517
00:49:35,979 --> 00:49:42,099
It's alright. A morning appointment got
cancelled, so I was just at home.

518
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:48,086
I was just eating lunch. If you
haven't eaten, have some with me.

519
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:49,751
I'll make it for you quickly.

520
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:52,121
That's okay. Let me just ask you
a few questions and I'll leave.

521
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:53,637
Are you sure?

522
00:49:53,637 --> 00:49:55,357
Then please sit over there a moment.

523
00:49:55,357 --> 00:49:56,317
Would you like some coffee?

524
00:49:56,317 --> 00:49:57,534
Yes.

525
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:24,654
When did you see Dr. Chun last?

526
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:27,083
Two nights ago.

527
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:34,582
He said he was going on a volunteer medical
trip to Senegal, so we met one final time.

528
00:50:34,582 --> 00:50:37,518
I think his flight was this morning.

529
00:50:37,928 --> 00:50:40,890
Dr. Chun is still in Korea.

530
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:45,210
Excuse me? What are you talking about?
How can he still be in Korea?

531
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:50,944
We've confirmed he was on
the passenger list of that flight.

532
00:50:50,944 --> 00:50:52,047
There's no way.

533
00:50:52,047 --> 00:50:56,685
When you met him last time,
did he say anything strange or anything?

534
00:50:56,685 --> 00:50:59,474
No. Not at all.

535
00:51:02,095 --> 00:51:10,099
Before he left, he even returned all the
books he had borrowed via delivery.

536
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,275
If Dr. Chun contacts you by any chance,
please contact me immediately.

537
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:20,077
Yes. I understand.

538
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,840
Let's have dinner later.

539
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,350
Yes.

540
00:51:32,822 --> 00:51:36,049
Were you able to get anything from Chef Kwon?

541
00:51:36,049 --> 00:51:40,491
Apparently, he told Chef Kwon that
he was going overseas as well.

542
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:44,929
But it's strange that Dr. Chun openly
talked about going overseas.

543
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:47,343
It's also strange that
he didn't get on the flight.

544
00:51:47,343 --> 00:51:51,120
If he was trying to get away, he wouldn't
have talked about it openly...

545
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,867
He would've tried to get on a flight
before the travel ban,

546
00:51:53,867 --> 00:51:55,578
but he didn't even get on the flight at all?

547
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:57,813
That's right.

548
00:51:57,813 --> 00:52:00,449
I need to see if I can put him
on a wanted list.

Hello.

What's your name?

00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:17,006
My name is Oh Cho-rim.

Would you mind drawing
a heart next to my name?

Please write a few words for me, too.

- Thank you.

00:52:29,674 --> 00:52:31,955
I want one, too!

560
00:52:35,241 --> 00:52:38,010
Oh, you're here.

561
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,938
Who is that? Why are there
so many people gathered?

562
00:52:40,938 --> 00:52:43,617
He's a very popular star these days.
You don't know who he is?

563
00:52:43,617 --> 00:52:45,182
I don't.

564
00:52:45,182 --> 00:52:49,988
Look at this. If you turn his signature
upside down, it's his name.

565
00:52:49,988 --> 00:52:51,669
You still don't know? Even when I do this?

566
00:52:53,202 --> 00:52:54,841
What is this?

567
00:52:54,841 --> 00:52:56,798
It's not a buy-one-get-one-free
item, so take it.

568
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,341
Really? Are you giving this to me?

569
00:52:59,341 --> 00:53:01,202
You have such unique taste,
so I had difficulty picking it out.

570
00:53:01,202 --> 00:53:04,100
Oh my!

571
00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:07,462
Then you picked this out
according to your taste?

572
00:53:07,462 --> 00:53:11,251
I guess you could say that
since I picked it out.

573
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,758
I didn't think you were
this kind of a person.

574
00:53:15,758 --> 00:53:17,226
What is this?

Officer Choi.

These handcuffs are not for criminals.

577
00:53:27,535 --> 00:53:30,180
I'm telling you this so that you don't
misunderstand. This is not what I ordered.

578
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,910
How can they work so carelessly?

579
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,999
What am I going to do with these?

580
00:53:33,999 --> 00:53:36,022
I'll check it.

581
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:46,318
Hello. I'm calling because there's
been a mistake with a package delivery.

582
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:50,891
Ah, so you think it happened
because a wrong barcode was used?

583
00:53:50,891 --> 00:53:54,356
You want me to read you the
whole barcode? The whole thing?

584
00:53:59,353 --> 00:54:02,420
Thick one, thin one,
thicker than the one before,

585
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:05,477
thickest one, thinnest one...

586
00:54:12,589 --> 00:54:15,907
You can see it correctly
if you turn it upside down?

587
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:05,699
These are the barcodes the
murderer carved on the victims' wrists.

588
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:11,135
Although the barcode the culprit carved
isn't as consistent as the actual ones are,

589
00:55:11,135 --> 00:55:20,060
we figured out that there's a certain pattern
after comparing each line.

590
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:27,864
But we couldn't figure out
what these barcodes mean.

591
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:35,002
When I reversed the barcodes
from left to right,

592
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:37,641
I was able to figure out that
they were mimicking real barcodes

593
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:38,739
that are usable in real life.

594
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:42,944
Are you saying the barcodes
carved on their wrists are usable?

595
00:55:42,944 --> 00:55:44,178
Yes, that's right.

596
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:49,037
What are they used for?

597
00:55:49,037 --> 00:55:52,366
Among the 13 numbers
which make up the barcode,

598
00:55:52,366 --> 00:55:57,380
the first three common numbers, 978,
indicate that they're for books.

599
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,256
Next numbers, 89, indicate
the Republic of Korea.

600
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:04,623
And 86755 indicates which
publishing company it is.

601
00:56:04,623 --> 00:56:07,581
In other words, these 5 barcodes
are describing books published

602
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:12,906
by one Korean publishing company.

603
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:20,426
ISBN... stands for International
Standard Book Number.

604
00:56:21,017 --> 00:56:25,548
You're talking about what all books have?
Like this one?

605
00:57:12,213 --> 00:57:15,572
What do those title identification
numbers mean at the end?

606
00:57:15,572 --> 00:57:19,356
They indicate the publication
order of the books.

607
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:26,782
But the order of publication matches
the order of the murders.

608
00:57:28,216 --> 00:57:32,926
As you can see, the number of
the professor in his 60s

609
00:57:32,926 --> 00:57:36,556
who was the first victim of
the serial murders is 01.

610
00:57:36,556 --> 00:57:39,782
The second victims,
the diver couple's number is 02.

611
00:57:39,782 --> 00:57:43,554
The third victim, the mountain climber,
the fourth victim, the exorcist,

612
00:57:43,554 --> 00:57:46,796
and the last victim Joo Ma-ri...

613
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,123
Their numbers were 03, 04,
and 05, respectively.

614
00:57:49,123 --> 00:57:55,464
So the murderer is carving the order of the
murders in the form of book barcodes.

615
00:57:56,901 --> 00:57:58,281
He's a real psycho.

616
00:57:58,281 --> 00:58:01,007
He seems like someone
who knows a lot about books.

617
00:58:01,007 --> 00:58:05,115
The murderer is presenting
the victims as a single book.

618
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:09,124
If there is a next victim,
the victim's barcode will be like this.

619
00:58:09,124 --> 00:58:10,813
978...

620
00:58:19,419 --> 00:58:21,229
89...

621
00:58:23,304 --> 00:58:26,084
86755...

622
00:58:27,923 --> 00:58:36,084
And the ID number to indicate
the sixth victim will be 06.

623
00:58:36,084 --> 00:58:44,217
If this barcode is real,
the last number will be 0.

624
00:58:46,951 --> 00:58:49,191
