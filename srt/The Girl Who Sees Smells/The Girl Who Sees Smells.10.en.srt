[Episode 10]

2
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,737
The person whom Cho-rim remembers is a
victim of the diver couple murder case.

3
00:00:31,337 --> 00:00:32,905
For composite sketches, it's important
to find something particular

4
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:35,228
describe something particular
about each part of the face.

5
00:00:35,228 --> 00:00:39,718
The first impression it
provides is important.

6
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:41,937
You must also confirm the height, too.

7
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:44,808
You might be surprised by
how much shorter the actual person is.

8
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:46,347
I guess that's possible, too.

9
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:47,717
Lt. Yeom must be here already.

10
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:49,009
She should be.

11
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:52,622
She is here.

12
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:56,310
Hello, Lt. Yeom!

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,231
Didn't you say that you'd finish
her composite sketch today?

14
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:06,596
You came together?

15
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:12,710
Should we finish the composite sketch?

16
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,445
Yes.

17
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:19,706
I had my first TV show taping today.

18
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:23,092
But after it was finished,
I couldn't remember a thing.

19
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:25,322
It completely disappeared from my mind.

20
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:27,095
Have you had that kind of experience before?

21
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:29,156
Don't you think there's a problem with me?

22
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,505
I'll wait here.

23
00:01:32,505 --> 00:01:34,433
Why? Don't you want to come with us?

24
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:37,839
I think the two of you need to focus
on the composite sketch.

25
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:44,129
Don't talk about useless things and
tell her what you remember carefully.

26
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,868
He's always telling me, "Don't do this.
Don't do that. Don't, don't, don't."

27
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:49,915
Then should we go?

28
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:50,767
Yes.

29
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:06,074
Cho-rim.

30
00:02:06,074 --> 00:02:06,865
Yes.

31
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:08,903
Should we get some beverages?

32
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:10,291
Yes. I'll go buy some.

33
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,775
Here.

34
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:15,408
I'll have one without carbonation.

35
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:17,416
Yes, got it. I'll be right back.

36
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:50,596
Here.

37
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:53,545
Here's the change.

38
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:54,416
Thanks.

39
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:58,642
Is the composite sketch
the same from last night?

40
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:04,420
What do you think about these eyes?

41
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:09,161
No. They were smiling more.

42
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:13,850
Don't you think the shape
of the mouth is different?

43
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,935
This doesn't feel right.

44
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:17,903
What's different?

45
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:23,442
Cho-rim, should we just start over?

46
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:24,783
Would that be alright?

47
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:25,927
It must be tiring for you.

48
00:03:25,927 --> 00:03:29,990
It's alright. Should we start?

49
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,261
No. I didn't describe it well.

50
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:47,032
I'm sorry. It would've been great if it
turned out the way you had remembered it.

51
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:50,496
The composite sketch didn't turn out well?

52
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,742
I see.

53
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:58,212
Thank you so much for working on it
till late, Lt. Yeom.

54
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:00,099
I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

55
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,757
No, I'm so thankful.

56
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:05,405
I have some more work to do.

57
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:06,778
Goodbye.

58
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:08,254
Yes. Thank you.

59
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:09,622
Thank you.

[Family Register]

61
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:43,389
Oh Jae-pyo?

62
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,790
Why are you more disappointed than I am?

63
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,364
It was the first face that
you were able to remember.

64
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:56,468
It's disappointing we
couldn't find out anything.

65
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:59,785
Cheer up. I'm sure I'll remember more.

66
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:03,564
If you're trying to cheer me up, then you
should just buy me a cold beer or something.

67
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:06,572
Alright. Let's knock one back.

68
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:10,403
Knock one back?

69
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:18,013
I'm certain the diver couples'
daughter is a witness.

70
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,982
Why are you hiding her?

71
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:22,027
Where is the witness right now?

72
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,662
Why would I hide her?

73
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:27,591
I'm certain that she didn't wake up from
her coma and died soon after.

74
00:05:28,922 --> 00:05:35,857
The witness whom Oh Jae-pyo was
trying to hide is Oh Cho-rim?

75
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:46,483
I'm sorry. I thought it was
the women's restroom.

76
00:05:46,796 --> 00:05:48,654
I must be crazy.

77
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:55,750
Oh my goodness.

78
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,102
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:58,531 --> 00:05:59,999
Wasn't that the women's restroom?

80
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:02,881
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:05,137
He's a pervert. A pervert.

82
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,844
What is this?

83
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,599
He jumped down.

84
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:45,728
What's going on? Some people were running
around and yelling, "Pervert! A pervert!"

85
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:48,714
Let's go catch that pervert.

86
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:49,914
What?

87
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:56,011
He jumped down here from over there.

88
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:03,095
There isn't anything special about

89
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:05,564
his right footprint, but his left footprint
reeks of a cigarette smell.

90
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:08,491
Then he must be a thoughtless guy
who smokes cigarettes and

91
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:13,005
has a habit of putting out
his cigarettes with his left foot.

92
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:15,641
He went that way.

93
00:07:28,342 --> 00:07:30,685
The scent of his footstep stops here.

94
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:34,067
He got away by bicycle.

95
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,836
He would've left it there.

96
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:37,566
What does that pervert look like?

97
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,158
He had a pink shirt on.

98
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,083
You'll know as soon as you see him.

99
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,571
Okay. I'll try over there.

100
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:04,456
Stop right there, you pervert!

101
00:08:31,216 --> 00:08:32,610
Are you alright?

102
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,893
That could've been bad!

103
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:44,100
What's wrong? Are you alright?

104
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:53,611
I... I just saw the moment of
my car accident.

105
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:31,500
Come here.

106
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,971
It's alright. It's alright.

107
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,365
It looks as if you're slowly
regaining your memory.

108
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:11,915
But I only remember that
I was in an accident.

109
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:15,350
I don't remember the reason
I was in an accident at all.

110
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:16,984
That's better than nothing.

111
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,622
It's just the beginning.

112
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:23,996
But why do you think I'm feeling afraid?

113
00:10:24,668 --> 00:10:26,686
It's probably because it's the first time
you're remembering it.

114
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:29,765
Don't you think you'll be at ease
when you remember more?

115
00:10:48,044 --> 00:10:50,763
Oh Cho-rim, come over here and
scratch this for me.

116
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:53,160
Where?

117
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,520
Here.

118
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,394
Here?

119
00:10:55,394 --> 00:10:56,729
A little higher.

120
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:58,271
Here.

121
00:10:58,271 --> 00:10:59,897
A little to the left.

122
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:02,291
Here.

123
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,631
You got it.

124
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:09,021
Were you itchy?

125
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:13,100
Could you feel that?

126
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,585
I think so. It was itchy?

127
00:11:19,337 --> 00:11:21,186
Can you feel that?

128
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:23,154
No.

129
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,866
Can you feel that?

130
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:28,857
No.

131
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:33,907
Can you feel that?

132
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:35,843
Can't you feel that?

133
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:42,033
I see...

134
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:47,117
Try over here to see if I feel anything.

135
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:01,609
Was that too weak?

136
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:02,828
Did I not feel that because it was too weak?

137
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:04,803
That's enough.

138
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:11,791
It's itchy.

139
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,605
Did you feel that? Did you feel that?

140
00:12:14,605 --> 00:12:18,931
Yeah. It was itchy. I felt it.

141
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:26,238
What's wrong with you?

142
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:33,010
What's wrong? There's only two of us here.

143
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,822
A chef doesn't have much to do.

144
00:12:38,822 --> 00:12:42,373
Just picking out good ingredients
will get you more than halfway.

145
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:50,208
Return the shrimp and tell them
that we'll stop doing business

146
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,004
with them if they send
it like this again.

147
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:51,874
Do you understand?

148
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:53,402
Yes, sir.

149
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,845
Hello, Chef.

150
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:03,611
Cho-rim, why did you come to work so early?

151
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:06,692
The servers aren't supposed to
come to work for another two hours.

152
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:12,197
I came early because I wanted to
see how the chefs prepare in the kitchen.

153
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:17,296
Come here.

154
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:29,040
By the way... there's something
I wanted to ask you, too.

155
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,277
Me?

156
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,986
Yes. Picking out ingredients is
the most important thing to chefs.

157
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:38,306
That's because we have to use
fresh ingredients with good quality

158
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:40,927
in order to bring out the proper taste.

159
00:13:40,927 --> 00:13:45,300
How do performers like you
choose your material?

160
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,569
Oh that... You know how women think
about what they need to do to

161
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:52,997
look pretty when they
look at cosmetics, right?

162
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:57,570
But the first thing we think about is
what we have to say to make them laugh.

163
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:03,432
You can't laugh already, Chef!

164
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:06,113
Even when you look
at ingredients like these...

165
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:08,518
I'll use what's been cut already.

166
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:13,546
This isn't much, but if I do this?

167
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:19,465
Even for something like this,
placement is really important.

168
00:14:19,465 --> 00:14:20,703
Take a look.

169
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:23,547
If I put it below my eye, it looks
like a tear, so it's not funny at all.

170
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:24,503
This should...

171
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,209
The best place to put this is
right next to my nose.

172
00:14:33,132 --> 00:14:35,351
It's nothing special.

173
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:37,583
No, it's not that.

174
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,838
I thought it wouldn't be that funny
since I see you a lot.

175
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:43,824
But when I see it up close,
it's really funny.

176
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:47,059
Then I'll be cleaning the hall.

177
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:50,149
Cho-rim.

178
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:50,998
Yes.

179
00:14:50,998 --> 00:14:54,508
I think you're a very interesting person.

180
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:57,652
That's a compliment, right? Thank you.

181
00:14:57,652 --> 00:15:02,501
It makes me want to know what
kind of person you are.

182
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,640
Then keep up the good work.

183
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,962
Lieutenant Yeom, are you going somewhere?

184
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:25,691
Yes. I have an appointment.

185
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:31,337
I went to the building where Oh Jae-pyo
was last time, but they said he quit.

186
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:33,815
His phone number is also
no longer in service.

187
00:15:35,357 --> 00:15:39,434
I think he went into hiding on purpose.

188
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:42,481
We have to find him no matter what.

189
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:46,199
If the culprit finds the witness first,
the witness will be in danger.

190
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,385
That's why we have to find
Oh Jae-pyo quickly.

191
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:51,816
Yes. We have to let the witness
know that she's in danger.

192
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:04,694
The composite sketch
should've come out better.

193
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:06,669
I wanted to see you because
I felt bad about it.

194
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:10,850
You don't need to think of it like that.
I'm the one who's thankful.

195
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,113
I shouldn't be asking you this but...

196
00:16:15,113 --> 00:16:18,001
You said you don't remember anything, right?

197
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:22,029
Yes. I don't have any memories
before three years ago.

198
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:26,920
Three years ago? That's the year the murder
of the diver couple took place.

199
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,746
Did you perhaps ever remember
that face before?

200
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:32,874
No. It was the first time.

201
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:35,869
How did you remember it?

202
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,060
It happened while I was eating seaweed soup.

203
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,913
It was a sea-urchin-seaweed soup
with abalone shells in it.

204
00:16:42,913 --> 00:16:44,773
Abalone shells?

205
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:48,881
Do you think the abalone shells could
help me regain my lost memories?

206
00:16:49,728 --> 00:16:52,918
They say you don't forget the tastes
you experienced when you were young.

207
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:57,159
There's apparently scientific proof for that.

208
00:16:57,712 --> 00:17:01,276
Let's say someone who hated beans when he was
young starts eating beans when he's older.

209
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:06,621
They say it's because the sleeping
palate has been awakened.

210
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:12,648
I think the sea-urchin-seaweed soup
with abalone shell could've been the

211
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:16,051
medium that brought back your lost memory.

212
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:22,563
You're the smartest person I know.

213
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:33,533
Could the person you're remembering
be your mother?

214
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:40,123
No. My dad told me my mom had passed
away before I lost my memories.

215
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:43,848
I know because my dad showed me a picture of
my mom. The woman I remembered wasn't my mom.

216
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,295
Yes.

217
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:53,598
It's delicious and refreshing...

218
00:17:57,406 --> 00:18:00,956
Cho-rim, thank you for your hard
work on creating the composite sketch.

219
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,577
Not at all.

220
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:05,752
Did it come out the way you described?

221
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,889
It's almost exact.

222
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:09,368
Then he's almost caught.

223
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:15,695
And he probably has a habit of putting
out his cigarettes with his left foot.

224
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:30,404
You shouldn't be smoking
in a non-smoking area.

225
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:33,242
You shouldn't take lewd pictures either.

226
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:34,652
Why are you doing this?

227
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:37,419
Do you have any proof?

228
00:18:39,191 --> 00:18:41,594
It's a perfect match!

229
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:50,111
I'm sure you're all exhausted from
the self-defense training.

230
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:52,075
So should we all have regular ox-bone soup?

231
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:53,872
Then 6 ox-bone soups?

232
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:56,906
I'll have ox-knee soup
instead of ox-bone soup.

233
00:18:56,906 --> 00:19:00,599
What? Don't you know we should all order
the cheapest item when he's treating?

234
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,609
We'll all have ox-bone soup.

235
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,464
Why are you saying that? Eat what you want.

236
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:08,291
I'm just craving regular ox-bone soup.

237
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,444
You're just saying that.

238
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:13,773
Sir. Please sit over here.

239
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:18,823
You're all working hard
because of a difficult case.

240
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:20,768
How's the injury from the assault?

241
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:22,827
Yes. It's fine.

242
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:26,310
Don't neglect your self-defense training.

243
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,259
Yes, sir.

244
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:31,197
I'll take care of the bill, so order
what you want.

245
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:34,071
Thank you.

246
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:42,889
Ma'am! Instead of ox-bone soup,
we'll all have ox-knee soup!

247
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:46,008
Spicy, braised oxtails!

248
00:19:48,764 --> 00:19:51,163
Isn't that the captain's?

249
00:19:53,372 --> 00:19:54,552
Take it to him, Detective Ki.

250
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:57,776
Yes. What are you waiting for?

251
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:00,142
You heard him, right?

252
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:00,906
Yes.

253
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:52,416
It's been a while, sir.

254
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:56,287
Jae-pyo, I told you to take it easy and
work at a security company.

255
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:58,722
Why are you making it hard on yourself?

256
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:01,100
The barcode serial murder case...

257
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,934
Who is the culprit?

258
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:05,857
If we knew, we would've caught him already.

259
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:08,009
You quit the force because of that case.

260
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:09,553
Do you still have regrets about it?

261
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:13,579
Since it's the case that made me quit,
I can't just forget it.

262
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:17,741
I can't give you information from the
investigation. I can't.

263
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:23,857
I don't want to talk about you to
other people either.

264
00:21:25,581 --> 00:21:28,151
If you're worried about people around you,

265
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:32,432
please bring the investigative
material to where I am.

266
00:22:01,963 --> 00:22:06,599
Anyway... I'll come by soon.

267
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,096
Yes, sir.

268
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:23,341
Would you like to order?

269
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:25,818
I'll have iced coffee and
may I use your memo pad?

270
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:28,293
Yes. Here it is.

271
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,210
[Lt. Yeom]

272
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:18,444
Hello.

273
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:20,371
I found out where Oh Jae-pyo is staying.

274
00:23:20,371 --> 00:23:22,667
You found out his new address?

275
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:28,071
Yes. This time we must ask him to give the
details about the barcode-murder witness.

276
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,782
I'll head over there now.

277
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:32,169
No. I'll go.

278
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:34,359
What's the address?

279
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:39,242
Gangwon Province, Wonju City,
17 of Yidang Neighborhood.

280
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,336
The police are looking for the witness, too.

281
00:24:00,627 --> 00:24:02,150
I found out where Oh Jae-pyo is staying.

282
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,380
You found out his new address?

283
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,747
Yes. This time we must ask him to give the
details about the barcode-murder witness.

284
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:11,499
I'll head over there now.

285
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:13,884
No. I'll go.

286
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:15,861
What's the address?

287
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:19,386
Gangwon Province, Wonju City,
17 of Yidang Neighborhood.

288
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,381
He's caught.

289
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:52,298
The serial killer has been caught.

290
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:54,120
What are you talking about?

291
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,124
Are you saying that the barcode
serial killer has been caught?

292
00:24:57,124 --> 00:25:02,984
Isn't the jerk who ran away and left his
bloodstain on the rebar the serial killer?

293
00:25:02,984 --> 00:25:07,450
That's right. He ran away from us
and left his bloodstain.

294
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,649
They found the same DNA as that bloodstain.

295
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:12,017
It's a genetic match.

296
00:25:12,017 --> 00:25:13,919
Is that true?

297
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,625
Where is that guy?

298
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:18,377
He's on his way to our station.

299
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:19,984
Who is it?

300
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:23,481
Who is the serial killer who's been caught?

301
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,958
They say he's an arsonist.

302
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,503
Excuse me?

303
00:25:27,503 --> 00:25:32,434
It's a genetic match, but he's an arsonist.

304
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:37,504
We're patrolling the area because
an arson happened nearby.

305
00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:41,986
Then the guy I was pursuing was the arsonist?

306
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:44,821
They found the shirt that matches
the ripped shirt piece left on the rebar

307
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:49,370
at the arsonist's house and
he has a record of previous arson.

308
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:56,181
Then were we chasing the wrong
guy all this time?

309
00:25:59,632 --> 00:26:01,898
That's when they switched.

310
00:26:01,898 --> 00:26:03,213
The culprit was still at
the construction site

311
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:09,009
and I chased after the arsonist
because he had run away.

312
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:22,774
Then why did Kwon Jae-hee
have a wound on his arm?

313
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:24,985
As though he was injured from a rebar...

314
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,293
That's why we thought
Kwon Jae-hee was the culprit.

315
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:32,131
But we were floored when
the DNA didn't match.

316
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:36,803
Then, are you saying that he injured
his arm on purpose to mislead us?

317
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,879
He was at the construction site.

318
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:40,859
He couldn't have known unless
he saw it personally.

319
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:45,164
Kwon Jae-hee was clearly
at the construction site.

320
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,694
Then the person who was at the
storage site was also Kwon Jae-hee.

321
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:56,573
I'll be right back.

322
00:27:40,766 --> 00:27:42,213
Yes. This is Choi Moo-gak.

323
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:43,680
This is Chun Baek-gyung.

324
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,606
I have something I must tell you.

325
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:05,379
Chun Baek-gyung...

326
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:07,491
What did you want to tell me?

327
00:28:23,183 --> 00:28:25,219
Why is there a gap here?

328
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:48,367
Welcome.

329
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:50,006
For one person?

330
00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:53,863
Yes. Is there someone named Oh Jae-pyo here?

331
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:56,476
Oh Jae-pyo?

332
00:28:56,476 --> 00:28:58,414
Isn't there someone new who came recently?

333
00:28:58,414 --> 00:29:02,702
Oh, I think you're talking
about Detective Oh.

334
00:29:03,048 --> 00:29:05,224
Ah yes. Detective Oh.

335
00:29:05,224 --> 00:29:07,751
He's the one who's parking the cars outside.

336
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:09,383
Yes. Thank you. Goodbye.

337
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:10,728
Goodbye.

338
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:21,508
Please go in. I'll park the car.

339
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:25,594
Detective Oh.

340
00:29:25,594 --> 00:29:27,139
Why are you doing this?

341
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:29,808
I told you that you don't have to do this.

342
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:32,778
Why do you keep calling me detective
when I quit being one a long time ago?

343
00:29:32,778 --> 00:29:36,972
As long as you're staying at my house,
I can't stand seeing you doing this.

344
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:38,569
I should at least pay for my meals.

345
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,204
Don't worry about me.

346
00:29:40,204 --> 00:29:42,894
It's busy right now, so go inside quickly.

347
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:45,166
Sir. It's busy right now. Come quickly.

348
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:48,360
I said stop doing that.

349
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,053
I'm coming.

350
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,136
I'm sorry.

351
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,549
Are you hurt badly?

352
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:10,029
No. I think I'm fine.

353
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:11,081
I'm really sorry.

354
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:14,500
I was thinking about something, so
I didn't see you.

355
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,953
You should go to the hospital.

356
00:30:15,953 --> 00:30:18,632
It's alright.

357
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:21,114
It's my negligence.

358
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:22,704
I'll give you my contact information.

359
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:23,937
Please contact me
if you have further problems.

360
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:28,701
People make mistakes. It's alright.

361
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:30,798
I think you should go to the hospital.

362
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:32,261
Let's go.

363
00:30:34,475 --> 00:30:36,572
I'll drive you.

364
00:30:36,572 --> 00:30:39,832
Yes. Thank you.

365
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,287
Thank you. Goodbye.

366
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:28,115
I'm here to see Oh Jae-pyo.

367
00:31:28,894 --> 00:31:30,485
Who?

368
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:32,831
Oh Jae-pyo.

369
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:35,297
I don't know anyone by that name.

370
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:46,800
I should be the one paying
for the hospital fee.

371
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,582
You shouldn't have paid for it.

372
00:31:49,582 --> 00:31:52,818
It's alright. You didn't do it on purpose.

373
00:31:52,818 --> 00:31:55,142
I'm so sorry.

374
00:31:55,142 --> 00:31:57,428
You didn't even get to eat yet.

375
00:31:57,428 --> 00:31:58,988
I can eat when I get to Seoul.

376
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:01,558
You should go back now.

377
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:07,016
I'm so sorry. Would it be okay if I treat
you to a meal at a nearby restaurant?

378
00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:09,532
No. It's alright.

379
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:12,061
If you're not in a hurry, please allow me.

380
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:15,574
I'd feel too bad if you don't.

381
00:32:16,975 --> 00:32:21,027
Then should we have tea somewhere?

382
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:25,050
I'd like to ask you something.

383
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,260
Yes.

384
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,390
Is there anyone named Oh Jae-pyo here?

385
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,982
I don't know.

386
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,092
Yes.

387
00:32:35,092 --> 00:32:36,722
Please enjoy.

388
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:01,053
[Oh Cho-rim]

389
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:04,697
Yes, Oh Cho-rim.

390
00:33:04,697 --> 00:33:08,394
Officer Choi.

391
00:33:08,394 --> 00:33:09,983
What is it? I'm going to see you later.

392
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:12,603
Let's delay our meeting time by two hours.

393
00:33:12,603 --> 00:33:13,799
Why?

394
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,529
Do you want to see me that quickly?

395
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:17,292
Tell me. Why do you want to make it later?

396
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:18,737
I told you that there's a get-together
with the production crew

397
00:33:18,737 --> 00:33:23,008
from the TV show at Chef
Kwon's house today.

398
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:25,159
Don't eat too much there.

399
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:26,585
You have to eat with me.

400
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:27,605
But Chef Kwon pushed back
the get-together

401
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,935
by two hours because he's coming
back from a different province.

402
00:33:29,935 --> 00:33:34,056
So our meeting automatically got
pushed back by two hours also.

403
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:35,876
I have to go. I'm hanging up.

404
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:49,518
Kwon Jae-hee...

405
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,313
Please turn the car around.

406
00:33:53,313 --> 00:33:54,157
The destination has changed.

407
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:54,871
Yes.

408
00:34:05,236 --> 00:34:07,370
I arrived at the address that you gave me.

409
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,346
There's no trace of Oh Jae-pyo here.

410
00:34:25,568 --> 00:34:27,473
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

411
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:31,176
I arrived at the address that you gave me.

412
00:34:31,176 --> 00:34:34,058
There's no trace of Oh Jae-pyo here.

413
00:34:35,435 --> 00:34:37,233
It's the right address.

414
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:41,961
What about the possibility of
Oh Jae-pyo using an alias?

415
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:45,644
I'll stay here for one more hour and
then return to the precinct.

416
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:48,696
I understand.

417
00:35:04,495 --> 00:35:07,042
I'm sorry. Please go ahead.

418
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,482
Yes. They said it wasn't a major
injury to your back, so I'm relieved.

419
00:35:13,482 --> 00:35:14,687
Yes.

420
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:26,797
You're Chef Kwon, right?

421
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:29,458
Yes. That's right. I'm Kwon Jae-hee.

422
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:31,336
The power of TV is amazing.

423
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:34,340
I sometimes get recognized by people.

424
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:40,561
I know you more as someone related
to the victim of a serial murder case.

425
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,341
Excuse me?

426
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:48,330
You had a close relationship with
the fashion model Joo Ma-ri, right?

427
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:51,357
Yes. It was in the newspaper article but...

428
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:57,315
I'm aware of it because the case
is of interest to me.

429
00:35:57,315 --> 00:35:59,260
I see.

430
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:17,238
By the way, is it okay for
a police officer to be doing this?

431
00:36:17,238 --> 00:36:20,454
I'm trying to catch a criminal like you.

432
00:36:20,454 --> 00:36:27,526
Okay. But from now on, I won't do anything
like this even if you ask me.

433
00:36:27,526 --> 00:36:29,320
Me neither.

434
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,398
Thanks. I'll call you later.

435
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:48,481
Thank you.

436
00:37:11,977 --> 00:37:14,360
I'll get going then.

437
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,364
Yes. If have any pain later, please call
me at the number I gave you.

438
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,180
Yes. I understand.

439
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,378
Be careful on your way back.

440
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:24,207
Okay.

441
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:18,361
Yes, Chef. This is Oh Cho-rim.

442
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:23,109
Yes, Cho-rim. I got done a little early,
so I'm on my way home right now.

443
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:25,662
You can come as soon as you're ready.

444
00:38:25,662 --> 00:38:27,940
Yes, Chef. I'll be there as soon as possible.

445
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,360
Yes. Okay. I'll see you at home then.

446
00:40:18,086 --> 00:40:19,378
Chef.

447
00:40:20,582 --> 00:40:23,542
Aren't you tired? Why did you run over here?

448
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:26,419
I was worried I'd get here later than you.

449
00:40:26,419 --> 00:40:28,498
Come in. The staff will be here soon.

450
00:40:28,498 --> 00:40:29,476
Yes.

451
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,763
Moong-chi.

452
00:41:00,862 --> 00:41:02,429
I'll be right back after I get changed.

453
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:03,909
Yes, Chef.

454
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:17,558
What is that? It's Officer Choi's scent.

455
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,003
Oh my...

456
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,764
Oh my... What should I do?

457
00:41:30,764 --> 00:41:32,503
Are you alright?

458
00:41:32,918 --> 00:41:37,376
I'm sorry, Chef. I was thinking about
something else and suddenly broke the glass.

459
00:41:37,376 --> 00:41:38,710
Don't touch it.

460
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,915
No. I'll clean it up.

461
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,082
I'll clean it up, so stand back.

462
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:49,267
I'm so sorry. Do you have a broom
for me to clean this up?

463
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:51,409
Wait just a moment.

464
00:42:18,978 --> 00:42:21,814
Why I've never in my life...

465
00:42:21,814 --> 00:42:26,185
When I think about how my heart
was pounding earlier...

466
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:30,772
What would you have done
if I hadn't seen your scent?

467
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:34,693
If you were caught, you would be a thief.

468
00:42:35,227 --> 00:42:36,492
Thank you for that.

469
00:42:36,492 --> 00:42:38,705
Just why were you there?

470
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:41,026
Just because.

471
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:44,280
Again! You're trying to
dodge the question again!

472
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:47,539
I was trying to investigate Chef Kwon.

473
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:49,534
Just what are you trying to investigate?

474
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:52,177
You can just openly investigate him.

475
00:42:52,177 --> 00:42:57,449
It's a long story, but
I'm suspicious of Chef Kwon.

476
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:01,457
Even if that's the case, should you or
shouldn't you trespass as a police officer?

477
00:43:01,457 --> 00:43:05,305
I can do whatever it takes to
catch my sister's killer.

478
00:43:05,305 --> 00:43:08,124
If I can catch that jerk,
I can do whatever it takes.

479
00:43:08,651 --> 00:43:12,820
Do you know how it feels to
see your family dead before your eyes?

480
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:18,095
My sister I just spoke to a moment
earlier was dead before my eyes.

481
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,639
Do you know how that feels?

482
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:36,952
I'm sorry for getting angry.

483
00:43:36,952 --> 00:43:38,359
No, it's okay.

484
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:42,428
Was your sister pretty? Prettier than I am?

485
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:48,372
I don't know about other things, but
my sister was the prettiest on Jeju Island.

486
00:43:56,108 --> 00:43:58,551
I guess she looked like that.

487
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:01,898
The level of beauty on
Jeju Island isn't that great.

488
00:44:01,898 --> 00:44:03,113
Oh Cho-rim.

489
00:44:06,169 --> 00:44:08,087
Do you have a picture?

490
00:44:20,162 --> 00:44:21,824
What did you mean by that?

491
00:44:21,824 --> 00:44:25,127
I'm about to get mad.

492
00:44:26,341 --> 00:44:29,213
What was your sister's name?

493
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:32,544
Choi Eun-seol.

494
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:36,879
It's a name that fits her face well.

495
00:44:36,879 --> 00:44:38,447
Choi Eun-seol.

496
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:42,187
That's enough. Stop looking at it.

497
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:49,367
I'm envious. I wish I had a brother like you.

498
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:53,029
I'm going to go find a brother
who only cares about me.

499
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,105
When's it coming on?

500
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:12,994
I think it's coming on soon.

501
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:15,622
It's on!

502
00:45:15,622 --> 00:45:20,824
I'll show you how to make
a delicious burger today.

503
00:45:20,824 --> 00:45:27,957
You have to beat up the patty
this much for it to be delicious.

504
00:45:27,957 --> 00:45:33,136
But you're saying the patty becomes burnt
and dry every time you cook it?

505
00:45:33,136 --> 00:45:37,610
Use an ice cube like this when that happens.

506
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,338
What you do is...

507
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:44,418
Put it on the frying pan and
circle it around.

508
00:45:44,418 --> 00:45:48,584
You have put it in the
center of the patty... like this.

509
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:50,298
Then cover it up with a lid.

510
00:45:50,298 --> 00:45:55,027
Cook it for 8 minutes, then
the burger is done.

511
00:45:55,027 --> 00:45:56,521
Like this...

512
00:45:56,521 --> 00:45:58,054
I'll try it.

513
00:46:04,676 --> 00:46:09,575
Are you asking me how that happens?

514
00:46:09,575 --> 00:46:12,064
Something like that will give you a headache.

515
00:46:12,064 --> 00:46:13,469
Don't you think so?

516
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:14,744
This has been "Cook Room Era."

517
00:46:14,744 --> 00:46:18,012
I'm Oh Cho-rim. Thank you.

518
00:46:20,754 --> 00:46:22,018
Wasn't that so weird?

519
00:46:22,018 --> 00:46:25,484
The dress I bought you was so pretty.

520
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,860
You can't be helped.

521
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,369
Why did your face look so big?

522
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:39,117
Just kidding.

523
00:46:39,117 --> 00:46:40,940
Congratulations on your first broadcast!

524
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,813
Oh Cho-rim. It's me, Detective Kang.

525
00:46:43,813 --> 00:46:46,145
Let me get your autograph next time.

526
00:46:46,145 --> 00:46:49,423
Slurp.

527
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:52,585
Much congratulations.

528
00:46:54,532 --> 00:46:57,588
Hey Cho-rim. It's Julian.

529
00:46:57,588 --> 00:47:01,654
I saw you on TV. Congratulations!

530
00:47:01,654 --> 00:47:04,125
Treat me next time. Got it?

531
00:47:05,237 --> 00:47:07,514
TV is really powerful.

532
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:09,728
He's a guy I met when I
was going to an English school.

533
00:47:09,728 --> 00:47:12,746
I just got a text from him saying
that he saw me on TV.

534
00:47:13,007 --> 00:47:14,095
That's amazing.

535
00:47:14,095 --> 00:47:16,303
Did you date a foreigner?

536
00:47:16,743 --> 00:47:18,282
Be quiet.

537
00:47:20,381 --> 00:47:22,414
Anyway, congratulations on
your first broadcast.

538
00:47:22,414 --> 00:47:26,180
I'll clean up, so you just rest.

539
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,678
I can't let you do that.

540
00:47:32,314 --> 00:47:38,297
I like to cook, but I hate dishwashing.

541
00:47:38,297 --> 00:47:39,553
Thank you.

542
00:47:39,553 --> 00:47:41,567
I like dishwashing more.

543
00:47:53,608 --> 00:47:57,538
Which do you hate more? Folding laundry
or hanging laundry?

544
00:47:57,538 --> 00:47:59,378
Hanging laundry.

545
00:47:59,378 --> 00:48:00,972
You're opposite of me.

546
00:48:00,972 --> 00:48:02,796
That's good.

547
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:07,884
Then do you sleep with the lights on or off?

548
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,094
I sleep with the lights off.

549
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,593
Same as me.

550
00:48:10,593 --> 00:48:13,707
That's good, too.

551
00:48:13,707 --> 00:48:19,916
Then do you eat something delicious first
or not-so-delicious food first when you eat?

552
00:48:19,916 --> 00:48:23,208
I'm not sure about that since
I've never thought about it.

553
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:04,656
The fact that I like dishwashing
more than cooking...

554
00:49:04,656 --> 00:49:07,444
That I like to sleep with the lights off...

555
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:11,550
The fact that I like folding laundry
more than hanging them...

556
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:14,138
I realized all of that after I met you.

557
00:49:16,049 --> 00:49:22,660
In the future, keep letting me know what kind
of person I am by being by my side, okay?

558
00:49:23,554 --> 00:49:26,476
Yes. I will do my best.

559
00:49:41,321 --> 00:49:43,268
That surprised you, right? I'm sorry.

560
00:49:43,268 --> 00:49:44,982
It's quite slippery.

561
00:49:57,269 --> 00:50:03,476
Hey, Oh Cho-rim. Are you alright?

562
00:50:19,118 --> 00:50:21,715
Are you awake?

563
00:50:21,882 --> 00:50:23,855
Are you alright now?

564
00:50:26,855 --> 00:50:29,027
I'm fine.

565
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,479
That's a relief.

566
00:50:35,912 --> 00:50:38,478
Why am I so sleepy?

567
00:50:38,478 --> 00:50:42,612
I don't know how long it's been
since I was so sleepy like this.

568
00:50:42,612 --> 00:50:45,740
Can I sleep a little bit like this?

569
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,120
For how long?

570
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,457
It'd be great if I could sleep
like this until morning.

571
00:50:53,948 --> 00:50:55,491
I'm going to bed.

572
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,499
Officer Choi. Officer Choi!

573
00:51:04,034 --> 00:51:07,172
I was the one who fell and got hurt.
What are you doing right now?

574
00:51:07,172 --> 00:51:08,833
You were smiling when you were sleeping.

575
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:13,082
You must've had a good dream.

576
00:51:13,082 --> 00:51:16,148
I'm sorry. I fell asleep for a moment.

577
00:51:16,148 --> 00:51:18,778
Is your head okay?

578
00:51:18,778 --> 00:51:20,606
It hurts obviously.

579
00:51:26,578 --> 00:51:28,828
Oh my... What are you doing?

580
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:31,096
It's because you're too loud.
Just be quiet for a moment.

581
00:51:31,096 --> 00:51:33,933
What are you doing? Really...

582
00:51:35,702 --> 00:51:38,998
By the way, do you like the
ocean or the mountains?

583
00:51:38,998 --> 00:51:40,814
I like the ocean.

584
00:51:40,814 --> 00:51:43,609
Then I like the mountains.

585
00:51:43,609 --> 00:51:46,602
Then do you like summer or winter?

586
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:48,314
I like summer.

587
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,088
Then I like winter.

588
00:51:50,585 --> 00:51:53,586
Why do you keep choosing the opposite?

589
00:51:53,586 --> 00:51:56,834
So we can go the ocean you like
and the mountains I like.

590
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:58,804
We can go to both places.

591
00:51:58,804 --> 00:51:59,988
That's so corny.

592
00:51:59,988 --> 00:52:02,206
Did you just realize that?

593
00:52:03,723 --> 00:52:05,392
Oh Cho-rim.

594
00:52:05,392 --> 00:52:08,355
What is that? You're so weird.

595
00:52:15,673 --> 00:52:16,842
Chun Baek-gyung.

596
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,129
You wanted to kill the witness

597
00:52:18,129 --> 00:52:20,188
but you made a mistake and
killed my sister, didn't you?

598
00:52:20,188 --> 00:52:24,023
The witness is Oh Cho-rim?

599
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,968
Officer Choi Moo-gak.

600
00:52:52,147 --> 00:52:53,951
From this moment on,

601
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:57,143
leave the special investigation team
for the barcode chain murder and

602
00:52:57,143 --> 00:52:59,719
return to the police substation
where you came from.

603
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:00,661
Excuse me?

604
00:53:00,661 --> 00:53:03,770
You will also be prohibited from accessing
the special cases database.

605
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:10,780
What are you talking about?

606
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,203
Why all of a sudden?

607
00:53:13,203 --> 00:53:18,504
I have to catch the culprit
who killed my sister.

608
00:53:18,504 --> 00:53:20,684
I can't. I can't do that.

609
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,666
If I keep covering for you,
I'll be the one who pays for it.

610
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:29,787
You're going by your
personal feelings right now.

611
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:35,183
You trespassed into Chef Kwon's
house yesterday too, right?

612
00:53:35,183 --> 00:53:38,157
That goes against police ethics.

613
00:53:38,157 --> 00:53:44,502
But... haven't you been understanding
of such actions up to this point?

614
00:53:44,502 --> 00:53:47,600
I told you because I trusted you.

615
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,969
If there's a dent in my career
because I was careless in

616
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:54,146
managing my subordinates,
I'd be ruining my future.

617
00:53:54,146 --> 00:53:57,007
Lieutenant!

618
00:53:58,243 --> 00:54:01,210
I found out that the witness is alive.

619
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,917
If I just find the witness,
I can catch the culprit.

620
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:07,942
I can't leave the special investigation team.

621
00:54:07,942 --> 00:54:10,879
I will catch the culprit no matter what.

622
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:18,065
Just why are you doing this?

623
00:54:18,065 --> 00:54:20,899
Why are you doing this all of a sudden!

624
00:54:28,668 --> 00:54:30,534
Thank you for everything.

625
00:54:44,736 --> 00:54:48,025
There will be a meeting in one hour.

626
00:54:48,025 --> 00:54:50,417
Since we're losing a member of
the special investigation team,

627
00:54:50,417 --> 00:54:52,955
we'll have to reassign the duties.

628
00:55:05,834 --> 00:55:08,307
This has been "Corner Within the Corner."

629
00:55:08,307 --> 00:55:10,750
I'm Oh Cho-rim. Thank you.

630
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,338
"Cook Room Era."

631
00:55:12,338 --> 00:55:14,687
"Cook Room Era."

632
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:18,791
Eun-seol. Choi Eun-seol.

633
00:55:18,791 --> 00:55:19,893
Who are you?

634
00:55:19,893 --> 00:55:23,156
I knew right away when I saw the TV show.

635
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:27,628
Even though you used a stage name,
Oh Cho-rim, I knew right away.

636
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:28,893
It's been a long time.

637
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:31,109
Did you call me Choi Eun-seol?

638
00:55:31,109 --> 00:55:33,802
Don't you remember?

639
00:55:33,802 --> 00:55:35,443
I was close to you.

640
00:55:35,443 --> 00:55:39,710
It's Soo-mi, Eun-seol. It's me, Goh Soo-mi.

641
00:55:40,066 --> 00:55:45,384
I'm Choi Eun-seol?

642
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:52,156
What was your sister's name?

643
00:55:52,156 --> 00:55:53,761
Choi Eun-seol.

644
00:55:55,454 --> 00:55:57,902
Hey, Goh Soo-mi. Hurry up.

645
00:55:57,902 --> 00:56:00,046
Yes.

646
00:56:00,046 --> 00:56:02,304
I'll see you later.

647
00:56:08,537 --> 00:56:14,154
Cho-rim, I'm sorry, but can you go to
my library and find some cookbooks for me?

648
00:56:14,154 --> 00:56:18,251
The producer wants me to
put some props on the countertop.

649
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:20,039
Yes. I got it.

650
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:13,295
Oh my goodness!

651
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:40,699
Dear Choi Eun-seol, no,
I mean who's now Oh Cho-rim.

652
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:47,392
Dear Choi Eun-seol, no,
I mean who's now Oh Cho-rim.

653
00:57:50,665 --> 00:57:54,636
I have to put a mic on Cho-rim,
but I don't see her.

654
00:57:56,448 --> 00:57:59,083
Is she not able to find the books?

655
00:58:00,521 --> 00:58:02,086
I'll go check on her.

656
00:58:05,488 --> 00:58:08,327
When you came to the hospital
because of the car accident,

657
00:58:08,327 --> 00:58:13,661
you didn't have a chance to survive.

658
00:58:28,149 --> 00:58:37,980
Please forgive this foolish doctor
who can only apologize to you like this.

659
00:58:38,246 --> 00:58:40,426
Sincerely, Chun Baek-gyung.

660
00:58:53,815 --> 00:58:56,910
Cho-rim. What are you doing?
