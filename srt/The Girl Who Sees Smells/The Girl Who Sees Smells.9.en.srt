00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,536
What's wrong?

3
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,953
What's wrong? What's the matter?

4
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:35,243
This taste...

5
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:48,732
I know this taste...

6
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,550
Do you remember something now?

7
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,527
I don't know what happened to me...

8
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:18,549
I remember someone's face...

9
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:32,972
The face that crossed my mind was of a woman.

10
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,380
She looked to be in her mid-40s.

11
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:43,550
Why did her face cross your mind?

12
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:50,161
I'm really curious who she is.

13
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:55,317
That must be frustrating. I understand.

14
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:00,500
I'm really curious about what happened to me.

15
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,560
I feel as if I'm nobody without my memories.

16
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:15,483
I don't even know if I liked or
hated that woman.

17
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:26,023
Sometimes I get scared because
I can't remember anything.

18
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:46,424
Let's go.

19
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,520
Let's try to remember no matter
what it takes.

20
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:05,304
Everything disappears once you forget.

21
00:03:07,737 --> 00:03:09,135
You're right.

22
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:13,775
Everything disappears once I forget.

[Choi Eun-seol]

25
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:12,627
What is it?

26
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:14,397
My house...

27
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,497
We're here again?

28
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:20,308
We went around the block five times already.

29
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:23,125
Your neighborhood is pretty small.

30
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:27,842
I guess you'll have to go now.

31
00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:28,641
I should.

32
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:30,673
It's late.

33
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:34,170
Okay. Go ahead.

34
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,751
Okay. Good night.

35
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:38,315
Bye.

36
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,522
Goodbye.

37
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:50,892
Will you be okay by yourself
throughout the night?

38
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,157
You're probably still uneasy.

39
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:55,951
Well...

40
00:05:56,474 --> 00:06:00,643
You're a bit uneasy because
of what happened, right?

41
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:03,381
I guess that's true...

42
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,424
I see...

43
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,415
Then I'll leave after you fall asleep.

44
00:06:07,415 --> 00:06:09,118
You don't need to...

45
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,251
Since you're still feeling anxious,

46
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,263
you'll be able to fall asleep
if I'm next to you.

47
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:13,616
Aren't you tired?

48
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:14,956
Why would I be tired?

49
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:18,798
I'm feeling great!

50
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:23,155
What is this?

51
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:26,609
This is my dad's winter tent he uses
when mountain climbing.

52
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:30,871
This room gets chilly at night.

53
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:32,428
How about your room?

54
00:06:32,428 --> 00:06:36,435
The room is warm. I'll be fine.

55
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:38,855
I'm going to bed then.

56
00:06:38,855 --> 00:06:41,215
Sure. Sleep tight!

57
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:42,984
Make sure you use that tent.

58
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:45,187
Okay. Go ahead.

59
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:47,425
I'll text you when I'm about to sleep.

60
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:49,616
Okay. I'll text you before sleeping, too.

61
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:50,835
Go ahead.

62
00:06:50,835 --> 00:06:52,568
Okay.

63
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:56,499
Good night!

64
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,683
Good night.

65
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:03,171
What was that?

66
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:08,131
Geez...

67
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:11,185
Did you just lock your door?

68
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,413
You're going to leave once I fall asleep.

69
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:23,624
So I must lock it.

70
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:29,733
Good job.

71
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,205
Go inside the tent if it gets cold.

72
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,421
Are you sleeping?

73
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:03,616
No, I'm not.

74
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,268
Are you sleeping?

75
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,425
No, I'm not.

76
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,483
Are you sleeping?

77
00:09:04,163 --> 00:09:05,659
No, I'm not.

78
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:10,029
Can you describe the face
you remembered last night?

79
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,750
Yes, the image is still vivid.

80
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,202
Pick the face shape first.

81
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:17,647
The shape is...

82
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:18,780
Something round.

83
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,705
Like this.

84
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:20,889
I see.

85
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:24,435
What about the eyes?

86
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:28,341
The eyes were more round. Like these.

87
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:30,942
Did you say more round...

88
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:34,384
This isn't the face I saw.

89
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:35,669
Really?

90
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:36,732
Then we can start all over again.

91
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:38,786
Are you doing this right?

92
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,402
This looks nothing like her.

93
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:45,186
The guy before asked me detailed questions
such as what kind of image she gives off.

94
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:48,606
Did you really learn how to do this?
I can't trust you.

95
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:49,806
What the...

96
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:52,024
You must have misunderstood something.

97
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,581
Detective Choi, I'm afraid
I have to use this room.

98
00:09:54,581 --> 00:09:56,177
You can come back when
there's no investigation.

99
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,251
Yes, sir.

100
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:58,466
Let's go.

101
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:03,960
I mean, how is it possible to have small
eyebrows when the eyes are big?

102
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,359
You asking because you don't know
how to make a composite sketch.

103
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:10,049
But it's possible to have small teeth
while having a big mouth.

104
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:13,895
You're the one who doesn't know
much about this.

105
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:17,117
You've never seen anyone
who's tall, but has short legs?

106
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,634
Never!

107
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:20,664
Are you sure?

108
00:10:20,664 --> 00:10:22,990
At least not anyone I know.

109
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:27,242
Hello, Lieutenant.

110
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:30,363
Why did Detective Choi come to visit you?

111
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,950
He asked if he could use the composite
sketch software, so I let him.

112
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,326
Oh, is that right? Thanks.

113
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:47,149
We confirmed that both box trucks
used for carrying Joo Ma-ri

114
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:50,422
and Chun Baek-gyung's cars
had fake license plates.

115
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:54,243
And we can't see the suspect's face though we
tried everything with the computer software.

116
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:57,024
There are 3.3 million trucks in this country.

117
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:02,441
If only 10% of them are capable of carrying
a car aboard, that's 300,000 trucks.

118
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:07,059
It's practically impossible to
find the trucks the murderer used.

119
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:11,125
This guy is very smart and meticulous.

120
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,231
He's too perfect!

121
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:15,723
He must lead a very tiring life.

122
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:19,727
From deducing how Detective Choi got stabbed,
the murderer knows us.

123
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:22,375
But we don't know our opponent.

124
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:29,142
Please be extra careful with
your personal safety.

125
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:33,201
Then how can we catch the murderer?

126
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:37,210
We must make him come to us.

127

[Jeju Baekrok Hospital]

128
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:46,453
The name is Choi Eun-seol.

129
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:47,652
Her birthday is...

130
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:50,386
Here.

131
00:11:51,952 --> 00:11:55,991
I'd like to get her hospital records.
I have to submit it to the insurance company.

132
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:59,187
Choi Eun-seol? One moment, please.

133
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:17,308
Hello? Is this Detective Choi Moo-gak?

134
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:21,544
Someone came to see Choi Eun-seol's
hospital records?

135
00:12:21,544 --> 00:12:24,688
Please proceed as I told you before then.

136
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:33,697
Lieutenant, the murderer has made a move.

137
00:12:33,697 --> 00:12:37,829
He started to trace the whereabouts of
Choi Eun-seol from Jeju Baekrok Hospital.

138
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:38,722
Is that so?

139
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:40,749
I asked the hospital staff to make up

140
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:44,109
a record as if she was moved to
Daemin Hospital in Seoul.

141
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:47,309
Then he'll go to Daemin Hospital
to continue tracing her.

142
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,384
Yes.

143
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:54,057
He's most likely using someone else
to do the job for him.

144
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:58,827
So the murderer also thinks that
Choi Eun-seol is alive, just like we do.

145
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:00,512
Yes, ma'am.

146
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:02,867
I think she's definitely alive.

147
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,731
The murderer will do
everything he can to find her.

148
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:08,556
And we must use that to catch him.

149
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:15,380
Are you saying that she went to
Daemin Hospital in Seoul?

150
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,781
Yes, her discharge record shows that
she was transferred to Seoul.

151
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:21,842
I see. Thank you.

152
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:31,137
The diver couple's daughter,
Choi Eun-seol, is already dead.

153
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:32,327
So how can she be the witness?

154
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:35,628
The murderer is currently looking
for her, believing she's alive.

155
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:41,774
So you want to make the culprit believe that
she's alive and lure him in?

156
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:43,229
That's correct.

157
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:47,377
And we'll be waiting for him when he bites.

158
00:13:49,877 --> 00:13:51,810
This is Choi Moo-gak.

159
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:54,615
Daemin Hospital?

160
00:13:54,615 --> 00:13:56,151
One moment, please.

161
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,620
Please go ahead.

162
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,190
I'm calling from Seoul Daemin Hospital.

163
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,020
As you predicted, someone came to ask
for Choi Eun-seol's hospital records.

164
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,652
He took the bait?

165
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:09,499
Great!

166
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:12,090
Please proceed as I told you before.

167
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,382
Sure, I'll draw up the documents
and give them to him.

168
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:15,436
Thank you very much.

169
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:18,825
So, once the murderer gets the fake
address from Daemin Hospital,

170
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:24,237
he'll go there to find the witness...
where we'll be hiding to catch him!

171
00:14:25,446 --> 00:14:28,205
Well... Shall we?

172
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:31,793
We should eat up before we stake out.

173
00:14:31,793 --> 00:14:34,055
I should tell Shivanova not to call me
when I'm staking out.

174
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:36,181
She always calls me when we stake out!

175
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:40,294
Up, down, up, up, down...

176
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,838
We're in position.

177
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:53,680
Detectives Nam and Do inside of the house...

178
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,340
if you hear us, flicker your lights.

179
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:00,457
Confirmed.

180
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:06,573
Didn't you say you told her not to
call you when we stake out?

181
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,623
What's wrong with her?

182
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:09,989
It's not mine.

183
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:11,955
Hey Cho-rim.

184
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:14,202
You can't come here!

185
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:16,005
Do you know how dangerous it is?

186
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:18,990
Yes, Cho-rim. I'll call you later, okay?

187
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,602
Good night!

188
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,761
Nothing unusual.

189
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:33,072
Okay. Stay focused, everyone.

190
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:35,674
Do you think he'll bite this time?

191
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:37,752
He got us several times already.

192
00:15:37,752 --> 00:15:41,725
We'll get him this time.

193
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:49,630
Hey, don't come!

194
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,005
Go away!

195
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:54,764
A routine check, sir.

196
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:56,596
May I see your identification?

197
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:58,460
I showed you this before!

198
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,840
What's going on?

199
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,210
We're patrolling the area because
an arson happened nearby.

200
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,178
We're staking out now, so get lost!

201
00:16:04,178 --> 00:16:05,961
Yes. Thank you, sir!

202
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:08,883
Don't salute us!

203
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,266
What if the murderer realized
that this is just a bait?

204
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,834
What time is it?

205
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:29,056
What if he's not coming today?

206
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:31,342
Let's wait a bit more.

207
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:38,956
Detective Kim as Choi Eun-seol,
please step out of the house again.

208
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,076
Roger, ma'am.

209
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:43,234
I'm stepping out.

210
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,259
A suspicious character is approaching her.

211
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,300
He's here.

212
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,067
A suspicious character is approaching.

213
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,737
He's wearing all black.

214
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:09,130
Choi Eun-seol...

215
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,566
Eun-seol...

216
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,717
Freeze!

217
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:53,026
Let me explain this...

218
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:55,476
Some man told me all I had to do
was to call Choi Eun-seol.

219
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:57,589
So, I did it.

220
00:18:57,589 --> 00:18:59,748
Do you remember his face?

221
00:18:59,748 --> 00:19:01,143
No...

222
00:19:01,143 --> 00:19:05,283
He approached me from the back,
so I couldn't see him.

223
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:07,100
I'm serious!

224
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,003
He put some money in my hand and
told me to go

225
00:19:10,003 --> 00:19:15,833
follow the girl from that house
and call her Choi Eun-seol.

226
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,807
Take him to the station and
inquire some more.

227
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:21,075
Let's go.

228
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:22,546
Take him away.

229
00:19:27,785 --> 00:19:30,651
Where are you running to, Detective Ki?

230
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:32,093
I don't know.

231
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:34,463
I'm only running because
Choi Moo-gak is running!

232
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:38,507
But where is he running to?

233
00:20:02,422 --> 00:20:05,072
Are you okay, Moo-gak?

234
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:06,042
Are you okay?

235
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:07,126
I'm fine.

236
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:09,390
The murderer ran that way.

237
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,913
Stop!

238
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:16,631
He's in black athletic clothes with a
black cap. His right arm is injured.

239
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:19,089
Support team, please come to Area B.

240
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,043
The suspect is wearing black
athletic clothes with a black cap.

241
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:23,336
His right arm is injured.

242
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:25,540
Let's get you to the hospital first.

243
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,343
I'm fine.

244
00:20:30,503 --> 00:20:32,025
What happened?

245
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:37,109
Hey, Detective Choi!

246
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:38,910
Tell us why you're running first!

247
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,128
I'm so sick and tired of him.

248
00:20:55,896 --> 00:20:57,778
What is that?

249
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:00,758
Tell us something! Please!

250
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:02,597
It's the murderer's blood.

251
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:04,466
His arm got cut here while he was running.

252
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:06,280
This is a critical piece of evidence.

253
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,595
This is great.

254
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:10,994
We have the murderer's DNA.

255
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:13,488
We got him!

256
00:21:13,987 --> 00:21:15,843
Call the forensics team.

257
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:22,398
Hello. This is Yeh Sang-gil from
the homicide team.

258
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:25,129
We need you here to collect the
murderer's blood sample.

259
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:30,677
We've secured the murderer's blood
sample from last night's operation.

260
00:21:30,677 --> 00:21:34,432
The forensics team is
conducting a DNA test right now.

261
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:39,288
We'll be able to determine who the murderer
is by comparing the DNA of our suspects.

262
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:45,645
So our priority now is to round up
all suspects and conduct DNA testing.

263
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:48,721
So we must get warrants to
collect personal information.

264
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:55,897
But the court won't allow us to get
saliva samples of random people.

265
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,941
We need a warrant for Chef
Kwon Jae-hee before anything.

266
00:21:58,941 --> 00:22:02,023
Are you aware if we get rejected
after applying for a warrant so randomly,

267
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:04,537
it'll be very difficult to get again?

268
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:07,175
Kwon Jae-hee is our prime suspect.

269
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:12,200
He was very close to our recent victims,
Joo Ma-ri and Chun Baek-gyung.

270
00:22:12,613 --> 00:22:16,641
Are you saying everyone who was
close to the victims is a suspect then?

271
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:18,507
From the information gathered so far,

272
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:22,355
we can conclude that the body type and
voice could match those of Kwon Jae-hee.

273
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:28,497
That's because you're trying to place the
gathered data upon Kwon Jae-hee.

274
00:22:28,497 --> 00:22:33,541
That body type and voice are quite
common among Korean men.

275
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:37,633
It's hard to consider it a coincidence that
two of his close friends are murdered.

276
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:43,531
But Kwon Jae-hee has a strong alibi.

277
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,056
I won't answer your question as to
why I don't look for my biological parents.

278
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,272
They're probably alive somewhere in Korea.

279
00:23:06,998 --> 00:23:10,371
I wish you would stop
asking me that question.

280
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:11,764
Okay.

281
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:16,277
Lt. Yeom, am I being interrogated?

282
00:23:16,277 --> 00:23:20,712
I'd like you to think of this as another
one of your press interviews.

283
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:25,853
You were adopted into a white
American family, correct?

284
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:29,393
Yes, I was adopted when I was three.

285
00:23:29,393 --> 00:23:34,136
I've mentioned this many times
in magazine interviews.

286
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:39,167
When did you come back to Korea?

287
00:23:40,355 --> 00:23:42,326
It's been six years already.

288
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:44,839
Why did you come back to Korea?

289
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:50,682
I'm not even sure myself why
I chose to come back to Korea...

290
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:56,369
I suddenly had this urge to come to Korea
when my adoptive parents passed away.

291
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:58,542
Did they pass away in an accident?

292
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:06,182
When both parents die at the same time,
it's highly likely it was an accident.

293
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:13,792
Were they murdered?

294
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:30,970
They died when their RV
caught on fire at the beach.

295
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:36,213
The local police concluded it was
a cigar-caused fire.

296
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:38,740
My adoptive father was a cigar smoker.

297
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:43,832
Were you abused by your adoptive
father during your childhood?

298
00:24:45,456 --> 00:24:53,579
Such prejudice is disrespectful to all
adoptive kids and parents.

299
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:59,514
I believe I've already told you how kind
my adoptive parents were to me.

300
00:24:59,514 --> 00:25:02,714
I have no bad feelings toward them.

301
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,276
Please forgive me.

302
00:25:07,484 --> 00:25:11,381
Why did you become a police detective?

303
00:25:11,381 --> 00:25:15,851
You don't seem like a tough person
who loves catching murderers.

304
00:25:17,045 --> 00:25:18,766
The reason I became a detective is...

305
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:24,272
Was anyone murdered in your family?

306
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:29,911
My father.

307
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,368
I see.

308
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:36,578
Do you still leave the lights on
when you sleep?

309
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,204
You don't feel comfortable when
there are people behind you, right?

310
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,375
That's why you always sit in the back.

311
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:48,717
I assume these are all related to
your father's death.

312
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:51,606
I think you should consider changing careers.

313
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:58,180
Can you share a good memory
you have about your adoptive father?

314
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,442
Is it okay for me to interpret your changing
the subject all of a sudden as an indication

315
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:05,919
you were involved in your father's death?

316
00:26:09,888 --> 00:26:11,218
It's hot in here.

317
00:26:11,218 --> 00:26:13,476
Why are you wearing a jacket?

318
00:26:14,845 --> 00:26:16,516
Even though you have to
go into the kitchen now,

319
00:26:16,516 --> 00:26:18,726
you're still wearing your jacket.

320
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:22,897
Is there something you have to
hide inside of that jacket?

321
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:31,324
I think you picked the perfect career
for yourself. You're very perceptive.

322
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:34,255
Are you saying I guessed correctly?

323
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:45,312
I was wearing my jacket because I
can't show my injured arm to my customers.

324
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:49,308
How did you hurt your arm?

325
00:26:50,614 --> 00:26:53,426
The kitchen is more dangerous than you think.

326
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:58,335
Knives, scissors, tongs, hammers...

327
00:26:58,335 --> 00:27:02,475
Every piece of kitchenware can
become a weapon.

328
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:08,910
This is true for even frying pans,
hot water, and gas fire.

329
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:14,085
When a person speaks for too long,
it means he's looking for excuses.

330
00:27:14,085 --> 00:27:18,907
I'm really not sure why
you're suspicious of me.

331
00:27:18,907 --> 00:27:21,489
Just consider it as my interest in you.

332
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:27,784
Yes.

333
00:27:27,784 --> 00:27:32,500
I've become very interested in you, too.
Thank you for this meeting.

334
00:27:35,595 --> 00:27:37,559
See you soon then.

335
00:27:55,347 --> 00:27:56,682
Welcome back.

336
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:02,063
Kwon Jae-hee has an injury on his right arm.

337
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:06,934
Are you saying that's the injury he
sustained while running away yesterday?

338
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:08,166
Is it around here on his right arm?

339
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:10,427
That's right. It's the same place.

340
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:14,207
Apply for a warrant to collect
Kwon Jae-hee's DNA.

341
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:16,574
Yes, I'll submit the application.

342
00:28:16,574 --> 00:28:23,530
It'll be over once we compare the
collected DNA to his DNA.

343
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,457
He won't be able to escape anymore.

344
00:28:25,457 --> 00:28:28,140
Your plan was brilliant.

345
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,679
Don't mention it.

346
00:28:29,948 --> 00:28:33,796
Let's go get Kwon Jae-hee's DNA.

347
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,223
What brings you here?

348
00:28:41,738 --> 00:28:44,129
It's a warrant allowing us to
collect your DNA.

349
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:49,097
Were you born on May 19th, 1983?

350
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:51,411
What's going on?

351
00:28:51,411 --> 00:28:53,702
Answer the question. Were you?

352
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:56,182
I'll answer once I know what's going on.

353
00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:57,694
You can't be rude like this.

354
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:01,377
Answer him before things get worse.
Is that your birthday?

355
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:03,485
Yes, that's correct.

356
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:08,722
We will collect a sample of your
saliva for DNA-testing purposes.

357
00:29:08,722 --> 00:29:10,326
Please cooperate.

358
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:19,098
Please open your mouth.

359
00:29:19,969 --> 00:29:22,694
What's the reason?

360
00:29:23,214 --> 00:29:25,513
You're a murder suspect as shown here.

361
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,190
Don't be like this.

362
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,984
You ran away after we saw you last night!

363
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:37,725
I'm more angry about your incompetence
than your rudeness.

364
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:40,581
You bled because you hurt your arm
while running away.

365
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:45,179
We collected your blood sample from that
construction site. Please show us your arm.

366
00:29:45,773 --> 00:29:47,529
Don't touch me.

367
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:50,331
You can't explain how you
hurt your arm, can you?

368
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:56,129
Later you'll have to answer for
your rudeness right now.

369
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:12,058
I got this cut from the edge of
my kitchen unit.

370
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:16,540
The edge of my stainless steel kitchen unit
was sticking out and was very sharp.

371
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,172
Do you really want us to believe that?

372
00:30:20,172 --> 00:30:21,608
Never mind.

373
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:25,447
We just need your saliva.

374
00:30:28,331 --> 00:30:30,539
Sure. Fine.

375
00:30:42,704 --> 00:30:44,190
Did you get his DNA?

376
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,641
Yes, I gave the sample to the forensics team.

377
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:51,241
You can't sit down right now.

378
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,988
There's a chance that
Kwon Jae-hee might run away.

379
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:58,206
Assign some officers around
Kwon Jae-hee's house and restaurant.

380
00:30:58,206 --> 00:31:00,735
We can't lose sight of him until
we have the arrest warrant!

381
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:03,144
Yes. I'll have a travel ban put on him, too.

382
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:06,440
I'll assign some officers
to keep an eye on him.

383
00:31:11,016 --> 00:31:14,429
Do you think we got him?

384
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:16,330
It seems like it.

385
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:20,261
When did you first suspect Kwon
Jae-hee as the chain murderer?

386
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:23,469
After our meeting today.

387
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:31,964
Hello.

388
00:31:31,964 --> 00:31:33,007
What are you doing here?

389
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:34,776
I thought you couldn't come in today.

390
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:41,438
I was supposed to go to an audition
to appear on a cooking show,

391
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:44,691
but I really don't think it would be the
right job for a comedienne.

392
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:48,424
So I chose to come here to clean instead.

393
00:31:48,944 --> 00:31:51,019
You're out of your mind.

394
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:53,026
Pardon?

395
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:55,133
What do you mean it's
not the right job for you?

396
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:57,956
That's exactly the job you should be doing!

397
00:31:57,956 --> 00:31:59,534
That's an amazing opportunity!

398
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:01,360
How can you give it up without even trying?

399
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,065
Don't you know the kids here
would kill to appear on a TV show?

400
00:32:06,065 --> 00:32:08,369
It doesn't matter if it's a cooking show!

401
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:11,112
Appearing on TV should be your priority!

402
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,015
What's the show anyway?

403
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,180
Kwon Jae-hee's "Golden Recipe."

404
00:32:18,698 --> 00:32:23,510
What? You're going to be on that show?

405
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,550
Yes. That's how it came to be.

406
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:32,081
Congratulations. I'm so happy for you.

407
00:32:38,949 --> 00:32:43,599
She wears her heart on her sleeve too much!

408
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:45,350
Did you like the show?

409
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:49,951
I'm Oh Cho-rim, hostess of "Corner Inside
the Corner" of "Golden Recipe"!

410
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:51,880
Thank you!

411
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:55,345
Her face looks better on the monitor.

412
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:58,528
Her voice is also good and her
facial expressions, too.

413
00:32:58,528 --> 00:33:00,685
I think we can start taping in two days.

414
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:01,894
Okay.

415
00:33:11,228 --> 00:33:12,569
Well done, Cho-rim.

416
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:14,410
We'll start taping in two days.

417
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,843
Thank you, Mr. Chef.

418
00:33:15,843 --> 00:33:19,167
I'll treat you out to dinner soon
at your own restaurant.

419
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:19,681
What?

420
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:23,674
I bet you've never dined at your
own restaurant as a customer.

421
00:33:23,674 --> 00:33:24,919
It'll be my special treat!

422
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,916
So look forward to it!

423
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:29,294
Okay, I'll look forward to it.

424
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:44,268
Is today the day when we'll arrest
the barcode chain murderer?

425
00:33:44,268 --> 00:33:48,226
Why do the DNA test results take so long?

426
00:33:49,647 --> 00:33:51,015
Choi Moo-gak is coming!

427
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:56,682

What happened?

432
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:24,560
The DNA of the culprit and
Kwon Jae-hee are different?

433
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:26,778
That's not possible.

How is this possible?

437
00:34:41,472 --> 00:34:43,685
I thought it was almost 100% certain!

438
00:34:43,928 --> 00:34:47,064
Then who's the real murderer?

439
00:34:47,064 --> 00:34:51,839
I guess we'll have to lift
the travel ban on him first.

440
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:55,132
I'll request to lift the ban.

441
00:34:56,711 --> 00:35:02,183
I guess we'll have to
apologize to him, too...

442
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,075
I'll do that.

443
00:35:06,266 --> 00:35:07,726

I'm looking for my phone right now...

May I borrow your mobile phone?

451
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:03,147

Last time, you brought a warrant
to get my saliva...

even though you're here to apologize.

I'm sorry.

No, I understand.

You realize this is your second time
apologizing to me, right?

472

You came to me once before about the
other chef's murder...

473
00:38:20,337 --> 00:38:24,218
and now you thought I was a serial killer.

mean it is alcohol.

00:40:34,576 --> 00:40:36,877
It's cold coffee. Try it!

485
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:44,498
I need someone to go clothes shopping
with me for tomorrow's shoot.

486
00:40:44,498 --> 00:40:46,090
Why do you have to work all day today?

487
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,916
Hey, what are boyfriends good for?
Go with Officer Choi.

488
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,651
He's not my boyfriend.

489
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:52,633
What?

490
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:57,477
You haven't acted like
"Today's day one of your being mine!"

491
00:40:57,477 --> 00:41:00,429
Nothing like that?

492
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:03,607
I kiss, but I don't date.

493
00:41:03,607 --> 00:41:06,011
Officer Choi is a bad guy!

494
00:41:07,104 --> 00:41:08,488
Go back to work.

495
00:41:08,488 --> 00:41:11,580
Do you want me to make Officer Choi call you?

496
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,662
I'm leaving if you keep talking
about such nonsense.

497
00:41:14,662 --> 00:41:17,183
You don't know the app that
makes men call you?

498
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,327
There's something like that?

499
00:41:19,594 --> 00:41:21,934
That's the most popular app these days!

500
00:41:21,934 --> 00:41:24,767
Is that so?

501
00:41:24,767 --> 00:41:25,967
What are you doing?

502
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,804
[Officer Choi]

503
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:31,771
Since you hung up right away,
he'll call you back in three seconds.

504
00:41:31,771 --> 00:41:34,229
Three, two, one...

505
00:41:34,229 --> 00:41:36,169
[Officer Choi]

506
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,451
Be thankful, idiot.

507
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:39,047
Ae-ri?

508
00:41:39,047 --> 00:41:40,244
Yes?

509
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:48,099
Yes, Officer Choi?

510
00:41:49,914 --> 00:41:52,827
Officer Choi!

511
00:41:52,827 --> 00:41:56,664
If it okay for you to initiate this meetup
and make me wait?

512
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:57,779
What time is it?

513
00:41:57,779 --> 00:42:01,347
You're the one who's early!

514
00:42:01,347 --> 00:42:02,263
Let's go in.

515
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:10,444
Tomorrow's the shoot.

516
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,446
They want me to wear something feminine.

517
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:15,119
Sure. Pick something.

518
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:21,550
I should try this on.

519
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,518
Tell me what you think.

520
00:42:22,518 --> 00:42:23,560
Okay.

521
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:15,231
I can't pick one. I think this is okay, too.

522
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:18,725
It's pretty.

523
00:43:24,822 --> 00:43:26,195
We'll take all three.

524
00:43:32,756 --> 00:43:37,157
Didn't you spend too much on these clothes?

525
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:38,788
I'll pay you back once the show does well.

526
00:43:38,788 --> 00:43:40,256
Thank you.

527
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:46,270
Oh Cho-rim, as for that show...

528
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:49,730
I don't want you to go on it.
Tell them you can't do it.

529
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,187
What?

530
00:43:52,187 --> 00:43:54,575
That show with Kwon Jae-hee...

531
00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:56,890
I don't want you to do it.

532
00:43:57,284 --> 00:44:00,311
Why not?

533
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,894
Just because...

534
00:44:02,894 --> 00:44:04,381
I think it'd be for the best.

535
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:05,411
Why not?

536
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:06,928
You just bought me clothes for it.

537
00:44:06,928 --> 00:44:08,719
Why are you telling me not to do it now?

538
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:10,703
That's because...

539
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,637
I pleading with you.

540
00:44:16,637 --> 00:44:19,108
Is it possible for you to
not go on that show?

541
00:44:19,108 --> 00:44:20,941
You're being weird.

542
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:25,059
You must give a reason for me to understand!

543
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:27,952
Would I make you do something bad?

544
00:44:27,952 --> 00:44:30,620
What kind of relationship do we have?

545
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,747
What... relationship?

546
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:38,485
Who do you think you are telling me
what to do and what not to do?

547
00:44:38,485 --> 00:44:41,588
This TV show is very important to
my life and career.

548
00:44:41,588 --> 00:44:45,275
So you're telling me not to do it
without giving me a reason?

549
00:44:45,275 --> 00:44:48,142
Are you saying I'm not entitled to
tell you something like that?

550
00:44:48,142 --> 00:44:49,871
It's not about entitlement,
but about the relationship

551
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:51,319
that would allow you to say such a thing.

552
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:53,561
Why is that so important?

553
00:44:53,561 --> 00:44:55,777
The fact that you think like that is weird.

554
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:57,371
That upsets me.

555
00:44:57,371 --> 00:44:59,616
I'm telling you this because
I'm concerned about you.

556
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:02,183
And now you're upset?

557
00:45:02,183 --> 00:45:05,892
We're not communicating well.

558
00:45:05,892 --> 00:45:08,198
Forget it. I'm going.

559
00:45:43,988 --> 00:45:45,293
Cho-rim?

560
00:45:49,282 --> 00:45:50,153
Oh, hello.

561
00:45:50,153 --> 00:45:51,355
Are you going home?

562
00:45:51,355 --> 00:45:52,987
Yes.

563
00:45:52,987 --> 00:45:58,213
But Detective Choi has already gone home.

564
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:03,579
I guess you always think
I'm here to see Officer Choi.

565
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:05,710
Isn't that the case?

566
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:09,957
Certainly not. I can come here
for other reasons, too.

567
00:46:09,957 --> 00:46:11,892
Really?

568
00:46:11,892 --> 00:46:14,887
Then what brings you to the police station?

569
00:46:16,577 --> 00:46:21,993
I came here... to see you.

570
00:46:21,993 --> 00:46:23,301
To see me?

571
00:46:23,301 --> 00:46:25,767
Yes, to see you.

572
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:27,747
I want to get dinner with you.

573
00:46:27,747 --> 00:46:30,488
Would you like to?

574
00:46:30,772 --> 00:46:34,761
Instead of dinner, let's go for a drink.

575
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:36,442
Sure!

576
00:46:49,526 --> 00:46:51,626
I lied to you.

577
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:54,462
I didn't come to see you.

578
00:46:54,462 --> 00:46:56,704
Is that so?

579
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:05,473
I came to drop these off at
his desk.

580
00:47:05,473 --> 00:47:06,841
Aren't they clothes?

581
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:10,178
It seems as though he bought them for you.

582
00:47:10,178 --> 00:47:13,234
I guess he did buy them
since he paid for them.

583
00:47:13,772 --> 00:47:17,118
But he didn't buy them for me,
so I must return them to him.

584
00:47:17,118 --> 00:47:21,220
Shouldn't you consider the intention
of the person who bought them?

585
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,191
He didn't really buy them for me because

586
00:47:23,191 --> 00:47:25,895
he never had any intention to
buy them for me to begin with.

587
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:31,397
Why did you fight?

588
00:47:31,397 --> 00:47:37,092
He meddles in my business even
though he's not my boyfriend!

589
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:41,618
Are you upset because of his meddling or
because he's not your boyfriend?

590
00:47:41,618 --> 00:47:44,411
Obviously because he's not my boyfriend...

591
00:47:50,448 --> 00:47:54,865
That was a leading question, wasn't it?

592
00:47:54,865 --> 00:47:57,454
I fell for it without realizing!

593
00:48:01,393 --> 00:48:04,779
It's Detective Choi's fault.

594
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:13,646
I really can't read him.

595
00:48:13,646 --> 00:48:15,216
He can be very frustrating...

596
00:48:15,216 --> 00:48:18,086
and his demeanor can be pretty annoying, too.

597
00:48:18,086 --> 00:48:20,072
And he's dumb!

598
00:48:20,882 --> 00:48:23,885
I won't tell Detective Choi
you just said that.

599
00:48:23,885 --> 00:48:24,688
It doesn't matter.

600
00:48:24,688 --> 00:48:26,662
It's not like I'm making things up.

601
00:48:26,662 --> 00:48:32,089
Right. I saw you coming out of the Police
Composite Sketch Room with Detective Choi.

602
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:33,966
What were you doing there?

603
00:48:33,966 --> 00:48:36,097
Ah, the composite sketch...

604
00:48:36,097 --> 00:48:38,731
I'm looking for a person.

605
00:48:42,672 --> 00:48:44,452
Is this the mouth?

606
00:48:44,452 --> 00:48:46,522
Yes, that seems correct.

607
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:51,301
Are there any other characteristics
you want to share?

608
00:48:51,301 --> 00:48:54,882
Things like the look of her face...

609
00:48:54,882 --> 00:48:56,602
It was a smiling face.

610
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:59,620
Her resting face was a smiling face.

611
00:49:01,484 --> 00:49:06,869
I hope this sketch will help you
regain your memory.

612
00:49:07,996 --> 00:49:08,983
Thank you.

613
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:14,652
I was so shocked to hear about your accident.

614
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:18,439
You're always so happy,
I thought you had no worries.

615
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:27,346
Perhaps I wanted to make myself and
others laugh in order to hide my feelings.

616
00:49:31,654 --> 00:49:35,178
Wait. I think it's getting more similar.

617
00:49:35,178 --> 00:49:36,606
Oh really?

618
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:41,097
It's getting late.

619
00:49:41,097 --> 00:49:43,300
I don't want to keep you out long.

620
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,332
Perhaps we should continue another time.

621
00:49:46,332 --> 00:49:49,037
Shall we continue tomorrow then?

622
00:49:49,037 --> 00:49:50,640
Yes.

623
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,807
Sure.

624
00:49:55,543 --> 00:50:00,651
Everything looks similar except the aura.

625
00:50:00,651 --> 00:50:05,937
Her eyes looked as if she was smiling,
even though she was tired from work.

626
00:50:05,937 --> 00:50:09,390
These composite sketches
are all about the eyes.

627
00:50:09,664 --> 00:50:11,857
Shall we go then?

628
00:50:12,484 --> 00:50:14,155
What time is good for you tomorrow?

629
00:50:14,155 --> 00:50:15,795
Tomorrow is...

630
00:50:41,988 --> 00:50:43,987
Hello? Is this the general
affairs department?

631
00:50:43,987 --> 00:50:45,721
This is Choi Moo-gak from the homicide team.

632
00:50:45,721 --> 00:50:46,928
Have you been well?

633
00:50:46,928 --> 00:50:48,115
Yes.

634
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:50,654
You want more office supplies already?

635
00:50:50,654 --> 00:50:52,660
Your team uses the most amount of
office supplies in the station!

636
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,337
You should try to conserve
the office supplies.

637
00:50:54,337 --> 00:50:55,645
I'm sorry.

638
00:50:55,645 --> 00:50:59,021
But can we get five boxes of A4 paper,
a dozen boxes of pens...

639
00:50:59,021 --> 00:51:00,981
and black, blue, and red markers?

640
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:02,038
Five each.

641
00:51:02,038 --> 00:51:05,430
And some binders, too.

642
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:07,415
Yes, thank you.

643
00:52:00,091 --> 00:52:01,938
Dear Ms. Oh Cho-rim,

644
00:52:01,938 --> 00:52:03,838
Congratulations on your first show.

645
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:05,224
Kwon Jae-hee.

646
00:52:28,803 --> 00:52:30,131
It's pretty.

647
00:52:36,391 --> 00:52:37,075
Oh Cho-rim.

648
00:52:37,075 --> 00:52:40,897
The yellow dress is the least weird one
of all the dresses from yesterday.

649
00:53:05,986 --> 00:53:07,394
Thank you.

650
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:19,686
[The yellow dress is the least weird

651
00:53:27,515 --> 00:53:29,357
Hello! How do you do?

652
00:53:29,357 --> 00:53:33,461
My name is Oh Cho-rim and
this is my first shoot!

653
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:35,172
Hello!

654
00:53:35,172 --> 00:53:38,162
I'm Oh Cho-rim. Nice to meet you!

655
00:53:38,162 --> 00:53:41,836
Mr. Chef... About the dress...

656
00:53:41,836 --> 00:53:44,592
I'm so thankful, but
I think it's too much for me.

657
00:53:44,592 --> 00:53:46,808
It's too nice.

658
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:50,878
I'll wear it once I become a great
show hostess. Is that okay?

659
00:53:50,878 --> 00:53:52,013
Of course.

660
00:53:52,013 --> 00:53:53,439
Good luck today. Don't be nervous.

661
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,203
Okay. I'll do my best!

662
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:08,243
I decided to give him the
honor of dining with me...

663
00:54:08,243 --> 00:54:12,535
so I ditched the team dinner to call him...

664
00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:14,671
And he hangs up on me?

665
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:17,570
You're out, Officer Choi.

666
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:20,867
What now?

667
00:54:20,867 --> 00:54:24,569
I'm in front of your place. Come out.

668
00:54:25,318 --> 00:54:27,048
Ridiculous.

669
00:54:27,048 --> 00:54:31,819
Does he think I'll run out as soon as
he tells me to come out?

670
00:54:46,524 --> 00:54:49,277
Should I at least listen to
what he has to say?

671
00:54:58,112 --> 00:54:59,281
Fine, whatever...

672
00:54:59,281 --> 00:55:02,270
It's not like he's my boyfriend!

673
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,143
Let's go.

674
00:55:14,265 --> 00:55:15,863
How was the shoot?

675
00:55:15,863 --> 00:55:18,190
Good.

676
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,729
Have you eaten?

677
00:55:20,729 --> 00:55:23,495
Ramen.

678
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:25,393
Ramen...

679
00:55:26,761 --> 00:55:29,771
I couldn't answer your call before
because I had an urgent meeting.

680
00:55:29,771 --> 00:55:33,982
I called you by mistake
because my finger slipped.

681
00:55:33,982 --> 00:55:35,891
You don't need to worry about that.

682
00:55:36,382 --> 00:55:37,876
Are you mad at me?

683
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:38,848
No.

684
00:55:38,848 --> 00:55:41,763
Then can you at least look at my face
while talking to me?

685
00:55:45,496 --> 00:55:48,517
What is it?

686
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:49,831
What...

687
00:55:50,753 --> 00:55:54,397
What should I call you?

688
00:55:54,397 --> 00:55:55,577
I have a name.

689
00:55:55,577 --> 00:55:58,842
When people are in a relationship,
they have other names to call each other.

690
00:55:58,842 --> 00:56:01,267
In a relationship?

691
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:04,770
What?

692
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,387
Oh Cho-rim.

693
00:56:06,387 --> 00:56:13,488
Pick one from among "lover, woman,
darling, girlfriend."

694
00:56:14,856 --> 00:56:16,727
Officer Choi...

695
00:56:23,148 --> 00:56:25,967
Oh, no!

696
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:29,072
I have to go home and change.

697
00:56:29,072 --> 00:56:30,645
I'll be back after putting some make-up on.

698
00:56:30,645 --> 00:56:34,127
Can we start over when I come back?

699
00:56:39,547 --> 00:56:41,286
I already saw you.

700
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,250
Where are we going?

701
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,706
To boast of my girlfriend to the world.

702
00:56:51,706 --> 00:56:53,515
You can't do that today.

703
00:56:53,515 --> 00:56:55,552
Don't worry about it.

704
00:56:55,552 --> 00:56:58,377
I promised to meet Lt. Yeom to work
on the composite sketch.

705
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:00,026
I have to change, too!

706
00:57:00,026 --> 00:57:01,202
Is that so?

707
00:57:01,202 --> 00:57:03,849
Then I'll go with you to the police station!

708
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:27,695
Her eyes looked as if she was smiling,
even though she was tired from work.

709
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:14,208
For composite sketches, it's important to

710
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:16,547
describe something particular
about each part of the face.

711
00:58:16,547 --> 00:58:20,987
The first impression it
provides is important.

712
00:58:20,987 --> 00:58:23,252
You must also confirm the height, too.

713
00:58:23,252 --> 00:58:26,017
You might be surprised how much
shorter the actual person is!

714
00:58:26,017 --> 00:58:27,585
I guess that's possible, too.

715
00:58:27,585 --> 00:58:29,090
Lt. Yeom must be here already...

716
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:31,046
She should be...

717
00:58:31,744 --> 00:58:33,934
Oh, she's here.

718
00:58:34,996 --> 00:58:37,422
Hello, Lt. Yeom!

719
00:58:37,422 --> 00:58:40,805
Didn't you say you'd finish
her composite sketch today?
